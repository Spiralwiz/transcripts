hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about cause and purpose okay
cause and purpose so let's crack into this I am
super pumped out right now I have literally spent the
last 24 hours working I decided that I wouldn't even
go to sleep because I was so freaking excited about
what I'm doing what I'm sharing with you guys the
cool ideas that are coming your way all the content
that I have coming out all the new ideas that
I have percolating in my mind and I just spent
basically the whole night in the whole morning and then
the whole afternoon working instead of sleeping and now I'm
kind of in this little bit of a daze I
only slept for about 1 hour got a 1 hour
nap but I just kept working and like I have
Drive I filled the drive in to someplace that I
wanted to be this is the place that I wanted
to be right here this is where I wanted to
be just a few years ago where I was feeling
listless I was feeling like I didn't have motivation I
didn't feel like I was on point I needed to
recreate that for myself and I needed to prove to
myself that that was possible to create it but that
aside let's really focus here on cause and purpose because
I was really thinking about this after reading some of
the comments that I've been getting here's the problem this
is the problem that you have this is your problem
and this is my problem too but I've probably worked
on it more than you have in step there's nothing
in your life that you're really willing to bleed for
there's nothing that your life is about there's no cause
there I mean what are you living for like honestly
what are you living for are you living for tomorrow
so you can go hang out with your friends you're
living for tomorrow's and go go to a party get
drunk go to your nine-to-five boring ass job and do
something that provides no value to humanity what is your
life about to be in that dead-end marriage to your
inter that relationship where you're just comfortable and not growing
and it's going fail and nothing is happening to be
sitting in the same house in the same apartment in
the same city in the same country it just kind
of being comfortable they're sitting there because your circumstances keep
you there that's the most convenient thing for you to
be doing right now that's your cause you want to
create a great life from that that's pathetic that's pathetic
you have nothing that you're fighting for because in this
society it's so easy now we take everything for granted
life is easy we don't have to do anything but
sit on our asses go do a little bit of
work every now and then come back home and pick
up the remote and just click through the channels go
internet surfing watch some videos read some newspapers talk to
some friends then Gorge yourselves full and then repeat the
same process the next day this is a waste of
life you're wasting your life have you seen a movie
300 it's a powerful movie and people that look at
this movie and they what they see if all you
see is the blood and the gore and the guts
then you're missing the bigger point because what's powerful about
300 is not the testosterone blood-soaked action but it's what
is being fought for there it seems like there was
a time in human history at least I want to
believe there was I don't know if this is true
on some level I tend to think that people were
lazy throughout all of history on another level I tend
to think that as we advance as we get more
technologically savvy we have more and more lazier but I
like to think back to the Spartan times to the
Roman times to the Greek times to the times of
the ancient and the old where people have something that
they're willing to die for it's like a soldier was
willing to go to battle and fight for something that
he believed in I mean sure there were mercenaries I'm
sure they got paid I'm sure certain soldiers just had
no other options but I'm talking about the ones that
fought for something like what you have to believe what
is the mindset that you have to have to be
willing to go into a battle into a field of
hundreds thousands of brutal men who want to chop your
head off with an axe or sword think about that
what like what kind of drive do you have to
have to do that do you think that that person
doesn't have fear no they're scared shitless but there's something
driving them there's something they feel like they have to
do they have a cause they have a mission they're
willing to bleed for it they're willing to die for
it and that's because back then one of the assumptions
we can make is that a is that survival was
something that was on people's minds all the time and
so life was more a matter of life and death
than it is today and that was more conscious -
there were Wars there were famines anything could really kill
you in the blink of an eye nowadays were so
safe we're so comfortable but also I think back then
to deal with the hardships that humans had to go
through back then the brutality the unfairness I mean just
think about it no real government no stability no Constitution
no human rights slavery rape pillage looting struggles for power
disease famine massive misunderstanding about science no technology crude crude
forms of medicine mythology disinformation no access to the Internet
no access to general knowledge that we have today nothing
like that if you live in a world like that
what would you need to survive that just psychologically not
even physically psychologically to cope with that what would you
need you need purpose you would need something larger than
yourself I think that's one of the deep origins of
religion and why religion really took root in ancient times
and grew from that and really took out took off
like a wildfire is because it offered people that it
offered people hope it offered people something beyond themselves and
today we don't really need it but 3,000 years ago
I don't know maybe we maybe really we really needed
it because maybe humanity could not have survived without that
layer that layer of a psychology added on to our
everyday lives maybe we wouldn't have survived but I think
there's more religion aside I'm not talking about that issue
here I'm talking about cause and purpose and believing in
higher values what do you really value and I don't
mean you value it by sitting on your couch and
watching TV I mean practical value that means when you
value something you're willing to put your sweat into it
your tears into it you're willing to bleed for it
and you're even willing to die for it because it's
important enough for you what is that for you you
need to tap into that and don't say you don't
have it you have it you're just not in touch
with it you've never connected with it probably because your
mind has been elsewhere you have been distracted by society
you have been conditioned with bad conditioning and you're not
in touch with your core you're not in touch with
what's important you're not in touch with what what your
life should be about let me give you some suggestions
how about you start to value beauty and that means
instead of just saying oh that's nice you actually go
out and you create something beautiful how about you value
truth and that means that you work your ass off
to understand what is true in this world and you
wade through all the that's out there but then also
you go out there and you find the truth you
discover you commit your life to finding the truth to
finding deeper truths helping us understand things on a more
accurate deeper level and bringing that to us so that
the rest of us can have a little bit of
a sharper understanding of what the hell we're doing on
this planet and in this universe how about that maybe
becoming scientist maybe becoming a researcher a writer however you
want to do that whatever that means for you truth
how about love and compassion how about really honoring that
you say you love but do you really love I
know for many of you out there what you call
love is a selfish kind of love where all you
want is you want to feel love for yourself how
about the kind of love where you go out and
you give love is not about what you get love
is about what you give it's about who you are
and how you share yourself and not needing anything return
for the love that you put out there how about
sharing now with the world whether through your work through
some sort of nonprofit organization community work or just in
your family or just even in the interactions that you're
having on a day-to-day level with people but putting like
real attention on that so you're not just mouthing the
words but you're actually doing it how about justice and
order think of what we have today the piece we
have become the comfort the stability that we have today
that order that justice has been brought about through centuries
millennia of struggle conflict brutality blood legal arguments debates people
were involved with that there was a point at which
it was important to actually go out there and create
just laws to make sure that society is just to
make sure that things are happening the way that they
ought to be and not just the way that they
are making society better making your company better how about
that how about you dedicate your life to that to
justice how about you dedicate your life to creativity what
about all the profound art and culture that we have
developed over the last several millennia from paintings to novels
to film to music to poetry to philosophy to all
the ideas the rich intellectual history that we have and
that is really the source of a lot of success
that we now have access to very easily especially through
the internet books all cheap mostly free what kind of
profound effect does that have on the trajectory of people's
lives think about the profound effect that knowledge and the
arts and culture has had on your life how about
you commit yourself to advancing that advancing that frontline how
about that how about you commit yourself to bleeding for
what you believe in creatively instead of dumbing your stuff
down procrastinating not putting out any work being lazy not
sharing your gifts with the world holding that back because
you're too weak how about you start to get in
touch with that these values that I'm talking about these
are the values that Abraham Maslow talked about in a
psychology towards being towards a psychology of being rather where
he talks about the self actualized human being and the
self actualized human being is what I'm talking about here
this is a human being that is living for something
larger than the petty common values that most of us
are living you're living for something greater than sex something
greater than a little bit of stimulation something greater than
a little bit of entertainment something greater than a little
bit of money and security and comfort and peace of
mind those are all nice but how about you make
your life big something you can bleed for what do
you think it's going to take to change and transform
the trajectory of your life it's got to start here
it's got to start with a cause it's got to
start with something that is meaningful something that you can
bleed for because if you don't have that you're not
going to make it I guarantee you're not going to
make it because even if you buy into what I'm
saying right now even if you do have a cause
still many of you are not going to make it
because it's just too damn hard it takes too much
emotional labor and toil and strain to make these ideals
real it takes too much sometimes so much that you
just want to curl up in a fetal position roll
up on your couch and just cry because you're out
there you're pushing yourself you're growing I mean I can
literally make myself cry when I think about what is
possible what's possible for me what's possible for you if
we really commit ourselves to this commit ourselves to something
greater commit your life to something that is not you
stop being selfish stop wanting to get into that compeer
relationship stop wanting to get into that well-paying job that
can let you travel and retire early and do the
4-hour work week and not do anything else with your
life stop wanting to just go party and hang out
with your friends get drunk do drugs eat some food
hang out with your family you can do all that
stuff and I have no moral compunction about any of
it go and live life do whatever you want I
don't care but make your life about something point it
in some direction your life is on the one hand
very short on the other hand very long it's long
in the sense that if you don't have any trajectory
you're gonna have a lot of time that you just
spend doing bunch of useless that's not going to make
you fulfilled even though you think it is all it's
doing is it's just like it's titillating you just look
ha ha ha little titillation here and there you know
a little little video game here watch little TV there
hang out with some friends there you little titillation you
could have all that but that should be like the
garnish that's not the main dish of life the main
dish of life like the steak as it were not
the side dish but the steak that is your purpose
and your purpose should not be you and your purpose
should even be larger than your family and should be
larger than your circle of friends your purpose should be
humanity you advance the cause of humanity in some way
whatever is meaningful for you whatever really gets you into
flow whatever resonates with you I don't know what that
is for everyone it's a little different you know some
people like to be the truth seekers out there some
people like to be the creative avant-garde types some people
like to be the the people route though like the
rabble rousers the people leaders the managers some people like
to be the visionaries some people really like to focus
some people like to go broad and think big picture
other people like to go really like detail and depth
and like master one little craft it's not really important
you find something in that whole domain that interests you
but you find something that you're willing to put the
work into you do that and all those other things
will still be there you can still hang out with
your friend used to watch little TV you can do
a video games eat little food a problem but the
life has direction now it's got direction it has a
chance now there's at least a little bit of a
chance a sliver of a chance that it can possibly
fulfill you there's actually some kind of arc to your
life some sort of hero's journey that you're on you're
not on a hero's journey now sitting on your ass
working your nine-to-five job what is that doing is your
95 job advancing humanity this is a simple yes-or-no answer
who are you working for what are you creating what
is your company creating what is your business creating is
you creating something that's actually useful is it creating something
that's cutting edge it's creating something that's beautiful something that
should exist in the world just because it's beautiful not
because it's useful not because it makes a lot of
money but because it's beautiful it's excellent it's living up
to some high ideal is your company doing that or
here is your work doing that is every hour that
you're putting into your work doing that if it's not
you need to change this is a wake-up call for
you and this is not going to be easy but
it's got to start somewhere and the only place it
can start is inside you with motivation you need to
start spark we're going to start sparking you that will
then grow into a small flame little bit bigger flame
a little bit bigger flame a little bit bigger flame
and finally we're going to Kindle that into a fire
that's possible if you think that people are just born
that way then you're dead wrong I've proved this to
myself in my life I've developed a process for how
to create real lasting intrinsic motivation something that's so powerful
that literally right now I feel so motivated with what
I'm doing and I wasn't like this just a year
or two ago so this is just something I'm living
into it it's just so amazing that I literally can
spend 24 hours not sleeping working on what I got
to do and if you think that that's always fun
it's not a lot of the work that I do
is grindy tedious work it's just work is just stuff
that you would think that's boring but I do it
because I'm doing it towards something greater that's me bleeding
for what I believe in that's me bleeding for my
values and I'm not saying that I'm perfect at this
I fall down and I stumble every single day and
I torture myself every single day over this struggle but
at least I feel like I'm struggling towards something something
that is powerful because if I can Kindle that spark
in at least a couple of you then that's worth
it to me that's worth it to me and even
if I don't I feel like this information is something
that should be out there regardless people need to understand
how psychology works people need to understand how to generate
motivation what purpose is what life is about how to
generate a fulfilling life people need to understand this I
want that information out there even if nobody sees it
if I shoot a good video if I put out
some good insight I feel like I was on top
my game when I did that I'm happy I feel
happy and when you do that one of the things
that you will notice I don't know if you've ever
had this in your life but when you're really on
your edge and you're executing full-out you feel like you
can die at any moment like you can die right
now and you would die with a smile on your
face that's how I feel right now if I if
I died while shooting this video right now after working
for the last 24 hours I don't care what it
would take how it would feel but I'd like to
think that I would die I would smile on my
face and I want that for you I want you
to tap into that kind of life that's what I'm
talking about I want to talk about creating an extraordinary
life sometimes it's difficult to articulate this idea because it
is abstract many people do not have a direct experience
of it and so it's hard for them to take
some of the concepts that I'm offering which are conceptual
they're abstract ideas and to really pin it down and
say yeah that's that's what it actually feels like that's
what it's going to be this is how can I
can actually see this in my life like transforming it
not a theoretical level on a practical level so you
can feel it so you can see it so people
around you can feel it and see it right that's
what I'm talking about a little hard to articulate sometimes
but I think I got it in this video all
right so this is Leo I would be signing off
here I want you to find that cause what is
your cause what are you willing to bleed for if
you don't have it yet commit make it your top
priority to find it your purpose right now is to
find your purpose or if you already know your purpose
get on track and start clarifying it even further and
start taking massive action to it commit prioritize get your
ass off the couch and start taking action all right
I'm getting off my soapbox so leave me some comments
I like to hear what you think about this like
this share this spread the spark inspire somebody else and
of course check out Ashlin org where we are all
about how to become self actualized we've got exclusive newsletter
with weekly video updates exclusive articles we've got two exclusive
bonuses a 19 part video series we've also got a
chance to win two free hours of coaching from myself
every month a giveaway two hours of coaching to a
subscriber every month so go ahead and sign up for
that but really sign up because you're committed to this
and you are taking some action right now just by
signing up so that you're following along because this one
video is enough to get you a spark in some
of you it's going to get sparked I hope it
didn't you but it's also going to take more it's
going to take persistence on your part it's going to
take hard work and that spark will need to be
periodically rekindled and that's really what I'm here for is
to help you do that also to give you the
tools the resources the knowledge that concepts ideas that you
need to carry this further because really to get to
where you want to go and to stay on that
path and to live to those ideals what you're going
to do is grow yourself you'd have to master your
own psychology and that is what actualized other work is
about is how to master yourself so that you can
create an extraordinary life you
