[Music] you after I came back from Hawaii I had
my deepest awakening experience yet this was after Hawaii thanks
to five Meo DMT this was a level of awakening
again an order of magnitude beyond anything that I have
experienced thus far and I've experienced some pretty crazy things
up to this point this level of awakening was just
ungodly an ungodly degree of awakening it felt like the
lights completely turned on this is such a radical experience
and it's so far outside of anything that any ordinary
human being has ever experienced or could even possibly imagine
that there's just absolutely no frame of reference no common
ground via which I could get this across to you
you can only understand it by having it for yourself
this was pure God mode it was the culmination of
everything you become so awake that you realize that the
only thing there is is you and you are God
and that's literally what you are in this body is
that you are God but of course this doesn't really
make much sense to the conventional dualistic materialistic mind and
it doesn't even make much sense to people who have
had some glimpses of awakening here and there it doesn't
still really make sense it doesn't really sink in the
the depth of it doesn't really sink in the magnitude
of it doesn't really sink in until the lights fully
turn on and you realize just what the hell is
going on here and it is possible to realize what
is going on here why is all of this happening
beyond this incredible God mode that I was in I
experienced a complete end to all suffering fear and concerns
all concerns all life problems financial problems relationship problems health
problems it's the end literally the end of all problems
all suffering in this in this mode you can't even
comprehend what suffering is because you completely break through all
personal notions of needing anything or wanting anything or being
incomplete in any way this is a this is a
state you reach after death with the complete end of
selfhood there is no self there anymore that person that
was born and that lived your whole life and that
is sitting there right now listening to me that thing
right there that thing that that whole persona is completely
gone as though it never even existed you can't even
bring it into memory anymore because it's so ridiculously false
and illusory that's how radical of a shift this is
it's a total inversion of reality your reality collapses and
flips inside out hmm to the point where it's like
you're inhabiting a completely new reality even though everything around
you basically still looks just the same but your relationship
and perspective on everything has changed so dramatically and there's
this complete absence of selfhood that for the first time
in your life you see reality unobstructed through the lens
of the self and you see what reality is in
its absolute form without the self and that's an amazing
thing you have an infinitely nonlinear understanding of reality you
understand everything so deeply it's a state of literal omniscience
that is beyond what the conventional rational mind thinks of
when we say the word omniscience because when we say
the word omniscience people think of all that means you
know all the scientific facts of the world something like
that that's not true omniscience that there is not nearly
as mind-blowing as true omniscience true omniscience is is way
beyond a collection of all the facts about the universe
it's actually tangential to all of that it's orthogonal to
all of that rather than knowing all the facts you
don't get to know all the facts but what you
discover is that you don't need to know all the
facts all the facts are irrelevant what you know is
you know the essence of it all you understand the
the infinite interconnectedness of everything and why it's here and
all of this happens without having to know all the
individual particular facts it's quite an amazing thing so after
having this awakening or rather I should say during having
this awakening I decided to surrender my life to this
awakening and so what does that mean that means that
on May 1st of this upcoming month I will begin
30 days of non-stop meditation I'm gonna isolate myself and
just basically sit for 30 days straight and do absolutely
nothing to take this awakening that I experienced and to
really deepen it to deepen it to the point where
there is no selfhood anymore and where this god mode
becomes my default state this has been quite a difficult
decision for me I've been thinking about doing something like
this for a few years now but kind of vacillating
about it because of course most of my time goes
into creating these videos and running actualized I don't work
and that's a full-time job and for me it's not
only my job it not only pays the bills but
it's much much more than that it's about a calling
that I have that I have been kind of drawn
to by the universe it's not something that's really coming
from me it's sort of like a mission that has
just come from up above and so I'm just fulfilling
that mission but the counterintuitive nature of this mission is
that for me to really fully fulfill this mission I
can't just go around creating videos every single week I
need to also go very deeply inside myself and so
what I saw during this awakening is that there's a
bigger game to be played here with what we're doing
with actualized already and for me to to fully play
that game I need to take myself out of this
process of running a business and in doing the daily
stuff that I do to keep this thing running because
creating these videos puts me in a very conceptual frame
of mind because I have to be analyzing things and
thinking about things from various people's points of views and
thinking about objections and questions and concerns and points of
confusion that people have about these these topics and all
of that is great and it's it's it's been wonderful
for the last four or five years that I've been
shooting these videos basically non-stop it's just been sort of
this non-stop cycle of of insights and understanding and going
deeper and deeper and understanding the field of personal development
of spirituality more broadly and more deeply at the same
time and that has been very helpful for my own
growth but still it's also limiting there's two sides of
this coin because this growth is still at the conceptual
level still at the mental level and so what I'm
finding that I need to do is I need to
take myself out of this sort of daily pragmatic running
a business mode and just go completely into myself because
of course even though I learned so much from actualized
org I learned a lot just from from formulating and
articulating these insights for you I also learn a lot
from getting feedback and questions from people and all of
that but still it easily becomes a distraction it's still
a materialistic process it's still a highly conceptual process and
so that's something that has been holding me back and
I've been I've been vacillating about this because I didn't
know like what the right move is should I quit
actualize that right entirely should I do a long retreat
should I just keep doing the videos and maybe somehow
sneak little retreats in here and there that's sort of
the the thing that I've been doing over last year
is I've been doing retreats but still most of my
attention was focused on actualized org and so now the
shift is that I'm turning my attention away from that
for the first time in about four years that I've
been shooting these videos and hence I will be isolating
myself for 30 days straight during these 30 days of
isolation there will be no business there will be no
creative pursuits there will be no talk King there will
be no socializing there will be no phone calls there
will be no internet there will be no text messaging
there will be no reading or any of that kind
of stuff I will be doing this 30 day retreat
basically at home I'm not going to any fancy location
I didn't rent any any fancy cabin in in Hawaii
or something like that it's just gonna be at home
I'm gonna keep it very simple I've done enough of
these retreats and exotic places that it really doesn't matter
where you are wherever you go there you are and
here I want to just keep it very simple I
want to focus on the essence of my work nothing
fancy I'm just gonna sit there and basically do nothing
and just surrender myself more and more into the emptiness
until it completely consumes me that's the objective now since
it's 30 days I'm not gonna stock up on three
days of food so I will be doing a little
bit of driving around to the grocery store maybe once
per week to procure more groceries but even during this
driving period I will still try to maintain my mindfulness
and be fully in the present moment doing this work
the objective of this retreat is the end of personhood
I want this persona of a self of alio to
completely collapse and end and to enter this permanent God
mode where every moment you are completely awake and you're
completely conscious no matter what's happening or what's going on
or what you're talking about you're always just conscious that
all that there is is God and that that's what
you are and also the objective is the end of
all suffering and fear and boredom I really want to
nip this boredom thing in the bud because this board
this boredom is a much much bigger monster than most
people realize most people don't realize just how much of
their life is spent avoiding boredom and you really only
realize that when you go on one of these long
retreats and you face that boredom head-on and you see
how difficult that is so I want to tackle that
once and for all I want to tackle any remaining
fears that I have fears of death fears of financial
problems fears of not being able to survive you know
there's all sorts of fears that are there under the
surface that I want to tackle once and for all
and any remaining sources of suffering and lastly the objective
is what the Zen master is called no mind it's
a state in which your mind is completely silent and
for me this has been a big challenge because my
mind is very active my mind is very creative my
mind is incredibly conceptual you haven't told if you haven't
been able to tell that yet and that has been
my biggest obstacle to all this enlightenment stuff is because
simultaneously as I pursue enlightenment I'm also analyzing the process
as it's happening because I have this mission of then
communicating it to other people so it presents a challenge
because to really go and fully embody the awakening the
mind has to completely stop which means that you can't
really analyze what's going on so that presents a challenge
so what's gonna happen here is I'm gonna go completely
into this process for 30 days I'm not gonna do
much analysing I'm gonna shut off the mind and see
how deep I can go towards the no mind state
now a couple of administrative points here there will not
be any new videos or blog posts for the next
month there will be no new forum posts from me
but actualise org as a website and the forum and
the store will we'll be fully active so you can
still shop if you want to buy the life purpose
course if you want to get the book list you
can still do that you can still access all of
those that's not going away anytime soon the forum will
still be active moderators will still be moderating it and
so everything will basically still keep running so don't worry
about that and in fact I will still provide tech
support and any kind of billing issues or refunds if
you need any then I will still be providing that
I will take an hour to out of my retreat
probably somewhere during the middle where I will answer any
kind of tech support issues that arise there aren't very
many that usually arise but you know we get once
or two a week or something like that so I'll
address those so don't worry and that will all keep
running what I think I want to do is I
want to shoot one summary video for every week during
this basically four week process so at the end of
every week I will sort of do a summation video
the way that I've done in retreats in the past
where I'll talk about what's going on with me where
I'm at and what my current state is and what
maybe some insights that I that I gleaned were and
share those with you but uh but I'm not going
to post those weekly videos until June until my retreat
is over so I don't distract myself so that's the
game plan now actualize that org is not going away
that's not what I'm saying here what I'm saying here
is actually that I'm trying to deepen the work I'm
trying to take it to the next level I'm trying
to make myself a better teacher I'm trying to fully
embody the things that I talked about and that I
teach it's easy to talk about these things it's another
thing to actually embody them and there are many degrees
of embodiment that one can have so some of the
things I talk about I already embody them to some
degree but then the question is to what degree and
so you know what I want to do is I
want to deepen that degree there are still many important
videos that I have left to shoot that I'm really
excited about shooting and that's what makes this decision so
difficult because I love shooting these videos in fact there
there are so many videos to shoot that it's overwhelming
how many of them there are there are hundreds of
them my best videos I think are still yet to
come we have very deep and important topics yet to
cover we have topics like the nature of science the
nature of language which we've still only just skimmed the
surface of we'll definitely cover that in the future chaos
theory the nature of perception that's a very important topic
we're going to talk about causality we're going to talk
about the true nature of evolution and how materialism and
science misunderstands what evolution is and how it really works
we're gonna talk about what consciousness is what awareness is
we're gonna talk about different levels of consciousness we're gonna
talk about different degrees of enlightenment and different facets to
enlightenment we're gonna talk about the problems with pragmatism there's
gonna be videos on systems thinking on spiral dynamics videos
about emotions the true nature of emotions that's a very
deep topic with many videos that will be under that
dat umbrella we're gonna talk about fear we're gonna talk
about anger we're talking about guilt or gonna talk about
shame we're gonna talk about boredom and all the other
kinds of emotions that are running your life and basically
enslaving you we're gonna talk about love well we're gonna
talk about chakras there's gonna be videos on healing there's
gonna be videos about self bias that's still a topic
that I need to cover from from earlier that I
promised there's gonna be videos about integrity about brain science
about brain training so I mean there's there's still so
much to cover this is just scratching the tip of
the iceberg of all the stuff we have to talk
about and that's not even including all the stuff that
I need to talk to you about which I learned
recently from my Hawaii retreat tons of insights there about
enlightenment and non-duality in this whole spiritual process and of
course all the insights that I'll gain over the next
30 days from from this from this long solo isolated
retreat so actualize that org is by no means done
my plan is to come back and to resume this
stuff at an even deeper level so that what I
really want is I want to be able to talk
about these topics in a way that gets right to
the bone to the very core of these issues so
that you have the most potent most concentrated wisdom and
insights about how to master your emotions and how to
how to do meditation retreat how to pursue enlightenment and
all the sort of stuff and so even though the
things I've told you in the past it's good advice
generally speaking but the question it always is you know
how direct is it how close to the bone does
it really cut and what I've noticed is that the
deeper I get into this work the more I see
all the common threads and how they all interconnect very
deep down you see sort of the surface structures at
first but then you get to the really deep structures
of how the psyche works and what the obstacles are
and then you see very very clearly why people are
suffering why they have pain why they keep backsliding why
they keep committing the same stupidities over and over again
why they're addicted and all this sorts of stuff you
start to see that and so the really powerful work
is being able to sort of rather than cutting off
heads of this Hydra all these problems you're tackling by
cutting off individual heads you attack the Hydra right at
the heart and then for that of course you need
to go very deeply into yourself so that's the plan
I have really no idea how this is going to
turn out it's an experiment I don't know whether I'm
gonna succeed at this or not so just watch and
see for me this is simultaneously exciting and scary it's
exciting because I'm excited to take it to the next
level I feel like this process of shooting video videos
every single week I've sort of mastered this process I'm
sort of comfortable with this process of course I can
improve it a lot but it feels like I'm just
polishing the details what I want is I want to
like take it to the next level so I'm really
excited about possibly doing that I'm really excited being able
to not just speak about these things intellectually with you
using words but also to embody it more physically and
to embody it more energetically such that the teachings are
communicated not just through my words and the concepts but
really through the energy and that's what you see with
a lot of really great enlightened masters and spiritual teachers
is that what's remarkable about them is their energy that's
what really convinces you to get into the work is
the energy behind the teachings not the words not the
ideas even though those can be very profound as well
but as excited as I am about all that it's
also scary it's frightening I've never done a retreat this
long I don't really know whether I'll be able to
pull it off frankly the longest I've done is about
10 days a 10-day Vipassana and that was in a
more structure sort of setting and even there you know
usually I would cheat a little bit here and there
I would sneak a peek at my phone or the
internet or something like that but also I feel like
I've done so many of these retreats now that I'm
getting more aware of the tricks that my mind plays
on me which then derail the retreats or get me
to try to like run away or to escape so
I'm becoming more conscious of that and also my commitment
and my determination is is deepening and that's what really
happened with this with this mini awakening experience that I
had on five Meo recently is that it really it
really showed me that this is what I need to
commit my entire life to sort of a all end
type of move and so that's what I'm doing but
of course you know with an all-in type of move
it's you you don't know what's really gonna happen and
a little bit scary because I've spent the last four
years just pumping out these videos and I sort of
built that up as a habit and then you know
quitting one of these habits even if it's sort of
a good habit as it is in this case let's
say it can still be frightening because because you're surrendering
something you see Ashley zurich has been my baby i'm
like surrendering my baby and that's something that of course
i don't want to do but that's precisely why i
need to do it is because it is scary then
you got to face those fears and you got to
surrender all of that ultimately if you want to get
to the deepest levels of awakening you can't have any
attachments really including all of your positive attachments and the
positive attachments in a way are really the most hardest
to give up it's easy it is to to try
to surrender your your negative attachments I mean it's hard
to actually give them up but at least intellectually you
you're onboard with this like if you're a heroin addict
you know you should probably not be doing heroin and
if you're like a porn addict you know that probably
porn is not good for you should give it up
but how do you surrender your attachment to your children
to your family to your business to your career that
you're really passionate about to your life purpose even how
do you surrender attachment of that that's really challenging so
that's what I'm gonna attempt to do a little bit
here so that's it this is goodbye for now I
hope that this next month even though I'm not going
to be releasing much of content that you take this
next month to go deeply into the work stop just
watching stop just listening stop just reading take it to
the next level yourself start doing the practices I've talked
to you about dozens and dozens of practices at this
point you know what they are stop saying you don't
know how start doing it start taking action and if
right now you're busy I understand maybe you have other
commitments and right now you can't go deeply into the
work because you have job commitments school commitments family commitments
whatever that's understandable but then at least make a plan
for when you're gonna go deeply into this work make
a plan that you're gonna start some meditation retreat maybe
not now maybe later in the summer maybe in the
fall maybe in the winter maybe next year but make
a concrete plan plan it out schedule it put it
on your calendar put the money down for the reservation
and not just a retreat there's there's many things you
can do besides retreats psychedelics and starting a yoga practice
starting a meditation practice shamanic breathing and all this other
stuff that I've talked to you about make some commitments
and some plans make it concrete for when you're gonna
really go deeply into this work yes your daily practices
you've been doing some Baili practices that's great but then
you got to take it deeper than just a few
daily practices here and there your biggest gains will come
when you do isolate yourself when you put yourself into
solitude and you focus your full attention on the inner
work the daily stuff is great keep doing that but
also carve out some time in your schedule over the
next year for really going a hundred percent into this
work with full focus without any distractions without any kind
of other obligations or concerns business concerns or family concerns
or anything that are in your way if you're a
student you've got a really great opportunity because summer is
coming up and during the summer you've got a lot
of free time stop wasting this time around you can
go very deeply into this work during the summer you
have very few obligations as a student and whatever obligations
you do have that you think are important guess what
they're not nearly as important as you think they are
ditch those go really deeply into yourself you'll thank me
later when you're an adult it's much much easier to
do this stuff when you're young then when you're older
because as you get older your mind gets ossified it
gets filled with all of its nonsense and all the
social conditioning and then it's it's it's a challenge it's
a real uphill battle to deprogram yourself of all of
that if you're in high school right now if you're
in college this is the time don't waste it right
now you can make so much growth that it'll take
you years or decades to do it as an adult
because as an adult you're gonna have a job you
can have all sorts of commitments and maybe a family
and and children and a girlfriend and boyfriend and a
wife and a husband and and all this sort of
stuff and then it gets more challenging but even if
you're an adult still no matter where you are no
matter how old you are figure a way to to
plan the stuff out be strategic about it and then
do it so that's goodbye for now and I will
be back you
