            <ul>
    <li><b>The Rider-Elephant Analogy</b>: The analogy compares the mind to a rider (conscious mind) and an elephant (subconscious mind). The elephant often behaves the way it wants to, even against the rider's directives, resulting in internal conflicts in decision making.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Rider-Elephant Conflict</b>: The constant conflicts the rider faces with the elephant, can occur in everyday activities, like the decision to workout, and in more significant life decisions such as starting a business or entering new relationships.
</li><li><b>Subconscious Mind's Control</b>: The subconscious mind (the elephant), more "powerful" than the conscious mind (rider), is responsible for most of the life results. The subconscious mind typically got its current form over several years of evolution.
</li><li><b>Aligning Conscious and Subconscious Minds</b>: Aligning actions and decisions with both the conscious and the subconscious mind can liken to an obedient elephant following the skilled riderÂ’s directives. The powerful combination can work together effectively and is necessary for achieving desired goals.
</li><li><b>Untamed Subconscious Mind</b>: An untamed subconscious mind and an inexperienced conscious mind make it strenuous and challenging to achieve set goals. Some people might find themselves unable to complete the task they know they should be doing due to this reason.
</li><li><b>Training the Subconscious Mind</b>: Success isn't just reliant on conscious decisions but also on the subconscious mind. Thus, continuously training the subconscious mind is crucial in personal development. Transforming principles and techniques into everyday routines through regular practice is an efficient way to train the subconscious mind.
</li><li><b>Elephant-as-subconscious and its significance</b>: The elephant symbolizes the subconscious mind which takes responsibility for essential automatic functions such as heartbeat, respiration, blinking, etc. This includes automatic actions, walking, chewing, moving eyes, driving cars, performing work, and even some conscious tasks that are delegated to the subconscious mind. This subconscious mind works like the autopilot of your body and manages routines and automated tasks throughout one's life.
</li><li><b>The rider-as-conscious analogy and its task</b>: The 'rider' signifies the conscious mind, which needs to have effective communication with the subconscious mind ('elephant') to cooperate and perform tasks efficiently. The video promotes self-observation, asking the viewer to monitor the communication and interactions between their conscious and subconscious minds.
</li><li><b>Potential communication problems between Rider and Elephant</b>: Problems may arise when there's too much focus on educating the rider, which could lead to an imbalance between the knowledge and control of the subconscious. This results in poor execution of plans and unfulfilled goals, even though the rider seems to know everything necessary.
</li><li><b>Importance of balancing education of the Rider with the training of the Elephant</b>: The goal is not merely accumulating theoretical knowledge but also training the subconscious to execute strategic actions habitually. Reading more books or obtaining information is not efficient unless the subconscious mind adjusts accordingly to the conscious mind's understanding and instructions.
</li><li><b>Training the subconscious for productive development</b>: To intellectually progress and achieve desired results, one has to 'train the elephant,' akin to the training of an actual elephant in a circus for performances. It emphasizes on the habitual practice of the learned principles on a consistent and daily basis so that the subconscious mind gets adequately trained, leading to a more efficient execution of tasks and better results.
</li><li><b>The power of aligning the Conscious and Subconscious</b>: Once the subconscious mind understands the principles, it aligns with the conscious mind, forming a powerful, coordinated combination. This efficient teamwork between the Rider and the Elephant eventually helps one in reaching their personal development goals.
