hey this is leo for actualized.org and in this episode
i'm excited to share with you one of my most
favorite meditation techniques and it's called the technique of do
nothing the meditation technique that i'm about to show you
is what i think one of the most powerful meditation
techniques that's out there or at least from all the
different stuff that i've studied there are a couple of
really key benefits to this technique of do nothing i'm
going to show you exactly how to do it here
in a few minutes here's what's really cool about this
technique number one is that it's very easy and it's
very effective this is probably the easiest and most simple
technique that you will find as far as meditation goes
so there's not a lot of stuff to learn or
to memorize very very easy to do and it's also
extremely effective in fact just over the last month i've
been using this technique a lot and man in the
last month i've gotten some of the biggest gains in
my meditation practice that i have in the last three
years so extremely effective the second thing that's great about
this technique is that it's really good for beginners but
also still really good for advanced students so you can
use this technique if you have absolutely zero meditation experience
and it'll be great for you because it's so simple
and if you're an advanced student who's been meditating for
20 years you can use this technique and man you'll
get some amazing results with it i think it gets
only better with time and with practice and the third
thing is that it's enjoyable and i think that that's
really important especially when you're starting off is that you
have a technique that actually lets you enjoy the process
of meditation rather than being totally frustrated by it which
you know is uh what i experienced when i started
i started meditating about three years ago and uh i
tried to establish habits and i i have this picture
in my mind that i'm going to be a great
meditator and that i want to be a great meditator
and it's going to be valuable for me in my
personal development journey but in practice when i actually sat
down to meditate just for 10 minutes it would be
extremely frustrating and painful and basically i would do it
for a few weeks or a month and then i
would quit and i wasn't able to maintain consistency i
tried a couple of different approaches the first approach that
i tried is simply the don't think approach i figured
okay so meditation means not thinking so what i'm gonna
do is i'm gonna just sit for 10 minutes and
not think and then i would sit down and be
like okay stop thinking wait a minute that's a thought
don't think i'm thinking again how do i stop thinking
i don't know how to stop that's more thoughts [
__ ] and so it would go like that and
be very frustrating for 10 minutes and of course the
problem with that is that you can't really stop thinking
because thinking is not in your control but that's a
tangent another thing that i tried is letting go of
thoughts so thoughts arise and then they go and they
arise and they go and you can also kind of
detach from them so i'd sit there and kind of
watch my thoughts arise and i'd detach and then watch
them arise again and detach and that process was quite
frustrating too so for me meditation especially for like the
first year it was really a frustrating process i wish
i knew back then this technique that i'm about to
show you because i think it would have made my
my life a little bit easier i learned this technique
called do nothing from shinzen young and here's how this
technique works i'm going to describe it step by step
even though it's extremely simple so what you do first
is you find a position where you're going to seat
yourself you can sit cross-legged if you want or in
a chair if you're starting off probably a chair is
best if you're a little more advanced do the cross-legged
thing get a cushion that kind of stuff if you're
sitting cross-legged i recommend getting a little blanket or quilt
so you just kind of throw over yourself to cover
yourself up and you're going to be sitting here with
your eyes open what you also want is you want
a timer you're going to set this timer for some
amount of time either 20 minutes 30 minutes 40 or
60 minutes if you're new start off with something like
20 minutes or maybe even 10 minutes if you're struggling
just to do 20. and then as you get more
advanced you'll add more minutes to the clock so you
set your timer that's all basic meditation setup stuff and
then what you do is you're sitting there your eyes
are open and now it's time to get a little
bit into the present moment so center yourself how do
you center yourself well just recognize and become conscious of
the fact that hey i just sat down to start
my meditation okay so that already is going to take
you out of your normal operating mode of running around
thinking about stuff and doing stuff in your in your
day you're going out of that mode and you're just
kind of entering this peaceful quiet mode where you're not
concerned about what else is going on around you for
the next 20 minutes it helps to take just a
couple of nice relaxing breaths deep breaths into the belly
and just notice that your breath is breathing for you
or that it has been even before you sat down
so just kind of become conscious of the breath kind
of going in and out just for a little bit
you don't need to do this for a long time
just for like 30 seconds and then notice that you
have thoughts in your mind become conscious of the fact
that thoughts are arising and thoughts have content in them
and you're getting lost in that content so start to
become a little more present of that present and aware
of that this takes just a couple of minutes as
you're sitting down and just kind of settling in and
then the actual technique begins and how i begin the
technique is i sit down i center myself and then
in my mind i say okay now i am doing
nothing and what i do then is i defocus my
gaze so my eyes are looking out somewhere into the
distance not at any particular object i'm kind of spaced
out just looking into space and then what i do
is here's the critical step is i let go of
control i let go of control over my attention and
over my mind process so i let the mind literally
do whatever it wants to do that's the essence that's
the core of this do nothing process you just let
go and whatever your mind decides to do of its
own accord you let it do that and you accept
it and you don't try to resist it and you
basically accept absolutely everything that's happening within your sensory field
sites come up sounds come up thoughts come up feelings
come up itches come up pains come up memories come
up all that stuff you accept all of it and
you don't try to stop any of it you don't
try to control any of it you don't try to
change any of it so what this is basically complete
acceptance of the present moment exactly as it is whether
it's good or bad or neutral or boring or whatever
you just accept all of it and you better believe
that you're gonna have a lot of negative stuff come
up when you try to do this so you know
feelings of anger might come up frustration boredom sleepiness tiredness
excitement giddiness anxiety fear all sorts of stuff will come
up the trick is not to try to resist any
of it and not to think of any of it
as bad and something that you need to get away
from you totally release control of your focus right so
your mind can do whatever it wants it can go
into story mode let your mind get lost in stories
that's okay too let your mind do the monkey chatter
thing if you've got a monkey mind and it's taking
you in a million different directions and you're sitting there
and you're thinking oh [ __ ] i i shouldn't
be thinking this i should be meditating no just like
all that let go of the need to stop the
monkey mind for a second and that's really the whole
technique what you're gonna find in practice is as you're
sitting there and stuff is coming up you're gonna feel
guilty about not letting it go because you know you're
trying to meditate trying to become a good meditator so
your mind tells you okay if i'm meditating i have
to be doing something i have to be like letting
go of thoughts or whatever what's tricky here is that
you have to let go of that urge to try
to control your thoughts that is the whole technique so
when you notice that and you have an urge that
you can actually let go of in the present moment
then you let go of it and here's the trick
if you are not able to let go of it
in the present moment then you let it be so
notice with this technique some what some people get wrong
is that they try to let go of everything even
stuff that like isn't in their control and that's not
what we're asking you to do here it's a lot
simpler than that if you can let go of it
right now easily you let it go and if you
can't then you don't worry about it it's just something
to sit there and watch and so that's the whole
technique and you sit for your 20 minutes or however
long you sit motionless without moving as still as possible
don't scratch your itches or anything like that and keep
your eyes wide open so you don't fall asleep keep
your back up straight your spine up straight as much
as possible so that that helps you from falling asleep
and that is right there the entire technique now here's
the beauty of this technique it might sound too good
to be true almost too simple so so simple and
so stupid that it wouldn't be effective but that's actually
exactly what makes it so effective what's beautiful about this
technique is number one is that it's hard to do
this technique wrong in fact really the only way you
can do it wrong is by trying to do something
with your mind like trying to get somewhere trying to
become enlightened trying to reach some goal so if you're
sitting there and you're practicing this technique and then you
realize that oh i have a goal to be getting
somewhere just recognize that recognize that's how that's you trying
to control your thought process and just let that go
let go of the intention to try to control stuff
and just sit there and let your thoughts wander and
go in any direction they want and you know 90
of the time your thoughts will wander into some crazy
direction that has nothing to do with meditation it'll be
just monkey chatter this is what in buddhist literature they
call monkey mind so you'll have that 90 of the
time maybe even 99 of the time but then that
five to one percent of the time what's going to
happen is that your mind is actually going to focus
in become very laser focused and into the present moment
and what's important recognize is that any of those are
good it's not just that that 95 is bad and
that five percent of focused concentration is good no that
monkey mind is good too so here what you're training
yourself to do is to accept both the monkey mind
and the calmness the calmness is easy to accept because
it feels nice and it sounds like traditional meditation the
monkey mind usually we don't like accepting that because it
doesn't seem like meditation but what's beautiful about this technique
is that it's really hard to do wrong because all
you have to do is just let go of any
need to control and then you know you're doing it
right the second beautiful thing about this technique is that
it's really effortless it requires virtually zero skill and requires
zero energy so you can do this technique when you're
dead tired when you're feeling shitty when you forget how
to do some other technique this is like the default
technique that you should fall back on in your meditation
practice and the third thing is that it's very enjoyable
and relaxing and you don't need to wait years to
get somewhere in order to enjoy it now does this
mean that you're going to enjoy every single session when
you sit down and do this no in fact probably
when you first start it's going to be very frustrating
and worrying and anxious for you why is that because
your your mind is your mind is always like this
this is the default thing that your mind is doing
it's doing this all the time right it's like it's
like your add you're like a a squirrel on crack
cocaine like this right you can't you can't stop when
we tell you to stop you can't stop it it
goes even worse it goes even more so what do
you do with meditation as you practice more and more
this slows down and it becomes this kind of undulatory
motion like this and then eventually becomes a perfect stillness
like this but that takes practice to do what i
found is that with this technique because you're letting go
of everything and you're accepting everything and you're not expending
any energy or effort on your part it's easier for
the mind to go from this down to something very
steady like this can happen quicker than you think let
me give you a couple of clarifications because as simple
as this technique is it's very easy to screw it
up too with uh you know doubts and also misunderstanding
what i told you so here's an analogy i like
to use for what this technique is like imagine that
you have a monkey that's been pent up in a
little five foot by five foot cage for 20 years
it's been pent up there and it's angry and it's
got all this energy and it's just bouncing around all
the walls in the cage now what you do imagine
you walk up to that cage and you unlock the
lock and you open the door and the monkey just
bolts out with all this energy crazed monkey he's ready
to tear you apart and then what you do as
he's bolting out of the cage you hand him a
bag of hand grenades and you set this monkey loose
onto the city that's basically what you're doing with this
technique you're setting your mind loose sometimes your mind will
want to like scream out crazy things inside your voice
you're not going to be moving your mouth in this
technique sometimes your mind will just want to scream stuff
out or it'll want to imagine like crazy things like
you murdering children or you've uh detonating a nuclear bomb
you know whatever your mind wants to come up with
crazy schemes and ideas and this and that just absolutely
ridic let it all happen naturally if it wants it
to happen what you'll notice what i've noticed is when
i first started this technique the mind was just crazy
because it was pent up for so long you know
we tell ourselves well i can't be thinking that and
i shouldn't be thinking this so we're always controlling everything
and it feels weird to just say hey stop controlling
your mind for 10 minutes or 20 minutes it's uh
something you probably haven't ever done in your life before
because one of the things that the ego does is
that the ego is a control fiend it likes to
control everything as much as possible that's like the ego's
modus operandi so when you try to take that away
from the ego the ego usually doesn't like it and
it resists and so you might at first have this
kind of backlash where your mind says okay you're letting
me loose okay if you're really letting me loose let
me test let me see what the limits are and
then your mind tries to like see what the limits
are and you need to show your mind that hey
there are no limits do whatever you want to do
and you just let it loose and you sit back
and you just watch and you accept all of it
without judging it you just accept now here's an important
point even though you're letting go of control of your
mind and you're not trying to direct your focus or
attention or your thoughts you are still maintaining control of
your body so if you're sitting there very still that's
actually going to be difficult to do you might want
to like scratch your face or you might want to
move around in your seat maybe you're going to want
to lean back because your back is aching or something
so here you exercise control and you maintain your posture
and you keep your eyes wide open if you're getting
sleepy your eyes will want to close and you're going
to force them open so there's a lot of control
being exerted physically on the body but no control is
being exerted over the thoughts and what they're doing in
the mind so get that distinction very clear another important
clarification is that you only need to let go of
control of your intention to control your mind and only
if you can so notice if you're sitting there and
your mind is thinking about stuff and then you know
it's thinking about doing your emails and you're thinking about
uh the birthday party you gotta go to tomorrow and
it's thinking about the kids and thinking about lunch and
thinking about sex it's thinking about all this stuff and
then you realize like oh damn i'm lost in thoughts
you have that realization and then your mind says something
like okay now i gotta focus so see what you
just did there when you said i gotta focus now
that's you you created an intention now to control your
thought process so that's the thing you gotta recognize like
oh i'm trying to control it let go now what
might happen is that you say to yourself let go
and you there's nothing to let go you can't let
it go what do you do then well then you're
not really in control of it so you just watch
it it's just another part of the process you just
watch right those are the clarifications pretty easy let me
give you a couple of tips about how to make
this work even better for you so of course meditation
habit needs to be built this is not something you
can do on a whim this is something you have
to do daily every single day so pick a time
either 10 minutes or 20 minutes to start and do
it daily like clockwork all the time don't miss any
days that's very important for this habit secondly is remember
always that monkey mind is okay if you sit there
for 20 minutes and all you get are 20 minutes
of pure monkey mind and no calm or no relaxation
and know what you might call meditation that is still
all meditation monkey mind is still all meditation if you're
using this technique now you might wonder well leo how
does this differ from not meditating at all isn't what
i'm doing throughout my day basically do nothing and the
answer is no it's not if you actually try this
technique what you'll notice is that you are doing something
in do nothing the only thing you're doing is that
you're watching for those moments where you're trying to take
control and you're releasing control now that might not seem
like a lot and it might seem like that's what
your normal day is like but actually that's not what
your normal day is like your normal day is all
about seizing control or getting lost in thought stories and
never realizing that hey i'm trying to control my thoughts
and all this stuff and all these events in my
life and you're never letting that go in ordinary life
so there is something different that you're actually doing when
you're sitting down here also just the fact that you
keep your body very straight for 20 minutes that will
also have some meditative like impact on you over time
as another tip i recommend that you accept the present
moment whenever you sit down to meditate always remind yourself
like hey why am i resisting the present moment why
can't i just accept it and then just accept it
that's really helpful another tip is to relax your jaw
what you'll notice if you meditate a lot is that
your jaw gets tense in fact it's mostly always tense
and this creates tension further on in your body so
a good tip when you're sitting down to meditate is
remember to loosen your jaw a little bit not totally
wide open but just a little bit loose and keep
reminding yourself of that as you're meditating throughout the session
because if you just start with a loose jaw five
minutes later you're gonna have a tight jaw again so
just kind of remind yourself that's not part of this
technique just a little extra tip you can throw in
there to spice up your meditation and also let your
breathing be deep and natural you don't need to try
to control your breathing just stop restricting it which is
what we do a lot of times like we try
to you know tighten our muscles tighten our belly and
this produces shallow breathing so just allow yourself to kind
of you know take in breath naturally you don't need
to actually control it consciously those are my tips i'm
going to give you a couple of last warnings before
i let you go there's one really major drawback to
this technique and that is that it's really hard to
judge your progress here and in fact because monkey mind
is so pervasive when you do nothing that you're going
to doubt yourself and you're going to think that you're
not progressing and that you're not meditating so how do
you address this well you need to have faith that
the do-nothing technique is very powerful it's a classic timeless
technique that they've been doing for thousands of years in
the east so it works it's extremely powerful don't judge
it until you give it enough time to actually try
it how much time do you need to give it
well i'd say at least give it a whole month
before you judge it but maybe even longer especially if
you're just starting meditation right now because it's going to
feel anxious at first and just because you have one
anxious day of meditation or maybe you have a whole
anxious week of meditation where you don't get any calm
at all and it's just 100 monkey mind you're going
to want to quit and you're going to feel like
it's not working so that's when you need to remind
yourself that hey it is working this is meditation and
in fact the most powerful meditation sessions are the ones
where you get all that [ __ ] out of
your mind the way meditation works and this is what
most people do not understand about meditation is that it's
like a purging it's a purging of your unconscious and
subconscious mind you have [ __ ] in your mind
that's decades old that your mind is kind of dealing
with and struggling with when you force your mind to
actually sit down and be still fully in the present
moment your mind can't be still it's moving around like
that so in order to stabilize itself what it has
to do is it has to purge it has to
purge crap that's making it anxious so when you first
force this this kind of process you kind of clamp
it down you try to force it what happens that
it it even like it even creates more resistance and
so this creates this kind of friction in your body
and also in your mind and to reduce this friction
purging has to happen and so that's what happens if
you're doing meditation effectively is you get these moments of
monkey mind and craziness and anxiety then a week later
there's like a release and it's like ah finally it
purged and then you're calm you reach a new level
of calm and then you keep practicing and what happens
is again that tension and that friction starts to build
up and then again there has to be a release
it's almost like think of it like a tectonic plates
in the earth's crust which rub against each other and
they're kind of like stuck next to each other and
then there's more and more pressure being put on them
and then finally they release and there's an earthquake that's
what an earthquake is those earthquakes when they happen in
your mind those are the true signs of progress on
this journey so don't worry about too much monkey mind
here have faith that it'll all just automatically work out
for you and the last warning i'll give you is
that i warn you you're going to feel guilty about
sitting down and doing nothing and in fact maybe this
is the biggest pitfall that people experience when they try
to meditate but especially with this technique because do nothing
is so poignant they feel like well leo i've got
like a full life i've got kids and i've got
a family and i've got friends and i've got a
business and i've got all this stuff to do and
you're telling me to just waste 20 minutes of my
life every single day doing nothing that's a waste of
my life that makes no sense i'd rather go invest
that time somewhere else it's hard to explain to a
person like that you know a person who's in this
kind of mode it's hard to explain to that kind
of person how beautiful and how profoundly incredible it is
to take your mind from this to this it's one
of the most powerful experiences that you'll have in your
entire life so it's very very worth it right but
it does take some time it's kind of like going
to the gym you don't just go to the gym
and expect to be fit the next day you give
it a few months to start seeing some results and
if you really want to kick ass then you go
for year after year after year very consistently and then
you can have an amazing looking body and just like
that your mind can be sculpted and this meditation technique
right here is just like doing bicep curls or just
like bench pressing or doing squats so think of it
that way if you're a gym rat all right that's
the whole technique very very simple try it today try
it for a whole 30 days do a 30 day
challenge with this 30 days straight for 20 minutes don't
miss a single day and then i look forward to
