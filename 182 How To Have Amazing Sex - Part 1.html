            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/KjLt5LUYZhw' target='_blank'>How To Have Amazing Sex - Part 1</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Amazing sex as a peak life experience</b>: Leo Gura begins the lecture by emphasizing that the experience of amazing, mind-blowing sex is one of the best peak experiences in life. He mentions that many men and women miss out on this throughout their lives. He criticizes men's general lack of knowledge and skill in the bedroom and insists that amazing sex involves multiple and intense orgasms and a deep intimate or kinky connection.
</li><li><b>Importance of sex in relationships for men</b>: Leo argues that men who have difficulty keeping women loyal in relationships are most likely missing out on the component of amazing sex. He believes that with a quality sex life, women fall deeply in love and become more faithful and easy to deal with in relationships. However, he cautions against using this for manipulation or trickery.
</li><li><b>Mindset more important than technique for good sex</b>: Leo asserts that having a good mindset is more important than mastering specific sexual techniques. He shares that the most important mindset is loving to please the woman, not in a supplicating way, but as a genuine expression of masculine energy. He encourages men to set a standard for excellence in the bedroom.
</li><li><b>Being emotionally open and vulnerable during sex</b>: Leo points out the importance of being emotionally open and vulnerable during sex, even though it might be difficult for those who have experienced past trauma or emotional damage. He emphasizes that sex is a peak flow state experience, where one loses self-consciousness and is fully absorbed in the activity.
</li><li><b>Understanding Emotional Intimacy and Dominance in Sex</b>: Leo asserts that having great sex isn't about mechanical tactics or physical attributes like penis size, but about creating an emotional connection and experience. He emphasizes women's emotional nature, particularly in sexual situations, advising men to be both emotionally open and dominant during sex. Being in touch with emotions and allowing oneself to be vulnerable enables a more fulfilling sexual experience.
</li><li><b>The Two Pillars of Amazing Sex</b>: Leo introduces the two key components of remarkable sex: intimacy and dominance. He specifies that these pillars apply to traditional and typical masculine-dominant and feminine-submissive dynamics. Understand deeply that a woman's real fantasy is to have immense emotional intimacy with her chosen man.
</li><li><b>Guidance on Hygiene and Variety in Sex</b>: Leo highlights the importance of personal hygiene before sex, recommending that men be well-groomed, clean-shaven, and pleasantly smelling. He also emphasizes the need for variety in sex, encouraging viewers to experiment with and add personal touches to the basic blueprint he offers.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Availability of Condoms</b>: Leo advocates for the availability of condoms before starting sexual activities. He suggests keeping them accessible near the bed or carrying two in the wallet as a contingency for multiple encounters or in case one breaks.
</li><li><b>Carrying Two Condoms</b>: Leo recommends carrying two condoms and emphasizes the point that sex is not just about male pleasure but about pleasing the woman. He advises that if the mindset is focused on the male climax, it can lead to premature actions that need correction. 
</li><li><b>Building Kinetic Energy Through Slowing Down</b>: Leo advises how to build kinetic energy through slowing down and building up the anticipation. He recommends starting sexual encounters with playful touches, then moving on to soft kissing and make-out sessions that can take up to 20 minutes, which can arouse the woman. 
</li><li><b>Effective Eye Contact and Dominance</b>: During the sexual encounter, dominant and loving eye contact is necessary. Leo emphasizes that women need to see trust, safety, and an intimate connection in a man's gaze. 
</li><li><b>Stripping Down and Building Up</b>: After making out, the progression to sex occurs with the slow removal of clothes layer by layer. Leo suggests the man undressing himself and then assisting his partner. The woman can then be led by the hand to the bedroom. This furthers the dominant frame the man is setting.
</li><li><b>Building Anticipation via Erotic Touching</b>: In this intimate situation, erotic touching builds anticipation and arousal. Multiple body parts can be explored using different senses, such as fingertips, hands, lips, and the tongue. However, Leo suggests avoiding direct stimulation of the vagina and nipples early on to build anticipation. This progression from non-sexual to sexual areas builds excitement and anticipation.
</li><li><b>Keeping sexual excitement high</b>: Leo suggests starting with non-sexual areas like arms and legs, kissing, licking, or caressing them slowly. Using both pecks and wet, sloppy kisses can vary the sensation. Blowing on wet areas after a kiss can enhance the experience. 
</li><li><b>Using fingertips effectively during sexual intimacy</b>: Running fingertips along her body, starting near but not touching the skin, can stimulate her. As she gets more excited, deeper touches and pressure can be added. Scratching gently with fingernails can also elicit positive reactions.
</li><li><b>Talking dirty as a part of sexual intimacy</b>: Dirty talk can start when making out and continue throughout the sexual experience. It can range from intimate expressions of love to dominant and explicit descriptions of sexual acts that will happen. 
</li><li><b>Teasing your partner</b>: Leo suggests teasing by doing things like rubbing a wet fingertip around her nipple without touching it directly, then blowing lightly on the area. After building anticipation, giving her what she wants, like touching her nipples, will leave her very excited.
</li><li><b>Making your partner beg</b>: Some might find it arousing to have the woman beg for penetration, and holding off until she does so earnestly can extend the build-up phase and make the ensuing sex more satisfying. 
</li><li><b>Duration of sexual encounters</b>: Leo recommends that sexual encounters should last between 60 minutes to 2 hours, as this provides ample time to build arousal, pleasure each other thoroughly, and avoid rushing the experience. 
</li><li><b>Role of Dominance in sexual encounters</b>: Asserting dominance during sex, whether through dirty talk or actions, creates an exciting dynamic and plays into the polar opposite dynamics of masculine and feminine, thereby enhancing overall sexual experience. 
</li><li><b>Focus on Pleasure of your partner</b>: Ensuring the woman is extremely aroused and pleased throughout the encounter not only enhances her experience but also makes the sex more fulfilling for the man. This approach requires genuine desire and effort to please her, and can differentiate the encounter from past experiences, which may have been rushed or solely focused on male pleasure.
</li><li><b>Importance of Fingering</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that fingering is an essential part of sexual intimacy that allows both partners to build up to penetration gradually. Finger penetration helps build more arousal and excitement, it is done when the woman is already very aroused. Gura explains how to finger a woman and stresses the importance of making her want more.
</li><li><b>Teasing the Woman</b>: Through teasing and holding back, a man can heighten a woman's arousal, leading to a more fulfilling sexual experience. He suggests gently applying pressure around the opening of the vagina and waiting until the woman desires penetration. 
</li><li><b>Inside the Vagina</b>: Gura explains how to explore a woman's vagina using a finger. He highlights the importance of locating the G-spot, which is about one inch inside on the upper wall. He explains that this area has a unique texture, and stimulating it can be highly pleasurable. After she becomes more aroused, a second finger can be introduced.
</li><li><b>Causing the Woman to Orgasm</b>: Gura describes his approach to make the woman experience orgasm more than once before penetration. He stresses that the woman can have multiple orgasms and explains that he prefers to make a woman orgasm at least once, using his fingers, before he penetrates her. It relieves the pressure to make her orgasm during sex and, he explains, it ensures that she will be satisfied even if the sexual act ended at that point.
</li><li><b>Penetration</b>: After finger stimulation, the next step is penetration for which, according to Gura, the woman will already be excited. He briefly explains how he gives the woman additional orgasms during penetration.
</li><li><b>Different Positions</b>: Gura encourages men to try different sexual positions and aspects of the dominance-submission dynamic. Different positions allow a man to delay his orgasm and prolong the sexual encounter. Eye contact is emphasized, especially in positions like the missionary, while in dominant positions like doggy style, a man can spank and control his partner.
</li><li><b>End of Sex</b>: According to Gura, the sexual act climaxes when the man ejaculates in the woman. He advises men to find positions that allow them to penetrate without causing them to orgasm prematurely. He intimates that the act of man orgasming, signals the end of penetration as it will come to an end soon after.
</li><li><b>Post-sex Intimacy</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of post-sex intimacy that is often overlooked by men. This involves staying awake after sex, cuddling, complimenting the partner, and expressing appreciation. These moments after sex can significantly strengthen emotional bonding, leading to greater loyalty and love from the partner.  
</li><li><b>Learning the Art of Sex</b>: The steps and techniques of sex shared in the video arent meant to be followed rigidly. Instead, Leo advises focusing on three core principles: Pleasing the partner, embodying masculinity, and striving for excellence in sex. By endorsing these principles, the techniques will fall into place more naturally.  
</li><li><b>Educational resources for Better Sex</b>: Leo encourages viewers to educate themselves about sex through various resources like books, online courses, and even particular types of porn that showcase practical techniques. 
</li><li><b>Practice and Consistency</b>: Consistent practice is the most effective way to improve sexual skills. Leo suggests having a constant partner, preferably a girlfriend, with whom one can engage in sexual activities frequently, as this helps better than one-night stands. The depth and quality of sex tend to be lower in one-night stands due to lack of synchronization, familiarity, and intimacy.
</li><li><b>Gradual Incorporation of Techniques</b>: Leo recommends introducing one new technique each time you have sex rather than trying to incorporate everything at once. This might include practices like dirty talk, spanking, and others. Over time, these actions will become more natural and spontaneous, improving the overall sexual performance.   
</li><li><b>Importance of Discussing Sex</b>: Most women crave deep, emotional sex more than men, and it's essential to give them that experience. Leo encourages open discussions about sex and sharing educational resources to normalize learning about it.
