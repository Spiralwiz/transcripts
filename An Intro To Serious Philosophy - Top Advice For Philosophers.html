[Music] thank you [Music] welcome to an intro to sirius
philosophy this is of course a Halloween special but don't
be fooled by silly appearances because this is going to
be one of the most serious philosophy episodes that you'll
find anywhere online if you're a student of philosophy or
you're interested in philosophy this is going to be some
of the best advice you can ever get about how
to do philosophy how to get into philosophy I'm going
to give you my lifetime's worth of tips and advice
for how to do that this is supposed to be
my top advice for philosophy students or aspiring philosophers funny
enough uh nobody really teaches you how to do philosophy
I'm a philosophy major I went to University for philosophy
I studied it academically seriously you might say and Way
Beyond I'll get into that in a minute but what's
funny is that in University nobody sat down and taught
me how to do philosophy it's amazing it's amazing how
bad it is so before we get into all that
though because I have some strong opinions about how to
do proper philosophy because see philosophy is my life purpose
my whole life has been about one thing understanding reality
and that's essentially what philosophy is I started doing philosophy
in my mid teens all through high school and through
University I spent about two decades over two decades doing
philosophy I effectively became a professional philosopher that's basically what
I am I do this full time I've turned philosophy
into a million dollar career not a lot of philosophers
can say that and those of you who have been
able to do that usually if they're able to do
that it's because their philosophy is very shallow what's interesting
about my career is that I've been able to find
a unique way of doing philosophy outside of the academic
setting which is even deeper than the philosophy you find
within Academia and also I've been able to make it
popular and successful so uh that's that's pretty rare and
there's a lot of lessons that I have discovered in
doing that I basically taught myself how to do philosophy
even though I went to University for it what I
learned in University was nothing like real philosophy all the
real philosophy that I learned I had to teach myself
through years of trial and error and so I have
a lot of wisdom I can share with you on
that if you're interested now even though I'm just some
YouTube blowhard again don't let appearances fool you and one
of the top lessons by the way of philosophy is
that appearances can be very deceiving reality is a very
deceptive thing it's full of all sorts of appearances that
uh hide the truth from you so even though I'm
just some YouTube blowhard you might think you know um
you know how serious of a philosopher can this guy
be you might wonder to be giving me this kind
of advice uh well actually I have probably over two
phds worth of uh study that I've done just on
my own independently I don't have a PhD but the
thing that you'll learn if you do philosophy the way
that I the way that I do it the way
that I'm going to teach you how to do it
is that if you do this for a few decades
you're going to have a deeper understanding of philosophy and
reality than any University professor at the best of universities
that's a pretty bold claim but again appearances can be
deceiving and a PhD is just an appearance it's just
a credential it doesn't mean that the Mind actually comprehends
the significance of existence that's two very different things a
PhD is given out to somebody you know it doesn't
it's not a guarantor guarantor that that person who receives
it really understands what reality is what philosophy is believe
it or not if these claims were not bold enough
here's an even more bold claim which is that I've
used philosophy to reach an absolute understanding of reality I've
used it to reach what I call omniscience most philosophers
would tell you that this is impossible yeah it's impossible
the way that they do philosophy but there are better
and worse ways of doing philosophy which we're going to
talk about uh and um here's an even more bold
claim is that I'm one of the only philosophers on
this planet who has reached the literal end of philosophy
how is that possible you might wonder am I am
I just being arrogant and boastful am I just exaggerating
or is this actually possible the literal end of philosophy
what is the end of philosophy see most philosophers don't
even think there is an end to philosophy they think
it's a philosophy just endless debating and arguing and Naval
gazing and speculating but that's not really what philosophy is
about and we'll get into that in a bit here
as well but to just wrap up this introduction the
point of this episode is that I want to give
young aspiring philosophers tips from my journey tips that will
save you Decades of wasted effort a device that will
transform your whole life if you follow it and stick
with it and one of the tricky things about philosophy
is that it's very easy to get lost in it
it's easy to get lost in the Labyrinth of your
own mind and to spend decades doing it and not
getting anywhere and that's precisely what I can save you
from now my style of philosophy is very grounded it's
very advanced yet at the same time it's practical and
it's quite unique I have some very strong views about
how to do philosophy and that is because in my
opinion philosophy has been badly abused especially in the West
and mostly what we'll be talking about here is sort
of the western philosophical perspective although of course I've studied
a lot of Eastern philosophy as well and there's a
lot of good stuff to be found there but we'll
get to that in due time so philosophy in the
west has been badly abused and I see that one
of my purposes and functions in life is to show
mankind how to do philosophy properly now you might say
well Leo who are you you know who made you
the pope of philosophy who are you to say what's
the right way in the right and the wrong way
of doing philosophy aren't these just your biases well again
maybe that's what's going on here but maybe there actually
are right ways and wrong ways of doing philosophy and
maybe there is an end point to philosophy because see
if you think of philosophy it's just as this endless
blowing around in the wind like a leaf just sort
of exploring this topic or that topic speculating about things
in your armchair if you think that that's all philosophy
is then to you this this claim can seem preposterous
isn't it all just relative but consider the possibility that
actually there is something that we might call absolute truth
that you can reach with philosophy and to reach that
absolute truth requires doing philosophy in the proper ways not
just willy-nilly however you decide it's not just all subjective
and relative although relativity is important topic within philosophy which
I've discussed in the past I have a whole series
of episodes on that so actually this leads us to
a very interesting topic which is the topic of meta
philosophy what is meta philosophy well meta philosophy is philosophy
about how to do good philosophy questions such as are
we doing philosophy properly are there right and wrong ways
of doing philosophy and if there are what are they
and how can we know about them can we know
them for certain or are these just subjective and biased
and relative what leads to corruption within philosophy and why
what are the Corruptions of philosophy and if there are
right ways of doing philosophy how can we teach those
right ways of doing philosophy to the majority of people
what are the obstacles to doing that so these sorts
of questions would be the topic of meta philosophy now
many of these questions are too advanced to be answering
here maybe I'll have a whole separate episode just called
meta philosophy that goes into that but this just gives
you an idea of how deep this can go because
if you embark on the Journey of doing philosophy at
all immediately you start to have meta questions you can
reflect on the process you say wait a minute am
I doing philosophy properly wait a minute is this even
going to be worthwhile where's this going to get me
am I doing it um the wrong way am I
being biased am I being corrupt are the people who
are teaching me teaching me the wrong ways of doing
philosophy and if they are then I'm going to waste
Decades of my life doing philosophy in the wrong ways
and then where's that going to get me you see
so before you can do philosophy you got to really
answer the questions of meta philosophy which is sort of
what this uh intro will be pointing you in direction
of we're going to be talking about sort of the
methodology of philosophy more so than the actual answers I'm
not interested in this episode in giving you answers to
what the absolute truth is or what reality is I
have other episodes that cover that topic first of all
second of all that's actually less important because whatever the
truth happens to be I can't tell it to you
you have to go through the process of deriving it
for yourself and so I want to introduce you to
the philosophical method the right way of doing philosophy and
then you generate your own answers so that I'm not
brain washing you with those so here are the questions
that we will answer in this episode what is philosophy
why do philosophy how to know if philosophy is right
for you how to do philosophy is there one correct
philosophy is there an Ultimate end point to philosophy and
if so what is it which philosophies are worth reading
and studying and which ones are not what are the
traps of contemporary philosophy what are the common mistakes and
Corruptions that exist should you become a professional philosopher an
academic or a professor should you turn philosophy into a
career is philosophy worthwhile isn't philosophy just all mental masturbation
can philosophy actually be useful or practical what can you
expect out of doing philosophy how to become an excellent
philosopher proper motivations for serious philosophy essential skills and practices
that every philosopher needs to learn and to master how
to get started with philosophy are you too young to
start doing philosophy and what are the downsides of doing
philosophy so all of these we will tackle over the
next few hours so get comfortable sit back and let's
get started but before we get into like the technical
details of doing philosophy and the method and so forth
I want to share with you a little bit of
my personal story of how I got interested in philosophy
in the first place because this might be Illuminating for
you if you're toying around with the idea of getting
serious about philosophy as well for me it really began
when I was young when I was a kid just
when I was eight years old 10 years old I
remember my earliest memories I remember a philosophy is just
like sitting in a hot tub with my dad or
with my family we would sit there in the hot
tub late at night looking up at the stars and
you know we had nothing to do so we would
just sort of ask interesting questions about life about reality
we would wonder about the Stars what are the stars
where'd they come from how far away are they how
old are they you know those Stars when you're looking
up at those stars and you're wondering you know it
takes thousands and perhaps millions of years for the light
from some of those most distant stars to reach your
eyes so really when you're looking at those Stars those
are stars that might have long ago gone extinguished and
yet you're still seeing them and that kind of makes
you wonder like oh wow that's amazing and you think
about how many stars are there up there and that
makes you go wow that's amazing and where do they
all come from and what are you doing here sitting
here on this rock orbiting some random sun which is
just one of these out of millions and billions of
stars circling around at some crazy velocity you know how
is all this possible where did the planet come from
where did humans come from you look at your own
body and you just wonder I have this incredible body
how does it work it's made up of cells and
those are made up of DNA and various kinds of
molecules and all this just makes you wonder at least
it did for me now honestly most people especially most
kids don't wonder about these things they just go play
with their friends and so forth but I was deeply
curious about these kinds of questions very early in my
childhood and throughout the rest of my life from then
on and this is how philosophy really begins is just
by wondering about what it is you're doing here and
how things work so I started thinking about stars science
technology cells DNA evolution animals one of the things that
fascinated me is animal Consciousness what are animals conscious of
how come humans treat animals so much worse than they
treat other humans are animals really as dumb as humans
think they are or are humans just so arrogant and
selfish and biased that we actually discount the intelligence of
animals I started to wonder about that I also started
to wonder like this you know if an animal is
so dumb as humans think like an ant or a
a mouse what does a mouse or an ant know
about reality compared to a human they know nothing a
mouse knows nothing a mouse probably doesn't even see the
stars doesn't even know that it's on a planet doesn't
even know what the sun is I mean it experiences
the Sun but doesn't really know what a sun is
doesn't know that some nuclear reaction happening uh millions of
miles away it doesn't know what evolution is it doesn't
know what DNA is or what cells are it doesn't
even know what mathematics is and then you start to
think well if a mouse is just that conscious and
then we think maybe a dog is a little bit
more conscious and an ant is even less conscious than
a mouse like what does an ant know or what
does a worm know a worm that lives in the
earth doesn't even know that there are forests outside doesn't
even know what the sky looks like it spent its
whole life living a mile beneath the Earth uh or
a fish that's living at the bottom of the ocean
a mile below the ocean what does that fish know
it doesn't even know that it's on a planet or
there's there's a surface it doesn't know there's a sky
it doesn't know there's light uh and there's a that
there's night and day because it lives so deep and
then of course the next sort of extrapolation beyond that
it's like well humans supposedly know quite a bit more
than than those creatures but then why do we assume
it stops there what if there's something beyond what humans
understand to the same order of magnitude as that of
a eel living a mile beneath the ocean and that
makes you really wonder how much more there is Beyond
human understanding after all if you were alive 2000 years
ago even humans 2000 years ago understood so little about
nature and reality they had so many silly ideas religious
superstitions and weird theories that we now know were completely
ridiculous and wrong but at the time they thought they
understood the cosmos makes you really wonder what if we're
in that same situation right now in the 21st century
see so I started wondering about all this and this
got me thinking about some very deep existential topics and
I specifically remember one time my family and I we
were doing a road trip somewhere you know sometimes we
would go skiing we'd have to do like a long
six hour road trip to Lake Tahoe or somewhere and
on that road trip we would be driving in the
middle of the night to our destination there was nothing
to do back then there was no podcast to listen
to or anything like that so we would just have
conversations and we would have conversations uh I remember my
dad would bring up like some topic to talk about
or my my mom would and it would be some
kind of existential philosophical topic and we would sit there
for hours and just debate it in the car sometimes
we'd get into heated arguments other times it would just
be a nice dialogue of different perspectives and we would
basically be doing armchair speculation we will be speculating about
this thing or about animals or about like I remember
one time we were in the car and um and
we were kind of arguing about you know could there
be animals that are more conscious than humans more intelligent
than humans and I would say something like well what
about the elephant doesn't the elephant have a bigger brain
than a human how do we know the elephant doesn't
know more than a human if it has a bigger
brain supposedly Consciousness comes from the brain right and I
remember my dad he argued that actually the elephant has
a smaller brain than the human and I know that
I knew that this couldn't be correct like the volume
of the brain mass of an elephant has to be
larger than that of a human but my dad actually
disputed this so we would argue about this so just
kind of silly things like this um that ultimately led
to nowhere but here's here's the heart of it here's
why I'm explaining all this to you might say like
so what what's so important about this well here's the
key what I discovered and maybe I was just 12
years old at that time when this conversation happened is
I discovered that I got most passionate and most excited
about life when I was in these conversations to me
this was the most interesting aspect of being alive is
being engaged in these conversations to me this was more
interesting than playing a video game or listening to music
or even having sex is thinking about these questions now
at that time I didn't explicitly understand this but now
in retrospect I'm just telling you in retrospect you know
I had to go through a whole process to to
come to realize like oh this is what my life
purpose is is to be asking these questions and to
be pursuing these answers took me a long time to
figure that out which is why I'm sharing this with
you because maybe this will help you figure out if
philosophy is right for you because if you're not interested
in these kinds of questions then you're not interested in
philosophy then when I got into High School in high
school I would engage in debates really with one of
my best friends who was a deeply devoutly religious Evangelical
Christian he was from Brazil they're very religious down there
he was a Catholic or something like that I don't
know is he image like I don't remember what he
was just very devout he would walk around High School
carrying a Bible that's how religious he was and I
did not go to a religious school this was just
a public school nobody else was doing this but I
remember him and I we would argue about the existence
of God I didn't believe God existed he of course
did as a Christian we would argue and debate about
all this kinds of stuff and I noticed that him
and his religious friends he hung out with a circle
of religious friends that the way that they reasoned and
argued when I would ask them sort of probing existential
questions about you know like questions such as well if
God exists who created God and if you say God
created himself well then why couldn't the universe have just
created himself itself if God could have so questions like
this and they didn't have good answers and I could
see that they were fooling themselves because they had a
belief in God but they didn't really have an understanding
of what God is they didn't have good arguments it
was just it was just pure Dogma so I already
saw that that's a problem because how do I know
that what they say is true because somebody else might
believe in something else how do I know that's true
how do I know what is true this question started
to Rack my mind in high school so I started
really deeply contemplating this question this got me into what's
called epistemology the theory of knowledge how do we know
anything for certain at all that's the subfield of philosophy
called epistemology so I spent a lot of time contemplating
reality science my situation in life like what am I
going to be doing with the rest of my life
I also started thinking about you know myself in relation
to reality see philosophy is not just thinking about reality
in some sort of clinical objective manner it's also about
what's my relationship to reality what should be my relationship
towards animals towards humans towards the Stars towards planet Earth
I started thinking about religion I was also studying history
at this point in European history especially and I was
just looking at all the religious wars that happened in
Europe how many people were killed Christians killing Christians Christians
killing Muslims Christians killing Jews over what over just ideas
and beliefs so I started thinking and contemplating about all
this and then I got my first philosophy book which
was not actually a a specific philosopher it was an
encyclopedia philosophy which listed all the different philosophical schools and
a few pages about each one so I flip through
and read through different ones and I found it fascinating
just to think about the different philosophies that exist what
are all the different philosophies out there materialism idealism solipsism
existentialism nihilism and so on and then I started thinking
about well they all disagree with each other so how
do I know which one is true and of course
the encyclopedia doesn't tell you which one is true it
just gives them all to you and then it's your
job to figure it out and I wasn't just interested
in studying Philosophy for the sake of philosophy I was
interested in what's the truth I don't want to just
memorize 20 different philosophical schools and be able to recite
them to somebody as some purely academic Pursuit I care
about what's actually true what's the nature of reality I
also went online this was the early internet days there
wasn't that much internet content back then but there was
some and I started to look at various philosophical schools
online like reading basically Wikipedia entries about them brushing up
on them there were some very exotic and interesting ones
and it was confusing and I didn't know how to
differentiate between the good ones and the bad ones I
also started reading western philosophers like David Hume he was
one of the first philosophers I read I also was
studying science at the time because I figured you know
science gives me a good understanding of what reality is
so I was very curious about physics and chemistry and
biology for example and evolution in fact I started reading
Charles Darwin's Book On the Origin of Species just on
my own because I was so interested about evolution understanding
how it worked so I did that and then one
day I told my dad that I decided I want
to become a professional philosopher and he told me oh
Leo you know philosophy it's all just mental masturbation you're
going to regret it you got to do something more
practical so I took that into consideration and I figured
he has a a good point there um but I
still kept doing philosophy in fact I started doing very
deep late night contemplation sessions I would just sit in
my room at 2 A.M with a piece of paper
just trying to figure out what what is reality and
how do I figure out what reality is what are
the different ways I can go about it and I
had some early breakthroughs even then this was before I
even read a bunch of different philosophy at that point
I was literally just doing it on my own and
even then one of my earliest deepest breakthroughs was the
realization that all of reality is groundless and that all
belief systems are groundless including science itself I was able
to see that just by sitting with a piece of
paper and thinking through how does science work how does
science come to its conclusions how does religion work how
does religion come to its conclusions and I very quickly
saw that these are belief systems and ideologies and methodologies
that are ultimately grounded in nothing they're circularly Justified or
not justified at all this was uh important an important
breakthrough in epistemology for me at this point I was
also experimenting with radical skepticism of all the different philosophical
schools that I read about I resonated the most with
skepticism also called pyranism in ancient Greece there was a
school of philosophers called the peroneians who were the radical
Skeptics and they basically doubted that it's possible to know
anything about reality and that's sort of the conclusion that
I came to is that like I don't know how
to know but this is tricky because if you say
that I know it's impossible to know anything about reality
that's true for certain if you say that that's actually
a knowledge claim that means you know that but I
was so skeptical that I wasn't even willing to say
that I knew that because I didn't even know that
I didn't even know whether I could know or I
couldn't know and so that just left me in this
kind of like empty null state at that point I
had dreams of writing a book a world transforming book
that would destroy every philosophical system because every philosophical system
that I read I could see it had its assumptions
and all those assumptions if you question them deeply enough
eventually this philosophical system would collapse you would deconstruct it
and so I wanted to create my own philosophy which
was the philosophy of deconstruction and then but but then
see I realized wait a minute but if I create
my own philosophy which is supposed to deconstruct all the
philosophies then what about my own philosophy that one too
has assumptions to it and that too needs to be
deconstructed and so what happens if I deconstruct my own
deconstructed philos deconstructing philosophy where do I end up I
can't even write a book at that point and so
I tried writing philosophy at that point this was maybe
like when I was 18 years old but everything I
write it I hated because every time I wrote down
some positive constructive statement I already realized that it's limited
it comes from various assumptions and that I can't possibly
be I can't know for sure that it's true and
so I struggled with this then I went to University
started studying philosophy and University and I started researching the
possibility of what it would take to become a professional
philosopher as like a university professor I actually bought a
book that explained you know how do you become a
University PHD I kind of like looked through the whole
process and then I realized very quickly that the whole
PhD process is the pyramid scheme especially when it comes
to Fields such as philosophy because you have to go
through this whole you know eight or ten years of
getting your PhD and then you have to go back
into the system and there has to be a spot
for you in the system but there's so few spots
in the system for philosophy phds that there's way too
many people clamoring for every position and not enough positions
for everybody because it's basically it is a pyramid scheme
essentially because what you're doing is you're becoming philosophy Professor
who then needs a bunch of students underneath you to
fuel your career and your position so for every one
philosophy Professor there has to be hundreds of philosophy students
and I was really disappointed by this I saw how
corrupt the whole university system is and I realized that
I can't pursue the truth within this kind of system
because this system is not prioritizing truth seeking or Genuine
philosophy when it's prioritizing is it's prioritizing the academic bureaucracy
and then you have to play by the games of
this academic bureaucracy in order to have a position and
as soon as you stop playing by their rules and
doing philosophy the way that they like to do philosophy
they're going to kick you out and you're not going
to get the position the people who get the position
because there's so few positions in so many people are
the people who basically become lap dogs of the University
system and that's not what I was interested in so
then at around age 20 or 21 I decided that
uh I would reject the university and academic system on
purpose because if I didn't then that would be selling
my soul to the devil and it would corrupt my
whole philosophy and that would be perverse so I would
rather do philosophy on my own or not do philosophy
at all than become a [ __ ] to the
university system and so that's what I did so I
dropped the idea of becoming a philosopher and I switched
my focus to video game design which is something I
was always interested in as well as a kid I
focused on that for the next few years I became
a professional video game designer and during that time I
stopped doing philosophy and then from game design I started
my own business online business because even Within game design
I realized that as a game designer working for a
large AAA Studio I would also be hoarding myself out
to that studio system which I also didn't like I
had too much Integrity to consign confine myself to any
kind of system what I really wanted is I wanted
to pursue my own creative interests completely autonomously without any
external forces influencing me or corrupting my work without any
kind of financial obligations and so forth without some boss
telling me what I can and can't do so even
though I didn't want to I forced myself to start
my own business I wasn't really interested in business other
than that I was interested in having complete Financial Independence
so that I could have the creative freedom that I
needed to do the work that I knew I needed
to do so I spent a few years building that
business and became financially independent and got my autonomy and
creative freedom and at that point I could do anything
I wanted to and that's when I got into self-education
reading a lot of non-fiction books science books and personal
development I got into personal development around this time and
then as I got into that I also needed to
work on my dating life because I had been neglecting
that for all these years because I was so focused
on figuring out the nature of reality that I I
didn't even I didn't even consider having a relationship with
a girl until I was over 25 years old simply
because I was so focused on figuring out what the
[ __ ] is reality and what is my role
within reality that's how focused I was it's not that
I wasn't interested in sex it's just that I was
way more interested in philosophy than I was in sex
so I put that on the back burner but then
I turned 25 26 and I decided that and I
got to take care of this as well um this
thing that I've been procrastinating on so I got it
to pick up started learning theory about attraction how to
get better with girls all that kind of stuff that
took me down a certain rabbit hole I started listening
to this guy named Owen Cook from RSD um and
what's interesting about Owen Cook is that he's a very
philosophical guy in addition to just teaching you pick up
skills he talked a lot about philosophical deep profound Concepts
and for me this re-sparked my passion for philosophy I
immediately saw the value in having a a sort of
a database of all these interesting philosophical Concepts because they
could also be very practical and uh that's actually when
I first got my idea for what actualize.org would be
is this catalog of philosophical Concepts that would be both
profound and also practical at the same time then I
was uh stumbling around on the RSD Forum just reading
pick up advice this was back in 2012 or so
and then I saw an off-topic section of the Forum
where people just talking talking about random non-pickup stuff and
there there was a thread and the thread said something
like this is the most dangerous book you'll ever read
in your life and as soon as I read that
thread title I didn't even click on the thread yet
I immediately knew I had to read this book I
mean how could you not read that book the most
dangerous book you could read in your life so I
clicked on the thread found out what the book was
bought it on Amazon it arrived I started reading it
the book was titled Enlightenment The damnedest Thing by Jed
McKenna it's a very radical book I read that book
after I finished reading that book it made me depressed
for about a week because kind of deconstruct deconstructs all
your Illusions about reality and life but anyways in that
book he talks about this notion of Enlightenment that's when
I really first learned about Enlightenment and what it is
and how serious it is and at that point as
soon as I learned about Enlightenment I understood immediately that
this is the most important thing in the world is
Enlightenment I didn't even know at that time exactly what
enlightenment was I just knew it was the most important
thing in the world I also knew that somehow it
connected to the the deep contemplations that I was doing
when I was younger in high school you know sitting
alone at night contemplating the nature of epistemology and knowledge
and how do I know anything at all and the
sort of groundlessness of various kinds of beliefs is I
knew somehow it connected to that but I wasn't sure
how it was just an intuition so I started following
up on that then I became a life coach did
that for a bit then I started experimenting with meditation
did that for a bit then I launched actualize.org and
then I got seriously involved in that and I got
very serious about personal development topics which I was also
researching at the same time I was researching both philosophy
and personal development and also a lot of psychology and
I saw a lot of connections between all these topics
then I got very serious about meditation and non-duality Retreats
and self-inquiry so I started doing a lot of that
then during a 10-day vipassana Meditation Retreat I had my
first Enlightenment experience sober that was so amazing that that
showed me that there's a whole new dimension to reality
that most people don't know that exist that I didn't
knew existed then I got into psychedelics and that opened
up a whole new dimension to reality that nobody knew
existed and so I dived very deep into psychedelics and
I did other things that I won't go into here
because we're running short on time but in a nutshell
essentially what happened is that I did so much philosophy
so much psychedelics so much self-inquiry so much meditation so
much deconstruction and I interconnected all these Concepts in my
mind so deeply that at some point I reached omniscience
by which I mean I reached a complete and total
and absolute understanding of the nature of existence as incredible
and impossible as that sounds I did achieve that and
when you achieve that only then do you understand what
all a philosophy is really about and where it really
leads to and also you understand why all the ways
that philosophy has been done in the West by all
the famous philosophers and all the ways it's done in
universities in Academia and even within science and so forth
that all of that is deeply deeply flawed and that
using those methods you will never reach omniscience which is
the true aim of philosophy so that's my journey that
was my process the reason I share it with you
is so that you can learn some lessons for yourself
if you're an aspiring philosopher you can see does this
resonate with you now let's get into some of the
meat here so ultimately why do philosophy because you are
insatiably curious because you cannot live without answers it's really
that simple in the end philosophy is simply the pursuit
and love of pure understanding for its own sake either
you love understanding for its own sake or you don't
if you don't you have no business being a philosopher
if you do then this is for you personally for
me there is nothing more meaningful in my life than
philosophy I do philosophy because I cannot stop doing philosophy
not questioning reality is not even an option for me
if I stop questioning reality I'd just rather be dead
to me life would be meaningless in the worst possible
way to me the whole meaning of life is that
it has such profound depth and you can question it
and question it and question it and get meaningful answers
and have genuine insights and learn about the magical ways
in which reality works and you can see patterns and
you can see patterns in the functioning of your own
mind and humans and nature and animals and this really
is the root of science philosophy is more fundamental than
science science is like a narrow sliver of what philosophy
is about because science is like one narrow methodology whereas
philosophy is a more broad inquiring to the nature of
everything because maybe science is not broad enough to Encompass
all of reality Maybe it's too Limited see and actually
historically science just was an offshoot of philosophy science used
to be called natural philosophy before there was science there
was philosophy because science is actually a sub philosophy someone
had to invent the scientific method who was that a
philosopher philosophers invented science how do they do that by
asking questions by being insatiably curious people wanted to know
stuff like why do rocks fall down and they don't
fall up why are there rainbows what is lightning why
are there earthquakes why are there tsunamis why are there
famines and plagues why do humans live for 80 to
100 years but not any longer basic questions like this
from this comes all of knowledge you see if you
value knowledge at all you must value philosophy because philosophy
is the root and source of all knowledge if you
think back to the first human who could ask questions
and think in a sort of a rational way you
might say maybe 500 000 years ago or however long
it was at some point there was the first human
on this planet who asked himself the question wait a
minute what's going on here where did I come from
who am I what is all this how does it
all work and why does it work this way and
not that way there had to be there had to
think about just think about how profound this is like
let's even broaden this out Beyond just this planet in
our universe where we have billions and trillions of galaxies
and stars which have billions and trillions of planets probably
by by just basic logic there are millions of civilizations
and sentient beings around the whole universe probably many of
them older than Humanity but there had to be in
the history of our universe there had to be the
first creature who could think and ask itself the question
how did I come to exist like I'm alive here
I am I'm conscious of myself where did I come
from where did all this come from where did the
universe come from imagine being that first creature think about
how mysterious this whole thing was for you because see
nowadays the problem is that you're born and you're just
fed with all these ideas immediately you're immediately brainwashed with
all the answers of where you came from so it's
no longer as mysterious as it used to be which
is actually a shame because all the stuff you're programmed
with most of it is wrong so imagine the mystery
of being the first one to recognize your own existence
and to wonder where you came from and what reality
is and how it works and notice in that position
you're in a position of total ignorance you don't know
anything you don't have the scientific method you don't even
have logic and reason yet because you don't even know
you're in such a position of ignorance you don't know
whether science exists or is valid or not you don't
know whether logic will get you to the truth or
to the answers you don't know these things maybe reading
tea leaves will get you to the answers you don't
know maybe doing a rain dance will get you the
answers you don't know at that point you see how
mysterious it is and you have none of the answers
so imagine not knowing that you're even on a planet
because he today you know you're on a planet but
our ancestors didn't know that and today you know where
the planet came from because science tells you that it
is it's Stardust that congealed billions of years ago but
ancient humans didn't know that they didn't know about Stardust
they didn't know about gravity collapsing dust together into a
ball they didn't know these kinds of these these ideas
were not so like it was it's a complete mystery
and it when it rains you don't know what rain
is and when you see a rainbow you don't know
what a rainbow is and when you see a rhinoceros
you don't know what the [ __ ] a rhinoceros
is you don't know if it's friendly or if it's
dangerous and we when you see a mushroom growing out
of the earth you don't know what that thing is
and so naturally you start to question and you start
to wonder but these days science has filled many of
these gaps for us to the point where most people
don't even bother wondering anymore because they just accept the
ready-made answers of science or of religion or whatever other
cultural conditioning you get you just accept those answers and
then you cease wondering so to be really philosophical you
have to wonder about the most fundamental questions and things
even those things that everybody else around you takes for
granted as already understood and known the stuff that science
tells you is already known you have to ask yourself
but what is that anyways because science can convince you
that it knows what a rock is science can convince
you that it that it knows what the sun is
and science can convince you that it knows what light
is and what the color red is and what a
rhinoceros is and you have to challenge science back and
say wait a minute but what are those things anyways
beyond all your you know shallow explanations so philosophy is
about going deep and that to me is the most
meaningful thing about life that's what I love the most
about life is that it has this depth to it
but the sad thing is the majority of mankind are
completely missing out on all this depth they just go
about life pursuing pleasure sex Fame success money a car
a house a family some children that's all they care
about and they never really deeply question life to me
this is a Preposterous way to live I don't know
how anybody can live this way but actually the majority
of people live this way if you can't stomach living
that way then maybe that means you're a philosopher philosophy
really has two functions function number one is your own
personal development understanding and Awakening just for its own sake
just so that you understand notice that there can be
a pleasure that you derive just from understanding something like
think of a situation where you didn't understand the situation
and you were confused by it and then you through
experience and questioning eventually you understood it you came to
understand it like maybe at first you didn't understand how
your computer worked and then you figured out how to
use computers and how they worked and there was a
joy that came from understanding how to use a computer
not because the computer could be used to get sex
or because the computer could be used to make money
or to print documents for your boss but simply because
there's a joy in understanding how a computer works for
its own sake try to connect with that Joy so
that's function number one and function number two is generating
useful insights for mankind you can use Philosophy for example
to create a better Society by asking the question what
is society and how do we make a better one
what are the ways in which society is bad what
are the things that corrupt society and how do we
change those or for example you can use philosophy to
do better science you can ask the question what is
science how do we improve science what are the limitations
of science what are the obstacles and Corruptions that prevent
us from improving science you can also use philosophy to
reduce suffering for yourself and for others which can be
useful you can use for example philosophy to generate money
you can ask the question such as what is success
what makes people successful and then you'd have a philosophy
of success you could outline principles you could find principles
that successful people follow to become successful and make lots
of money and then you can also find all the
things like all the traps and mistakes that normal people
make that keep them poor the heart of philosophy what's
so beautiful about it is it's so simple the heart
of philosophy is just questioning questioning questioning is actually a
thing that humans take for granted because if you think
about it what is a question and how is it
that questions even work if you start thinking about this
deeply and you do a sort of inquiry into the
nature of questioning uh at some point it's going to
stun you and all you the mystery of questioning it's
amazing that you can ask questions of reality and you
can get meaningful answers of course you can also get
bad answers you can get a bunch of [ __
] and speculation and ideology and Dogma those would be
the bad answers but also notice it is possible to
get genuine legitimate answers to questions about reality how is
that possible that's amazing that this is possible what allows
for that why is reality structured in such a way
because you could imagine a reality where you couldn't even
ask questions of it you could imagine being a mouse
and a mouse probably as far as we know is
not asking deep questions about reality it probably doesn't even
have a questioning function but you as a human you
have a questioning function thanks to language and so forth
and this questioning function is not just a a language
game you're not just shuffling symbols and labels and words
around when you're asking questions it is possible to ask
very deep questions and to get deep answers you could
for example ask the question if the Earth is round
what is it that keeps objects attached to the Earth
rather than floating away into outer space and there is
a good answer to that you can find good answers
to that it's not just all mental masturbation even though
of course that's possible you could mentally masturbate about that
question but you could also do some legitimate serious inquiry
into that question so I want you to appreciate that
asking questions is a superpower and there are many degrees
at which you can exercise this power most people are
under utilizing grossly under utilizing this power to them it
hasn't been turned into a superpower but you could you
could Master the art of asking questions you could start
asking very powerful very deep questions and you could do
it consistently and persistently to the point where you reach
very deep answers you could but will you do you
have the wisdom to see the power that this could
be for you in your life just this one understanding
right here could transform your whole life because it's going
to mean the difference between exercising this power and just
letting it atrophy everybody asks questions at one point in
his or her life that's not the issue the issue
is are you going to turn this into an art
or are you just going to do it haphazardly in
a piss-poor way whenever you're put into a corner the
philosopher is one who undertakes a deliberate cultivation of the
art of asking questions doesn't leave it up to chance
and doesn't just do it for purely pragmatic reasons see
most people they only ask questions when it personally serves
them like they might ask the question how do I
get more sex but even though of course you can
ask that question you can get good answers and you
can actually use that question to get a lot of
sex but you see this is a this is a
trivial utilization of this superpower because you could also use
that same superpower to ask way way way more interesting
and important questions than how to get sex but what's
going to motivate you to do that see most people
look like animals and if you're an animal then for
you you're motivated by sex but what if you want
to live in a deeper Way Beyond just the way
that an animal lives well that would be the path
of philosophy here's a list of examples of philosophical questions
that could get you started in this process as I'm
going to be listing off the next you know 30
questions here um write down the ones that really strike
your curiosity some of these you won't care about you
won't find them interesting but some of them you'll be
like wow yeah that's an amazing question I want to
know more about that make a note of that that
right there these are Clues to what you should be
inquiring into with your life and with your philosophical Pursuits
so here we go here's a list where did reality
come from why is there something rather than nothing what
is language what is consciousness is a rock conscious are
plants conscious can a machine become conscious what is the
relationship between mind and matter what is truth does ultimate
truth even exist what makes for a good life why
do people suffer and how do we reduce suffering is
there anything valid to religion does God exist what is
God and where did God come from how do we
know we can trust science what makes science better than
religion what is rationality can anything be known for certain
is philosophy even worth doing how can I be sure
anything exists outside of my own consciousness what are the
best ways to understand nature what do the results of
quantum mechanics mean what is the color red how do
I know I'm not fooling myself what is life how
did life originate where did the laws of physics come
from could they have been different what is time is
time travel possible why does War happen why does it
keep happening again and again and again and again why
can't we stop it what would it be like to
communicate with an advanced alien intelligence how would it be
different or more advanced than humans how do we construct
the best Society possible can all true things be proven
and what is proof anyway what constitutes proof why is
the world ordered what is more certain perceptions or Reason
which one should we trust more over the other how
do I know which sources of information I can trust
does philosophy have right and wrong answers or is everything
just subjective and relative so this is just a small
list of the kind of questions that philosophers ask of
course there can be hundreds more questions but think about
this list as a pretty Broad and diverse list ask
yourself if any of these have piqued your curiosity I
have an older episode called the 64 Most Fascinating questions
that a human can ask go check out that episode
if you're interested in more so how do you know
philosophy is right for you here's how are you deeply
curious about fundamental existential questions are you unable to stop
wondering and questioning everything do you love truth and pure
understanding for its own sake do you love to question
to contemplate do you love to do thought experiments does
asking existential questions excite you do you love conversations about
profound existential topics with other humans if so then philosophy
is right for you and here's a question since we're
talking about questions here's a question you should write down
and wonder for yourself if you're going to be a
philosopher what is it that you want out of philosophy
why are you doing philosophy what are your motivations it's
very important that you're clear about this for yourself and
that you contemplate this and see the contemplation of these
questions is not something you just do for a few
seconds or for a few minutes you can contemplate this
question such as what is it you want out of
philosophy you can contemplate that for years and you will
get deeper and deeper insight into the situation so it's
not just about getting some quick answer or asking me
for the answer like Leo tell me what I should
want out of philosophy no philosophy is about going through
the process and deriving your own answers what are the
various fields of philosophy that you might be interested in
there's not that many of them here they are all
of them basically there is metaphysics which deals with what
is anything otherwise known as ontology it's like the most
fundamental things like what is existence that's a metaphysical question
or does God exist and what is God that's a
metaphysical question or is reality material or is it mental
these are metaphysical questions then there is epistemology epistemology is
everything about knowledge questions about how do we know what
we know how do we know that it's true how
do we know we're not fooling ourselves how do we
answer skeptic the questions and challenges posed by Skeptics radical
Skeptics that's epistemology then you have ethics and morality that's
the whole sort of like moral philosophy subfield which deals
with questions of what's right what's wrong what's good what's
evil if God exists how come God allows for evil
why do people behave in evil ways how do we
stop people from being evil how do we make more
good people questions like this you know how do you
construct an ethical moral Society for example is it is
it moral to indoctrinate your children into your religion or
not then there's the field of Aesthetics which has to
deal with with beauty and so forth questions around that
and art and what is beaut what is the beautiful
what is good art questions like that then there's political
philosophy which deal with how do you construct the best
political system and what are the different pros and cons
of various kinds of political and economic systems democracy versus
monarchy versus socialism versus communism versus Marxism versus capitalists and
this kind of stuff then there's science there's a field
called philosophy of science in science there's a lot of
fundamental questions about what kind of scientific methods are correct
what kind of scientific paradigms need to be used scientific
models how to model all these kinds of technical questions
then there's the field of logic and Mathematics different kinds
of Logics how do they work how do they connect
with mathematics what is mathematics mathematics of science is it
more fundamental than science is mathematics absolute truth what makes
mathematics true how do we know that one plus one
equals two questions like this questions such as can everything
be explained with mathematics can everything be explained with logic
then there's religion philosophy of religion all the different religions
out there you can study them all compare them all
you can ask questions about which one is the right
one what's the what's the best ones what's the worst
ones how do you compare them to each other are
they all talking about the same thing are they talking
about different things and so on you can try to
reconcile science and religion maybe you believe you can maybe
you believe you can't do you think science and religion
are totally separate domains or do you think that they
connect somehow and they need to be integrated and synthesized
and if so how do you do that then there's
philosophy of mind questions specifically about Consciousness what is the
mind what is conscience how does it arise what are
qualia can science study Consciousness and the mind or are
these inaccessible to science what is subjectivity emotions colors perceptions
how do we explain all these things and how does
all this arise from the physical brain so to speak
how does mind and matter combine connect what is the
relationship is there two things one thing called mine and
one thing called matter or are they actually one thing
and if they're one thing is it all matter or
is it all mind or maybe there's some other third
possibility speaking of mine there's psychology now psychology is usually
not considered philosophy but actually for me psychology is critical
to philosophy because as you're doing philosophy you're coming into
contact with your own psychology if your psychology is screwed
up how are you going to do good philosophy for
example if you have a mental illness are you going
to be able to do good philosophy if your psychology
is wrong and there's a lot of psychological tricks and
biases that the mind has which you're gonna have to
take into account when you're doing your philosophy then there's
the field of Sociology which is usually not considered philosophy
but to me it's very related because sociology deals with
culture and it deals with society and after all philosophy
and Science and religion these are cultural constructions and artifacts
the only reason you know about religion or science or
philosophy is because of culture and because you live in
a society and these cultures and societies you know they're
different philosophy is done differently in the East than in
the West and it's done differently in America than it
is in the Middle East and it's different and it's
done differently in China because there's different cultural norms and
it's also done differently throughout different eras in time the
ancient Greeks did different philosophy than the medieval period and
then and then the medieval philosophy was different from Renaissance
philosophy and Renaissance philosophy was different from uh you know
German philosophy and then that's different from today's American philosophy
then there's history of course history is separate from philosophy
but also how can you do philosophy without history in
fact most of what philosophy is taught in universities is
just history it's not philosophy they teach you about various
historical figures who did philosophy but basically they're just teaching
you history the history of philosophy then there's the field
of spirituality you might say spirituality is not philosophy but
then again spirituality is interested in the same questions philosophy
is interested in what is reality what is consciousness what
is God what is spirit what is the soul do
Souls exist do spirits exist then there's mysticism also related
to that and then lastly there's the field of language
the philosophy of language what is language how does it
work how does language shape the way that we think
about reality of course there are all sorts of more
specialized subfields of philosophy but these are the big ones
so think about which ones are these you're most interested
in all right so now let's get into sort of
like how to actually do philosophy philosophy requires serious work
it's not just sitting around an armchair speculating so I'd
like you to make a distinction here you can actually
create distinctions in your mind one of the distinctions you
can make which is very powerful is the distinction between
on the one hand speculation and beliefs and on the
other hand genuine observation and insights these are different things
a lot of people think that speculation and belief and
ideology that this is philosophy it really isn't philosophy is
about making genuine observation about reality or about your own
mind or about your own self or about people and
having genuine insights it's not about just sitting back and
coming up with ideas randomly and then believing in them
in fact this here speculation and belief and Dogma this
is the chief obstacle to good philosophy because when you
have a lot of beliefs and ideas and preconceived notion
and dogmas about how reality is you can't question effectively
you see to question effectively you have to have a
completely open mind you have to be unbiased unprejudiced you
can't your mind can't be filled with a bunch of
cultural programming and fundamentalist religion and stuff like this you
have to seriously be willing to question everything and observe
everything you can't observe a thing honestly when you have
preconceived notions that you're projecting upon that thing and you're
interpreting it according to your preconceived biases and prejudices and
the way that you want things to be because see
we're not interested in how we want things to be
in philosophy we're interested in how things are I might
want to live on a flat Earth but that's not
the issue the issue is is the earth flat and
how do we know that and if your mind is
close to the idea of the Earth is flat and
you just believe the Earth is round how do you
know you're not tricking yourself how do you know that
the ideas that you got the Earth is around are
not just delusions from culture at large because look throughout
every era of human history we know for a fact
that there were people who believed all sorts of silly
ideas about the Earth at about nature which turned out
to be grossly wrong in retrospect this mask is starting
to hurt me I have to bear the pain here
so um so yeah you have to be so open-minded
in doing philosophy that you have to be open-minded to
the Earth being flat on the other hand you don't
want to just believe that the Earth is flat either
because if you just believe the Earth is flat and
there's some Global conspiracy well how do you know that
that's also you just accepting ideas from culture you see
so it's really really tricky and true philosophy only begins
when you understand how tricky all these questions are as
it turns out almost every single fundamental question like the
basic questions that you could ask about nature and life
and reality they seem so simple on the surface but
when you probe into them you realize how difficult they
actually are even a basic question like what is light
that seems like an easy question what is light but
when you dig into it it's not easy at all
it's mind-boggling bogglingly complicated and difficult to explain and understand
what light is and pretty soon you realize that this
isn't just true of light there's nothing special about light
per se that makes it so complicated it's true about
everything what is water what is a human what is
an animal what is life what is consciousness what is
what is a star what is gravity what is empty
space everyday culture makes these things seem simple and resolved
when in fact none of them are the only way
to become a great philosopher is to spend thousands of
hours in deep questioning and contemplation it's just like any
other activity if you want to become a chess Grandmaster
there's no way you can do that without playing thousands
of games and if you want to become a world-class
golfer you have to play thousands of games of golf
and so it is with every activity and the same
thing with philosophy only with philosophy here's the trick is
that a lot of people convince themselves that they are
already good philosophers they begin philosophizing and they just believe
whatever their mind comes up with and they think that
they don't need to spend thousands of hours practicing it
to be good at it they they just accept their
own conclusions immediately and therefore they fool themselves into all
sorts of ideologies and belief systems the Mind very easily
convinces itself that its own conclusions are correct that doesn't
make them correct and so philosophy is one of the
trickiest activities to learn how to do well because when
you're learning golf or how to play pool or how
to play soccer or even how to paint and draw
um you have very objective criteria like it's very easy
for someone to take a look at your drawing and
tell you that it's ugly or take a look at
your golf swing and just see you miss app you
know miss miss your golf swings ugly ugly golf swings
and you can see it yourself you can't really fool
yourself that you have a great golf swing when you
don't and you can't fool yourself that you're a great
artist when you aren't but it's extremely easy to fool
yourself that you're a great philosopher when you aren't knowing
how to question well is not a skill you're born
with it has to be developed and knowing how to
think is not a trivial skill most people are very
poor thinkers they're very biased in their thinking they fall
into various traps of self-deception like projection confirmation bias confabulation
rationalization and justification reasoning backwards from conclusions question begging reasoning
in circles and many many others I have a whole
series called self-deception where I outline it's a three-part series
self-deception part one part two part three where I outline
dozens of various kinds of self-deception mechanisms that I've discovered
how did I discover those did I read those in
a book did I get them from God no I
sat down for thousands of hours doing contemplation just doing
philosophy and observing my own mind fooling itself having various
kinds of biases observing myself falling prey to projections and
other these mechanisms that I have explained and noticing how
tricky my own mind is to the point where now
I'm so aware of my own self-deceptions that I'm pretty
good at avoiding them although I'm still not perfect the
self-deceptions are so sneaky that even after thousands of hours
and Decades of philosophy I can still be self-deceived and
I catch myself sometimes but the difference is that unlike
most people I am able to catch and correct myself
that doesn't make I won't that doesn't mean I won't
make a mistake I can make mistakes and I can
make mistakes in public but then a week later a
month later a year later I'll catch myself and correct
myself whereas most people when they make self-deception errors they
do it and then they make that mistake and they
keep doing it and doubling down on it for the
rest of their life see philosophy is about improving the
quality of your thinking most people you'll notice are very
very poor thinkers and even if they're good at thinking
about some narrow aspect of life they're bad about thinking
in general so there's a difference there are a lot
of for example mathematicians who are really good at mathematical
thinking or physicists who are really good at physical type
of thinking and Engineers who are good at engineering and
programmers who are good at programming program thinking and then
other kinds of people who are good at thinking about
their little you know narrow Niche but then they're really
bad when it comes to thinking about outside of their
domain of specialization and philosophy is about knowing how to
think in general about anything think about how powerful that
is as a skill if you develop that how is
philosophical work accomplished basically through contemplation and observation the combination
of both these things You observe then you contemplate you
contemplate then you observe and you keep going back and
forth between the two I have episodes that explain what
is contemplation how to do contemplation go check that out
I have episodes that explain observation I have an episode
called learning equals observation go check that out to explain
that concept so you closely observe how reality works or
how some part of reality works and you also observe
how your own mind works and You observe how other
minds work you can literally go outside your house sit
down on the curb find an ant and just observe
that ant for an hour when you're observing that ant
you're not judging it you're not projecting upon it you're
not telling it what to do or anything like that
you're just observing it neutrally without commentary you're just observing
what it does noticing its patterns maybe you notice that
it moves its legs in a certain way maybe you
notice that it blinks its eyes maybe you notice that
it Wiggles its antenna maybe you notice that it grabs
a piece of food and how does it do that
and where is it taking it this is the beginning
of philosophy in the beginning of science and then you
can also contemplate on that and that's really the work
of philosophy also you can do thought experiments you can
do a thought experiment such as what would happen if
I took one ant put them in a cup take
another ant put them in a cup and then combine
the two cups together what are the ants gonna do
that's a thought experiment and then you can actually do
it in real life and then observe what happens and
notice that there's a difference between what you think will
happen and what actually happens What You observe happening philosophy
philosophical work is also accomplished by exploring various perspectives and
points of view this by itself can be very valuable
ah because your own mind your own imagination is so
limited that you can't even imagine all the possible perspectives
that you can have on a situation whereas other Minds
can have other kinds of perspectives that are different from
yours and it can be valuable because they might have
some idea that you won't have in 20 years so
it's valuable just to go through and just to do
a cursory review of different perspectives on various kinds of
situations for example if you're a man you as a
man have a certain perspective about women and if all
you talk to is other men they're also going to
have their male perspectives about women and that's all going
to tend to reinforce this I'll create like an echo
chamber but what about women's perspective of women you see
that's a different perspective so if you want to be
a good philosopher you can't just ask men about women
you should also ask women about women you should also
ask children about women you know if you could ask
animals you should ask animals about women you know um
or maybe you should ask about women from different cultures
you know middle easterners will have a different perspective on
women than Americans than Scandinavians than Africans than Asians and
so as a philosopher you should be less interested in
which perspective is the ultimate right perspective and you should
be less interested in demonizing perspectives you should be just
more interested in exploring perspectives for their own sake just
to see what you can get out of a perspective
and appreciating a perspective for just being its own perspective
it doesn't have to be right or wrong it's just
a perspective I have an episode called what if everything
is just perspective go check that out and then you
do philosophical work by asking powerful questions and questioning everything
questioning all assumptions I have an episode called assumption is
the mother of all fuckups which explains the importance of
assumptions I also have an episode you should check out
called the power of asking questions and I have an
episode called learning equals making distinctions distinctions are a crucial
distinction that you need to learn how to make and
utilize as a philosopher because a lot of philosophies about
making distinctions and also very importantly learning how to collapse
distinctions can you see that learning how to think and
how to question is very valuable just for its own
sake after all you will be thinking for the rest
of your life about every kind of thing there's no
option of going through Modern Life and not thinking you're
going to be thinking the only question is is it
going to be good thinking or is it going to
be bad thinking and for most people it's bad thinking
so just think about the difference in your life whether
you decide to be a good thinker or not because
if you don't deliberately take measures to become a good
thinker by default you're going to be a bad thinker
nobody's a good thinker by default think of what difference
that will make for you in your love life in
your business relationships in your finances in your investment schemes
in your ability to raise children to do science the
next point is that philosophy is about self-reflection well you
have to be very careful about as a philosopher is
how your own mind gets in its own way as
you're doing philosophy you're not just some neutral objective Observer
the way that scientists imagine when they're doing science you
are a biased creature you are selfish you have needs
and fears and you have cultural programming that you've already
received for 20 or 30 years before you even began
doing philosophy and all this is going to influence the
way you do philosophy so one of the most important
tools that a philosopher has is introspecting and looking inwards
I have an episode called developing introspection that's crucial go
check that out so self-reflection is about going meta and
thinking about yourself as you're thinking observing yourself as you're
thinking observing yourself as you're doing philosophy I also have
an episode called what it means to go meta go
check that out that's going to be crucial for you
because a lot of philosophy is about going meta in
fact you could almost say that all of philosophy is
about going meta and see when you ask the question
what is going meta what does that really mean see
you're already doing philosophy you're asking a question and that's
a very good question and do you know how I
generated that episode what it means to go meta I
sat down for a few weeks and I contemplated the
question what does it mean to go meta and I
generated a whole list of stuff and I created a
whole episode from that very powerful episode that was an
example of me doing philosophy after all how do you
know that your own thought process is legitimate what if
it isn't what if you're fooling yourself so a crucial
aspect of philosophy is self-honesty you have to really be
honest with yourself hold your own feet to the fire
and the avoidance of all possible bias this is absolutely
crucial because if you're not honest with yourself about your
own biases and if you're not able to reflect deeply
enough to become aware of your own biases you're just
going to be acting out your biases and projecting them
out onto the world creating sort of echo chamber effect
where your own biases are just going to be projected
out and then what you see and observe and then
what you think is just going to be your own
biases reflected back at you you see and then you're
not getting at the truth of the situation you're just
reinforcing your own ideas which is not serious philosophy now
let's talk about what philosophy is not the traps of
philosophy philosophy is not arm share speculation and just guessing
it's like you know well I think that plants are
not conscious I think that rocks are not conscious no
that's not philosophy you're just coming up with ideas that's
not interesting that's not useful that doesn't get you any
closer to truth the question is if you really want
to know about plant conscious you have to ask yourself
what might plant Consciousness look like and how do I
access it how do I verify that plants are conscious
or not conscious that would be an interesting question that
would require some serious work you see the mistakes people
make is they say oh well Leo philosophy is just
mental masturbation no that's just bad philosophy as mental masturbation
because you see bad philosophy doesn't require any work it's
like sort of like a lazy man's philosophy you can
just sit around and say ah I believe this and
I believe that and maybe this and maybe that and
then after all that is said and done then you
just go back to your normal life and nothing changes
and you don't do you don't lift a finger to
do any work whereas real philosophy is like you know
like you know I think the Earth is flat I
think the Earth might be flat there's a good there's
a good chance the Earth might be flat but it
doesn't stop there then you say and you know what
I am going to now work to earn the money
to buy a ticket on a Russian Mig airplane that's
going to take me out to the edge of the
atmosphere it costs about twenty thousand dollars for one of
these flights on a MIG you take a Russian Mig
all the way to the to the edge of the
atmosphere and you look down on the earth and you
see is it round or is it flat so real
philosophy means you're going to spend twenty thousand dollars to
verify that or you know it doesn't have to be
that method any other method you want you whatever method
you want but you see most people are so lazy
that they don't want to invest twenty thousand dollars doing
that but then that means you're not really interested in
the answer you're not interested in truth because if you
were interested in truth as a flat earther you would
want to go out there and actually validate the fact
the Earth is flat you wouldn't just post on Reddit
conspiracy theories you'd actually want to go out there and
see it for yourself and also notice if you were
a true philosopher and let's say you went I mean
you these days you can even buy a ticket outer
space I believe Jeff Bezos sells them now or the
Richard Branson sells them some some of these com space
companies you can buy a ticket for like a hundred
thousand dollars that will fly you into low low earth
you're not going to be in orbit but you're going
to be like just on the very edge of outer
uh on the very edge of the Earth from where
you should be able to see the roundness of it
or not um if you were serious a serious philosopher
you would you would happily pay a hundred thousand dollars
to take that ride and to confirm whether the Earth
is flat or round and you would be happy with
either conclusion right because as a as a genuine philosopher
you don't care you're not attached to the Earth being
flat or round or Square it could be a [
__ ] pyramid you don't you don't care what you
care about is the truth you want to know how
it actually is see and so if you take a
flight up there and you find out that the Earth
is actually a a pentagon then you'll be happy with
that Discovery because that's the truth it's a pentagon you
see but this is not how most people do philosophy
most people when they're doing cortical philosophy they're just trying
to reinforce their existing biases they're not interested in the
truth so all the philosophy hinges on your genuine deeply
honest desire for truth which means that you're willing to
surrender any of your ideas and you're willing to admit
that you've been wrong which most people are not willing
to do so that's the first trap the next trap
is group think ideology beliefs and justifying your world view
we've already talked about this a bit most of what
people call philosophy is just ideology and group think they're
not generating any new insights or making any personal observations
about anything it's just group think there's a difference between
reading Karl Marx and his philosophy of Marxism and subscribing
to it and calling yourself a Marxist versus sitting down
and actually deeply thinking about and generating unique insights about
economics you see these are two totally different activities and
most people who call themselves socialists marxists Communists and so
forth they've never done any serious economic philosophy they've just
read some stuff and they're subscribing to an ideology or
to groupthink that they happen to like because it serves
their political agenda they're not actually generating insights about economics
so please understand this oh man I really regret wearing
this mask it's super uncomfortable after an hour and a
half but I'm committed now the things I do for
you guys I'm just enduring excruciating pain right now while
I talk about philosophy but now we have to go
we don't have time to stop so uh make a
distinction between inquiry and rationalization these are two different things
inquiry is when you're actually thinking about something asking questions
coming to grips with with truth deriving answers whereas rationalization
is when you're just coming up with stories about why
you believe what you believe and why it's true and
why other things are false you see most people when
they're doing philosophy what they're doing is they're just doing
rationalization they're not really doing inquiry the next trap of
philosophy is debating arguing debunking and critiquing these are extremely
popular especially on YouTube on Reddit online on forums and
so forth this is not serious philosophy debating about which
philosopher was right and which was wrong this is not
serious philosophy because when you're debating you're not doing inquiry
you're trying to argue towards some kind of conclusion you're
doing rationalization the mind is extremely good at rationalization in
fact the mind can rationalize absolutely anything the mind can
rationalize raping and gassing children so do you think the
mind will have any problem rationalizing whatever philosopher or philosophy
you think is the best your mind will convince you
that any philosophy is the best if you so desire
there's no limit to what your mind can rationalize how
do you know that's true look at human history look
at intellectual history of the last two thousand years human
have believed humans have believed all sorts of crazy things
and rationalize it to themselves you can rationalize torturing people
you can rationalize lying you can rationalize building a cult
so be careful the next trap is history of philosophy
and scholarship like I said one of my biggest critiques
of academic philosophy is that it's not really philosophy it's
not inquiry what it is is it's reading the writings
of old dead white men and then regurgitating them and
memorizing them and debating over them and interpreting them and
then ask a question like well did Descartes mean this
or did he mean this or did he mean that
and who was you know who's who's better on this
point Hume or Descartes or Plato or Aristotle this is
not a serious philosophy reading the works of another philosopher
and then trying to nitpick it and doing scholarship on
it trying to figure out what did David Hume say
what did Aristotle say what what did Plato really mean
this is not philosophy you're not inquiring into anything when
you do this this is a huge mistake it's so
obvious but this is what they teach you in University
it's not real philosophy decipher deciphering ancient texts is not
philosophy getting too Technical and academic getting bogged down and
all sorts of trivia and technicalities this is not true
philosophy this is a distraction philosophy is about basic symbol
fun simple and fundamental questions it doesn't hinge on technicalities
and the reason that is because you can be technically
correct about many things but then grossly misunderstand the larger
picture philosophy is about the big picture getting the big
picture right not the technicalities a lot of what happens
in philosophy departments and universities is that they completely ignore
the big picture and they earn their phds and write
all their papers on such minor technical minutia which really
doesn't serve them it doesn't increase their understanding of reality
of themselves and it doesn't really appeal or is practical
to the majority of mankind which is why academic philosophy
is rightly looked down upon academic philosophy is a complete
bastardization of what philosophy should be philosophy is not writing
and Publishing papers it has nothing to do with publishing
papers it doesn't matter how many papers you've published that
does not make you a good philosopher I've published zero
papers other philosophers at MIT are Stanford or Harvard have
published hundreds of papers I guarantee you I have better
philosophy skills than those people I have a deeper understanding
of reality that's the ultimate thing philosophy is not subscribing
to some philosophy or philosopher so one of the biggest
mistakes you can make is to say something like you
know what I'm a capitalist I'm a Marxist I'm a
Cartesian I'm a empiricist I'm a rationalist I'm an atheist
I'm a solipsist I'm a whatever and then defend that
position I'm a libertarian and then spend the rest of
your life defending that position that's not serious philosophy you're
just identifying with an ideology or even worse you're attaching
yourself to some human Persona like you really love Descartes
or you really admire Plato or you really admire hate
admire Hegel or you admire Jacques derida or whatever who
gives a [ __ ] I don't give a [
__ ] who you admire it doesn't matter who you
admire philosophy is not the pursuit of a personality cult
it's not about status it's not about credentials it's pure
understanding the true measure of philosopher is How Deeply do
you understand yourself mankind the workings of the Mind Consciousness
and reality that's it everything else is a sideshow it's
a distraction it's a red herring philosophy is not making
proofs or proving things to others this is a big
mistake you can fall into the strap of like oh
I gotta I gotta prove my understanding of reality to
somebody no you don't whether you understand something or not
is one thing and whether you can prove something to
somebody is a totally different thing first of all there
are such deep things you can recognize about reality that
you won't be able to prove it to anybody number
one number two even those things that are supposedly provable
um there are people out there who are so close-minded
and stubborn that you won't be able to prove to
them that water is wet that's not your problem that's
their problem and in fact most people are like this
most people are so stubborn that there's many things you
can't prove to them which are true but you're never
going to prove it to them because they're not interested
in truth they're too biased and too close-minded the next
trap of philosophy is judging the quality of philosophy based
on Authority credentials and status thinking that Plato is a
great philosopher just because he's Plato no what if Plato's
a bad philosopher what if the card is a bad
philosopher what if his philosophy is bad it's not even
about the person it's about their ideas their ideas can
just be bad ideas from Plato can be just as
bad as ideas from from a Nazi bad ideas are
a dime a dozen almost everybody has bad ideas including
very intelligent people have bad ideas Einstein had bad ideas
so one's Authority does not guarantee your ideas are good
or valid and no matter how many good ideas you've
had up to this point the next idea you have
could be a bad idea see just because you know
let's say Einstein was still alive and still doing physics
that doesn't mean his physics are right he could easily
still be doing you know the next theory he publishes
could be the wrong one and it's a mistake to
put him on a pedestal oh this is Einstein it
doesn't matter the next trap is using philosophy and Theory
as a way to avoid facing the realities of survival
and practical life you can turn philosophy into sort of
Escape this is a huge trap especially for those of
us who are very intellectual so one of the things
in my work and the way that I do philosophy
is I force myself to to come into contact with
reality I don't just sit around on the couch brainstorming
stuff all day although I do but like I put
my philosophy to the test in the real world I
do business I run a business I I have to
make money I have to be profitable I go out
I socialize I talk to girls for example that puts
all Theory to the test it's one thing to sit
around on your arms and say oh you know you
know relationships should work like this and sexuality should work
like this and girls should be attracted to this thing
and not that thing and I think this is the
right way to attract girls when you go into a
loud ass Vegas nightclub music is [ __ ] blasting
your ears so loud you can't even think straight and
you have to approach a [ __ ] group of
20 hot girls that are all dolled up and [
__ ] and dancing crazy and drunk that's a very
different situation no philosophy will save you then also when
it comes to your own emotions and suffering you know
when you have a breakup when you lose a hundred
thousand dollars when your neighbor runs over your your favorite
cat when your parent dies or your child dies when
your girlfriend gets raped this is the real test of
your philosophy how are you gonna react when people criticize
you attack you get make insults at you troll you
online how do you respond this is the true test
of your philosophy and you will see very quickly that
all of your philosophy crumbles in the face of reality
one of the things that I really look down upon
is someone who's a philosopher really high Noble philosopher but
then isn't able to run a business isn't able to
buy himself a house isn't able to go attract a
girlfriend this is a misuse of philosophy what I believe
in is that you should do very deep theoretical work
and you should balance it out with a lot of
practice and then you should synthesize those two together and
in fact the practice will help to inform and ground
your work because otherwise your work is going to be
very airy fairy you're going to be talking about chakras
and spirits and past lives and all sorts of [
__ ] but then in real life you're going to
be miserable because you can't get a girlfriend you don't
have your car broke down you can't pay for an
oil change because you're so broke your parents kicked you
out of your house you have nowhere to live you're
homeless you're suicidal your emotions are out of control and
you're sitting there doing philosophy no this is you're just
you're fooling yourself you're not a real philosopher real philosophy
requires embodying your your understanding of reality when you truly
understand situations and things it's not Theory it's not just
you're not just writing a textbook this is transforming you
at a deep level it's transforming your emotional system it's
transforming how you interact with humans it's transforming the words
that come out of your mouth it's transforming the depth
of your capacity to love it's transforming how you think
of yourself it's transforming how you suffer it transforms how
happy you are whether you're depressed or not whether you
argue with people whether you're a jerk and an [
__ ] to people or whether you're kind and loving
all of this is affected by real philosophy so a
lot and of course this is threatening because this this
requires changing yourself a lot of people would prefer that
philosophy not actually touch oneself and one's life because then
it can be done in a purely conceptual manner then
it's safe you know it's safe to sit on your
couch and think whatever theories you want and then just
go about your normal life you don't have to change
but if you're doing really deep philosophy you think about
stuff and then then you realize wait a minute I
have to change my behavior for example if I'm thinking
about animal Consciousness and I realize that animals are actually
sentient and maybe even intelligent then that means I can't
just like go to Burger King anymore the way that
I used to and get the same old burgers that
are Factory farmed you have to change but that's not
comfortable so most people the people who say that philosophy
is just mental masturbation their problem is is that they
actually want it that way because they're too weak and
they're too afraid to do the serious philosophy which would
put the burden on them now to take a lot
more responsibility for their behaviors people don't want to take
that kind of responsibility if you did true philosophy you
might have to quit your job because you would find
that your job is immoral and unethical you might have
to end a relationship because you realize you're just doing
this relationship for some sort of like cheap shallow sex
and you don't really love this person you won't have
to end that because you realize that you know true
philosophy will maybe tell you that you gotta get love
from your relationships for example stuff like that that's extremely
threatening if you're a scientist or an academic and you
do serious philosophy the way I'm telling you eventually you
might come to the point where you realize you have
to leave science and Academia behind because it will not
get you to the ultimate truth and the ultimate aim
of philosophy and that's going to be extremely threatening to
you because how are you going to cope with that
after you've invested 20 30 years into science and Academia
and that's what you use to put bread on your
table and feed your children are you going to have
enough integrity and courage to quit most people won't which
is why they never even begin serious philosophy because it's
too threatening serious philosophy is very threatening in fact that's
a really good way to know whether you're doing serious
philosophy or you're just bullshitting is how threatened are you
by the work it should scare you serious philosophy is
so serious that you might even reach a point where
you think that you're losing your sanity and at that
point you still have to keep going you're not done
because see when most people get to the point of
thinking you know thinking thinking thinking that they think that
they're losing their sanity then they get afraid and say
oh okay I better stop I better stop and just
go back and watch some TV and just do what
normal people do but you failed philosophy requires very deep
courage it's the courage of Truth seeking if truth leads
you to Insanity a true philosopher will choose to become
insane because that's the truth so you have to be
a very clear as to what your priorities are and
if anything is a higher priority for you than truth
then you're going to fail at philosophy and that's exactly
what happens to most philosophers including the academic ones the
scientific ones the professional ones and the last trap of
philosophy that I'll mention here is political activism and power
games philosophy is not about achieving some political goals like
ushering in a Marxist Revolution or power games like your
party winning the presidency or something like that or you
having power in your University this is not serious philosophy
because as soon as you start to carry to care
about winning these power games what happens is you have
to stop caring about truth power becomes a higher priority
than truth and as soon as this happens you've sold
your soul to the devil because remember philosophy is about
pure understanding we don't really care where the understanding leads
us to we don't care what the consequences of the
understanding are and the reason we don't care about that
is because we don't even know what the consequences will
be we don't know what the consequences of finding the
ultimate truth will be assuming there even is such a
thing but let's just assume there is what are the
consequences will it make you happy will it make you
suicidal we don't know but a real philosopher will say
I want the truth anyways even if it's going to
make me suicidal why because a true philosopher cares about
understanding for its own sake damn the costs if you're
not comfortable with that then you shouldn't be doing philosophy
now you might say well Leo aren't these just your
biased ideas of what philosophy should be after all who
made you the king of philosophy why don't you teach
philosophy in a more neutral way the way that a
university Professor might because see a university Professor is not
going to be as forceful with you as I am
here that might make it seem as though I'm kind
of biased and in a sense I am biased you
know what I'm biased towards I'm biased towards truth I'm
forceful because if I'm not forceful with you then you're
gonna engage in [ __ ] and [ __ ]
is the obstacle to truth so we have to be
very ruthless in cutting out the [ __ ] so
yeah my style of philosophy is extremely ruthless about [
__ ] as incredible as this sounds philosophy has a
tangible endpoint there are right and wrong ways of doing
philosophy and here's what the endpoint is the end point
is this it's possible to understand yourself and reality completely
completely Imagine This open your mind to this possibility now
maybe I'm wrong you don't know if I'm right yet
and I'm not asking you to just to believe me
blindly this is something you have to prove to yourself
by doing it but just open your mind to the
possibility that you can do so much philosophy so deeply
if you do it in the right way that eventually
you will come to complete understanding of yourself and reality
now either that's possible or it's not the problem is
you don't know which the only way you could know
is by trying it seeing if you can do it
in the same way that you don't know how high
you can jump until you try jumping so don't just
dismiss this possibility right off the bat without trying it
you have to try it and you have to try
it seriously that's how science Works science requires serious experimentation
you can't just do a half-assed experiment you have to
do a genuine honest experiment you know with your full
effort and see if it if it pans out and
works I'm sweating a bit under this mask okay um
so my claim is that if you do philosophy correctly
you will answer every existential question that you have about
reality and you will understand why everything exists precisely as
it exists this is possible to answer but the answer
is so profound that it cannot be put it easily
into words although I've done so in other episodes but
you are correct in your skepticism in that see the
reason you're skeptical about this and you might think that
what I'm saying here is impossible fantastic exaggerated or delusional
is because you just don't know anybody in in real
life who has achieved this in fact you don't know
almost of a single philosopher in Western philosophy who has
achieved this or who even claims is possible usually philosophers
play this game of humility where they just try to
act like oh well there's so much stuff in the
world it's so complicated we can't know it we can't
possibly know it this is this is false humility of
people who don't know what they're talking about any philosopher
who tells you this is impossible is simply full of
[ __ ] and the reason that is is because
it's not that they're lying it's just that they don't
know how to do proper philosophy because philosophy is so
tricky and complicated that almost nobody has succeeded in doing
it properly in fact this is so common that it's
gone so bad to the point where if you tell
people there is a proper way to do philosophy they
will argue with you about this and they'll say no
Leo there isn't it's all just subjective and relative and
these are just all your biases and you're just delusional
well that's one possibility but the other possibility is that
it's actually possible but you have to be very strict
about your doing a philosophy you can't just take it
willy-nilly and do it any which way you want now
I want to introduce the notion of what I call
pure philosophy I'm trademarking this pure philosophy capital P capital
p Ure Capital pure Capital philosophy what do I mean
by pure philosophy its philosophy that's completely free of history
and named individuals which makes it very different from academic
philosophy and the history of philosophy we don't care about
Plato or Aristotle or Descartes or David Hume or shock
derida or anybody we also don't care about history we
don't care about who said what what did they really
mean did Plato really mean this or they mean this
and when was this said and you know how did
these ideas develop historically we don't care in pure philosophy
all we care about is the ideas themselves pure philosophy
is an impersonal collection of ideas and Concepts think of
it as a spreadsheet of every possible idea and concept
you could have about reality every perspective every way to
understand it in pure philosophy we then evaluate all these
Concepts and ideas based on their Merit we edit them
freely we reinterpret them and we blend them together to
create the best possible understanding of reality we don't care
who said what we don't care if we're interpreting Descartes
correctly or not we don't care about arguing about this
philosopher versus that philosopher and so forth we don't care
about east or west we just care about understanding reality
as best as we can and we're going to use
whatever ideas invented by whomever to do this in pure
philosophy there is no debating there is no arguing there
is no proving there is no debunking and there is
no ideology this is done purely for your own understanding
as long as you understand reality correctly that's it we're
not trying to prove it to anybody else we're not
trying to discredit anybody else we're not trying to invent
an ideology we're not trying to write a book we're
not trying to write a research paper that gets approved
by somebody we're not interested in convincing the whole world
that they're that we're right and that they're wrong we're
not interested in being the best were interested simply in
pure understanding of reality and in this Pursuit we are
willing to question absolutely every single assumption that mankind makes
about everything it knows everything we will question everything nothing
is sacred we will even question whether your mother is
actually your mother everything will be questioned we will even
question one plus one equals two we will even question
a equals a we'll question everything we're willing to burn
everything down to the ground and we do all this
outside of any institution or bureaucracy not in a university
not as part of some school not as part of
some group not as part of some collective project it's
just personally you understanding reality just pure philosophy in pure
philosophy nothing has ever taken for granted everything is questioned
we even question why water is wet in pure philosophy
everything must be explained from scratch without any appeals to
Authority history status cultural norms or even morality we will
even question is rape bad we will question that that's
not taken for granted that rape is bad we have
to derive whether it is or not and maybe it
isn't we're open to that with pure philosophy we have
infinite open-mindedness we're open to absolutely anything and we don't
care about the consequences of any of our ideas that
means that if if we have some idea that is
going to annihilate the entirety of mankind we will choose
to annihilate all of mankind just to get a glimpse
of that idea because we just care about pure understanding
if we get to the point where our understanding grows
so deeply that we annihilate the entire universe and all
the living beings in it we will take the understanding
over the entire universe and all the living beings if
we have to torture somebody to understand what the universe
is we will torture as many people as possible to
understand what the universe is that's pure philosophy like radical
I'm talking about radical things I'm talking about dangerous things
we understand that what we're doing here is very dangerous
and threatening to society and to mankind and we appreciate
that but also we understand that we can't be meek
here and we can't be scared we have to pursue
the truth at all costs that's pure philosophy in pure
philosophy we make a profound study of self-deception we assume
that the doer of the philosophy is in the greatest
danger of self-deception we don't worry about the self-deceptions of
anybody else except ourselves and this is a constant perennial
Danger that we have to worry about we worry about
it from now to the end of our lives and
with pure philosophy we are crucially concerned with the Transcendence
well first of all with the identification and then the
Transcendence of all of our biases especially our personal biases
we're not interested in the biases of other people you're
interested in your own biases as philosopher and your understanding
is trying to transcend every possible bias you have whatever
it might be if you like kitty cats that's a
bias you have you as a philosopher have to be
concerned about that and how it's going to skew your
ability to understand reality that's pure philosophy to me this
is what philosophy actually is when I say philosophy that's
what I mean I don't mean what's done to universities
What's Done in universities should not even be called philosophy
because they ain't doing this they're not doing what I
just described there are really four questions at the heart
of pure philosophy just four from these four questions every
other question is derived here it is and I'll throw
in a fifth bonus one but here's the four key
ones write them down this is the most important these
are the most important questions in in the universe write
these down number one how the [ __ ] is
anything possible number two what the [ __ ] is
anything number three where the [ __ ] did you
come from number four what the [ __ ] is
consciousness and the fifth bonus one is how do I
live the best life that's it that's the heart of
philosophy if you can answer these five questions you figured
out the whole universe that's powerful now of course there's
many other questions you can ask which we can consider
sub questions of these questions you know you can ask
questions like how do we create a great society that's
a good philosophical question but all of that is secondary
to these core questions so I'm not saying you can't
specialize you know you can have your more narrow interests
but just be careful not to get lost in the
minutia it's very easy to get distracted pursuing some kind
of like you know tangent here and then miss the
big questions how can you call yourself a philosopher and
not be interested in these five core big questions that
I outlined for you here if you're not interested in
answering these then what are you doing you're chasing after
peanuts don't miss the elephant in the room that's the
mistake that most philosophers make they're chasing after peanuts okay
here are the top techniques for serious philosophers number one
sit down and contemplate for hours in solitude actually do
this this takes work this is hard thinking is hard
sitting alone in a room by yourself late at night
for two hours thinking about something deliberately with Focus this
is more than most people are willing to do most
people probably haven't done this even once in their whole
life try it do it number two asking powerful questions
and getting better and better at asking more powerful questions
clarifying your questions honing your questions number three Simplicity Clarity
and cutting through all human [ __ ] this is
key a huge mistake in academic philosophy is that they
get so jargony so technical they use giant words and
complex vocabulary this all obscures the pure pursuit of understanding
one of the things that I've tried to model in
my work with actualized audience I've deliberately dumped down all
of my language deliberately not because I don't have access
to fancy vocabulary words and academic jargon I could have
done that and it would have made my work seem
much more intellectual and academic I deliberately didn't do that
because to me if you understand something you should be
able to communicate it as though to a child using
simple vocabulary and by the way when you do access
omniscience and absolute truth as I claim is possible your
understanding will be so pure and so powerful and so
direct and so clear that you will not use complicated
jargon to explain it you'll be able to explain it
very simply with simple metaphors basic vocabulary you'll be able
to explain it to a child I can explain the
nature of the entire universe to a child I don't
need to write some complicated philosophical manuscript that only uh
uh PhD Professor can decipher after five years of of
you know parsing the the words look at my teachings
my teachings are extremely clear the reason that is is
because if they weren't my own mind if my own
mind wasn't clear enough I would never have been able
to reach the levels of understanding that I've been able
to reach the only reason I've been able to reach
these levels of understanding is because I've been ruthless monstrously
ruthless was cutting through all of [ __ ] all
of Mankind's [ __ ] all of the [ __
] and philosophy all the [ __ ] and science
and um all the [ __ ] of intellectuals and
all of my own [ __ ] as well the
next technique for serious philosophers is radical skepticism be skeptical
of anything of everything question everything but also don't abuse
skepticism you have to also apply skepticism to all of
your own ideas and skepticism itself for this see my
episode called um I believe it's called false versus true
skepticism which explains the mistakes of misusing skepticism so the
proper use of skepticism is necessary the next technique for
serious philosophers is study all philosophies a little bit so
that you're familiar with the entire landscape of philosophy rather
than going deep on one philosopher do a shallow overview
of all the different philosophies that are out there this
will help you much more so watch lectures videos read
books and summaries read Wikipedia to get a cursory overview
of the whole landscape the next top technique is explore
radical perspectives and points of view you should be thirsting
for an exploration of different perspectives every time you see
or hear of a new totally unique perspective on some
situation or the world you should be excited about that
and you should make a catalog of all these different
perspectives because all these are just like possibilities in the
whole landscape the next technique for serious philosophers is radical
open-mindedness you need to be so open-minded you can't even
imagine uncomfortable levels of open-mindedness are required the reason most
philosophers never reach omniscience is simply because they're not open-minded
enough actually this is a technical thing that I'm saying
right now it's technically true in a way that you
won't understand until you you reach the end but um
the only way your mind can understand all of reality
is if it has infinite requisite variety that's a technical
term I have a very important episode on my blog
called requisite variety go check that out to understand what
I mean basically you need to have infinite mental flexibility
in order to understand what reality is at the ultimate
level and virtually no human is capable of this which
is why the things that I'm saying here are so
rare and incredible sounding the next technique for serious philosophers
is question science as though it were a religion do
not take any of the models or ideas or assumptions
of science as true or as a given for example
science will tell you that um you will die after
your body dies that's accepted within science you can't accept
that you need to question that science will tell you
that Consciousness is generated by the brain because if we
hit your brain with a hammer or a bullet that's
going to ruin your consciousness you can't accept that you
need to question that science will tell you that the
universe is 14 billion years old and came from The
Big Bang you can't accept that you have to question
that science will tell you that you came from your
mother you can't accept that you have to question that
the next serious technique for philosophers is psychedelics to me
there is no philosophy without psychedelics in fact I will
go ahead and make the Bold claim that if you
don't do psychedelics you will never understand the true nature
of reality and you're not a serious philosopher so you
must commit to at least 100 psychedelic trips if you
want to be a serious philosopher if you think you
can do it without this you're fooling yourself you can't
do it you won't do it I guarantee you'll fail
and this is one of the greatest mistakes that philosophers
throughout history have made although you know um you might
say well Leo but you know Descartes didn't use psychedelics
and David Hume didn't knew psychedelics and they were great
philosophers so how can you say this well first of
all they weren't great philosophers they had no idea what
they were talking about um almost all the great philosophers
in history that are idolized and lionized by academics they
were amateurs they're not serious philosophers um but you know
also speaking of which did you know that nearly all
the ancient philosophers in Greece and in Rome did psychedelics
Plato and Aristotle did psychedelics foreign fact what do they
do did they do uh did they do wheat no
they um they had a psychedelic called keikion which was
actually part of the illusion Mysteries so for for hundreds
of years the ancient Greeks and Romans would have this
ceremony that they did every few years they would do
um a pilgrimage to the city of eluses and there
they would administer a psychedelic drink called the keikion which
was made out of fermented wheat which actually contained ergot
which is actually where LSD is derived from so they
were literally drinking LSD so when Plato is talking about
the The Meta the allegory of the cave if you're
familiar with that you know classic philosophical metaphor um yeah
he's talking about his insights from taking LSD how do
you think Plato got so smart why do you think
the ancient Greek philosophers were so smart so wise because
they were tripping balls that's how see they don't they
don't teach you this in school foreign the next serious
technique is keep a commonplace book what is a commonplace
book it's basically a repository of all of your notes
and quotes that you've collected throughout your whole life I
have a separate episode called how to use and keep
a commonplace book go check that out I actually show
you examples of my commonplace book how I keep it
in digital form that's very important for a philosopher uh
the next technique is write down all of your major
insights you will have so many insights once you begin
this process that you're gonna have so many you're going
to forget to write them all down but then with
an Insight an Insight arises and if you don't write
it down usually you're going to forget so write all
your insights down on your phone or wherever you want
the next technique for serious philosophers is do serious meditation
practice go to some meditation retreats some Buddhist ones are
good some vipassana ones are good uh as far as
your meditation practice I recommend shinzen Young's mindfulness meditation with
labeling that's what it's called I have an episode called
mindfulness meditation where I explain that technique and I teach
it to you but if you want you can learn
it from shinzhenyang or one of these other meditation teachers
that is out there you can find on YouTube and
elsewhere meditation is a crucial technique for for philosophers and
even though I [ __ ] on meditation these days
a lot because it's simply not powerful enough to get
you to the ultimate levels of understanding that you'll need
it's still a very important technique I've done years of
meditation I've done Retreats I've had sober Enlightenment experiences so
this is all important fundamentally what meditation teaches you is
how to calm down your mind and really focus inwards
on your Sensations which is a lot of what intellectuals
and Western academics are terrible at doing this [ __
] mask okay next um make a deep study of
psychology and sociology it's not really possible to do good
philosophy without psychology and sociology because you need to see
how your own mind works and all the sort of
tricks and biases that the mind has and also what
you need is you need an understanding of how broader
culture works and how culture influences the mind and programs
your mind with various kinds of social social conditioning you
need to be able to see the social Matrix so
to speak you need to see us so deeply that
you see science as part of the social Matrix you
see full academic philosophy in universities as part of the
social Matrix you start to see religion as part of
the social Matrix um I'll talk more about sociology in
the future I'll teach it more um but in the
meantime go check out my episode called the social Matrix
which explains that concept the next technique you need is
working with making and collapsing distinctions distinctions are a crucial
and profound thing that basically explains the nature of all
of existence so you want to contemplate what a distinction
is for that I have some episodes where I talk
about distinctions and what they are and how they work
and I talk about dualities go check out my episode
like I said learning equals making distinctions and also my
episode called um understanding Duality part one part two part
three which is all about various kinds of distinctions the
next technique you need as a serious philosopher is generate
specific and Powerful examples that's how I do most of
my philosophy is I sit down and I generate examples
and then I analyze those examples and I see how
those examples work for example see already I'm using an
example to explain to you um but like for example
if I'm trying to understand let's say how attraction works
with women rather than just sitting and speculating what I
will do is I will come up with specific examples
like oh there was that one girl I attracted and
there was that other girl and that other girl and
that girl she didn't get attracted and then I analyzed
those four examples and I said I asked myself the
question of like okay so what was the attraction in
all these examples and then what was the lack of
attraction in that one other example and then I'll I'll
look at that and then from there I will get
my insights and do my observation see observation doesn't just
happen in the outer world it's not like you're only
observing you know animals and plants and objects in the
world you can also do observation on the inside you
can observe how your own mind works how your thinking
process works or you can observe examples in your own
mind but then you have to generate those examples first
they have to be clear and specific the next Technique
we already talked about which is observation go see my
episode called learning equals observation that explains that the next
technique is Master language clear communication and the articulation of
your ideas it took me years and decades to get
to the point where I'm able to articulate abstract ideas
so clearly and precisely as I do in my work
and in fact if you find my work remarkable that's
probably one of the things that makes you think it's
remarkable is my ability to do this this didn't happen
by accident literally thousands of hours of practicing in the
shower in the car when I'm going to bed on
the couch cooking dinner doing laundry I'm standing there and
in my own mind I'm articulating these ideas I'm not
verbalizing it with my mouth but in my own you
know inner monologue I'm constantly refining my ideas asking how
can I make it a little bit more clear what
kind of you know where can I use a better
word to explain something this takes a lot of practice
but it's a super powerful and unique skill set it's
one of those skill sets that will take you years
and decades to develop so start working on it bit
by bit because you got to do a little bit
at a time you can't just sit down and do
it all in one weekend doesn't work like that it's
a long-term investment that you make but it's going to
be so important for you as a philosopher the next
technique for serious philosophy is engage other intellectuals in philosophical
conversation and dialogue but not debate find somebody online or
some friends you have in your University or wherever in
your Social Circle with whom you can have deep existential
conversations and dialogues without any ideological debate right so don't
go on Reddit arguing with people about your philosophy that's
not what I'm talking about here dialogue dialogue try to
find high quality Minds because there's a lot of stupid
people on the internet who you can argue with endlessly
who are ideologues this is not going to help you
this is actually going to [ __ ] your development
as a philosopher you gotta it's not about quantity of
people it's quality find one or two high quality people
with whom you can have these kinds of conversations uh
if you need help with that check out actualized The
actualized Forum where you can find people who are like-minded
who are into this stuff with whom you can have
these kinds of dialogues although also we have debates there
too but you know it's hard to avoid debates these
days especially online but you can find some people there
um try to befriend them try to have offline conversations
you can have Skype conversations or you can meet in
person you know ideally this would be in person if
you're still in University this is a great opportunity for
you to find these kinds of people at your University
that's going to be the easiest thing or you know
if you want even if you're out of University you
can go to a university and find some people in
the philosophy department or wherever that are interested in kind
of in this kind of stuff you can also find
these kinds of people in various kinds of spiritual circles
the next technique for you is writing write write out
your ideas your thoughts do philosophy on paper that helps
to keep things organized and it helps to keep you
honest it's easier to [ __ ] yourself in your
mind than it is on paper because on paper the
next day you read what you wrote and you're probably
going to be disgusted with yourself at least you should
be because most of the stuff you're going to write
is going to be horseshit honestly um but it's still
good to write it out because that is the process
of you growing and developing also that helps you articulate
your ideas and the last technique is start a YouTube
channel or a blog or start speaking publicly you can
go to your local Toastmasters which you can find in
any city in the world basically uh starts start actually
speaking about some of these ideas you have get them
out there that's going to help you to refine your
ideas make them more concise simplify them and then one
of the best ways to learn philosophy is to teach
philosophy you know how much growth I got in the
last 10 years of doing actualize.org publishing all this content
I learned so much philosophy that I wouldn't be able
to have learned otherwise simply because I have to just
to put out quality content every week I just have
to do so much research and I have to think
very carefully and you know methodically and hold my own
feet to the fire and also people give feedback and
that also holds my feet to the fire because I
get a lot of criticism that I have to listen
to can't really even avoid it if I wanted to
okay here's Leo's top advice for philosophers do not neglect
the Practical business and survival aspects of life don't use
philosophy as an escape from facing life and handling in
a masterful way basic survival stuff like having sex getting
a girlfriend getting a spouse having a family having a
job managing your finances having a nice place to live
and so forth and develop some practical skills in addition
to the abstract philosophical skills it's not enough just to
know how to think you want practical skills you want
to develop some practical skills like computer programming or drawing
or music composition or um sales copywriting or sales skills
cooking skills engineering skills that kind of stuff because chances
are you're not going to be making much money off
your philosophy especially not in the beginning the next tip
is don't turn philosophy into a defense of any kind
of Dogma ideology world view or pet theory that you
have true philosophy is not about pet theories it's about
pursuing truth which actually means you're gonna have to kill
all your pet theories that's the cost of pursuing truth
the truth I guarantee you that the truth is not
your pet Theory your pet theory is a fantasy it's
not the truth don't fool yourself the next piece of
advice I have for you is keep your philosophy simple
and clear don't get lost in academic and Technical jargon
like I said articulate your ideas so clearly that a
child can understand you and if you can't that means
you probably don't understand what you're talking about the next
advice I have for you is be careful of your
pet theories and intuitions a lot of times you have
intuitions and they're just wrong they turn out to just
be your personal biases so question your pet theories and
intuitions the next piece of advice is that Consciousness is
key consciousness Consciousness Consciousness remember this word consciousness everything is
going to boil down to Consciousness so study Consciousness the
most what is consciousness what is truth this is your
North Star this is what will keep you from getting
lost in all sorts of stupid cul-de-sacs within philosophy always
come back to what is consciousness in the end you
will not understand the ultimate nature of reality without answering
the question of what is consciousness you need to have
a crystal clear direct experience of what is consciousness and
there are many degrees of this that you can have
many of you guys who follow me and have had
a few Awakenings you think you understand what Consciousness is
you don't I promise you you don't you do not
understand what Consciousness is and if you think Consciousness is
nothing you don't understand what Consciousness is consciousness is not
nothing although it also is nothing but let's not get
bogged down on that next next piece of advice is
be more open-minded you're not being nearly open-minded enough the
next piece of advice enjoy the process remember this is
not a mad rush to get to the ultimate truth
and two omniscience and to answer all the questions no
this process realistically will take you a few decades from
start to finish uh and really there is no finish
line per se you're going to keep doing more and
more philosophy even though I've sort of reached the end
of philosophy I still keep doing it every day anyways
and I still generate more insights uh which just sort
of like deepens my understanding of the core ultimate truth
um but look enjoy the process enjoy asking questions enjoy
not knowing this is actually beautiful because once you're done
with the process so to speak once you reach the
end and you have the ultimate truth you're gonna look
fondly back at all the years you spent struggling trying
to figure it all out and you're gonna see that
this was all a beautiful Journey it's like a film
it's like a movie you don't want to get to
the end of the movie and to see the climax
of the movie you want the whole process the beginning
of the movie is is as good as the climax
of the movie enjoy the whole show love the doing
of philosophy even more than you want the answers but
also not too much to don't love the doing of
philosophy so much that you just endlessly go around in
circles like an academic and get nowhere that's that is
a problem so you do want the end result you're
moving towards an end result but you're also enjoying the
process the next piece of advice is embody your philosophy
don't leave it just purely academic the next piece of
advice is beware of self-deception remember this word self-deception self-deception
self-deception everything is going to boil down to self-deception not
somebody else's your self-deception not my self-deception your self-deception the
next piece of advice try to generate some practical insights
while you're at it insights can be practical they can
change your life you can generate insights about how to
make money why not use that power philosophy is not
just for pure abstract existential questions it's also for practical
stuff be smart about that it's okay to have some
materialistic Pursuits in fact it's necessary don't demonize the materialistic
stuff especially if you don't have it yet you can
transcend it later but if you don't even have it
yet you have nothing to transcend don't fool yourself about
that the next piece of advice is be an original
thinker don't subscribe to any ancient philosopher think for yourself
independently why do you need to subscribe to some philosopher
why do you got to follow dick hard or Plato
or whatever why you don't need this think for yourself
steal their ideas and drop them you don't need the
person the personality and you know Plato is not going
to be offended if you never think of him the
next piece of advice is contemplate read less contemplate more
contemplation is way more powerful than reading one hour of
contemplation is worth 100 hours of reading next piece of
advice do not get attached to any one school of
philosophy like Buddhism so many people get fooled and deluded
by Buddhism because they think they found finally the the
greatest philosophy ever Buddhism the absolute truth no no it's
Dogma it's groupthink next piece of advice keep it simple
and pure focus on the ideas and the insights don't
get bogged down in deciphering dense technical philosophy you know
some philosophers are very difficult to read you know if
you go try to read Hegel or Kant you're going
to spend a month just trying to understand what the
[ __ ] they're saying this is not a good
use of your time instead what you can do is
you can go to Wikipedia type in Hegel or Kant
and you can get a quick summary of their ideas
you don't need their technical arguments you don't need to
understand every sense they wrote what you need is just
a general idea of their ideas which should be summarizable
in a few minutes or in an hour in one
video or on one Wikipedia page it should not be
hard for you to understand what Kant or Hegel wrote
or what they taught you can figure that out in
one hour on Wikipedia you don't need to spend a
month reading their stupid treatises which are Arcane and esoteric
and very difficult to comprehend this is a huge mistake
that philosophers make is they actually take on the burden
of trying to [ __ ] you know read the
original Hegel it doesn't matter what Hegel wrote what matters
are the ideas in Hegel Wikipedia is your greatest friend
there are so many great summaries of philosophies on Wikipedia
the next piece of advice is study self-help traditionally the
self-help field is sort of considered inferior to philosophy and
it kind of is you know it's not as prestigious
it's not really taught in universities and so forth but
there's a lot of profound and important lessons within self-help
and the self-help field when combined with philosophy that's what's
going to make it very personal it's going to start
you up you know affect your own life and your
own development and it's also going to make it more
practical because academic philosophy is so dry and so abstract
that you don't see how it can possibly help you
in your life you want to bridge the gap between
those two and um well you've already found actualize.org and
that will help you with with that a lot because
that that's what all of my work is about is
Bridging the Gap between those two so I've already done
most that work for you watch my content and there
it is but also you should you know read some
classic self-help books and watch some classic self-help teachers stuff
like that the next piece of advice is be careful
with over specialization and siloing so what happens in universities
is that everything is siled and over specialized so nobody
is studying the very big picture of philosophy in a
university in a university every philosophy department is like broken
down like you know one person is studying Descartes another
professor is an expert on Hegel another one is an
expert on moral philosophy another one is an expert on
philosophy of language and it's all siled and nobody is
integrating all of that together into the ultimate understanding because
they think that's impossible it's not impossible it's just that
you're not you're not doing it and not just within
philosophy but look you need to integrate not just philosophy
philosophy science religion mysticism the new age spirituality self-help integrate
all of these together psychology as well sociology as well
developmental psychology integrate everything together into a holistic understanding this
is how you reach omniscience you can't reach omniscience through
only study philosophy or only studying science or only studying
the new age or only studying self-help or only studying
psychology it won't work the next piece of advice is
make Clarity one of your highest values clarity clarity you
can't reach truth without clarity I'm going to have a
whole episode on Clarity in the future so that will
cover that the next piece of advice is just I
want to reiterate for you that history of philosophy is
not the doing of philosophy these are two different things
don't be fooled by that and also memorizing and parroting
the words of other philosophers is not true philosophy and
the final piece of advice is beware of intellectual fads
all throughout philosophy and in every era in every culture
there are intellectual fads you need to break free of
these fads to reach the ultimate understanding and to do
serious philosophy all right so now which philosophies are worth
reading and studying I'm going to give you very concrete
answers usually you know if you ask this of a
university Professor they wouldn't want to answer this kind of
question because they want to say well you should decide
for yourself just read everything and decide for yourself I
mean yeah in theory that would be nice the problem
is most of us don't have time to study and
read every philosophy and every philosopher there's way too many
of them so again you can call me biased and
some of these will be my biases but then again
I have become conscious of absolute truth and the ultimate
nature of Consciousness and reality and omniscience so in retrospect
I can clearly look at all the different philosophers and
philosophies out there that I've studied and looked at and
I can tell you which ones are really good and
which ones are really bad and save you a lot
of time now of course you don't know if what
I'm telling you is true or not from your point
of view this could all just be my biases but
I'm going to tell it to you anyways um you
know just in case you want to believe me or
not I don't I really care if you believe me
or don't so you know people will disagree and argue
with me about this there is no such thing as
like one true philosophy there are different schools many different
schools of philosophies and different philosophers many of whom had
um pretty deep and good understanding they were in the
right track they were in the right direction in the
right Ballpark and then there was other ones that are
not in the right ballpark at all so I'm going
to give you a list of the ones that are
in the right ballpark that are good that are really
worth your time and then I'm going to give you
a list of the ones that are not worth your
time all right so here we go the following philosophies
are quite good and worth your time skepticism pyranism idealism
relativism uh political philosophy it's good to just study different
kind of political systems there's not one true political philosophy
but just the whole field is good to study Eastern
philosophy has a lot of really good profound truthful stuff
in it Zen Buddhism Hinduism and just various kinds of
Hindu philosophies like vedanta for example really good lots of
great stuff Zog Chen which is spelled d-z-o-g-chan Zog Chen
it's a sort of offshoot of Buddhism um mysticism is
good to study non-duality is really good meditation various meditation
techniques are great monism is really good solipsism is good
and yoga is good many different kinds of yoga again
this doesn't mean that all of these are perfect and
correct there's a lot of problems with all these no
one philosophy is perfect I would say but these are
all in the right ballpark now um which philosophers are
most worth reading heraclitus anaximander an axagoras platinus sextus empiricus
Hegel and various other German idealists that came after Hegel
excluding Kant I don't like Kant uh Barkley which is
spelled Berkeley which is what you see Berkeley is named
after um Thomas [ __ ] Paul fire Robin Willard
Klein Spinoza William James the stoics like Marcus Aurelius and
Epictetus SRI arabindo Ken Wilbur and Peter Ralston these are
all generally quite good and some of them are incredible
and amazing all right now which philosophers do I consider
to be overrated and really not worth your time this
is a very controversial list because this includes most philosophers
that academics love but really honestly they're a waste of
your time Socrates Plato Aristotle Descartes Hume Kant the post-modernist
like daredev co uh lot The Logical positivists especially uh
Wittgenstein Hobbs Locke Nietzsche Heidegger Machiavelli Sartre kamu the pragmatists
the American pragmatist like Pierce uh Ein Rand Richard rorty
Confucius husrell and Russo I would not waste any time
reading about reading these philosophers if you want just read
the summaries of their work on Wikipedia that will be
enough for you the problem is that you could you
could spend a decade reading these guys and you won't
be any closer to understanding what reality is that's the
problem here that's why I'm trying to simplify this for
you um all right now the question is there one
correct philosophy um in a sense there is in the
ballpark and this is what it is it is a
combination of idealism pan psychism pantheism monism non-duality Zen Buddhism
vedanta radical skepticism piranism mysticism holism relativism Hindu idealism solipsism
subjectivism and phenomenology so if you take the best of
all those schools of thought and you combine them all
together that's going to get you the closest to absolute
truth but it still won't get you to absolute truth
but it's the best pointer that we've got besides my
work so I mean I'm biased um and I don't
want to toot my own horn but if I had
to you know if you're going to ask me what's
the best philosophy I'm going to say it's actualize.org you're
going to say well yeah that's that's so selfish of
you to say so so narcissistic but then again look
look at it like this like I built actualize.org with
the deliberate intention of creating the best most advanced most
sophisticated most accurate philosophy possible that's what actualize.org was that
that was its Mission from the very beginning I've been
working on this for 10 years I think I've done
a pretty good job not perfect but a pretty good
job especially when you compare it to the Canon of
all of Western philosophy uh I'm happy to compare my
work to any work of any major philosopher in all
of Western history and then you you judge for yourself
I mean feel free to compare my work to Plato
to Aristotle to Descartes to Kant to Hagel to whatever
I'm pretty confident you'll find more depth and more profanity
in my work than you will in all of theirs
combined but you know that's just my opinion I could
be wrong I'm biased so take it with a grain
of salt all right now let me answer the question
of is philosophy just mental masturbation is philosophy even worth
doing what if it's just a waste of time and
what can you really expect out of philosophy so in
regards to mental masturbation um that is certainly a trap
of philosophy it can turn into that but it doesn't
have to it really depends on how you do it
if you do it properly it can be extremely practical
and extremely worthwhile and it can transform your whole life
and in fact you can use it like I said
you can use philosophy to make lots of money you
can use philosophy to get sex you can use philosophy
to change your self-image and your self-esteem and to change
your depression and your lack of you know emotional mastery
you can use philosophy to help you to meditate and
to calm down your monkey mind and you can use
philosophy to make yourself more happy you can use philosophy
to gain a deeper appreciation of life literally more happiness
in fact a really good philosophical question is to ask
yourself what is happiness and how do I live the
happiest possible life that's very practical you can use philosophy
to improve your relationships you can use your philosophy to
improve your communication with other humans and your ability to
empathize and to love you can use philosophy to de-program
your mind of all sorts of ideologies conspiracy theories and
bad ideas which can be extremely dangerous these days a
lot of people getting brainwashed with fascist ideologies Nazi ideologies
far right wing ideologies radical communist or Marxist ideologies this
is all toxic garbage that's going to ruin your life
people's lives are ruined by these bad philosophies and then
when it comes to the ultimate aim of philosophy which
is the axis of omniscience and absolute truth and ultimate
existential understanding you might ask well is this practical or
is this just mental masturbation and what I can tell
you about this is that this is the most worthwhile
thing that a human can pursue there is no more
worthwhile thing once you achieve this level of understanding and
comprehension it will be the happiest moment of your life
nothing else can compare no amount of sex not your
wedding day not the birth of your children not the
earning of a billion dollars none of that will compare
to the peak experience you will gain when you fully
comprehend the source of all of existence I can't prove
that to you you just have to trust me on
that so yes it's worth it of course it's worth
it if it wasn't worth it why would I be
talking about it also understand this that even if you
want to you can't really avoid philosophy you might think
see Ordinary People they fool themselves into thinking that they
can avoid philosophy you can't avoid philosophy if you don't
do philosophy deliberately what that means is that just means
that you're going to get programmed automatically by the culture
that you happen to grow up in and the era
in which you live in which you were born you're
going to be programmed with with that thinking you're going
to be programmed by your environment by your friends teachers
colleagues co-workers businesses advertisers all of that religion science you're
going to be your mind's gonna be programmed by all
of that philosophy see that's philosophy you're going to be
programmed with all that and that's going to be very
low quality philosophy low Consciousness low brow philosophy which is
not designed to get you to the ultimate truth or
to get you to happiness or anything like that or
to get you to love it's designed to uh just
maintain the status quo of society and to help advertisers
sell you materials to shape that you don't even need
so the real Choice the only choice you have is
will you do philosophy deliberately if not that automatically means
you're going to have bad philosophy if you do decide
to do philosophy deliberately that still doesn't mean you're out
of the woods you can do it deliberately and screw
it up and still have bad philosophy but at least
you have a better chance and at least there's the
opportunity that you might do it correctly by following all
the principles I've outlined above following all the tips and
advice and then eventually you'll reach to Ultimate understanding and
love and all sorts of beautiful profound things and you
will purify your mind and you will Break Free of
the social Matrix in the best case scenario and that
would be very very worth it what can you expect
out of philosophy well depends on how you do it
if you do it badly you can expect that you're
going to construct some kind of ideology it's going to
become very toxic you might even become insane or suicidal
or you might join or start a cult or you
just might become one of these brainwashed ideological political people
like one of these you know Maga people one of
these you know Neo-Nazi fascists far right Wingers or one
of these radical antifa marxists these are the worst case
scenarios here's the best case scenario and this leads us
to the question of what is the ultimate endpoint of
philosophy where do you get to if you do it
all correctly and you reach the very end well here
it is I've really avoided talking about this this whole
episode because I didn't want to freak people out because
I could start saying some crazy things here that will
completely strain your credulity this is just an intro video
that will strain your credulity to the point where you're
just gonna click the off button because the truth is
that where philosophy ultimately gets you is so radical and
so profound that you literally cannot believe that it's going
to be true and yet it is so I'd like
you to think of philosophy as a maze or a
giant tangle of wires and chords that you're trying to
untangle this is a good metaphor because what it shows
you is that it is possible to reach a state
where you know if you ever have one of those
giant Tangles of wires maybe behind your TV when you
were a kid you had this giant angle of wires
you had like video game controllers in there and RCA
cables and HDMI cables all this junk and it was
so much so tangled you could barely figure out where
one began and where one ended and what you even
had in there that's kind of like where you start
life it's all tangled up then you untangle untangle if
you untangle correctly now of course if you do it
incorrectly you could tangle it even worse but if you
do it correctly you can untangle it and then all
your chords will be completely laid out on the floor
nicely you know separated and you know bow tied together
with push ties and you'll know everything that there is
you'll understand all the chords that's actually possible within philosophy
that's the end point of philosophy when you do that
with your own understanding of existence so there is such
a point to reach the reaching of this point leads
to the following things it's not just a scientific sort
of understanding it's way more profound than that what happens
is that you reach something called Awakening Awakening with a
capital a you reach absolute truth truth with a capital
T you reach what I call God realization you reach
infinity you reach love you reach omniscience you reach infinite
Consciousness you reach immortality you reach absolute perfection good and
total clarity what I'm literally telling you is that if
you do philosophy correctly you will become immortal you will
become so conscious you will disentangle your mind so completely
that you will transcend the possibility of physical death because
you will deconstruct the very notion of physicality which turns
out to be a construct of your mind I've done
this a few other people on the planet have done
this it's possible to do this but it's not easy
to do this because everything in your mind is designed
to keep you from realizing this truth this is not
a theoretical abstract realization or truth like some theory of
general relativity this is a live palpable life transforming event
that will change your entire attitude towards life reality and
other people and it will be the happiest day of
your life so that is possible these are the stakes
this is real this is not Theory also one point
I should mention is that philosophy Beyond just that if
that wasn't enough is also about the cultivation of your
mind and your intellect see the mind and intelligence itself
these are beautiful things our culture doesn't appreciate the beauty
of the Mind the beauty of intellect and mind and
intellect are so deep they can be cultivated so deeply
there's almost no end to which you could cultivate your
mind and your intellect most people's minds and intellects are
completely underdeveloped and one of the greatest Joys that I
get Beyond The Awakening and the immortality one of the
greatest Joys that I get the fruits of all this
work that I've done for decades is that I'm in
love with my own mind and my own intelligence I've
cultivated it for three decades to the point where my
mind is like this beautiful exotic alien flower growing in
some Garden perfectly manicured and and like it's just a
beautiful thing to look at and I'm not saying that
to brag or some sort of narcissistic way it's just
that like I myself and am in awe at the
intellect that I've been able to cultivate after three decades
of near daily cultivation it's incredible I would have never
have thought this was possible I sort of just kind
of stumbled into it by accident but I'm telling you
this so that you can do it deliberately see now
you have no excuses you don't need to do it
by accident you can cultivate it deliberately I got so
much joy from that most of my joy in the
in life comes from just dwelling within my own intellect
it's better than sex it's better than making money I've
had plenty of great sex I've I've made millions of
dollars none of that compares to the to the Joy
I get from Simply basking in my own intellect and
that had to be cultivated okay now I'm going to
tell you which philosophies are utterly a waste of your
time meaning they're utterly wrong dualism atheism behaviorism materialism physicalism
realism scientific materialism logical positivism empiricism rationalism libertarianism nihilism absurdism
existentialism and reductionism it's a big list it's also going
to be very controversial a lot of people will debate
me on this um I'm not saying absolutely everything is
wrong it's hard to find a philosophy or worldview where
like literally everything about it is wrong that's pretty rare
but for the most part these are wrong they're they're
wrong in very fundamental ways is what I mean and
then maybe they're right in minor ways now the question
of should you become a professional philosopher Professor or academic
I recommend you don't go into the university system you're
not going to find truth in a university that's not
what the university is designed for the university is designed
for the survival of the University so if you love
philosophy don't become a academic philosopher however if you want
to develop a career of being a philosopher you can
outside the university system like I have it won't be
easy there's quite few slots available you know everyone can't
become a a career philosopher but some of you can
in order to do so you have to offer something
unique something new to the field you can't just regurgitate
what everybody else has said or what I have said
you have to offer you know new insights um you
earn philosophy as a philosopher generating new insights but you
know there's so much to Consciousness and there's so much
to spirituality and there's so much to philosophy that there's
certainly opportunities out there for you if you're endeavoring enough
it's not going to be easy but then again you
know no career and no business is easy all of
them are very competitive for the most part are you
too young to start doing philosophy some people have asked
me this question via email and comment and private message
uh I don't think there's such a thing really I
started questioning reality when I was a kid and certainly
by my teenage years so the problem is not that
you're too young the problem is probably that you're already
too old too late now there's no such thing as
too old but I mean like you've already you're already
behind the curve if you're 15 years old you should
have already been doing this for the last five years
you missed five years you see so go ahead and
get started if you're wondering well Leo am I too
old for philosophy what if I'm 60 years old in
a certain sense the older you get the more important
philosophy gets because you know as you get older you
have less gains you can have from sex and from
materialistic Pursuits from money from career so you know as
you approach your mortality and your death you're gonna have
to face some deep some deep challenging questions about existence
and you have more free time probably if you're older
if you're near retirement age what else you got to
do what else are you gonna do with your life
you're gonna go chase girls you're gonna go chase money
you're gonna go chase Fame probably not at your age
uh philosophy might be one of the most worthwhile things
you can do and eventually of what you want to
get to is you want to you know don't waste
time get real serious about it get very straightforward about
it cut all the [ __ ] and eventually you
know you want to transcend your own death that's the
point and yes you can do that uh what are
the downsides of doing philosophy the downsides are that you
can turn philosophy into a farce where it just becomes
like an echo chamber your mind becomes this massive Echo
chamber and you just you know you feed all of
your own ideas back to yourself and reinforce them and
you construct some kind of ideology and you become some
sort of ideological cult leader [Music] um or you just
got so deluded by your philosophy that you think you
have the truth that you know what the truth is
but actually you haven't awoken and you can waste a
lot of time doing that you can waste a lot
of time reading content Hegel and Descartes and arguing and
debating and and then doing this online you can start
a YouTube channel where you debate and debunk people and
and you know you [ __ ] on atheists or
you [ __ ] on theists and then you [
__ ] on marxists and capitalism whatever you can do
all that and this is just a this would be
very counterproductive and then beyond just you doing that you're
going to suck other people into your own toxic ideology
so be careful of that and also you can neglect
the survival aspects of your life relationships sex business art
more practical stuff you know family life okay here's a
quick list for how to get started with philosophy number
one briefly study all the different philosophies that exist just
in summary so you understand what's out there number two
decide what kind of questions you're most interested in answering
make a list number three start independent contemplation don't read
sit down and actually contemplate number four observe your own
mind at work and make observations and write down new
insights about how your own mind is working number five
be ruthlessly honest with yourself your own biases and your
own deceptions that's it you can get started on philosophy
today today is the best time to start pick one
question that fascinates you the most out of all the
ones that I've talked about sit down on a couch
set a timer for an hour or two and just
contemplate and have maybe a notebook with you so you
can write down some notes but look even taking notes
can be a distraction pure philosophy is not even you
taking notes pure philosophy is you just sitting there with
your eyes closed contemplating some deep question and then if
an Insight arises you write it down and then you
go back into your contemplation it's not just Mindless writing
mindless writing is not proper contemplation you contemplate then you
jot down the fruits of your contemplation then you stop
writing and you contemplate again right so really judge yourself
by the amount of time you spend focused in contemplation
I recommend you start today lastly I'll say that philosophy
requires integrity and embodiment it's not just enough enough to
know a bunch of theory or facts or philosophies it's
not enough to recite the things that I've told you
philosophy must transform you I'm talking about doing philosophy at
such a deep level that you cease to be human
philosophy so deep that you transcend death that's true philosophy
that's serious philosophy as opposed to all other kinds I
want to recommend for you a couple more episodes if
you enjoy this one a very important one and relevant
one to you will be the episode called how to
discover what's true where I guide you through an inquiry
process make sure you watch that one also see my
series called deconstructing the myth of science part one part
two and part three this is some of the most
serious philosophical work that I've published it's extremely profound it
took me decades to achieve the insights that are present
in that series it's really a uh historical work of
philosophy it's for free you can find it on YouTube
watch that that shows you the depth of philosophy that
I do and also the depth of philosophy that you
can do it'll also help you a lot to deconstruct
many of the myths of this you know signs that
have been programmed into your mind help you break free
those and then um lastly I'm working on a new
episode that's going to be talking about this concept called
bootstrapping so remember this word bootstrapping because in the next
few months I'm going to publish my bootstrapping episode which
is going to be very relevant and sort of continue
on and talk about you know fundamental aspects of philosophy
and epistemology that you will be interested in here all
right that's it I'm done here this was a long
one a lot of material here um but this is
like my favorite topic so I had to make it
juicy come check out my website down below you'll find
resources for philosophers there you'll find my blog which has
tons of various philosophical insights and resources that I share
almost on a daily basis these days I put so
much effort into my blog you'd be a fool not
to look at it it's all free you can find
uh my book reviews on my website you can find
the life purpose course I'm going to have future courses
coming out soon I'm working on some profound courses that
will be coming out in the next year subscribe to
the newsletter stay tuned for those those will be through
the website um come check out actualize.org the Forum on
the Forum you can find like-minded people to have philosophical
conversations with you can support me at patreon.com actualized with
donations I thank you for those helps me to stay
independent and uncorrupted by various kinds of corporate and academic
forces and the last thing I'll say is this again
I'm biased but I think that actualize.org is the deepest
source of philosophy you'll ever find on this planet at
this time maybe in the future there'll be something better
but for now I don't think there's anything deeper than
what I've created that was my goal from the outset
hopefully you can appreciate that the majority of people who
stumble upon actualize.org will not appreciate that because they're just
stumbling around on the internet they're not serious philosophers hopefully
a handful of you will understand what's here the value
that is here you have to work this value you
were lucky to find actualize.org but that doesn't mean you're
done this is just the beginning now you have to
actually work it work the things I talk about make
it practical work it for a few decades and you'll
see the amazing results you can get and how profound
this work is you won't even appreciate the depth of
my work until 10 years afterwards 10 years after doing
it then you'll start to understand and my work is
just getting started really I'm working on a new course
a couple of new courses I'm working on a new
book uh really a book which I intend to transform
the world it's going to be one of the most
important works of philosophy in the last thousand years will
be my book I've been working on it for years
now it's a it's a it's still going to take
years to finish maybe five years from now maybe 10
years from now I don't know I have no time
frame on it uh my goal is simply to create
the most powerful work of philosophy that mankind has ever
written that's that's my work with my goal with the
book If I can't do that I won't even publish
a book I'm not interested in just publishing some short
fluffy self-help book this is going to be the deepest
philosophy that there is and in my future upcoming course
I'm going to be teaching some extremely Advanced spiritual stuff
that is beyond anything that any spiritual teacher has ever
taught you I'm going to talk about how to reach
not just Awakening and not just God realization I'm going
to introduce to you a whole new class of Awakening
that I've discovered which is Awakening to alien intelligence that's
going to be very unique as a teaching I have
not seen anybody teaching this I'm not talking about contacting
aliens I'm talking about jailbreaking your mind so profoundly that
your own mind accesses alien consciousness so imagine for a
second that one day mankind will come into contact with
Advanced alien civilizations imagine how much more advanced those aliens
will be in their Consciousness than a human it'll be
like the difference between a mouse and a human will
be the difference between a human and a one of
these aliens but now imagine that you could access that
alien mind now your own mind can turn into that
alien mind imagine that that's even more amazing than talking
to an alien I mean actually becoming that alien experiencing
its mind and its consciousness how is that possible well
that's what my course will help to explain that's the
level that I've reached personally in my own work it's
Way Beyond Awakening I've gone Way Beyond any kind of
normal Awakening or Enlightenment I mean this is insane stuff
that nobody else is going to teach you so I'm
super excited for that I'm still researching this I'm in
the early phases of developing this course but um if
you want to go the deepest with me those of
you who want to go the deepest with me this
is what you're in for this is what you're going
to stick around for this is what's going to really
blow your mind so stay tuned that will come
