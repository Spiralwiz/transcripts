            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FshM0798jeg' target='_blank'>How To Detox Heavy Metals (Lead & Mercury) + DEMO</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Heavy metal detox importance</b>: Understanding the importance of detoxing heavy metals from the body is essential in understanding what the present video is about. Leo Gura shares his personal story detailing his struggle with health problems which were unresolved by mainstream health treatments. These problems included autoimmune conditions, cognitive performance problems, sleeping issues, and unexplained fatigue. His discovery and application of a heavy metal detox protocol dramatically improved his overall well-being. 
</li><li><b>Effects of detox protocol</b>: Gura reports improvements in his sleeping patterns, energy levels, and cognitive performance after completing his heavy metal detox protocol. He gives an example of an odd nerve sensation he experienced in his hand and foot, which was resolved after roughly 10-15 rounds of his detox regimen. However, he emphasizes that the detox protocol may not work identically for everyone or solve all health problems. 
</li><li><b>Who should consider heavy metal detox</b>: People experiencing chronic fatigue, sleep disorders, autoimmune conditions, brain fog, Attention Deficit Disorder, Autism, unexplained headaches, hair loss, Fibromyalgia, cold hands and feet, gut problems, depression, anxiety, low sex drive, anger, irritability, skin problems, dark circles under the eyes, and even cancer may consider trying a heavy metal detox. 
</li><li><b>Cautions on approaching heavy metal detox</b>: There are potential risks and considerations to keep in mind while approaching heavy metal chelation. It's critical to consult doctors, think critically, and consider one's unique health conditions and genetic history. Gura stresses that symptoms or health issues like the aforementioned may have multiple causes, and while heavy metal detox might play a role in alleviating these issues, it may not be a cure-all solution. 
</li><li><b>Overall benefits of detox</b>: Taking care of one's health, including addressing the issue of heavy metal toxicity, forms a critical foundation for personal development work and spiritual progress. He asserts that neglecting this aspect could hinder progress in other parts of life. Gura holds that his heavy metal detox protocol significantly enhanced his capacity to work, achieve personal development, and engage spiritually. 
</li><li><b>Examples of improvement</b>: Notable changes in his health and well-being due to the detox protocol include resolving unusual nerve tingling sensation in his hand and foot, eliminating sleep disorder and chronic fatigue problems, dealing with persistent brain fog and cognitive performance issues, and overall improvement in personal and career life. However, it's important to remember these results are not guaranteed, and individual outcomes may vary. 
</li><li><b>Video's primary aim</b>: The video is aimed at raising awareness regarding heavy metal toxicity and its potential impacts on health. It also provides a detailed, step-by-step heavy metal detox protocol based on Gura's personal success and experiences. The hope is to educate and empower indivduals experiencing unresolved health issues, possibly due to heavy metal toxicity, and to motivate them to explore this angle further for potential holistic improvement in their health and well-being.
</li><li><b>Sources of Heavy Metal Toxicity</b>: Heavy metal toxicity can emerge from varied sources such as heavy industry, mining, manufacturing, electronics, and more. Significant pollutants include lead, mercury, and arsenic which can infiltrate the environment, impacting bodies of water and soil. This can then affect plant life which is consumed by humans. Heavy metal toxicity is a slow process and can result in gradual declines in one's mental and physical health.
</li><li><b>Major Contributors to Heavy Metal Toxicity</b>: Key contributors to heavy metal contamination include dentistry (from metal amalgam fillings), food, seafood, water supply (from lead pipes), paint, fluorescent lights, makeup, spices, supplements, and protein powders.
</li><li><b>Effects of Chronic Heavy Metal Exposure</b>: Chronic exposure to small amounts of heavy metals can have profound impacts on human health, causing depression, irritability, cognitive and memory decline, reduced sex drive and performance, skin problems, and gut issues. This exposure often happens subtly and is easily written off as age-related decline.
</li><li><b>Unaddressed Impacts of Heavy Metal Toxicity</b>: The extensive impacts of heavy metal toxicity are not yet fully understood and are not often recognized as the root source of many health issues. Traditional medicine, while beneficial for some ailments, does not address the core issue of detoxification in heavy metal toxicity cases.
</li><li><b>Regulation and Awareness of Heavy Metals</b>: Countries have regulations in place to control heavy metal exposure, but these often fall short in practice. Awareness about heavy metal toxicity and its effects is also limited, partially due to this being a long-term health issue rather than a short-term, acute condition.
</li><li><b>Correlation between Heavy Metal Exposure and Crime</b>: Studies have linked heavy metal exposure to cognitive issues, such as impaired impulse regulation and decreased general intelligence. For example, higher blood lead levels have been associated with increases in violent crime rates in certain geographical areas, demonstrating the far-reaching effects of heavy metal toxicity.
</li><li><b>Potential Role in Autoimmune Disorders</b>: Heavy metal exposure could potentially contribute to immune disorders and other subtle health conditions that may not be immediately recognized or treated.
</li><li><b>Hidden factors causing health disorders</b>: Leo suggests that there may be hidden factors, not yet extensively researched by current science, that might be causing various health disorders. Some of the symptoms and conditions that might be attributed to heavy metal toxicity include mood swings, nervousness, insomnia, muscle weakness, learning disorders, memory loss, fatigue, and autoimmune disorders.
</li><li><b>Genetic susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity</b>: Leo explains that the body's capability to detox heavy metals naturally varies based on genetics. He mentions the MTHFR gene and various methylation pathways that determine one's susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity. He recommends conducting genetic tests like 23AndMe to understand one's specific mutations and susceptibility.
</li><li><b>Testing for heavy metal toxicity</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of testing for heavy metal toxicity before starting detox. He introduces the provoked urine test as the most reliable method. The test kit, ordered online, includes a supplement called DMSA, which triggers the release of heavy metals in the body. The user then collects urine over a three-hour period for lab testing. This helps determine the amount of heavy metals being excreted.
</li><li><b>Use of DMSA for provoked urine test</b>: The provoked urine test requires the ingestion of a fairly large quantity of a supplement called DMSA. DMSA is consumed, followed by a lot of water over the next three hours, during which all urine is collected. The accumulated urine, indicative of heavy metal excretion, is then sent to the lab for testing. 
</li><li><b>How to conduct a urine test for heavy metal toxicity</b>: Using the at-home test kit, you consume the DMSA supplement and then collect your urine for three hours. The collected urine sample is then sent back to the lab for testing. The test results will reveal the level of heavy metal toxicity in your body.
</li><li><b>How many urine tests to take before starting detox protocols</b>: Leo Lura recommends conducting two urine tests for heavy metal toxicity before starting any detox protocols.
</li><li><b>Heavy Metals Test Procedures</b>: Baseline for the test is established with an unprovoked urine test, measuring the amount of heavy metals being excreted naturally. A second test is then conducted with a dose of DMSA, a supplement that triggers the release of heavy metals. The appropriate dosage is calculated based on body weight, with an example provided being 18 100mg pills for a 170-pound individual.
</li><li><b>Risks and Rewards of Testing</b>: The provoked test can stimulate the body to release stored heavy metals, potentially causing harm. However, this test is seen as the most reliable way to determine toxicity levels, despite its inherent risk.
</li><li><b>Understanding Test Results</b>: Test results demonstrate toxin levels excreted over a three-hour window, not stored amounts in organs. To gauge these stored toxins, multiple rounds of chelation are required, followed by repeated tests to monitor changes. 
</li><li><b>Limitations and Criticisms of Government Authorities</b>: The safe levels of heavy metals put forth by the FDA and EPA are called into question, with lack of rigorous enforcement and potential industry influence highlighted as concerns.
</li><li><b>Importance and Challenge of Detox</b>: Detoxification is recognized as essential for optimal cognitive performance and overall health, however urinary tests only indicate excreted heavy metals. Hence, ongoing chelation is required to gauge the levels accurately. Implied here is the importance of personal responsibility in managing one's health rather than relying solely on institutional guidance. 
</li><li><b>Significance of Detoxification Protocols</b>: A round of chelation, typically lasting 3-4 days, is followed by urine testing to determine effectiveness. The process is repeated until test results show minimal heavy metals excretion. Any delay or interruption in the chelation process can hinder detox efforts, highlighting the importance of commitment and consistency during detox. 
</li><li><b>Important Note on Chelation</b>: Chelation should not be started if there is an active exposure to heavy metals or if the individual has metal fillings. These cases can result in an increased leaching of heavy metals into the organs, potentially causing damage. Fillings must be removed prior to starting chelation and a certain period must pass after the last heavy metal exposure before initiating the detox process.
</li><li><b>Chelation Protocol</b>: Leo suggests a specific chelation protocol for heavy metal detoxification. It involves taking supplements such as DMSA and alpha lipoic acid at regular intervals over three to four days, even during sleeping hours, due to their half-life. In addition to DMSA and alpha lipoic acid, he also includes additional support supplements like vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc picolinate, and magnesium citrate throughout the day.
</li><li><b>Importance of Consistent Dosages</b>: The half-lives of the supplements imply the necessity to take them at regular intervals (every three or four hours) for effective detoxification. Negligence in maintaining schedule can lead to redistribution of heavy metals in the body causing further damage.
</li><li><b>Recovery Period</b>: Apart from the dosage and half-life aspect, Leo mentions the importance of maintaining a recovery period where the body can rest and alleviate potential side effects. A typical chelation round includes three to four days of taking supplements followed by four to seven days of rest. The number of rounds depends on the individual's level of toxicity.
</li><li><b>Adjust Dosage Based on Body Weight and Tolerance Level</b>: Dosages should be calculated based on body weight and tolerance level, and gradual increment is suggested mainly for alpha lipoic acid. This is due to its potential to cause sever detox symptoms as it leeches out heavy metals from the brain. It is generally suggested to start with a low dosage and gradually increase it.
</li><li><b>Combination of Supplements</b>: The combination of DMSA or DMPS in combination with alpha lipoic acid is preferred. The dosage schedule should be designed according to the supplement with the shortest half-life. 
</li><li><b>Other Factors</b>: Supplements are organized into pill boxes and timers are used to ensure strict adherence to the schedule. It is recommended not to take substances like chlorella, spirulina, cilantro, and alpha lipoic acid as daily supplements, as they can redistribute heavy metals in unknown ways in the body.
</li><li><b>Patience and slow steady progress in chelation process</b>: Leo underscores the importance of patience in the heavy metal detoxification process, discouraging the temptation to rush for quick results. The goal is slow, steady, and sustainable progress rather than sharp up-and-down experiences marked by severe side effects from taking large doses of detoxing agents. A gradual increase in dosage after covering four rounds is suggested if there is no severe discomfort.
</li><li><b>Using pillboxes for effective and regular chelation</b>: Leo discusses his method of organizing chelation chemicals and supporting supplements in labeled pillboxes. Each box represents a three-hour period for consumption of the respective pills. This helps ensure regular and timely intake of necessary supplements and offers an organized system to manage the process around the day.
</li><li><b>Introduction to various chelating agents and arranging them in pillboxes</b>: Leo presents the main chelating agents, DMSA and DMPS, alongside alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), which are used in the chelation process. He also introduces the supporting supplements taken during detox, including Vitamin C, Zinc Picolinate, Vitamin E, and Magnesium Citrate, which aid in reducing any potential detox symptoms. Leo arranges these supplements in pillboxes, marking each box to denote the three-hour interval at which it needs to be consumed.
</li><li><b>Adjusting doses to manage side effects and keeping track of progress</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of a gradual increase in dosage after completing four rounds of chelation if the user experiences no severe discomfort. If severe detox symptoms occur during the process, Leo recommends reducing the dose. 
</li><li><b>Using a digital timer for strict adherence to the detox schedule</b>: Leo discusses the use of a high-quality digital timer to ensure strict adherence to the three-hour supplement intake schedule during each round of detoxification. This assists in making the protocol effortless and manageable alongside daily activities, including during sleep hours.
</li><li><b>Verifying the safety and efficacy of chelating agents used in the protocol</b>: Leo reassures viewers about the safety of the chelating agents, DMSA, DMPS, and ALA, citing existing scientific studies to back their efficacy and safety. However, he also emphasizes that while these chemicals are safe, the heavy metals these molecules mobilize in the body for detoxification are not, thus emphasizing the need for a serious and careful approach to the detox protocol. 
</li><li><b>Likely barrier to supervision by traditional doctors</b>: Leo shares the difficulty in finding adequate supervision from traditional doctors, as many may not be knowledgeable about this protocol. Leo urges viewers to take personal responsibility for researching and managing their heavy metal detox.
</li><li><b>Chelation Process and Doctor Consultation</b>: As per Leo, most traditional doctors will not have detailed knowledge about the chelation process and the safest protocol must be self-studied. It takes extensive research which isn't typically taught to traditional doctors. The number of detox rounds required is inflexible and depends on the individual's toxicity levels. Side effects during detox could vary from fatigue, depression, sleepiness, brain fog, mood disturbances to sleeping problems which indicate detox is taking place. If the side effects are not bearable, it suggests the dosage is too high and needs adjustment. Every 10-20 rounds of chelation, re-testing is recommended to track progress. 
</li><li><b>Pros and Cons of Chelation Chemicals</b>: Each chelation chemical has different affinities for certain heavy metals. DMSA is effective for detoxing lead, less effective for mercury but it does detox cadmium, antimony, and arsenic. DMPS is more effective against mercury, less effective for lead but detoxes arsenic, nickel, and antimony. Alpha lipoic acid is most effective against mercury and also detoxes arsenic and cadmium. It is the only chemical that crosses the blood-brain barrier to detox heavy metals from the brain. It's recommended to start with DMSA or DMPS and add alpha lipoic acid after 6-12 months of chelation. 
</li><li><b>Medical Community and Chelation</b>: While these protocols have been used by medical researchers and doctors, traditionally not all doctors may support this detox process. The traditional medical industry tends to be conservative and wary of new, cutting-edge protocols or methods that aren't fully established. Many doctors are influenced by insurance companies and may not prioritize alternative treatments. Therefore, Leo advises taking personal responsibility for health optimization. He also points out that not all advice from a traditional doctor is accurate. A lot of traditional doctors are just interested in treating most severe conditions and aren't well versed with conditions like brain fog, chronic fatigue, skin conditions, etc. 
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility for Health</b>: In conclusion, Leo maintains that while professional medical advice should not be ignored, the individual must also take some responsibility for their health, particularly when it comes to optimizing it and treating conditions that traditional medical practice doesn't fully understand. It's essential to do your own research and take a proactive approach to health and wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Research and personal responsibility for health</b>: Leo urges viewers to do their own research and take full responsibility for their health as doctors may not be able to dedicate enough time to diagnose every single cause of health problems. 
</li><li><b>Use of natural methods verse chemical methods for heavy metal detox</b>: Leo warns against the use of natural methods like cilantro, chlorella, spirulina, activated charcoal, zeolite, juicing, and saunas for heavy metal detox as they might not be as effective or scientifically proven like DMSA, DMPS, and alpha lipoic acid. 
</li><li><b>Safe and effective detox methods</b>: Leo advocates for the use of DMSA, DMPS, and alpha lipoic acid, as they are proven to safely and effectively chelate heavy metals (bond tightly and fully excrete them from the body).
</li><li><b>Validation of detox protocols</b>: Leo suggests individuals validate detox protocols by looking up studies on PubMed or google specifically for phrases like "DMSA mercury and lead detox" or "chelation". 
</li><li><b>Prospective candidates for detox</b>: Individuals suffering from chronic health conditions like chronic fatigue, brain fog, cognitive performance problems, focus issues, memory problems, sleep problems, depression, anxiety, and otherwise untreatable health problems are encouraged to consider heavy metal detox.
</li><li><b>Multi-level factors contributing to health problems</b>: Health problems occur due to a multitude of factors such as poor diet, lifestyle, genetics, environmental toxins, food sensitivities, and even mental well-being. Addressing health issues requires understanding and taking care of each contributing layer - from physical chemical to lifestyle and spiritual. 
</li><li><b>Importance of correct diagnosis</b>: Leo highlights the importance of correctly diagnosing the layer of the problem. Misattribution of an issue to the wrong layer could hinder the path of improvement. For example, depression could be resulting from lead-contaminated water rather than being a spiritual problem. The key lies in experimentation to understand what suits an individual's body best.
</li><li><b>Heavy Metal Detox Protocols Need to Be Customized</b>: Leo emphasizes that detox solutions must be tailored to each individual's needs, requiring hours of research and experimentation.
</li><li><b>Preventative Measures After Detox</b>: He suggests regular rounds of detox every few years to eliminate trace amounts of heavy metals from our diet and environment. Key preventative measures include drinking only reverse osmosis water, avoiding seafood and organ meats, and being cautious with supplements, spices, and protein powders. 
</li><li><b>Hidden Sources of Heavy Metals</b>: He warns about the concentration of heavy metals in powders, store-bought bone broths, baby food, and certain spices (especially oregano and thyme). Exposure to heavy metals could have negative health impacts, particularly on children, pets, and people around construction sites or highways.
</li><li><b>Makeup and Lighting</b>: Heavy metals can be present in makeup products and inhaled from fluorescent lighting. He advises using products free of heavy metals and replacing fluorescent lighting with LED lights.
</li><li><b>Cost of Chelation Therapy</b>: Leo outlines that a single round of DMSA detox will cost around $45, with total costs for 30 rounds equaling roughly $1,350. These costs include the purchase of detox supplements, urine tests, and supportive literature.
</li><li><b>Cost of heavy metal detoxification</b>: Conducting 15-20 rounds of chelation therapy, including urine tests and supplements, will cost approximately $1000. Leo Gura argues that the price is justified, stating that slight improvements to cognitive performance, sleep quality, or any other health-related benefits are worth the investment. 
</li><li><b>Chelation as preventative healthcare</b>: Chelation has potential in preventing severe health crises, reducing the risk of cancers possibly caused by long-term build-up of toxins and heavy metals in the body. Implementing chelation therapy early on could prevent costly and emotionally draining treatments such as chemotherapy. 
</li><li><b>Chelation for treating Autism in children</b>: Chelation therapy can be utilized in treating children, adjusting dosages accordingly to their weight. While it cannot guarantee a cure for conditions like Autism, it can help alleviate symptoms and improve conditions with consistent application. Anecdotal evidence from a practicing doctor showed positive results from the application of heavy metal detox.
</li><li><b>Potential factors contributing to Autism and ADD</b>: Leo Gura speculates a combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to Autism and ADD, which are seeing epidemic-like rates. Food industry practices and environmental pollution are outlined as factors contributing toward the disorders, starting as early as in the womb.
</li><li><b>Cost-benefit analysis of chelation</b>: For approximately $1000, you could invest in a tool that could improve cognitive performances, sleep patterns, and memory. It could also potentially treat health problems like hair loss or acne. Not to mention, it could assist in preventing the occurrence of more serious health issues such as cancer.
</li><li><b>Long-term investment in health</b>: Chelation therapy has been suggested as a long-term investment in health. Assuming good practice and correct implementation, the therapy could be used from childhood into adulthood, becoming part of a regular health protocol. Advocating a preventative approach, it aims to avoid severe health problems down the line. 
</li><li><b>Importance of consistency and commitment in chelation therapy</b>: Implementing chelation therapy requires a long-term commitment. Initiation may require some effort and learning, but it becomes a simple and manageable process over time. However, consistency is key to gain the full potential of the protocol.
</li><li><b>Chelation therapy as a tool for health</b>: While not a magic cure-all, chelation therapy is a tool for addressing health issues and used as part of a larger plan in health management. It should also be investigated as part of any health troubleshooting exercise. 
</li><li><b>Individual responsibility in health management</b>: Proper implementation of chelation therapy requires adequate research, understanding the process, recognizing dangers, and committing to a long-term vision. The individual is encouraged to treat this as an investment in their own health. 
</li><li><b>Accessibility of chelation therapy supplements</b>: While DMSA and DMPS might be inaccessible in some regions, such as the U.S, due to regulations, they can still be purchased from overseas. Countries like Canada, South Africa, and the UK have these supplements easily accessible with high quality guaranteed. Alpha Lipoic Acid is even more accessible, available in any supplement store or on Amazon.
</li><li><b>Heavy metal chelation idea recall</b>: Leo shares that he had forgotten to engage in his most recent rounds of chelation due to being preoccupied with other aspects of life. He also cites negative side effects from recent rounds as another reason. He eventually remembered and decided to resume protocol, encouraging listeners who experience negative side effects to consider them as signals that the detox is working rather than to stop the process.
</li><li><b>Precaution and rare case mention</b>: He cautions viewers against taking unreasonably large doses of the alphalipoic acid and DMSA, recounting a rare case where an individual accidentally inhaled a large quantity of alphalipoic acid and experienced severe side effects due to his existing high toxicity levels, tragically leading to his suicide.
</li><li><b>Traditional doctor perspective challenge</b>: Leo argues that traditional doctors may dismiss heavy metal toxicity, linking this to their deep involvement with insurance companies. He emphasizes his own positive experiences with chelation as a counterpoint to such dismissals.
</li><li><b>Non-medical advice disclaimer</b>: He stresses that the information provided is not medical advice and adds that listeners should use their own judgement to decide what is right for them. 
</li><li><b>Underlying health issues impede self-actualization and spirituality</b>: Leo argues that underlying health issues including the level of toxicity in the brain and body, can hinder self-actualization and spiritual progress. He attributes his own improvements in mental clarity and psychedelic experiences to the lifting of brain fog after chelation.
</li><li><b>Clean brain necessity for spiritual progress</b>: He emphasizes the importance of having a 'clean' (non-toxic) brain for spiritual growth and accuses some spiritual teachers of not acknowledging this. 
</li><li><b>Health responsibility encouragement</b>: Leo concludes by encouraging his viewers to take responsibility for their health, highlighting its crucial role in self-actualization and spiritual progress.
