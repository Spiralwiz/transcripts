hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm doing an enlightenment FAQ I'm going to answer
and address some of the most common questions that people
have about spiritual alignment and because there are so many
questions this is going to be part one of a
multiple part series this video is intended for folks who
have watched my other videos introducing and talking about spiritual
enlightenment so if you don't know what that is and
you probably want to go watch those first because this
is not going to make much sense to you but
if you watch those initial videos and you've been following
along then you've probably got a lot of questions about
what spiritual alignment actually is and you have a bunch
of objections and you're not quite clear about what the
ramifications are of pursuing spiritual alignment in your life one
of the real tricks about pursuing spiritual enlightenment is that
it's it's hard to get serious about the journey until
you kind of understand where it's going to take you
and what it's going to mean for your life and
this is difficult because your ego will concoct all sorts
of stories about what spiritual alignment will mean and a
lot of these stories are false and so what I
thought would be really valuable is to go through in
a no-nonsense way and just clearly address all the most
common concerns all the most common concerns that I hear
you people out there who learn about this stuff for
the first time having all the common concerns that I've
had when I first learned about this and even to
this day as I'm still learning more and more I'm
getting more and more my questions answered and what I
find is that when you get these questions answered then
you're able to go off and take this pursuit a
little bit more seriously and also just kind of calms
you down because a lot of the objections and fears
that you have will be addressed here in some of
these questions that I'm going to answer there's a lot
of these questions this is a very nuanced subject right
you have to be very careful about your mind jumping
to conclusions about what the truth of no self means
your mind will tend to want to jump to extreme
conclusions and turn this Enlightenment thing into this black and
white but it's not black and white it's a very
big gray area and so we have to tread carefully
and use subtlety and nuance and intelligent thinking and reasoning
to think about this stuff all right so let's just
go ahead and jump right into it so the first
thing that people say after they hear the truth of
no self is something along the lines of okay l√©o
so I understand that there is no self I've watched
your videos you've told me that there is no self
I understand it now I accept it what's the big
deal I'm there right I got it I got what
you're saying and the fact is that you don't got
it you got to understand that enlightenment is an experience
of what we're talking about here so the truth of
no self just saying it to you and you understanding
it logically intellectually philosophically theoretically doesn't count for pretty much
anything in this work so the big deal is that
it's totally different just theorizing about spiritual enlightenment and this
idea that you don't exist and actually living from that
place right you got to share this that you can
live from this place where you actually live realizing that
you are not a real physical entity in reality you're
merged with everyone else and everything else in reality so
this is a huge profound deep shift in the way
that you live your life so just because you understand
what I told you in one of my videos that's
not good enough that just that's just like an interesting
little fact that you now can tell to your friends
but the big deal here is that now you got
to go and actually look for the perience personally gotta
find it right it's almost like the difference between talking
about being a millionaire we can talk about it all
day long but unless you actually become a millionaire you're
not going to experience what it's like to be a
millionaire you can't use the money until you actually acquire
it so it's kind of the same thing here we're
just talking about being lightened which is not the same
thing as actually being enlightened so this is a very
very big difference that you have to understand all right
because if you don't understand this and you're not going
to undertake the journey to study this stuff deeper and
then all you got is you got some mental masturbation
going on you're just thinking about this stuff but you're
not experiencing it you're not feeling it and we're not
doing this journey so that we have some cool theories
that we can tell our friends we're doing this because
we want a real shift in the way that we
live our lives we want a real shift in the
way that we perceive life in our emotional well-being in
our psychology in our relationships in every aspect of life
we want a big shift so until you get that
shift don't assume that you've got it the next question
that some people have is well Leo if the truth
of no self is so simple if the truth is
literally that there is no self and that all that
there is is these perceptions and reality then how come
I can't see it shouldn't it just be obvious like
you say if it's so obvious why can't I just
understand it and see it like instantly why do I
have to spend a thousand hours looking and searching well
this is a really interesting question it turns out that
your entire psyche has been constructed from the point where
you were born and enculturated and raised by your family
and grew up in this culture that your entire environment
has shaped your psychology in such a way that your
psychology is prevented from seeing it even though you can
logically understand it and there is this very big difference
between logically standing it and actually seeing it so why
can't you see it well because for you to see
it you would have to give up your notions of
self you can't just say ok I understand now because
what we're doing here is we're kind of undermining the
whole paradigm of understanding the way that you traditionally understand
subjects in life enlightenment is the antithesis of that and
that's a very uh kind of counterintuitive and unorthodox way
to look at life you've never looked at life this
way before so what's required here is a drastic paradigm
shift it's kind of like looking at an optical illusion
and then seeing it flip right and in a sense
it almost happens automatically like you can't force it and
probably the problem here is that your psyche doesn't want
to see this so in fact a lot of the
things that you do in your life are actively designed
without you knowing it they're actively designed to prevent the
seeing of this truth so what this means is that
we actually have to go in there and dig deep
into your psychology we have to unwire a lot of
preconceived notions and beliefs things you were taught from a
very young age and when you're taught things at a
very young age they tend to just sear into your
mind without you questioning them right in the same way
that a religion is indoctrinated into a child's mind if
he's very young and then it's really hard to get
that religion out it's just seared in there because the
mind is very very receptive and sensitive and just absorbs
everything like a sponge when it's young well in the
same way what was fed to you when you were
young is this idea that you exist in that you're
this personal entity who's experiencing life so to undo that
takes quite a lot of work it can take a
staggering almost all inspiring amount of work to unwire all
that stuff alright this is just how your brain and
your mind tends to function so have to appreciate that
to do this investigation properly the next question people that
ask is okay leo so you're saying that there is
no self so does this mean that we live in
a matrix like the movie The Matrix and the answer
is no we're not saying that you're living in a
matrix think about it what did the movie The Matrix
really tell us it said that we're living like in
a computer simulation and that everything that we're experiencing all
these sensations when you're looking at my face and I'm
looking at the camera all this stuff that's happening well
the matrix says that none of that is real that's
just like a like data pumped into our mind by
a computer and that you can somehow break out of
this matrix and then go into reality in etc etc
etc right well that's not what we're saying here in
fact what we're saying is kind of the inverse of
the matrix it's actually more freaky and more counterintuitive than
the matrix what we're saying is that imagine that the
movie the matrix what happened was that the matrix Excel
itself was real but the person who is supposedly stuck
inside the matrix that that's a fiction and what you
do is to break out of the matrix you realize
that you're not existing at all but the matrix itself
exists so to speak right the external world exists it's
that you as a personal entity don't exist much more
counterintuitive and freaky much more interesting much more intellectually fascinating
much more paradoxical than just breaking out of the matrix
and it's not that we're saying that your physical body
doesn't exist your physical body exists it's part of the
phenomenal world what we're saying is that the thing that
you think is controlling and looking at the physical body
and sensing the physical body that that entity that you
call you that that entity doesn't exist right so it's
subtle it's it's very subtle point you have to start
to go from the black and white to this gray
subtlety the other question that a lot of people ask
is okay Leo so then is what you're saying is
that reality is just an illusion is that what you're
saying and the answer to this is no we're not
saying that reality is an illusion reality we're saying in
fact is real it exists what you're seeing exists all
the physical objects that are in your awareness those exist
what we're saying is that there's not a you who's
looking at those objects whose perceiving those objects so those
objects are not the illusion what the illusion is is
the you that you think is looking at those objects
that does not make the objects unreal that makes you
unreal right this is all about you it's not so
much about the external world the next question that people
have is Leo you talk about enlightenment as being something
other than religion or philosophy how is this different than
religion or philosophy isn't it the same and the answer
is that it's very very different what religion is and
philosophy is these are systems of thinking about reality they
make certain factual claims about what reality is and how
it works they give you certain explanations and justifications and
it's basically a model of reality that's what a religion
is that's what a philosophy is some of them seem
better than others some of them seem more true than
others some of them seem somewhat reasonable others seem very
ludicrous and and far out there and crazy and it's
very easy to confuse enlightenment as just another wacky crazy
philosophy or religion but it's not it's really the antithesis
of religion and philosophy and if you think that science
is what is the antithesis of religion and philosophy well
I got news for you it's actually not size is
closer to religion and philosophy than it is to enlightenment
so how can this be and what is enlightenment actually
if it's not a religion or philosophy we'll see enlightenment
is not a model it's not thinking about reality it's
not theorizing it's not putting justifications out there it's not
trying to make sense of reality it's simply being reality
being one with reality itself without mental chatter the common
thread between religion philosophy and science is that there's a
lot of theory building and mental chatter all the time
you notice it that whenever you're thinking about religion or
philosophy or science you have to be thinking right and
thinking is an active process so what's the opposite of
thinking it's not thinking now when I say this it
sounds a little bit simplistic and you're like well not
thinking not thinking is not a good thing thinking is
the way that we progress thinking is the way that
we find truth well that's exactly the paradigm that we're
questioning here what if thinking wasn't the proper way for
finding truth and that thinking in fact was separating you
from truth could that be possible you have to start
to open your mind to that possibility once you do
and you kind of distance yourself from thinking and you
start to do a meditation you sort of do some
of these guided enlightenment meditations that that I want to
put out there I put a couple of outcome I
probably put one out there so far I'm going to
put out some more so what you're going to realize
is that oh there's something extremely powerful about just being
silent being totally silent and not thinking and that in
fact stopping thinking is very very difficult the mind wants
to rationalize the mind wants to build theories the mind
wants to claim certain facts about reality and is very
difficult to stop the mind when you do stop the
mind something very powerful happens basically you become enlightened so
it's a very very very different thing than just another
religion or another philosophy now the trick is that you
can certainly take enlightenment and turn it into a religion
or turn it into a philosophy and that's something that
I'm mmm that's why I'm picking my words very carefully
when I do these enlightenment videos I have to be
very careful about what I say because I could easily
say something that will get people to think of this
as a philosophy or a theory or a religion and
what that does is that defeats the whole purpose right
and this is the whole problem with the egos that
the ego tends to want to theorize about everything he
doesn't want to actually see what's actually there it wants
to theorize about instead even within science the mind theorizes
it can't just look at something objectively so the process
of enlightenment is just the process of removing all the
filters the beliefs the preconceived notions the theories that you
have about reality so that you can actually melt into
reality and when you finally melt into it then you
become reality itself and that is something that either religion
or philosophy nor science can offer you it's a very
powerful life altering experience the next question is Leo isn't
this nihilism isn't what you're really talking about nihilism and
the answer is no it's not nihilism at all nihilism
is a philosophical system and what nihilism says in a
nutshell is something along the lines of life is pointless
there is no importance attached to one thing over another
thing so everything is basically neutral and everything is pointless
so you might as well just not do anything in
life there's nothing to believe about life that's what nihilism
says well nihilism is not enlightenment because nihilism is a
philosophy nihilism is a way of thinking about reality enlightenment
is a way of not thinking about reality at all
there are certain superficial parallels between but one of the
key differences is that nihilism tends to lead to this
dark bleak outlook on reality as though like reality is
meaningless and purposelessness is in purposeless therefore you can you
should be depressed and kind of sad because there's no
point to living that's kind of the dark nihilism enlightenment
is actually a light very positive realization because what you
realize with enlightenment is that yes there is no point
and there is no meaning to life but this is
actually a very positive and great thing because the fact
that there is no meaning to life itself has no
meaning the problem with the nihilists that he attaches a
dark meaning to the fact that there is no meaning
the enlightened person he's not doing any mental masturbation it
doesn't matter in his mind that there is no meaning
because you're just reality reality just exists for its own
sake and this is a very beautiful realization even though
when you look at it from a distance it seems
kind of scary and it seems dark it's actually not
dark at all another question that people sometimes ask me
is well Li do you keep selling saying that you
know religion the philosophies that these are offering stories about
reality but aren't you in this video and all the
other enlightenment videos also giving us your story so how
come your story is true while all the other ones
are false it's like you're taking um you're taking some
sort of authority or precedence over your own story and
this is the extremely tricky aspect of enlightenment work is
that everything that I'm communicating to you yes it's just
a story it's just another belief for you right but
you got to see that what I'm trying to communicate
to you is not that you should accept my story
but that you should go off for yourself and find
what I'm trying to hint at with the story right
we're using language and we're using thought to communicate this
to you why because the only thing that you really
understand and know how to work with is thought you're
stuck in a mental prison of thought so for me
to communicate this to you how can I do it
I can only do it through going inside and using
the flawed mental models that you are under we have
to go inside your mental cage so think of it
kind of like this imagine that you're stuck inside the
matrix like in the movie The Matrix you're stuck inside
the matrix and now I have to come and rescue
you and I'm outside the matrix how do I rescue
you if I'm outside and you're inside well I have
to actually get inside the matrix and I have to
use the falseness of the matrix to tell you about
the fact that the matrix is false so that then
you can break out but the danger is is that
if I come inside the matrix and I tell you
hey everything here is false you have to recognize that
oh yes everything years false and everything he's saying and
he himself is also false he's not real because he's
just part of the matrix if I get outside the
matrix then I can see what's actually real and so
it's kind of analogous to that with what we're doing
here right I'm using language and communication here because stories
is what you understand the danger is that you will
take what I'm saying as another belief system and you're
going to turn into a philosophy or a theory and
you're going to stay stuck in the matrix to break
out what you need to do is you got to
say okay what is he actually pointing to all these
words they're just words there's no truth here in the
words what's he actually pointing to what's he trying to
communicate between the lines let me read between the lines
and see and then go out go out and actually
do the thing that he's hinting at and see what
happens right so it takes intelligence and subtlety on your
part to understand this communication if you want to be
black and white and you want to be very simplistic
what you're going to do is you're gonna say well
Leo everything you're saying to me is just another story
every story's just story so if what you're saying is
that every story is false your own story is false
and therefore nothing mad and so therefore I'm not going
to do what you say and I'm just going to
say stuck in my current paradigm but if you do
that what that is is that that's you getting lost
in your mental prison it's like you're a prisoner and
I can't come tell you hey here's the key to
breakout you look at the key and you look at
you say this key this key can't possibly work this
is a [ __ ] key and you throw it
away when in fact it was the real key but
because you didn't you didn't have the belief enough and
kind of the wisdom enough to see that this key
could break you free you don't actually try and use
it and in not using it you don't break out
so be very careful about this trap this is a
very very common trap next question okay leo so if
I become enlightened will this make me strong and powerful
like I'm doing personal development to become really strong and
powerful in my life will enlightenment help me become the
strongest self and this is an interesting answer the answer
is yes and the answer is no it's yes in
the sense that what will happen is that you're going
to be free of your mental prison you're going to
be free of the thoughts that limit you and you're
going to be free of the crippling emotions that sabotage
you and this is the number one problem that people
face in life no matter in what area whether relationships
are business or money or health or anything is the
emotional and mental blocks that they have so you're going
to be free of those to a large degree and
that will make you strong and powerful but the other
answer here is that it's not going to make you
strong and powerful why not well the person that asks
this question will this make me strong and powerful that's
an egoic question notice that you're asking about well will
I be strong and powerful the question is why do
you want to be strong and powerful and you also
have to realize that the you that wants to be
strong and powerful this you is an illusion it doesn't
exist this is the matrix that we're talking about so
there is no you to become strong and powerful you're
not going to gain magical superpowers why because there's no
you to control anything so it's not actually possible in
reality for you to have any power or strength at
all so in a sense what we're going to do
is we're going to strip you of all the power
and strength that you perceive that you currently have we're
going to strip you of all of it and this
is why it's going to be very emotionally difficult for
you because you don't want to relinquish your strength and
your power you want more of it not less of
it but counter-intuitively what happens is that if we succeed
and stripping you of all your strength in all your
notions of power and you finally surrender to the fact
that you have no strength and no power at all
that becomes the greatest strength of all it sounds like
paradox and it kind of is a paradox but this
is just how it works this is just how it
works so if you're going in this with this ego
trip mentality of you know wanting more control over other
people or whatever you're not going to get that you're
not going to dominate the world through enlightenment but what
you will get is you will get peace tranquility and
an inner power not an outer power where you get
to dominate other people but an inner power where you
get to relinquish your sense of self so that in
a sense you've conquered yourself and that's the greatest powerful
all is the power to conquer yourself the next question
is Leo what about freewill are you saying I don't
have free will if so it's obvious that I do
have free will well in fact what we are saying
is that you do not have free will why do
you not have free will because you do not exist
there is no such entity as a you who can
exert will on the material world this is the one
of the most bitter peels that you have to swallow
with enlightenment is this idea right here and I didn't
want to accept it for a long time and I'm
still very resistant to it but the more and more
that I pursue this inquiry the more obvious it becomes
that actually free will does not exist what exists is
the illusion of free will and so a big part
of the Enlightenment inquiry is breaking down this illusion of
free will that you have because one of the biggest
ways in which you prevent yourself from seeing the truth
of no self is by telling yourself constantly that you're
in control of your life and that you have control
of your hands and your feet and your mouth and
your thoughts and your eyes and everything else in your
life that you have controlled this stuff but the fact
is that you don't how can this be the case
that you don't what you think that you do well
because what the ego does and it's a master at
this is that the ego claims control and responsibility for
things that do not belong to it that's the whole
game that the ego plays this is the whole deception
is that your entire life you've been telling yourself in
your head you've been building this a giant story that
you are this entity that gets to control everything and
look at everything and experience everything and what turns out
to be the case is that this is just false
it seems so obvious but it's exactly because it seems
so obvious that you've never seen the truth before because
it doesn't even occur to you to question the fact
that you could not be in control that there is
no one inside to be controlling this stuff this one
is tricky this point is tricky I'll have other videos
that go deeper into this idea of freewill I'm not
going to really prove it to you here but basically
what you do if you want to prove this to
yourself is you can actually sit down in a meditative
type state and you can start to look for evidence
of whether in fact you are able to control your
thoughts the question is who is controlling your thoughts is
it you or is it something else and what you're
going to discover if you sit down very carefully but
this takes a lot of practice so don't think that
you can discover this in one day this takes months
and years of work you sit down in a meditative
state very carefully you try to silence the monkey chatter
and you look and you look for evidence of where
the thoughts come from who's controlling thoughts and my controlling
thoughts wait a minute what am I aren't I also
a thought where did I come from if I'm a
thought did the thought I create the thought I or
did something else and what turns out to be the
case that you can actually through first-hand experience come to
an understanding of where thoughts come from and what turns
out to be the case that they don't come from
you because you don't exist but you're not going to
fully appreciate this until you actually become enlightened the next
question that people have is okay Leo so if all
this is the case then what's the point of living
you're telling me that there's no point to living then
there's no purpose well the fact is that there is
no point to living the desire to have a point
or a purpose for living is an egoic desire and
this is in fact something that creates a lot of
problems and stress and emotional turmoil in your life within
Lineman what you discover is that there is no point
how could there even be sense to talk about a
point to living a point from whose perspective there's no
who to even have a perspective as to having a
point or a purpose in life the fact is that
reality exists life is flowing life is one continuous River
and you're a part of that River so what's the
point well it just exists existence doesn't need a point
right what's the point of empty space there's no point
it's just it's just there it's just existence the ego
needs a sense of purpose because it makes it feel
significant this is a problem this is a problem because
whenever you feel insignificant then you have this ago ik
emotional reaction so this actually creates a lot of distress
and turmoil in your life the fact that life is
meaningless and pointless don't turn that into an additional meaning
of negativity like the nihilist does with true enlightenment what
happens that you discover that life is meaningless and the
fact that life is meaningless is also meaningless so it's
really really deep profound meaninglessness it's so profound that the
meaninglessness isn't negative anymore it becomes like a positive sometimes
I get people asking me the following question okay Leo
so then why don't I just kill myself right now
this is a funny question first of all you have
to recognize that this is a question that is an
egoic reaction right so this is a you're like a
knee-jerk reaction against some of the some truth that you
heard so first of all recognize that second I'll recognize
that what we're telling you is that there's no you
to kill and there's no you to do the killing
so when you say you're going to kill yourself what
we're saying here is that there is no you to
control the process of killing are you so it's like
a double fallacy there is no you to kill yourself
there is no self to kill the self is an
illusion it doesn't exist it's almost as though I said
let me go kill Santa Claus how do I kill
Santa Claus he doesn't exist he's a fictional character you
can't kill something that doesn't exist also the reason you
want to kill yourself is because you're taking this idea
of meaninglessness or selflessness and no self you're taking this
as some some negative nihilistic problematic thing in life in
fact it's not problematic at all it's a beautiful truth
and this truth is going to set you free but
the problem is that you're having an egoic reaction against
the truth why because the ego the illusion of the
ego doesn't want to dissolve the illusion wants to stay
put and so therefore it's going to fight and so
when you say that you want to go kill yourself
in fact you don't want to go kill yourself what
you're saying is that you're saying that that what I'm
telling you is nonsense because if what I told you
was true then everyone would kill themselves well in fact
that turns out to not be the case that's just
an emotional overreaction on your part the next question is
okay leo so then on a practical level is doing
business and having a family life is that then pointless
too if there's no point to reality and the you
know the tactical answer is that yes is pointless I
mean what do you think is the point of a
business or a family in the long run under your
models of reality let's say you don't accept what I'm
telling you under your model reality what's the point of
a business or family you might come up with some
point but if you really track it into the very
long term you're going to see that there is no
point because in the long run you're going to die
under your model you're going to die and your business
is going to eventually go bankrupt and it's going to
fail even let's say if you think it's going to
fail 500 years later okay 500 you're later it's going
to fail and your family eventually going to die too
eventually the human species will die eventually the whole planet
will be incinerated by the Sun eventually the entire solar
system will be destroyed eventually the entire galaxy will burn
out or be sucked into a black hole eventually the
entire universe will experience heat death and eventually perhaps the
whole universe will collapse back into a singularity which was
the the initial seed for the Big Bang so even
under kind of traditional scientific models under your models of
reality if you really think about it there is no
point to business or family the point only makes sense
as like a little trick that you play on yourself
you tell yourself oh well I want to build a
nice business or I want to go create a great
family and I want to leave a good legacy but
the fact is that you know no one in your
family is going to remember you five hundred years from
now just in the same way that you don't remember
anyone from your past family that lived five hundred years
ago and your business you know what's what's your business
going to matter after you're dead it's not going to
matter at all but even though we say all that
I'm not saying that you should go quit your business
and go murder your family or something like this right
this is ridiculous the fact is that life has no
point but this doesn't mean that you should now become
depressed and not do anything in life in fact what
this does is this frees you up to now do
whatever you want it's like a playground right what's the
point of being in a playground and having cool toys
and a sandbox well if you got a sandbox you
can build castles and you can have fun and you
can experience the joy of building a castle you can
also experience the you know the the pain of someone
having coming in and breaking your castle down and destroying
it because in the end no matter what castle you
build in sandbox that castle will get destroyed life is
just about being and experiencing there doesn't have to be
a point stop trying to grasp and cling for some
sense of purpose that's your ego doing that that's how
it preserve itself that's a false way of living life
that's a big lie so in reality with enlightenment you
can still go out and work on a business you
can still go out and have a family and all
these things you do why because you enjoy them basically
once you realize that life has no point and you're
not depressed about it what that practically means for you
is that now you're free to do whatever you want
and you're basically going to go do the things you
really want to do and you're not going to do
the things you don't want to do you're not going
to feel obligated you're going to feel to just go
and do things that are pleasurable to you that are
most meaningful to you even though you recognize that this
meaning is kind of a made-up meaning so that's that
point the next question is okay leo so then are
you telling me that you want me to become some
emotionless robot I'm going to come enlightened realize this truth
of no self and I'm going to be you come
this mo this robot who has no feelings for anybody
well this is actually the opposite of what's going to
happen if anything the emotionless robot is who you are
right now you're not able to presently fully experience and
appreciate your emotions because you're like a puppet controlled by
your emotions your emotions tug and pull at you with
enlightenment you're going to have emotions you can't stop emotions
emotions are a real phenomena they're not going away emotions
are not an illusion we're not saying that so you're
not going to become some emotional zombie robot in fact
you're going to be able to feel and experience emotions
more richly because now you're going to be in the
present moment now your monkey chatter is not going to
be driving you crazy and it's not going to be
having you living in the future in the past or
in your imagination you can experience emotions for real so
if you want the most emotionally rich life you should
become enlightened the other question is ok leo so do
you want me then to become a monk who goes
off and meditates in a cave somewhere is that the
kind of lifestyle you want me to live and the
answer is no becoming a monk is a caricature of
enlightenment not every line person is a monk and there's
no reason why you have to become a monk if
you don't want to become a monk enlightenment is an
inner realization it's not a lifestyle and it's not any
external behavior in the same sense that if I was
telling you that I want you to learn mathematics go
learn mathematics and what you tell me is you tell
me Leo if I learn mathematics does that mean that
I have to become some nerdy college professor of mathematics
I don't want to become like my college calculus professor
he's lame and of course the problem with that objection
is that well just because you learn mathematics does not
mean that you have to become a mathematics professor you
can learn mathematics and still live whatever kind of lifestyle
you want those are two totally different things how you
choose your how you choose to live your life is
separate from what you know and realize about life now
some of you after you become enlightened and actually want
to go out and become monks and that's great but
you're not going to do it because it's a bad
thing you can do it because you think that that's
the most meaningful way to live life most of you
if you become enlightened will not want to be monks
you'll live a more normal ordinary type of life so
you have to be afraid that this thing about being
a monk and not wanting to be a monk this
is like a little red herring that your ego throws
out there to say that all wealth this enlightenment stuff
is just so far out there so ridiculous it's a
kind of lifestyle I would never want it's a terrible
lifestyle I don't want to be a monk right but
that's a red herring the next question but Leo isn't
the ego or the self important to my survival you're
telling me to get rid of my ego but I
need my ego to survive in life so aren't you
threatening me and threatening my survival here and the answer
is that the ego in the self don't exist so
part of the illusion here is that you think that
your whole life you've been responsible for creating these great
results in your life and earning wealth and achieving all
these goals and getting to relationships and all this stuff
and surviving fighting for yourself right well the bitter pill
you have to swallow here is that there was no
hue that whole time doing it so the ego is
absolutely not a part of survival because the ego is
not real so it's not important or survival at all
and this is a this is a very counterintuitive notion
to accept you don't want to accept this why not
because when we accept this we basically undermine the entire
ego structure and this is not something that it wants
because the way that the ego maintains its power is
by saying that it's necessary how does it say that
it's necessary it says that oh I'm needed for your
survival but what if what what if that was just
a story in your mind what if it wasn't true
well it turns out to be the case that it's
not true but it's going to take you some time
to to see this you're not going to see it
immediately and in fact what you're going to realize later
if you go far enough is that your ego and
yourself threatens your survival how can this be well because
you do a lot of stupid stuff in your life
because of ego bar fights those start because of ego
wars start because of ego violent crimes and theft and
criminal activity those are all ego based those don't exist
when you are enlightened you have no reason to do
those things all those things are just a mechanism to
protect yourself when you realize that there is no self
to protect you don't need to engage in that activity
anymore so actually your survival will be improved it's very
counterintuitive this is very counterintuitive and kind of paradoxical notion
but it turns out that actually if you want to
get to the highest levels of living and thriving in
life you have to abandon your cleanness to the need
for survival right if you notice the most admirable high
quality human beings in history who were they were they
people who were clinging to their survival or were they
people who were actually selfless and didn't even care about
whether they survived or not right it was people who
didn't care and counter totally they thrived now sure some
of them died you know Gandhi was shot and Jesus
was crucified and so on and so forth and Martin
Luther King was assassinated so you know we have some
bad examples but there are many people who who are
kind of positive examples the next question is Leo but
surely the ego isn't all bad surely there are good
aspects to the ego right and again this is an
interesting one because the ego doesn't exist when you ask
this question you assume that the self exists and that
somehow if we remove the self then not only do
we remove the good parts I mean the bad parts
but we also remove the bad of the good parts
so it's like you're throwing the baby out with the
bathwater and the fact is that there is no baby
and there's no bathwater that's what we're trying to tell
you here so it's not like the ego has good
qualities because it's an illusion it doesn't exist it's kind
of like if I told you get rid of your
notion of Santa Claus kill Santa Claus in your mind
and what you said is you said but Leo if
we get rid of Santa Claus then what happens to
the Christmas gifts I want to keep the Christmas gifts
does that mean that there are no more Christmas gifts
under the tree come Christmas time I don't want to
lose that of course that's silly right because Santa Claus
wasn't responsible for the Christmas gifts in the first place
so all the good stuff you have in your life
that you think you're responsible for maybe your family maybe
your relationship maybe your children maybe your business maybe your
house maybe your car maybe whatever well I got some
news for you and it's a bitter pill to swallow
but that wasn't created by you you had absolutely nothing
to do with it even though you told yourself the
whole time that you did so if we remove the
you all that good stuff will still stay so don't
have to worry about that next objection below what will
happen to my motivation levels if I become enlightened won't
I become this list list useless slacker who just lays
around on the couch does nothing all day well first
of all there are plenty of people in fact probably
most people in society who are exactly that very unmotivated
I have many clients who have struggle with motivation a
lot that I coach right there's a lot of unmotivated
people out there and they're very very egotistical right so
your motivation levels and enlightenment itself these these are connected
in a subtle and complex way the fact is that
you might become enlightened and you might lose certain motivations
in your life but generally it doesn't make you a
lazy slob what enlightenment does is it just clears away
your neurotic sense of obligation to certain things in your
life so for example maybe right now you're going to
work and you're telling yourself that I'll have to go
to work I have to build this business I have
to be successful I have to earn all this money
I have to prove to people that I'm someone I
have to build a legacy and then with enlightenment what
happens is that you discovered at all I don't need
any of that to be happy and so you just
drop that whole business now to you right now that
might seem scary because you're thinking like oh well I
don't want to drop that business but see that's because
you still think the business is important to you when
you truly genuine and see that the business is not
that important and that you really don't enjoy doing it
and that you'd rather not be doing it and that
your authentic self doesn't really desire to be running a
business then you can go off and do other stuff
right this doesn't mean that you're not motivated anymore it
just means that certain false motivations that are in place
right now will disappear on the other hand if you
really love this business and it's like a passion of
yours and you think that this is really helping people
and it's improving the world after enlightenment you might be
even more motivated and you might be more empowered to
work on this business because there's nothing wrong with running
a business and you're still going to want to do
things after enlightenment you know why because your motivation wasn't
created by you in the first place why because you
don't exist so right now when you tell yourself that
you're responsible for creating your motivation levels well actually you're
not because you're not real so your motivation levels are
not coming from you they're coming from the body and
the unconscious mind and so those motivation levels will still
exist now they might shift but you know what your
motivations might shift no matter what if you don't become
enlightened next year your motivations might change anyways people quit
their businesses all the time people leave relationships all the
time people lose motivation all the time people gain new
motivation all the time this stuff is just a phenomenon
of life and it happens and it's really not up
to you what you're going to be motivated by so
stop clinging to that the next question is Leo doesn't
enlightenment contradict self-actualization and self-help and it'll definitely seem that
way at first when you start learning about this and
especially if you've been watching a lot of my videos
you'll see direct contradictions between stuff I've said in other
videos and some of these more advanced videos but you
got to understand that personal development is like a staircase
with many steps and stages so that you're moving up
as you're growing and developing what we're talking about here
is some of the most advanced stages that you can
get to write to get these high stages you need
to work through the intermediate and lower stages so it's
not that enlightenment makes everything else that I've been talking
about pointless depending on at where you are in your
life some of my other more basic more practical videos
will be very helpful to you because remember you're stuck
in the matrix if you're stuck in the matrix how
does someone in the matrix survive well they eat inside
the matrix they go to the work inside the matrix
they have sex inside the matrix they get married inside
the matrix then they die inside the matrix and everything
they learn is in the matrix so they only know
the matrix right so if I give you a matrix
books inside the matrix it's actually going to be useful
to you isn't that funny how if you're living in
a fake world if I give you a fake objects
in the fake world it's actually helpful to you so
that's basically what's happening with the lower level videos for
example if I give you some relationship advice or if
I give you some advice about how to earn more
money you might say well Leo isn't that kinda like
fake advice well yes but what you're living is a
fake life so fake advice for a fake life it
in a sick way it kind of works right and
also my hope ultimately is that by giving you this
fake advice which get you some fake results in your
life that eventually you're going to move up the staircase
to the higher levels so that now you're in a
place where you can actually really go off and do
the deep advanced work become enlightened and then you can
look back at all this and you say oh all
of this was like a staircase that led me to
here and every step in a sense had its value
but also in a sense every step was kind of
like ah not necessary afterwards right it's kind of like
building scaffolding to erect a giant skyscraper and then you
take the scaffolding off now the question is was the
scaffolding useful or was a useless well in one sense
you could say it was useless because you had to
throw it all away eventually but on in another sense
you say well but the scaffolding was actually very essential
because without the scaffolding you couldn't build the whole skyscraper
so that's what some of my more basic videos are
like their scaffolding and the last question that I'm going
to cover here is some people ask well Leo should
I still keep doing self-help or should I stop doing
self-help and this is a little tricky to answer because
it really depends on where you are in your progression
everyone's a different place it also depends on what you
really mean by self-help personally I consider the things I'm
talking about now in enlightenment as part of self-help so
in a sense if you want to pursue enlightenment you
should keep doing self-help also if you're at the lower
stages of your personal development and you're having problems with
money or relationships or your career or with whatever else
you know very basic everyday problems then you actually need
self-help because it'll help you to plug those holes so
that you can move on to the higher so what
I would suggest is that you continue doing self-help and
if anything do more self-help now there's one warning here
though is that if you've already done a lot of
self-help in your life and you've already put into place
many different aspects and you've plugged many holes and now
you're reaching the higher levels now you might be getting
to the point where traditional self-help might not be what
you need so maybe you don't need to go read
another Tony Robbins book maybe you don't need to go
take another relationship seminar maybe you don't need to go
read a hundred self-help books right after a while there's
like diminishing returns and after a while what you really
need is after you've built up a healthy ego you
start with a weak ego you build up a healthy
ego then what you do is you transcend and release
the ego and this can seem a little counterintuitive to
some people because some people think like well I spent
all this time building up my ego and building up
my life and now Leo you're telling me to throw
it all away no or telling you is transcend it
ascend to the higher stages right ascend there's going to
be greater stuff ahead so don't cling to everything that's
coming in in your life with self-help and what I
would suggest for you is that stop doing the traditional
self-help and move more into the kind of quote-unquote spiritual
self-help move into that more go practice more meditation watch
and study more of mine life and videos or other
people's enlightenment videos if you want to read books go
read some really high quality books on spiritual enlightenment specifically
not just regular self-help hey maybe stop focusing so much
on earning more money and having more sex and buying
more material objects you don't need those anymore you've gone
through that phase now it's time to ascend to the
new phase so generally though I was looking to you
doing it me I'm still on my journey towards enlightenment
I'm not enlightened yet and I'm still doing loss of
self-help because it's helpful to me why because I'm living
in the matrix I realize it now that I'm living
in the matrix but for the time being I'm still
stuck in the matrix therefore I still need to eat
inside the matrix I still need to go to work
inside the matrix right alright so that's it for this
part one I'll have other parts coming up in the
future so stay tuned for those there's a lot more
