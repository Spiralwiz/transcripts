hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm gonna talk about how to stop being a
workaholic I suppose I should start with a confession which
is that I'm a bit of a workaholic and that's
something that I've been working on to myself lately because
it's a problem workaholic is a problem have you ever
stopped to notice that there's something deeply wrong going on
inside of you if you're a workaholic well whether you
realize it or not there is and what I want
to do in this episode is to help you to
gain some deep insight into where your workaholism is stemming
from what's the root of it and it turns out
that the root can be very very deep also very
fascinating also very eye-opening and the cool part is is
that once you get a handle on it then it
can open up a whole new world and a whole
new life for you whole new chapter of your life
so this will be powerful but first how do we
tell if you're a workaholic well here are some basic
guidelines that I just kind of drew up for myself
if you work over eight hours a day and over
40 hours a week then you just might be a
workaholic if you take your work very personally to the
point where it can make you sad or angry at
what's going on with your work you might be a
workaholic if you work weekends you might be a workaholic
if you work holidays you might be a workaholic and
if you don't take vacations you might be a workaholic
and the a whole slew of problems with this but
as workaholics were very good at disguising what these problems
are so let's mean let me just bring a few
of them to light for you the first most obvious
problem is that you're agitated and that basically you create
needless suffering for yourself on a day-to-day basis with your
work because you take it so personally and because your
identity is so tied up in your work so there's
that kind of low-level stress that you create that's not
necessary but it's there you don't produce your best work
even though you tell yourself that you do and even
though it appears that when you crunch and you work
your ass off for a few weeks or a few
months that you get a lot of stuff done but
that's not your best work really because in those high-pressure
situations sometimes you can be creative but generally your creativity
suffers from overwork it doesn't get better it suffers and
also there's burnout you didn't crash and burn like sometimes
you're kicking ass and everything's going great and you're doing
a lot in your life and you're accomplishing a lot
you're feeling really good about that because you're outperforming everyone
else but in the long run you crash and burn
because you can't sustain that and so your work is
in starts and stops right you have this great spurts
of growth but then stuff crashes and in the very
long term you know over the course of a years
what might happen is you just get fed up with
the stuff that you're working on to the point where
you have to move on to something else or you
just give up or quit on it that can be
a problem there's also the health problems of overworking and
now these are very good at concealing and denying and
sweeping under the rug but they're there and they're creeping
up on you and they're only going to get worse
as you continue with your workaholism those are kind of
like the ordinary problems but then what I consider the
kiba's problems are as follows these are like the real
shames of being or colic is that you don't get
to self-actualize not really because what you are is you're
just this obsessive robot who's going to work you're really
a slave of your work there's facets of your life
outside of work that you're neglecting and mostly it's your
own personal development your own psychological development right you're stifling
yourself there because you're so obsessed with the work and
you don't give yourself the time that's necessary to self
actualize and so really you miss out on some of
them the most greatest aspects of life and you ultimately
limit yourself and what you can accomplish in your life
you kind of put a glass ceiling on your own
inner development and therefore the potential that you're able to
express and actually realize in the world you're never gonna
be able to grow your consciousness to its full potential
as a workaholic which is a shame and also what's
the shame is that you miss out on the beauty
of life because you're not stopping to smell the roses
and so what you're gonna realize on your deathbed is
that really your whole life was this string of attempts
to work your way into fulfillment and it's never really
worked and it was just project after project after project
after project at their project and then you're dead and
when that happens when you're there when you're approaching it
you're gonna have a lot of regrets for not stopping
to smell the roses and to appreciate all the different
aspects of life that exist outside the domain of work
that's just one domain of many domains which include relationships
and family and being out in nature and all this
other stuff right so you're living a very unbalanced life
and ultimately that's going to cost you so you're probably
aware of some of that stuff already but let's get
to the core issue what's the core issue behind the
workaholism well really it's that deep down you believe that
you're worthless or you're incomplete it's really that basic here's
the thought experiment for you just try this on for
a minute imagine that I forced you and pass a
law that you cannot work any more in your entire
life ever again how would that make you feel picture
that for yourself right now imagine it what if you
couldn't work at all for the rest of your life
how would that make you feel be honest would it
make you bummed out depressed anxious outraged how would you
feel if it's any of those and it probably is
if your work holic then why do you think that's
going on do you see that there's something like deep
inside of you that's out of whack for that kind
of emotional reaction to be happening to never working again
see the problem here is that your self-image your very
identity at its core is tied up with your work
you take pride at out working other people you compare
yourself to other people you kind of secretly glow that
you're better than others more productive than others more efficient
than others more creative than others but also the interesting
mechanism that you set up is that you set up
this condition in your mind without knowing it that you
can feel fulfillment or peace Oh after having worked X
amount you know huge amount for you it's a huge
amount so what happens is that you're working on a
project for a couple of years and then finally you
get to the point where you've reached that barrier that
you set for yourself and when you reach that threshold
finally the project just come let's say complete or released
and you get it out there to the world then
it's like ah that's nice and you get that sense
of peace and relief and fulfillment from all that work
you did right and that feels so good it's like
a drug and that's the emotion that you were after
that whole time for years but see it took a
couple of years just to get to that ah peace
feeling but then what happens that only lasts for a
week maybe a couple days maybe not even a full
day that lasts and then what your mind does is
it immediately jumps on to the next thing because there's
always a new project around the corner and then you
do that one for a few years and there's the
next project around the corner and you do that one
and then the next one and then the next one
and all you really got is you've got these couple
of days in between these these projects where you actually
do feel at peace and you feel satisfied and fulfilled
but the rest of the time not really and then
you rationalize this to yourself by saying well I got
to keep myself motivated what's wrong with that gotta keep
myself motivated right can't be complacent but see there's something
something wrong with that whole scheme it's kind of like
it's rigged against your own happiness and also the way
you might be tricking yourself you might saying well Leo
there's this there's just this you know this dream project
I have if I can just complete that one all
these little projects yeah they were kind of like important
but I'm working toward that one dream project and when
I complete that that's what my life will finally all
be complete that's when I'll finally feel like okay I'm
good I'm done now but you know what that's never
gonna happen news flash that's never gonna happen why because
deep down the problem is that you feel worthless and
incomplete and that's not going to be solved with external
accomplishment not gonna be solved with an external accomplishment see
what you're not realizing is that actually you're caught in
a mechanism that's man it's it's so beyond your awareness
right now this mechanism you're like a mouse spinning in
a wheel chasing after some cheese thinking that that cheese
will be yours if you just run fast enough long
enough but actually if you zoom out and you take
a third-person look at situations you can realize that oh
that Mouse no ma'am no no matter how long he
runs and how hard he tries he's never gonna get
the cheese never will the closest he'll get is he'll
get his nose a little bit close to us we
can kind of sniff it and that will feel nice
he just kind of sniffs it but he's never gonna
get the cheese because the mechanism is not designed for
him to get the cheese you see this what you're
doing on a very fundamental level is that you're working
to avoid the present moment you're not comfortable just being
in the present moment so you feel like you need
to be moving on the move like a shark right
truck doesn't like to stand still it needs to get
oxygen and his gills from the water as it's moving
through otherwise its harshest to suffocate and die well that's
basically you write and you rationalize it yourself saying well
whatever your rationalization is you know like oh well I
have work to do you know life needs life needs
to be worked on to be meaningful and significant whatever
your justifications are but it's something along the lines of
I have to work my ass off in order to
create value so that I can feel worthwhile and complete
inside that's essentially what you're saying to yourself without realizing
it because as soon as you stop working have you
noticed this if you stop working for a sufficiently long
period of time for maybe a wee week or a
month what happens is you actually start an existential crisis
an existential crisis for you because actually your very identity
in your existence as a being as an entity what
you feel you are is you feel like you're this
thing that needs to generate worth and value otherwise your
life is meaningless and so therefore sitting still is like
the worst form of torture for you you don't like
to sit still you like to run around and do
stuff you like activity but have you ever wondered what
all this activity is distracting you from seeing see you
think that this activity is you creating this activity what
if this activity was a mechanism that was designed to
prevent you from seeing something that's very flawed at the
center of your existence that you don't want to look
at and that you don't want to admit and what
that is is a very interesting thing you're using your
work as a defense mechanism from seeing what I call
the void the void the void you can call it
the truth of no self and basically what this means
and this is an existential fact of everyone's existence is
that there's no such thing as worth worth does not
exist no matter how hard you work you cannot create
earth you can create illusions of worth but not actual
worth nor does value exist no matter how hard you
work you cannot make yourself any more valuable than any
other human being or any more worthwhile than any other
human being right and this void also means that meaning
does not exist in life the meanings you attach to
life and to all the work you do those are
illusions the not real and the purpose that you generate
in your life is also an illusion it's not real
either that's like a fiction of fairy tale in your
mind and ultimately all this boils back down to the
ultimate truth of your you know your psyche which is
that you as a personal entity inside the head there's
no entity that there's no you in there there's no
you that's the truth that enlightenment reveals to us you
know I'm not gonna go into much detail here because
it's quite complex and technical and there's a lot of
traps that people fall into with this truth if you're
interested now go check out my enlightenment videos I have
many of them but what I will say here is
that I want to focus on this issue of worth
because this thing about worth is very profound see in
your mind you frame it as well if I accomplish
this great project like if I write that amazing novel
or fight create that amazing business or if I create
this amazing piece of software or if I accomplish this
amazing research project then it's like finally I'll be like
yeah it relaxed finally like I've proven myself to the
world and for you that might be a dollar amount
it might be a certain award that you want like
the Nobel Prize it might be a certain position in
your university or in your business it might be you
know taking your business IPO or selling out your business
or it might be inventing some new product or whatever
maybe getting your your face plastered on a magazine so
that people know you getting recognized in some way basically
for your work and you might say to yourself well
you know Leo I don't really want to be a
celebrity but I do want to be recognized for my
work what's wrong with that like I want to do
great work and just be recognized for being someone who
made a difference in the world you know leave a
legacy behind isn't that good what's wrong with that and
yeah that's that's miles better than just wanting to be
a celebrity for fame sake cuz that's real shallow so
you know you're a step up from that but the
thing you're not facing is that no matter how much
work you do and what you accomplish in life it
doesn't mean anything it means nothing do you understand this
it means nothing because in the end you will die
and everything you accomplish will eventually get destroyed this is
just a fact you don't like to look at it
because when you look at it all the sudden kind
of robs you have motivation to do anything in life
and that's understandable so we kind of ignore that part
and we just kind of work towards something say well
it's gonna be meaningful anyways you know might as well
do it what else am I gonna do with my
life um and that can all seem very innocent but
see do you really believe that you're incomplete inside if
you're very honest I mean I can't tell you if
you if you are or not because you know some
people are and some people are not it just depends
what was your childhood like what are you really motivated
to do with your work is it really just because
you're expressing yourself and it's just like this very positive
creative expression or is it because you feel like there's
a void or a gap inside of you that you're
trying to avoid looking at and you feel like you're
worthless and you're not complete if somehow you're not doing
this work see they might seem kind of very similar
on the surface like they and you know both produce
the same kind of result in that the person works
in both cases really hard but these are very different
motivations and what I'm telling you here don't get us
wrong I'm not telling you that you shouldn't be working
or that you should become a bum or lazy slob
or go work at McDonald's something like that be ambitious
in life if you want to I'm just telling you
aware be aware of the realities that drive you so
that at least they're driving you consciously at least understand
what's going on inside you because right now you probably
have no idea what's really happening here is that you're
refusing to accept that life is meaningless you don't want
to do this you don't like this to you this
is threatening this to starting to ego because your whole
ego the way that it works is basically it's not
there it's a blank splits a gap it's a void
it's nothing that's what it really is but it likes
to pretend like it's something so basically what it is
is kind of like the Invisible Man for the Invisible
Man to see himself what does he do he needs
to put on clothing otherwise he doesn't even feel that
he's real and that's the thing you're resisting is you're
resisting looking at the mirror and seeing a blank nothingness
something that has no worth and no value that's what
you're resisting and so what you're busy doing is you're
busy putting on all these garments jackets and socks and
pants and hats and sunglasses and lipstick and all this
if you're putting all this stuff on so that you
can feel more alive and more real but in fact
there's nothing there and so what I suggest to you
is that instead of playing that whole game why don't
we just take off all the garments and just stare
ourselves in the mirror as we are and get comfortable
with it because the first time you do this it'll
scare the [ __ ] out of you right because
this whole mechanism has been designed to keep you on
the wheel spinning your wheels and avoiding the void but
counter to only what you should do instead is you
should turn around and look at the void enter the
void and then what you'll have is you'll have liberation
you will no longer be a slave to alcoholism and
what you'll do is you'll actually embrace this idea that
life is meaningless and what a lot of people get
wrong when I say that is that they say well
if life is meaningless then how come you're shooting all
these videos and isn't that a point to be depressed
about I mean that's so nihilistic and and sad and
and depressing but no not at all the fact that
life is meaningless is just a fact of life and
it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful truth because it
means nothing you see that don't make the mistake which
many people make of turning life is meaningless into a
meaning of its own and giving it a negative spin
that's not what I'm telling you to do I'm just
asking to be very open and self honest about this
whole thing look into this idea of worth because you
sometimes somehow feel that you know let's say hypothetically we
take a bum on the street we take a mangy
dirty old dog those two and then we take you
as a third comparison we've got these three comparisons a
bum on the street a mangy old dog and you
and you maybe you're like uh you know a business
type of person you like to go out there and
earn lots of money and build companies and stuff and
have a good put yourself together nicely and drive a
nice car and dress very professional you do all this
thing but you realize that that's a game right you
realize that even though you feel like you have more
worth than that mangy dog and that bum on the
street actually can you see that you have exactly the
same amount of worth as both those things you have
no more worth than those bum and dog why is
that well because what is worth have you actually looked
into it have you actually contemplated what worth is I
encourage you to do that as an exercise for yourself
perhaps after this video is done you could take a
look at that but what you'll come to realize is
that worth is not actually in this world doesn't exist
does not exist it's a fantasy that you create so
you tell yourself you're worth 'fl and you tell yourself
that that dog or that bum is worthless and it
becomes true for you but that's just like stories in
your mind right stories in your mind it's part of
the illusion if you look into it it's like worse
I mean why would anything in life be worth anything
more than anything else only within a social system like
yes if you go and you buy a Toyota is
going to be worth less than a BMW at the
dealership so we say it has less worth or less
value and so it's like well I want the BMW
I don't want the Toyota but you see that that
that's just like a social fiction that we create that's
a social fiction in fact if you look at an
object it has no worth on it take an object
take like take an apple from your kitchen and just
sit with it as an exercise and look at it
ask yourself where is the worth in this Apple am
i worth more than the Apple or am i worth
less than the Apple do it once I realize that
this whole thing of worth is just like a sham
there's no such thing as worth so because of this
you know setting up all these obstacles for how you
can earn and increase your own personal worth this is
not necessary so what I want you to do is
to kind of look into that real deeply drop all
that stuff drop it and then if you still have
the desire to do work go do work what you'll
find is that you probably will have the desire and
what's gonna happen that you just shed the negative reasons
for doing work and you keep the positive ones what
it might also be scary is that you might discover
that actually if you do this process you discover like
oh [ __ ] I've been working for the last
30 years of my life trying to fill this void
inside me which is not something that's never gonna fill
because it that void is in you that void is
there you can't run away from it you can only
just turn your back on it for a bit but
it's always right right there chasing it's like your shadow
you can't run away from your shadow right you might
discover that oh [ __ ] man I've been doing
this my whole life and it's like and maybe I
should just stop working for a while and just see
what comes up see where my life takes me maybe
I should focus my energy now on family or on
my health or on traveling or whatever or maybe not
who knows you know usually this this this feeling of
worthlessness it comes from your childhood somewhere so maybe you're
trying to prove yourself care of dad because your dad
didn't approve you remember you're trying to prove yourself to
your first grade elementary school teacher because she didn't approve
of you and you're still trying to live that up
you know these very childish seem like these things these
seem so childish but you know this is how our
mind tends to work is that it latches on to
issues from the past and kind of just creates drives
around them so you need to kind of do some
introspection look very back in your life far back in
your life and ask yourself where could this feeling of
worthlessness be coming from why do I feel incomplete and
why do I believe that launching some business or some
product will somehow make me complete I mean this whole
idea of incompleteness you're already completely complete you're complete right
now the problems that you're not acknowledging it and so
what you do is you set up these circumstances or
these kind of rules in your own mind that say
something like well I'll be complete when I do blank
it's likely oh I'll be complete when I do that
project I'll be complete when I publish my novel I'll
be complete when I sell my screenplay no you won't
because there's no such thing as completeness you're already fully
complete all you're doing is just playing games with yourself
so why don't you just cut all that [ __
] out and then you can feel a complete right
now and then being complete you can go do it
or whatever the [ __ ] you want that's the
deep root of the solution and I'll alternate LIGO try
to discover no self if you want to really feel
complete what you need to do is you need to
go get enlightened that's the only way because that's that's
the only you know method by which you can face
that void and actually realize that void and realize the
beauty of that void embrace it and become it because
you're already it you just don't realize it yet you
can raise your awareness to that point so anyways here's
some solutions real quick solutions for how to deal with
this workaholic problem workaholism problem so firstly acknowledge yourself that
you're running away from the void and to do this
you need to start to look inside yourself you do
some contemplation on this you know ask yourself why do
I feel worthless why do I feel incomplete what's the
bottom that the very root of it why am I
really feel like I need to be working all the
time to feel happy in life why like why it
makes no sense because like a dog doesn't have this
problem right that mangy dog on the street corner he's
not having an existential crisis about the fact that he's
not working he's just sitting there he's enjoy live you
know maybe he's hungry maybe he's cold or whatever and
those are problems for him but he's not having an
existential crises Enfield's an interesting really powerful tool for you
is meditation I recommend you start meditating daily for 20
minutes at the very least check out my how to
meditate video and other videos where I talk about meditation
also check out my lammie videos where I talk about
how to do a looking process into how to become
in lines that video is called how to become enlightened
take a look at those those two processes can be
very powerful for you I also recommend that you start
practicing mindfulness especially on your habit of being a workaholic
so you start becoming mindful which just means become aware
of what you're doing in the moment that you're doing
it so when you're in the grip of that urge
to work and to satisfy yourself with worth notice that
that's there that that drive is there and that mechanism
is there see the mouse running in the wheel see
that as being you all right so apply your awareness
to the situation as it's happening because it's one thing
to do it right now with me but we're kind
of you know we're kind of looking back in your
past I want you to become aware of it as
you're doing it because you do it in a mechanical
robotic kind of way also very practically work less stop
working so much slow your pace of work down it's
okay you don't need to be accomplishing all this [
__ ] in your life to be happy in fact
it will work it's gonna backfire on you so maybe
instead of working you know six or seven days a
week maybe you should cut it back to five days
a week and even take the end of Friday night
Friday afternoon take that off and go go to the
beach go to the park go to the zoo go
hang out with your kids with your girlfriend with your
boyfriend that sort of thing slow down the pace of
your work - do you really need to accomplish that
project by the end of this year would it really
kill you if you accomplished it in two years instead
of one year does it really make a difference in
the grand scheme of things probably not so maybe adjust
your schedule a bit there and take more vacations the
kind of vacations where you're not working on vacation or
checking your emails or in that kind of nonsense but
like real full-blown vacations take a week here take a
week there ah one thing that I'm starting to do
is I'm taking more retreats take a meditation retreat take
a seminar or do something to actualize yourself right discover
the aspects of life that you've kind of ignored and
denied and hidden discover the spiritual aspects of life discover
the romantic aspects of life discovered natural beauty the natural
beauty of life discover art discover music discover culture discover
Travel discover a great sex discover cooking whatever you know
