            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/LD3UozF8Hn0' target='_blank'>How To Eat Healthy - Create A Super Healthy Meal In 15 Minutes</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of Eating Healthy</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes on valuing health and focuses on improving his diet progressively by cleaning up and experimenting with different diets. He highlights the significance of raw vegetables in the diet and shows the process of creating a healthy meal.
</li><li><b>High Consumption of Vegetables</b>: Leo suggests the importance of eating vegetables like wild arugula, romaine lettuce, sugar snappies, red bell peppers, radishes, and others, particularly green leafy ones, ideally raw rather than cooked or processed. He cautions against substituting vegetables for other food items like potatoes or grains.
</li><li><b>Organic Produce</b>: Despite the inconclusive evidence on the enhanced nutritional value of organic produce, Leo recommends their consumption as he believes in their potential health benefits despite their slight higher cost. He demonstrates by using organic vegetable items like tomatoes for his salad.
</li><li><b>Volume of Food</b>: Leo advises consuming larger volumes of vegetables owing to their less calorie-dense nature, which requires more intake volume for satisfying hunger. He suggests using large plates for meals and advises against underconsumption of vegetables as it could lead to feeling hungry and thus giving up on a healthy diet.
</li><li><b>Salad Dressing</b>: Leo prepares a dressing for his salad using organic extra virgin olive oil and half a lemon. He attests to buying organic for fruits and vegetables that are not peeled, like tomatoes.
</li><li><b>Emphasized importance of purchasing organic food</b>: Organic food should be prioritized especially for fruits and vegetables that are not peeled, as pesticides and chemicals used on non-organic produce can be harmful. Examples include tomatoes and leafy greens.
</li><li><b>Salad preparation and dressing</b>: A simple dressing using high-quality ingredients such as lemon juice, olive oil, and organic brown mustard can enhance the flavor of the salad. Ingredients for making organic brown mustard include whole organic mustard seed, organic apple cider vinegar, water, and sea salt.
</li><li><b>Usage of natural salt over white table salt</b>: Discarding chemically processed white table salt which is stripped of all nutrients for natural salts like pink Himalayan sea salt or Celtic sea salt is recommended. These natural salts contain essential nutrients and minerals, offering a richer taste as well.
</li><li><b>Changes in taste preferences after adopting healthy food habits</b>: Once unhealthy junk foods are abandoned, an appreciation for healthier foods like raw salads is developed. Taste buds adjust to less complex flavors of raw vegetables and this gradual change in diet ultimately leads to improved health and feelings of wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Negative impacts of poor diet and lack of exercise</b>: A poor diet and insufficient exercise contribute to health issues like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. These negative impacts significantly affect life performance and achievements. 
</li><li><b>Benefits of pasture-raised eggs</b>: Pasture-raised eggs, although more expensive than conventional eggs, are substantially nutritionally superior. Hens are allowed to roam freely outdoors and eat a more natural diet, resulting in eggs with a different shell texture and a deep, rich orange yolk.
</li><li><b>Investment in high-quality food</b>: Regardless of the higher costs associated with organic and pasture-raised food, investment in these healthier food choices is worth it for the improved nutritional value and the health benefits they offer in the long run. 
</li><li><b>Relating healthy eating to daily performance and long-term life goals</b>: Healthy foods, although they may not taste as exciting as junk foods, provide the body and mind with clean fuel which significantly affects daily performance and overall health. Transitioning to a healthier diet requires patience but has lasting benefits and aligns with a mission of achieving higher values in life.
</li><li><b>Exercise and Calorie Intake</b>: Leo discusses that because he exercises less and doesn't need a lot of energy, he can eat less. However, if he was burning more calories, he would need to eat more, including multiple meals like the salad he prepared. Leo also describes additional foods he consumes which include dark chocolate, wild Alaskan smoked salmon, and organic frozen berry desserts.
</li><li><b>Diet Comparison</b>: Leo encourages viewers to examine and compare their own diet to his, examining the quality, quantity, and types of food they are consuming. He pinpoints typical unhealthy examples like fried, overcooked, and charred food, as well as food prepared with low-quality ingredients.
</li><li><b>Transition to a Healthier Diet</b>: Leo acknoweldges that transitioning to a healthier diet takes discipline and awareness. He stresses the importance of self-education via reading nutrition books to build a case for changing diet, as it doesn't come naturally in a culture that makes unhealthy food choices convenient and readily available.
</li><li><b>Importance of Quality in Food</b>: Leo criticizes restaurants, even expensive ones, for serving low-quality steaks to maximize profit margins. He highlights that despite the high prices patrons pay, the food often remains unhealthy.
</li><li><b>Health and Purpose</b>: Leo emphasizes his desire for a long, healthy life free from diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. He talks about the importance of being healthy, not just for his current work, but also for his future aspirations. Being healthy, according to him, positively impacts his ability to relay his knowledge and wisdom to others, significantly when he's older and at his intellectual prime.
</li><li><b>Eating Healthy for Energy</b>: Leo credits eating healthy, especially green vegetables, as the reason behind his energetic state. He suggests that if he were to substitute his healthy meal with an unhealthy one, he would feel lethargic and unable to continue work.
</li><li><b>Final Remarks</b>: Leo invites viewers to leave comments about their experiences with cleaning up their diet, like and share the video to enhance the message, and sign up for the weekly newsletter at actualized.org. The newsletter promises free videos, articles, downloads, and wisdom necessary to build an exciting and balanced life. Subscribers also receive exclusive access to a 19-part video series and a chance to win two hours of free coaching with him.
