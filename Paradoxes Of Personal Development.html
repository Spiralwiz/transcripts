hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about the importance of embracing
paradox in your self-actualization journey we learn from history that
we do not learn from history paradoxes are cool not
only are they cool but they're also a necessity of
life if you're going to be going through and you're
going to be self actualizing and they're really not the
problem that some people make them out to be so
here we're going to talk about what we mean by
paradoxes why paradoxes are not a problem why in fact
they're a great asset to you if you're able to
embrace them we're going to talk about how to go
about embracing some of these paradoxes personally I love studying
paradoxes there's paradoxes that I've discovered in science in mathematics
and linguistics and in personal development and I'm going to
give you a whole list of personal development paradoxes in
this video so that you get a really good idea
of what I mean by paradox the reason I wanted
to shoot this video is because as now that we
are getting into more advanced personal development stuff with actualized
org covering more advanced topics what I'm seeing is that
some people are having difficulty with accepting kind of contradictory
notions especially when we're starting to talk about spiritual enlightenment
and then how that connects back to the bait more
basic personal development work that we do that we do
and and when you're looking at both of these things
they seem contradictory and when this happens what then happens
after that is that basically you use this as an
ego defense to avoid looking deeper into resolving these contradictions
or even just accepting that these contradictions are are there
as a part of reality and then this blocks you
and prevents you from achieving the most advanced results that
you can achieve with personal development just to put everything
into perspective for you I talked about this theme a
lot of my other videos but basically what I'm hoping
you're getting from everything that you're getting from my videos
is that you're getting this big picture understanding of reality
and to me this is like an endeavor that you
do and you undertake in your life is you say
okay I'm really interested in figuring out how all the
pieces fit together on a big picture a lot I
want to know how my psychology works I want to
know how life works and I need to know every
little facet of that so I can put them all
together I can create this giant jigsaw puzzle and each
little piece that I put into place helps me see
the larger picture that's what we're trying to do here
because the value of having this big picture understanding is
that you have the wisdom then to create whatever kind
of life you want and you have the wisdom then
also to live a virtuous life rather than living a
shallow life when I see people living shadow lives it's
mostly because I see that they don't have this entire
jigsaw puzzle assembled or at least even a good chunk
of it and so what they do is they waste
a lot of time and their life they go down
a lot of dead ends because they don't really see
what's happening in life what life is they don't understand
they don't ascend themselves so to resolve that what we
do is we piece by piece start putting it together
now as you start doing this one of the problems
is that you get pieces that don't seem to fit
or you get a piece you try to fit it
in this corner over here but then you see that
it doesn't fit in this corner so you scratch your
head and you wonder and mmm where should this piece
go and maybe you try the other corner and it
doesn't fit there either and then you have to try
in the middle and maybe it doesn't fit that either
and then you just have to put it off to
the side for a while until more the puzzle gets
complete and then maybe you'll see oh it was supposed
to go right here the whole time see but it
this is like a process this is a multi-year long
process this is really a lifelong process of doing this
the puzzle is never fully complete you always keep discovering
new stuff and sometimes the stuff you discover is very
challenging intellectually it challenges you it jostles your pre-existing notions
maybe it means you have to rearrange certain aspects of
this puzzle maybe you thought that all I had this
part figured out you get this new piece and you're
like oh well that means that this whole part is
wrong I have to reconfigure it some people really have
problem with this they don't like doing this because their
ego likes to be certain likes to be concrete but
if you are not able to go through this investigative
process and keep your mind open to the possibility that
all maybe I don't have it quite right maybe these
two pieces don't fit because there's something in my understanding
that I'll figure out three years later if you don't
have that kind of open mindedness then you're going to
get stuck and I find that this is not only
necessary for the advanced work in personal development but it's
also necessary for even sometimes the entry-level work and I'll
show you what I mean by that in a second
when I start telling you all these paradoxes of personal
development I actually wanted to create a whole video series
of like 20 or 30 videos that just focus on
the paradoxes of personal development cuz I find them so
fascinating and also because understanding this stuff and understanding these
paradoxes and accepting these paradoxes I think creates much better
results for you in your life maybe I'll do that
in the future but right now I want to go
through and just give you a taste of what some
of these paradoxes are so here they are the first
example is something like this it goes like this on
the one hand in personal development we tell you that
you're perfect you're perfect as you are you're already complete
yet on the other hand you must do self help
you must do personal development you need to work really
hard to actualize yourself so which is it am i
perfect or do I need to work my ass off
to self actualize how do you resolve that here's another
one we tell you in personal development yes you have
real problems in your life that need to be fixed
maybe health problems business problems career problems whatever and we
try to go to problem-solving mode and help you solve
all these problems that you have helped you diagnose them
and understand them on the other hand we also tell
you but really your problems are ilusory they're not real
problems and that in fact problem solving is not the
best way to go about living a good life so
which is it should I be solving problems or shouldn't
I be solving problems how do i reconcile that about
this next one one we tell you that relationships can
give you lots of fulfillment and happiness and that relationships
are one of the highest quality happiness's that you can
have is deep relationships on the other hand we also
tell you that relationships can never make you truly happy
and that you have to make yourself happy from the
inside and that you can't rely on other people to
make you happy so how do you resolve that which
one of those is true another paradox goes like this
we tell you be wise don't make any unwise decisions
in your life make sure that you're making proper choices
so that you're not making the kind of mistakes that
a lot of other people make in society on the
other hand we tell you but some of the greatest
people we know in history entrepreneurs business people whoever that
their lives are constructed around their biggest mistakes and that
failure is good then in fact the more you fail
the better you become the stronger you become so which
is it should I be worrying about making perfect decisions
or should I be making more mistakes to avoid failure
what should I be doing another one goes like this
on the one hand we tell you think about your
life contemplate about your life live a contemplative life where
you're examining your life and you're planning on the other
hand we tell you thinking creates neuroses don't think so
much stop thinking how do you reconcile that what should
I do should I think more or should I think
less about my life about this one work hard to
make yourself more attractive for the opposite sex so if
you want that great girlfriend or that great boyfriend work
on yourself to be more attractive than you'll attract that
person that you really want on the other hand to
be the most attractive don't work at it at all
who will be detached be independent from outcome don't rely
on to the person don't be needy don't even try
to act attractive don't even think about being attractive so
how do I resolve that should I be thinking about
being more attractive and working hard on that or shouldn't
I be how about this next one to get into
a relationship don't need the relationship which basically say states
that if you really need a relationship badly you're desperate
for one then you probably won't get one because no
one wants to be in a relationship with you on
the other hand if you're very independent and you don't
need a relationship at all and you don't want one
then everyone wants to be in a relationship with you
because you're not needy about this one be present how
many times do you hear be present in personal development
circles be present be in the moment be in the
now the power of now so we have people telling
us to be present and then also people telling us
but delayed gratification is good don't focus on the present
people who focus on the present are hedonistic instead focus
on the long-term perspective plan prioritize your life properly don't
live in the present moment live for the future how
do you reconcile these two here's another one on one
hand we tell you be very careful with your mind
and your ego because it's very deceptive so you can't
trust yourself because you're deceiving yourself all the time with
stories and philosophy you create in your mind on the
other hand we also tell you but trust yourself in
fact if trust yourself completely to be successful and really
fulfilled in life so which is it am i deceiving
myself and should I not trust myself or should I
trust myself completely how do I resolve that another one
goes like this never quit persevere we like to champion
perseverance and personal development so never quit on the other
hand prioritize and cut your losses early so that you're
not going down a dead-end so which is it should
I never quit and persevere all the time or should
I quit the things that aren't working for me how
do i resolve that how about this one the paradox
of happiness to be happy don't think about happiness if
you're thinking about happiness then you're not actually happy to
be happy you need to be happy in the moment
so what should i do should I not worry and
think about happiness at all if I do that won't
I be like the rest of the people in the
world who are not happy or should I think and
plan and strategize about happiness in which case I'm thinking
about happiness so much how can I be happy what
do I do about this next one be selfless right
that's a virtue to be selfless to not be selfish
but to be selfless work on yourself really hard so
if you want to be selfless be more selfish and
if you're selfish you won't be selfless so what should
i do should I be more selfish or be most
be more selfless how do I resolve that about this
next one to be the most authentic self that you
can be eliminate yourself eliminate the ego you want to
be the most authentic human being you can be well
eliminate your ego and aren't you using your ego to
want to eliminate the ego bit of a paradox there
and then the mother of all paradoxes which is the
paradox of spiritual enlightenment which goes like this on the
one hand you exist on the other hand you do
not exist literally so what is true do I exist
or don't I exist how do I make sense of
this and then I like this last paradox which is
what I call the mayor of the meta paradox and
the meta paradox goes like this well on the one
hand Leo you're telling me to embrace paradox which means
that I should be open to certain contradictions in my
worldview on the other hand you're telling me to create
this perfect worldview this jigsaw puzzle of understanding which every
piece fits together perfectly so how can I do both
how can I accept paradox and also build my model
of reality at the same time and yeah that's an
additional meta paradox so you can see we have a
lot of paradoxes here these are just the paradoxes of
personal development there's more this is just kind of the
tip of the iceberg there's also paradoxes in Sciences in
the physical sciences and mathematics and linguistics I encourage you
actually go out there and not read up on these
paddocks and just embrace them and study them and kind
of immerse yourself absorb some of them into your system
rather than what I see a lot of people doing
which is kind of getting standoffish as soon as they
see a contradiction or a parent paradox and then they
can't hold the paradox they're not able to hold it
in their mind and what this actually says is it
doesn't say so much about the quality of the information
or the the error in the ideas that you're being
presented but it actually speaks to your closed mindedness and
your neuroses now you might say but Leo shouldn't paradoxes
be resolved after all we don't want contradictions in our
worldview right and that's generally true but you also got
to understand that when you are hung up on a
paradox usually it's because you're coming from an insecure place
and so this is not a problem with the inherent
ideas or the theories but it's mostly a problem with
you and your insecurities and you need to feel certain
most people really really really like to feel certain in
their mind and in their worldview and when your mind
doesn't feel certain about something its agitated this is called
cognitive dissonance but this is not like a science problem
this is not a problem with reality this is the
problem the ego so yes in general you want to
be correcting contradictions and you want to be trying to
understand as much as you can with your mind kind
of grasp stuff but also you have to recognize kind
of the limits of your mind and you have to
recognize that this process of grasping at stuff this is
a lifelong ongoing process so it's not like you just
hear some ideas and everything is great some of these
paradoxes that I just listed off to you has taken
me years of personal development work and experience and study
and reading a bunch of books and listening to seminars
and thinking about it on my own to finally get
a resolution of it years and some of them for
me are still not totally resolved so what does this
mean this means you have to treat your mental model
building kind of like a ongoing process like it's always
under construction you can never put up a sign and
say okay I'm done it's completed there's always more maintenance
work that's being done there's always new pieces that you're
putting into place basically it's kind of like you're assembling
an infinite jigsaw puzzle there's not a hundred pieces not
a thousand pieces there's an infinite number of pieces and
so in your entire lifetime you'll never piece everything together
and in your entire lifetime you probably won't resolve every
contradiction in fact I want you to do a little
experiment with me right now in a second I'm going
to ask you to just pause and I want you
to just look around pause the video if you'd like
just look around but I'm going to be looking around
too so you can do it with me while you're
watching the video just take like 10 or 15 seconds
to do with me get very present in the moment
I want you to take your focus off the video
and what I was saying just look around and just
get in touch with reality reality is happening around you
right now but a lot of times we get out
of touch with the moment just get in touch with
the moment and I'll tell you why it's important all
right ready go okay good did you look around you
get InTouch present in the moment well what happened there
when you were looking around did you see any paradoxes
happening in reality were there any glitches in the matrix
were there any discontinuities were there any contradictions floating around
you are there any contradictions actually inside of reality if
you look around and you're honest with yourself then the
answer is no there's no real contradictions anywhere in reality
so then where are the contradictions and what are paradoxes
if paradoxes don't really exist what are they well paradoxes
are a function of language and they're a function of
your minds desire to conceptualize and model reality inside the
brain so as you're going around you're looking at life
life is very rich very complex there's so much happening
in life that even the most advanced supercomputer could not
simulate it in fact if you think about it then
you could not simulate reality inside of another system because
that system would be itself a part of the reality
so you can't simulate reality reality is like the ultimate
simulation of itself so when your brain is trying to
run a simulation of reality the problem there is just
fundamental the problem is that there's always going to be
a lack and what we naively assume is that well
because we have science and because we have mathematics and
because we have all this fancy technology nowadays and we
you know we're human beings now we feel like we're
masters of the world we've pretty much taken over the
world our technology is so awesome we can send people
into outer space successfully so because of that we know
all reality but actually that's not what's going on what's
going on is like we have a very limited understanding
of reality based on certain concepts that we've created certain
models and these models are very very simplistic so you
look at reality and then you basically take all this
vast richness and then you draw it in a little
schematic form on the back of a cocktail napkin and
then you tell yourself look I figured out reality it's
right here on this little cocktail napkin in this little
equation or in this little theorem or in this little
formula but that's that's very very limited and we need
to recognize the inherent limitations in that process and so
while conceptualizing and modeling stuff might be helpful in certain
situations we don't want to go all out and just
assume that oh well then this is the end-all be-all
and that our models and our cocktail napkins are somehow
actual reality we don't to make that mistake and so
basically when you recognize all this then you start to
recognize that mmm you know I probably shouldn't be taking
my concepts too seriously this jigsaw puzzle that I'm assembling
is not the end-all be-all it's probably not the actual
truth it's not not the actual reality it's just an
approximation and even in the best imaginal imaginable case it's
probably a very very loose very poor approximation of reality
and so any kind of contradictions that I find any
kind of difficulty I have in combining two ideas or
reconciling a couple of ideas or fitting everything together and
some grand theory of everything those are really problems of
my own mind and of my own ego not problems
of of nature and so let me just kind of
chill out and not be so serious about it let
me embrace the paradox let me look at these paradoxes
and say cool let me just play around with them
let me experiment with them let me go try out
both sides of the paradox and just see what happens
what the results are and then I'll trust that over
time stuff will click for me my intuition will kind
of figure stuff out and even if there's something that
I can't quite reconcile that's okay it's not the end
of the world reality is still whole reality is not
affected or threatened by this in any way that's very
natural and you want to be able to keep these
contradictions in your worldview for potentially years on end without
needing to find that security and that certainty see so
many people claim to security uncertainty this is kind of
like the default operation of the human mind the human
wat mind likes to be certain when it's uncertain it
feels afraid it feels insecure it gets angry it gets
frustrated this is called neurosis right self-actualized people have an
increased tolerance for paradox and contradiction rather than a decreased
one sometimes they're irrational people as rational people we get
hung up on this idea that everything needs to be
very rational and we take our rationality so seriously but
as Abraham Maslow talks about when you describe self-actualization you
double up did a lot of study on self actualized
people what he discovered is that they're they're more comfortable
with accepting paradox and the average person more comfortable this
is what makes them wiser this is what makes them
more open-minded more open to new ideas more willing to
explore the intellectual landscape whereas the people who are more
like normal people they're the ones that cling to beliefs
and they're the ones that wrap up their ego in
their worldview and then this creates all sorts of problems
down the road the most important reason that you want
to start getting cool of paradox is because if you
want to be following along with some of my spiritual
enlightened this will be a massive massive theme and all
those videos that there's going to be lots of paradox
very deep seeming paradoxes which are going to boggle your
mind and instead of shying away from them I want
you to be like oh this is cool this is
exciting a new paradox let me go explore in fact
what I want to leave with you with is I
want to leave you with an assignment in the the
bottom in the video description I'm going to leave a
link to a Wikipedia page which has a bunch of
different paradoxes and you can go and you can start
exploring like I said there's paradoxes within mathematics within science
linguistics and all sorts of other areas of life so
it's cool to just go in there and start to
dig around and just to see what are the paradoxes
what have other people said about these paradox because there's
been a lot of great thinkers throughout history that have
faced these paradoxes from the ancient Greeks and Romans all
the way to modern physicists mathematicians and philosophers really hard-nosed
guys so you can go through and take a look
at all those that will be a good kind of
homework assignment for you to help you to get comfortable
and be cool with your not knowing not knowing is
not a bad thing not knowing is a good thing
alright that's it I'm signing off go ahead post me
a comments down below click the like button please also
share this video with a friend and finally come and
sign up to my newsletter right here at actualize that
org it's a free newsletter I release new videos every
single week videos on self actualization topics I'm really excited
to be talking about more advanced topics paradoxical topics topics
that will really challenge your understanding of life and yourself
and of course help you to create that kind of
fulfilling extraordinary life that you want so this is not
just philosophy but we tie the philosophical and abstract concepts
in with actual practical reality so even when we're talking
talking about stuff like spiritual enlightenment all of that will
tie back in with your own happiness your own fulfillment
your own success in life so it's all coming together
if you really want to create a powerful self actualized
life then my advice for you is to do it
on a consistent basis if you like this video watch
the next one watch the next one watch one every
week watch a couple every week do this for a
few years and you'll keep shocked at how different your
life is how much you've grown on the inside and
then how much your outside circumstances reflect the new inner
development that you acquired alright go ahead and up right
now you
