hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm gonna be talking about strategic thinking how to
be a strategic [ __ ] this is a very
important very foundational episode because what I'm gonna tell you
here is gonna make or break the rest of your
life most people's lives suck due to lack of strategic
thinking and on the other hand successful people are highly
strategic thinkers I listen to a course by the Teaching
Company which I highly recommend by the way it's like
a thirty hour course on strategic theory it talks about
military strategy business strategy sports strategy and it was taught
by Stan Lee originally PhD he's a professor who's been
studying military theory and so on for four years and
he did this long and amazing course and as I
was sitting there and listening to this course this was
a couple of years ago I was also thinking about
self-actualization and what I'm doing with actualized org and I
was putting the pieces together and I would just blew
my mind how much strategic thinking goes into self-actualization and
that everything that this professor was talking about from military
theory and business theory which has been studied for now
hundreds of years how all of these same principles apply
to our personal lives as well into self-actualization especially you
see in the fields of military and business and professional
sports there's a long history of studying strategy because in
these fields these fields are highly competitive and very demanding
they demand tangible concrete results those people that win military
victories and win in business and win in sports these
are like the best of the best the stakes are
very high and we've also got a pretty long history
now we've got a multi thousand year history of military
campaigns that humanity has waged on itself that can be
studied and picked apart and we can find the lessons
of all those things and we can we can find
and distill the principles that work right we've also got
now a couple hundred years of real serious hardcore business
that has been happening and we can study those principles
and break them apart and also we've got maybe a
hundred years of professional sports now then we can break
down and break that apart and find the juiciest principles
and what's amazing is that all of these apply to
your personal life I want you to think of yourself
as a general standing on a battlefield and your task
is not just to win the battlefield that's right in
front of you but to win the larger campaign the
war that you've been tasked to win now the question
is what kind of a general are you a successful
general is a highly strategic general he's the one that
will win the battle and go on to win the
war the general that will fail and that will lose
is the general who slacks off and doesn't understand the
principles of proper strategy hasn't even studied what strategy is
you understand that this is this is a field of
study a whole field you can devote your whole career
or and get an entire PhD just studying this stuff
I took a lot of notes while listening to this
course and I'm gonna cite quotes all throughout this episode
from my notes here's the first example of that quote
most people do not engage in a methodical process of
questioning evaluation of assumptions investigation information gathering analysis planning and
finally action most people function in routines that they do
not question living life day to day facing the same
problems every day and quote most people are always struggling
with something and their struggles haunt them till the day
they die people are always struggling with their money or
these people are always quarreling with their co-workers or they're
always dealing with inefficiencies that work the same exact inefficiencies
the same red tape the same limitations the same handicaps
the same relationship problems the same and abilities to communicate
the same inefficient techniques that they've always used they just
keep using those techniques over and over again they're always
putting out some kind of fires or emergencies and it's
always the same kind of fires the same kind of
emergencies this is what the average person's life looks like
this is a person who's not strategic most people do
not sit down and actually strategize they don't strategize deeply
enough and they don't strategize often enough and in the
end they make a lot of strategic blunders in their
lives and they wonder what's wrong with my life how
come I hate my life well this is why but
let's back up a step and talk about what strategic
thinking actually is I'm going to give you some various
quotes that I took here in my notes firstly quote
strategic thinking is setting goals and developing flexible long-range plans
to reach those goals based on careful analysis of internal
and external environments and quote secondly quote thinking logically and
deeply about the future it means that where you want
to be five years from now and five months from
now and five days from now should inform what you
do today and quote thirdly quote it's a way of
looking at the world with a purpose in mind and
quote and fourthly quote it's a way of dealing with
a constantly changing environment both responding to that environment to
achieve your goals and also attempting where possible to change
the environment to your benefit end quote and also quote
is a method or a plan that we craft to
bring about a desired future such as an achievement of
a goal or a solution to a problem that quote
in sports strategic thinking is as following quote studying the
competition learning as much as you can about his tendencies
his habits and his weaknesses and quote and when I
heard that in my mind immediately I just replaced the
the part about in sports with in self actualization work
in self actualization work what we should be doing is
studying the competition learning as much as we can about
his tendencies his habits and his weaknesses are you doing
that who is the competition why do we even need
to be strategic with self-actualization well there is a competitor
and the competitor is you you are in battle with
yourself have you realized that yet have you realized yet
that you are your own greatest enemy have you realized
yet that there's a a a battle inside of you
going on every day between your lower self and your
higher self between your ego and those spiritual drives and
those higher self-actualization drives within you that are pushing you
towards becoming something much greater in your life and that
your lower self and your ego is extremely devious and
extremely crafty and tricky and deceptive it's the most deceptive
thing that there is Maya in the Indian traditions they
call it Maya very important concept so if we apply
strategic thinking to this then we have to say that
what we want to do is we want to study
ourselves learn as much as we can about our own
tendencies their own habits our own weaknesses our own self-deception
mechanisms the mechanisms by which we go unconscious the way
we sabotage ourselves the way we shoot ourselves in the
foot the way we go to war with ourselves that's
where we have to be extremely strategic for most people
this is like a totally new concept it is not
doesn't even occur to them that this is something that
they should be doing let alone I would say not
only should you be doing this this should be the
prime focus of your life the majority of your time
in life needs to be going towards doing this towards
strategizing about your self actualization that's what the majority of
your life should be that's what all your spare time
should be spent thinking about is this very far for
most people to get to this place it'll take a
lot of a lot of changing of your habits and
your thought patterns to get to this point or I'm
telling you get to see most people what they do
is they commit major strategic blunders in their lives the
kind of blunders that would get you killed on a
battlefield if you were this stupid and this short-sighted and
this myopic and this slovenly let me give you an
list of examples of the most common strategic blunders getting
married in your 20s pissing away the prime years of
your life your teens and your twenties playing video games
drinking and partying in college not developing mastery and anything
in life eating junk food not going to doctors chasing
money rather than passion chasing achievement and status rather than
inner growth having kids too soon in life sticking it
out with a bad boyfriend or a bad girlfriend that
you know isn't right for you not continuing your education
after college or not even going to college or not
even getting an education in the first place very big
strategic blunder staying loyal to a dysfunctional family member investing
money in the wrong places thinking that you can get
something for nothing in life going into debt using credit
cards working for a boss or in some sort of
giant company this is a bad strategic mistake working 80
hours a week chasing success climbing the corporate ladder because
you think it'll really get you somewhere that's a huge
strategic blunder being too cheap to hire a therapist or
life coach or being too cheap to buy books or
being too cheap to invest money in a online course
or an information product that could actually help you out
being too cheap to go to a seminar or to
a retreat that could help you out living in the
wrong place hanging out with the wrong people chasing sex
or love and devoting lots of your time and energy
into death neglecting meditation and neglecting enlightenment work taking your
religion too seriously these are huge strategic blunders right here
this is just the tip of the iceberg is just
like some of the most common ones that come to
mind let me talk about some of the strategic mistakes
that people make not these specific blunders but I want
to talk about in general what are the failures of
strategy that happened for people basically it's not doing the
right things at the right time it all boils down
to that but I want to break that down into
more specifics for you so firstly it's not being able
to think micro or macro what does this mean to
be a good strategist in life you need to be
able to think macro which is the big picture and
then you need to be able to also think micro
which is the little logistical planning the detail-oriented stuff right
and you need to jump be able to jump back
and forth between micro and macro and micro and macro
and macro and micro over and over and over again
every single day you need to be able to do
this most people cannot do this they don't know how
to make the jump up or down they get stuck
either in the airy fairy dreamer land and they neglect
the the actual practical execution and the my new should
that's necessary or they get lost in the minutiae of
life and they forget the ultimate goal of what they're
trying to accomplish most people are terrible at this and
this is a skill that has to be developed without
this you cannot be strategic another one is that people
are not able to delay gratification if you can't delay
gratification that you're always just chasing for pleasure for the
most immediate gain and then what strategy can you have
there cannot be a strategy if your strategy is immediate
gain have you noticed that all marketing efforts everything that
everyone ever sells you always plays on your weakness of
delayed gratification everything promised to you is instant it's fast
its flashy it's all the results that you'll get and
then you get used to that and then what happens
is that you just chase that stuff and you forget
that all the really important stuff in life comes through
delayed gratification comes through strategy no one just hands you
valuable [ __ ] on a silver platter in life
you have to earn it through strategy and delayed gratification
could you imagine a general on the battlefield and he's
trying to win this big war like think of world
war two and you're the general who's been tasked with
winning world war two for the Allies and your concern
always in every meeting that you have with your staff
and your and your your military advisors and all your
generals that are working under you you always just go
for the stuff that gives you immediate results that would
be a disastrous military campaign your forces would get defeated
almost instantly also people are generally bad strategists because they're
unaware of the cul-de-sacs in life the dead ends the
things you shouldn't do the things that are traps that
are dangerous that are costly that are risky they don't
take these cul-de-sacs very seriously also in general people lack
Intel could you imagine if I was a general on
the battlefield and I had to win this battle but
I had no intelligence whatsoever about the enemy and I
invested no time preparing the Intel I didn't send out
my spies and I didn't bother to meet with them
and get their reports to hear about what's actually going
on on the battlefield I would just assume that I
knew everything or just neglect the Intel altogether that would
be disastrous disastrous and that's generally what people's lives are
there's zero Intel zero Intel about self actualization zero Intel
about meditation zero Intel about enlightenment zero Intel about life
purpose and how to build a great career and how
to start a business zero intel on how to start
a relationship zero intel on what love is and how
love really works zero intel on the mastery process zero
intel on the psychological development that happens throughout an adult's
life what do you expect what kind of results can
you expect with zero Intel how much energy are you
devoting to building up your reserves of intelligence for me
this is one of the most important things that I
do in my life my whole life is committed to
developing my own intelligence getting the information I need from
multiple sources not just one source because one source can
be unreliable many many sources hundreds and thousands of hours
devoted to gathering Intel because I need to be able
to make important long-range strategic decisions and I can't do
that without Intel most people lack self-knowledge as well how
can you be strategic if you lack knowledge about yourself
if you don't know how you work if you don't
really study the machine that is the human mind and
the he being most people also neurotically overcompensate for the
problems that they have in their lives and this leads
to a whole slew of strategic problems could you imagine
a general who's always reacting to problems on the battlefield
he's not proactive he's not planning his own strategy but
he's just always reactive neurotically react if he gets pissed
off and angry and he gets jealous and he gets
sad and he's just always reacted overcompensating that would be
a terrible general yeah this is how most people live
their lives and then they're surprised at the results they
see another huge strategic mistake people make is chasing the
small prize rather than the large prize they don't know
how to evaluate outcomes and they don't know how to
prioritize into to really judge okay this is a this
is nice but then that's a bigger prize so that
thing is worth more than this thing and then there's
a third thing that's even a bigger prize than this
thing and maybe there's this other factor that renders both
of these things or this third thing not even as
valuable as I thought it was so sometimes we have
a deception we think something's a big prize but then
we realize it's not a big prize it's actually a
small prize what's the biggest prize what should I be
going after should I be fighting this battle here or
that battle there or maybe I shouldn't engage in any
of these battles for now and I'll pick a new
battle in six months to fight the one that's really
gonna matter see most people don't go through this process
they just kind of do the thing that lands on
their lap without really questioning from up from a ground
zero position they don't really question is this even necessary
why am I doing this in the big picture what's
it gonna mean so people can be very hard workers
they can spend 80 hours of a week working on
something for 20 years but the thing they're working on
is a small prize terrible strategy could have save yourself
20 years another thing that people do is that there
are generally oblivious to social and business traps do you
know and have you studied the traps that culture society
and business has laid for you these traps are like
minefields these traps exist in religion in education in the
culture at large in politics in your social circle in
the media advertising all these traps designed to trick you
and to catch you to take your money to get
you involved with the wrong thing that doesn't serve you
but serve somebody else you understand that generally speaking businesses
and social organizations their aims are not to really help
you the level of consciousness Society is currently at is
that the aims of most of these organizations is to
serve themselves at your expense it's to feed off of
you to leech off of you but most people don't
understand this most people just play into it and they
think they're actually getting benefited by this leeching we're in
fact these businesses and these social organizations are parasitic they
they suck your life energy away from you and rob
you of any ability that you have of really self
actualizing and growing to your full potential and contributing meaningfully
to life and improving society they suck you down to
their level most people aren't even aware of this because
they haven't spent the time thinking about this stuff see
a really good general he goes out onto the battlefield
of the morning before and he analyzes the landscape and
he looks and he sees era could the enemy have
lain a trap for me you know that hill over
there that's a suspicious-looking hill there's some trees there and
there's a little ol patch of grass there could be
some enemies lurking there hidden lying in wait for me
tomorrow when we start this campaign or what about that
River down there maybe there's a some kind of dangerous
trap in that river that I need to think about
be careful of so that when I'm crossing that River
my troops don't get slaughtered most people don't do this
with their personal lives also another trap people fall into
is that they don't invest time strategizing zero the average
time that a person invests per week strategizing about life
is zero could you imagine a general who spent zero
time strategizing about his military campaigns he just rushed head-on
into every campaign and just kind of flew by the
seat of his pants that general would be dead very
soon see in terms of military the reason I like
military strategy is because the stakes are so high you're
talking about people's lives you're talking about your own life
in modern times when a general loses a battle he
doesn't even lose his head but a thousand years ago
or 2,000 years ago if you study Roman military strategy
for example or ancient Chinese military strategy stuff like Sun
Tzu right the general was the first one to lose
his head it was always his head that was on
the line so he took his strategy extremely seriously in
a way that even modern generals can't really appreciate because
their lives are not on the line the president's life
is not on the line when he chooses to invade
a country that was not the case 2,000 years ago
his life was on the line so he was much
much much smarter about this it's nice to have that
because it it really makes you sober very very sober
and very you know very very invested in making the
right choices and the right strategies nowadays is so easy
to be complacent in life you know we live in
a pretty comfortable society you can scrape by pretty easily
without being very strategic these days so people get lazy
the stakes aren't high in their minds and so because
this they don't strategize and they piss their life away
by default zero time spent strategizing another huge strategic mistake
people make is not fixing problems at their root most
people only care about fixing problems on the surface not
at the root the commitment to fix a problem at
the root is a very rare thing I see it
so rarely to me is a character trait you either
have this character trait or you don't and most people
don't they just don't care about fixing problems at their
root they just want to fix something enough that they
can just kind of go on with their life keep
coasting that's not how I think that's terribly unstruck teaching
because what this means is that in the future that
problem will come back to bite you in the ass
and I don't know about you but if I face
a problem I want to solve it permanently so it
never ever comes back to bite me in the ass
and lastly most people they don't spend any time developing
their strategic resources I'll talk more about this as we
go on because this is one of the pillars that
I'm going to share with you is a strategic preparation
but you got to prepare your resources what are the
resources that you will need in life to live the
kind of life that you want to live I don't
know about you but me personally my life as early
on as I can remember it's always been about strategizing
about what resources should I build for myself whether it's
more money that I need or I need a certain
amount of time I need to be in a certain
place I need to live in a certain city I
need to live in a different part of the country
I need to have a certain kind of education or
a certain piece of knowledge or a certain skill set
I need to go and build and develop those resources
can you imagine a general on a battlefield who rushes
into battle with no strategic resources he hasn't prepared food
for the troops he hasn't arranged logistical support air support
none of these things have been thought of or taken
care of so he has zero resources besides what he's
going in there with that's all he's got he's got
no reserves he's got no backup plans nothing he's going
to get slaughtered and that's what happens to most people
in life so let me tell you now in a
nutshell the seven pillars of strategic thinking what strategic lean
he actually is here the pillars and then I'll cover
each one in some depth and tell you about it
so the first pillar is strategic intent you need to
have strategic intent for there to be a strategy at
all I'll talk about that in a minute the second
pillar is strategic analysis and gathering of intelligence pretty self-explanatory
but I'll cover it as well to go on also
the third one is strategic preparation that's what I was
just talking about strategic preparation preparing your resources for battle
the fourth principle is concentration of force concentration of force
fifth pillar is disciplined execution and detailed tactical follow-through the
sixth pillar is adaptability and the seventh pillar is the
study of general principles so let's talk about each one
of these pillars and some details so firstly is strategic
intent this is highly important highly highly important here's a
quote that I took from the course quote a compelling
vision of the future that motivates action this is what
elevates a technique into a strategy essential for any effective
strategy and quote this is what strategic intent is strategic
intent is the ultimate thing that you're going for what's
the ultimate outcome you want the ultimate outcome needs to
inform all the steps that lead up to it all
the actions you take when you're highly strategic you're highly
efficient about this you don't just take random actions you
don't just go and fight random battles just for the
sake of fighting battles think about this if a nation
is fighting a war against another nation this is an
extremely costly endeavor it has to be motivated by some
sort of ultimate strategic intent what's the point what do
you want usually you want something and you better be
specific about it you can't be vague and wishy-washy you're
not just there to fight you're there to accomplish a
name what is that do you want to annex the
enemy's territory do you want to fight to ensure peace
do you want to change laws do you want to
conquer the people there do you want to enslave them
what do you want you have to be very clear
about that until you're clear about that you can't have
any strategy whatsoever this is called strategic intent once you
have your strategic heading you're very very clear about it
now what you can do is you can backwards engineer
every step necessary to get you there it's kind of
like if you're gonna do a very long road trip
that's a thousand miles long you better know where you
want to end up because if you just start driving
in any random direction you're basically never gonna be satisfied
with the way your trip goes because you're not gonna
know which way to turn every turn in any way
will be sufficiently good you can't make decisions based on
that most people have zero strategic content in their lives
in their personal lives they have no big picture they
have no overarching vision nothing that compels them towards action
or towards planning of any kind which is why no
planning or action really happens and they complain about lack
of motivation and lack of results of course or what
people do is people just they just apply techniques and
take random steps thinking that this is strategy when in
fact it's not just taking a technique that I share
with you just applying in your life a little bit
here a little bit there that's not enough to get
to the kind of life that we're talking about the
self actualized life you need to be a a much
of a big-picture thinker than that you got to see
10 20 30 years down the road of what you're
shooting for and then everything that you do today and
tomorrow and the next week in the next month and
next year has to all be methodically aligned with that
every single you have to wake up and ask yourself
is this action that I'm taking aligning me and moving
me closer to my ultimate strategic intent or is it
not or is it irrelevant could easily be irrelevant most
of the actions you're taking in your life in fact
right now are irrelevant and tangential or even worse they're
slowing you down and distracting you from achieving your strategic
intent it's very easy for the mind to trick itself
into thinking that oh just because I'm taking this action
here or I'm doing this process here that this is
getting me to where I want to go that's rarely
the case very rarely the case it's very rare to
meet a human being who has a very clear and
strong strategic intent and if you do meet such a
person you'll see that this person accomplishes amazing things in
their life that seem impossible to the outer human being
this is why the general needs to know whether the
battle he's gonna fight here tomorrow is actually going to
advance him towards his ultimate purpose of winning the war
just because you in a battle does not mean that
it gets you closer to winning the war this is
something that has to be always checked and asked and
verified over and over again will winning this battle actually
get me closer to winning the war No then let's
not fight this battle let's save our reserves and use
them where it really is gonna count that's how you
have to think the second pillar is strategic analysis this
is analysis of the strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and
threats that present themselves on the battlefield are you assessing
and acquiring and allocating the necessary resources in the most
effective and efficient uses possible how do you allocate your
time and your energy and your physical vitality and your
charisma and your attention span how are you allocating all
these things what are you putting these things towards in
your life are you using these things efficiently and effectively
to move you towards your ultimate strategic intent also as
part of strategic analysis you have to anticipate and incorporate
competitor responses because the battlefield is not a static thing
it's a very flexible and fluid situation it's always changing
your competitors are smart they're also scheming and strategizing against
you so you have to strategize and anticipate that and
incorporate their potential responses in your strategy now what am
I talking about who's the competitor again the competitor is
not your business competitors the competitors is not your family
members or your friends the competition is yourself when we're
talking about self-actualization are you anticipating the responses of your
ego and your lower self when you're trying to grow
when you're trying to make a change in your life
are you anticipating how your subconscious mind is going to
react how it's going to resist how it's going to
rebel how it's going to trick you the excuses it
will tell you how it will trap you how it
will convince you that you shouldn't change most people have
no awareness of this whatsoever and so of course the
competition always wins the lower self always wins the next
pillar is strategic preparation I've already touched on this but
let me go into some more depth what this means
is the building up of strategic reserves through preparation your
maneuvers will be limited if you have no reserves therefore
you must prepare so again a general on a battlefield
you know he wants to make sure that his troops
have flexibility he needs to provide them with weapons with
armor with vehicles with support with food with water with
clothing with shelter with the back-up plan with a retreat
location they can go back to with some kind of
support structure so that they don't get bombarded from the
air or by arrows right he's to think about all
this stuff he didn't then used to prepare and lay
the groundwork it's not just about rushing in there and
coming up with the best you know tactical move on
the battlefield that wins the war no a lot of
times wars are won or lost based on how well
you prepare for the war do you have enough food
for the winter do you have enough water if you
neglect these very basics then you will get slaughtered on
the battlefield and most people in life neglect these basics
what does it really mean to do strategic preparation it
means thorough training it means hard work it means discipline
it means sound planning and then it also means the
preparation of your unique capabilities every soldier on the battlefield
or every unit of soldiers on the battlefield has unique
capabilities it has unique strengths and also unique weaknesses and
limitations cavalry has certain strengths that infantry doesn't have and
vice versa and then your spearmen have different capabilities than
your archers and your archers have different capabilities than your
aerial units or whatever you need to recognize what these
unique abilities are the need to develop ease in yourself
what are your unique abilities in your personal life are
you developing those how much time are you spending preparing
and bolstering your unique capabilities in life how many hours
a week are you spending doing that for most people
it's zero and of course we wonder why we get
crap results here's a quote that's relevant to strategic preparation
quote since you can't predict what fortune will hand you
you must develop yourself internally to handle the external circumstances
and quote you must develop yourself internally to handle the
external circumstances what else is this describing but self-actualization this
is what self-actualization is about developing yourself internally to handle
the external circumstances of life this is what actually eyes
that org is about this is what I'm here to
do all my work is about how to develop you
internally to be able to handle the external circumstances of
life most people spend no attention on this at all
in their life pay no mind to it whatsoever and
then they fail miserably fail miserably me personally in my
own life I spend the majority of my life in
strategic preparation mode I'm highly strategic when it comes to
preparation because I know that this is one of the
variables that I can control the best I can't always
predict what's gonna happen on the battlefield and I'm not
always the quickest on the battlefield but I can really
sit down and prepare my resources in extremely strategic way
that gives me so much leverage and so much maneuverability
on the battlefield that then it's very hard for me
to lose the battle the next pillar is concentration of
force this is a super important concept which is studied
and taught in all military schools and in any classes
where you're studying military battles and tactics because to win
a military battle it's fundamentally what has to happen is
you have to concentrate force at a point at a
decisive point that breaks through into victory here's a quote
from my notes quote concentration of force at the decisive
point is the key to all strategy it's all about
directing as much force to one point as possible given
your limited resources this applies to war as much as
it applies to career development and to business ed quote
are you even aware that this is what strategy is
all about it's all about finding the weak point on
the battlefield and and then pushing all your troops at
that weak point to get a breakthrough and that's a
battlefield analogy how would we apply that to your personal
life well how are you concentrating your forces in your
personal life because you've only got so much time and
so much energy and so much money and so much
attention in your day how are you concentrating those where
are you putting all your eggs into which basket are
you putting it into the right basket or the wrong
basket are you hitting problems where the enemy is strongest
instead of where the enemy is weakest are you finding
the weak spots are you finding the spots where your
force can really have the most leverage most people don't
even think about this stuff they don't their energy and
their focus is dispersed all over the place they're doing
10 20 different things in their career in their relationship
and this and that and this and what's happening nothing
is really moving forward because they're not properly concentrating a
force see everyone has limited resources that's what makes it
so important to concentrate those resources properly not to waste
them not to piss them away the next pillar is
detailed execution after you come up with a plan and
you've gathered up your strategic resources and now you know
where to concentrate your force now what you have to
do is you have to execute on the plan a
great plan poorly executed leads to disaster great execution with
a poor plan also really leads nowhere it's highly inefficient
highly non strategic you need both you need both and
most people are very poor executors I have a whole
episode it's a pretty popular one it's called how to
get [ __ ] done which talks about many important
points about what it takes to get results to be
a results maker in life to really be good at
execution this is something that you need to make a
study of it's really a study at one point in
my life I had I just went all-out on execution
just focus so much on execution because I knew that
I need to get good at execution and I became
a good executor and now so that's something that takes
years it takes years to really become a good executor
it's not something you can do in a week especially
if you spend the last ten or twenty years being
a poor executor you've developed all sorts of bad habits
that now need to be unwired so check out that
episode if you want to learn more about how to
do proper detailed execution I'm gonna move on to the
next pillar which is adaptability strategy is not about selecting
the ultimate one best strategy and then going with it
forever that's actually a mockery of strategy proper strategy is
all about being flexible and adaptable it's about understanding that
the environment is constantly changing every day what the battlefield
looks like today tomorrow might be totally different it might
rain tomorrow that will totally change the battlefield the troops
might lose their morale tomorrow totally changes the situation that
we're dealing with they might be out of food tomorrow
or out of water or half of them might be
dead totally changes the situation so whatever plans I have
tonight tomorrow morning I'll have to be able to adapt
in case things change and I have to plan in
such a way where I don't have this rigid plan
that tells me well X happens then Y happens then
Z happens and they'll all just go swimmingly according to
plan no you have to plan for all the contingencies
and you have to plan for all the disasters all
the misfortunes that might happen see a common naive mistake
that people make when they do personal developments they just
think well okay let me just sit down and you
know come up with a plan so I come up
with my three-year plan for my life and then what
happens and then a month later all of a sudden
you're not following that plan at all because your plan
is over here and then real life is over here
and they're just a golf apart no that doesn't work
high quality strategy requires that your plan be flexible take
into account all sorts of different scenarios and contingencies and
you have to be able to sit down and rewrite
the plan every week every day if necessary be flexible
don't get too rigid don't get dogmatic about your plan
don't get attached and cling to your plan as though
it's your baby and it's the only thing if this
is the only way it's got to be is through
this plan no that's very poor strategy your you'll get
slaughtered if you do that you got to be adaptable
a lot of times people start business you know they
start a new business they come up with a business
plan and they think that this is how it's gonna
go this is how my business gonna generate money and
then in reality it doesn't work this is the naive
business plan this is the person who starts business for
the first time and of course they fail pathetically miserably
fail because to get a successful business model going you
have to try a lot of different stuff you have
to experiment you have to see what actually works in
the marketplace what actually works on the battlefield a lot
of times this stuff is unknown you're dealing with a
lot of unknown variables you're not gonna have all the
Intel you're never going to have perfect Intel which means
that you have to be very adaptable you have to
be willing to change your business plan completely throw it
out and get a new business plan some of the
most successful businesses started out with with one idea of
how they're going to earn money and that didn't work
and they went in a totally different direction and then
they made billions PayPal and an example this PayPal as
a business started out as a mobile payment processing for
Palm Pilots and that of course didn't work and then
they they got the bad idea hey why don't we
just email each other payments let's create a system that
allows people to email each other money and then they
came up with PayPal generated billions of dollars but see
they were flexible enough to change because if they just
stuck with their original idea they would have gotten nowhere
would have went bankrupt that's very important that's why I
always talk about open-mindedness how important open-mindedness is most people
are so stuck in Dogma and their beliefs about how
life is and how spirituality is and religion has to
be this way and education has to be this way
and personal develop a personally in my life I can't
afford rigidity I can only afford flexibility because to be
the most strategic I can be I have to be
extremely adaptable I have to be willing to throw away
everything everything I believe has to be on the table
on the chopping block and in a sense everything I
believed and do believe will get eventually replaced and thrown
away because there's always better beliefs there's always better models
there's always better something better to come and replace whatever
you currently hold is true and the last principle or
the last pillar is the study of principles the study
of principles quote regardless of how chaotic situation may be
there are principles that can give shape to your thinking
about the situation emerge and in such principles allows for
genius flashes of insight and quote you need to study
the principles the proper principles of battle if you're in
general and you need to study the proper principles of
life and self-actualization if you're a human being trying to
live your ordinary life and this actually this is something
I make easy for you because this is what actualize
networking is about this is all that actual eyes that
we get it's the study of the principles that make
life amazing it's all the principles that control your psychology
and how life works and how relationships work and how
interaction with people works how your mind works some of
these principles have been known for thousands of years but
most people they don't make a study of it see
and you might say well only I'm already listening to
you well that's good but you're just listening to me
there's a big difference between listening to me and making
a study of these principles someone who makes a study
of self-actualization principles is like someone who sits down watches
the video from start to finish take notes on everything
re reads his notes study his notes in the morning
and then at night again and then washes the video
again drills it into his subconscious mind and then he
thinks that he contemplates it deeply he doesn't just accept
what I say he thinks about it he integrates it
into his own worldview he combines multiple sources cross-references everything
checks everything against his own intuition make sure everything is
fitting in with his own life he thinks about ways
how to apply these principles that's what it means to
make a real study of the principles it's someone who
he's not just looking for a fix he's looking for
a deep understanding and a mastery of the principles of
life that's that's a whole nother level of commitment and
dedication and of course it Italy yields to a whole
nother level of results whole nother level of results which
is why I want to convince you and sort of
psych you up to to get excited about learning these
principles right I want you to just to make this
a lifelong process I want you to get us excited
about self actualization as I am in my own life
to really make a study of it so those are
the seven principles and seven pillars rather I should say
of strategic thinking this is what it takes your life
will only become satisfying once you start to make wise
strategic decisions that's the only way it's gonna happen you
know in the movie Pulp Fiction I like that movie
towards the end there's a scene there with samuel l.jackson
and he's getting he's getting robbed and he has to
give his wallet up to the thieves and then later
he asked for the wallet back and they give him
the wallet back and on the wall and it says
bad [ __ ] in big letters bad [ __
] on it's kind of embroidered on the wallet I
really like that and I was thinking about that scene
today and I thought you know what would be even
better if it said strategic [ __ ] on that
wallet strategic [ __ ] cuz that's how I think
about myself in my own life and that's how I
want you to think about your life from now on
is that you are going to be a strategic [
__ ] using these principles and pillars that I talk
to you about hey your whole attitude towards life needs
to change from the complacent lazy one you've been having
to this one where you're a strategic [ __ ]
where every move you make every step you take has
a purpose in mind where you're almost Machiavellian about every
action that you take not a neurotic negative way I'm
not mean I'm not saying that you should go and
cheat people rip them off I'm not saying that you
need to be all manipulative like that I'm just saying
you've got to be very clear about every single step
you're taking where its leading you why you're doing it
what the priority is and then how it fits into
the bigger picture of everything for you and then what
kind of resources you need to develop in order to
allow you to do that I've been a strategic [
__ ] since I was like seven years old I
don't know it just probably came naturally to me I
don't know why other people aren't this way but like
since seven years old I've been thinking about what my
career is gonna be and exactly how I'm gonna do
it and where I'm gonna go with school am I
gonna go to what am I gonna learn what degrees
am I gonna get I'm always thinking like 20 years
ahead how much money am I gonna have what that
money's gonna allow me to do where am I gonna
live what if I do this what about that my
mind just doesn't stop with this just keeps going just
the other day I was thinking about what the end
of my life is gonna look like what do I
want actually I don't to look like when I'm 70
years old on my deathbed what do I want to
achieve what do I want my legacy to be I'm
thinking about that stuff now when I'm 30 I'm already
planning for that what I did yesterday what was already
setting me up for that for what I want when
I'm 70 years old I don't just think about it
I actually then take action on it you know lately
been thinking about how to position myself strategically so that
I can just be a yogi that's my thing now
that's kind of like my strategic intent right now in
my personal life is I just I just have this
picture of me being a yogi that's where my life
is lean what else am I gonna do with my
life honestly like there's no point in in success for
me there's no pleasure in success for me there's no
like there's just there's no real reason for me to
go and do more business and to become more successful
or um more popularly there's just so little that's really
worthwhile for me because I've studied so much of these
principles that is just you know you say you know
these principles the only option really for you if you're
wise is to become a [ __ ] yogi that's
like the only thing that there is to do with
your life that's it that's pretty much all that there
is I spent eight hours the other day sitting doing
absolutely nothing for eight hours I wasn't particularly meditating I
just sat there and did nothing for about eight hours
it's hard to do I wasn't perfect at you know
I check my email once or twice and I got
up and you know ate and drove around a little
bit but generally I spent eight eight hours just like
not doing any business not doing any work not reading
any books just sitting there because I was testing out
what it's like to be a yogi right cuz like
in my mind when I say I want to be
a yogi it's like I'm gonna sit for 12 hours
and do absolutely [ __ ] nothing and that's my
perfect life that's my strategic intent I'm moving towards that
now what do I need to do that there's a
lot of preparation that goes into it it might sound
like well you can just go do that right now
not quite there's a lot of like little tactical stuff
that I have to figure out how to do to
make that work and there's still issues I haven't resolved
there I have to resolve that what's gonna happen with
my business what's gonna happen with my relationship what's gonna
happen with my diet what's gonna happen to all these
things these things all need to change drastically in order
to support this kind of lifestyle but already I'm planning
it for it right so this is what I mean
by being strategic also what comes to mind for me
I've been watching it's kind of bad but I've been
watching house of cards watched that show with Kevin Spacey
a really interesting show but when I think about that
show and I think about Kevin Spacey yeah Kevin Spacey's
character there he is a perfect example of what I
would call a strategic [ __ ] now he takes
it to the extreme in a kind of a negative
narcissistic egotistical way so I would encourage you doing that
but he is a highly strategic [ __ ] you
can't argue with that that's how you need to be
in your life every step has to be leading to
the next step to the next step to the next
step to the next step even if what you ultimately
want is you just want to be sitting there doing
nothing blissing out under a tree like the Buddha if
you want that be a strategic [ __ ] to
get that because even that is something you will not
get without lots of strategy strategy is not just about
blind success you can apply strategy to anything you want
a loving relationship apply strategy to that you're gonna have
to if you want one you want to raise great
kids apply strategy to that so this is this isn't
just related to work or to earning money in fact
you know earning money and just going to work and
running a business in those situations it's actually kind of
natural to be strategic most people tend to be strategic
there where they're not strategic is in their personal lives
and their spiritual lives in their love lives in their
whole attitude towards life I'm extremely strategic in what I
ultimately want out of my life my ultimate ultimate ultimate
ultimate strategic intent in life is to die knowing that
I lived well knowing that my life not that it
mattered in some global sense to people that's kind of
silly I don't really care about that these days what
matters to me is that I can look back over
my life before I die and I can say yeah
that will um that was the way I wanted to
live my life that was it I don't have any
regrets I didn't piss my life away I had this
one life I knew from an early age I knew
that this was the only one I'm gonna have and
then I'm gonna make something of it that I'm proud
of and that that's what I worked for and that's
what I got that's my ultimate strategic intent and so
um I realize just the other day that you know
to do that to fulfill that I have to work
less that's why is that for eight hours did nothing
that actually moved me might seem like well sitting and
doing nothing is doing nothing what did that accomplish no
actually that moved me towards my strategic intent that's exactly
what was necessary because life is counter-intuitive sometimes when you're
working you're actually shooting yourself in the foot which was
what I wasn't was now seeing for myself I know
but that's just me you don't have to do that
you'd have to live the yogi lifestyle that's my personal
preference that's kind of like what I'm going for you
can do whatever you want with your life I don't
really care but just be strategic about that's the point
