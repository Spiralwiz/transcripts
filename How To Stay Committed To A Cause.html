hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org in
this video I want to talk about commitment and I
want to give you an example of what it takes
to be committed to your life purpose Hey all right
commitment let's talk about this let's crack into it I
want to get really practical with you guys in these
videos and I want to give you more and more
details about what does actually mean about some of these
concepts because sometimes when you get these concepts I know
what's going on in your head and I let you're
dismissing them because you're missing the depth and the impact
that they can really have on you and one of
the things that I think I can do is share
more examples of what I really mean and a lot
of times you'll be surprised by how these concepts actually
get fleshed out in real life and how it give
me something something very simple that you just overlook you
don't really notice these things until you you start to
study this stuff like I do and when I give
you these examples I think we're gonna do is solidify
in your mind what I'm really talking about so one
of the things that I want from you is I
want commitment from you and I want you to be
working taking action on your goals and one of the
things that I mean by commitment because commitment can be
an abstract term what the hell is commitment mean how
do you quantify commitment well I got a perfect example
for you today it's actually something I kind of struggled
with a little bit so a little technical fact is
that as I'm shooting these videos what I do is
I use an expensive wireless microphone wireless microphone system plugs
into the camera I've got it on my on my
hip here and this microphone system takes two double-a batteries
on each the receiver and the transmitter so it's four
double A batteries and I don't know how much time
does do I get I usually get maybe I'd say
four hours of recording on on four of those batteries
so just you know one set of batteries will get
me about four hours of footage and then the battery
dies out and then I need to replace those to
shoot more video and so what's the point well the
point is that I kind of have been putting myself
on track to be releasing a lot of content a
lot of video for you guys and I want to
keep doing that for the long run and so today
I had a pack of maybe 12 batteries I'm starting
to run low and so I went to where would
I go I went to Home Depot to buy some
more batteries and I'm stocking up and as I'm there
I'm looking at the battery counter and there's all sorts
all sorts of brands all sorts of sizes in the
packages I'm looking for the double A's and I've seen
packages you know I see a four pack I see
an eight pack I see a twelve pack another twelve
pack that's nice I want something you know something big
because I plan to be shooting more of these videos
I'm committed to that so twelve pack looks good then
I select what is more than twelve how about a
20 pack did have a 20 pack sure enough they
have a 20 pack then I look do they have
anything bigger like a 30 pack sure enough there's like
a thirty six pack of Energizer's like yeah that's that's
what I should be getting right I mean why I'm
gonna save some money if I do that but ultimately
you know why would I not do that if I'm
serious about releasing this content am i serious about or
not why am i hesitating I found myself hesitating and
it's not like I have a money problem I don't
have a shortage of money so I can splurge and
buy as many batteries as I really want it's not
going to really affect my bottom line but psychologically what's
happening in my mind is there's a little bit of
a war going on it's a little subtle if you're
not sensitive to it and what was happening was there
I was standing there as I was thinking on the
one level I saw some limiting beliefs I still have
about money and scarcity and I still thought myself ii
do i really need 36 energizer batteries you know what
am i gonna do with that many of them what
if I end up not liking the Energizer's and maybe
I want some other brand later then I'm gonna have
all these leftover batteries or what happens if they expire
and then I actually picked up the packages are looking
at expiration dates I'm wondering like am I gonna even
be able to burn through that many batteries in the
next year or two however long the battery lasts I
wasn't sure so started looking at the expiration dates and
by the way batteries last forever so there's a problem
there but the other thought that I was having was
I was really the bottom line of it what I
was doing was I was questioning whether this is something
that I'm committed to because on the one hand logically
I'm saying yes I'm committed to this I'm committed to
releasing lots of content I want to be doing this
for at least the next few years of my life
I'm just gonna devote myself to creating content maybe even
longer if things are going great so I've committed myself
to that but see I'm still working the process it's
not just simple it's not black and white you start
off and you tell yourself consciously but it's still not
really permeated on the subconscious level it's not totally you
you don't always believe everything you tell yourself and that's
how it should be that doesn't mean you're bullshitting yourself
you're moving yourself up you're kind of bootstrapping yourself and
bootstrapping yourself can be tricky it can be tough sometimes
your mind will resist so in this case my mind
was resisting a little bit I noticed that I wasn't
fully bought in with the battery situation and I'm like
well you know what I mean why why am I
not practicing what I'm preaching here I mean I'm telling
you guys to be committed I'm telling myself even my
highest self is telling my lot telling my lower self
that I'm committed and that I'm willing to do this
I'm gonna be spending the next few years doing this
so logically it just makes sense that I would stock
up on as many batteries I can get because I'm
burning through batteries so quickly that realistically I'm gonna be
burning through probably 36 batteries in a month if not
in a few weeks because of how much content I
shoot so that being the case all you can easily
be able to use those batteries but even as I
was having that argument with myself I still noticed resistance
the lower self was resisting and it was sayin but
what if I want to leave my options open right
what if I decide to this wasn't really what I
want to do maybe I decided I want to do
something else maybe I stopped shooting video maybe something happens
and uh you know not too smart too to stock
up in that case right but see what I'm doing
there is I'm leaving my options open sometimes it's smart
to leave your options open I'm not saying you should
always cut make make these decisions and make these cuts
sometimes you want to keep stuff open great but sometimes
you want to make a cut you wanna make a
clear cut and you want to say this is it
I'm all-in I'm committed it's a little bit of a
technique you know a little bit of a kind of
a mindfuck that you run on yourself to get yourself
to follow through on the stuff that you said you're
gonna follow through on it stuff I mean sometimes I'm
really excited to be shooting these videos usually I am
but it's still tough to motivate myself to get up
here and do this stuff I mean I have to
summon charisma and energy and knowledge and resources that I
would rather not just have to summon I mean I'd
rather sit on the couch and do nothing honestly I
mean not that would be easier more comfortable than being
up here in front of a bright light and shooting
all this stuff and worrying about whether I said everything
I wanted to say and getting it right and editing
in and posting in and then trying to make sure
that you guys are happy with it and I'm happy
with it I mean that's more of a hassle than
not doing it right but there's something higher there that
I'm working towards I'm making a commitment I'm making a
commitment and I'm recommitting this is key you don't make
a commitment once you keep re committing because I can
guarantee you that even if you find that perfect fit
that perfect life purpose that perfect cause in your life
that perfect business that perfect job just that perfect vocation
for you your life calling you find it you feel
awesome the next week I mean your life can still
feel pretty dull and in fact you can feel depress
the next week because you were on a high now
you're on the low that's how it is sometimes and
then some you get some snag here you get some
snag there something doesn't quite go the way you want
it to go you're becoming butthurt about it becoming depressed
about it all the sudden you start going into a
spiral of negative thinking worried pessimism all the sudden you
start thinking about failure too much all your old limiting
he's come back in a big bright flash and what
do you want to do you want to quit you
want to cut you want to run you want to
pull yourself out of that commitment oh yeah you don't
want to be commit at that point but what you
got to do is you got to realize that it's
all a trick it's your mind with you it's your
mind trying to keep you where you're at and not
where you should be and so what you got to
do is you got to push yourself through and you
say this is tough this is a really tough time
but I'm pushing through and I'm not gonna say this
battery situation was really tough for me it was just
a subtle thing but I want you to notice how
commitment gets translated into something very tangible wait one second
look batteries right what am i into buying I bought
60 double-a Rayo max 60 batteries look at that 60
bad boys so now I am excited to create enough
content to burn through 60 batteries this is about 15
four-hour sessions of footage so I got a lot of
recording to do this is what I mean about commitment
this is practical this is tangible and what I want
you to be doing with all the information that I'm
sharing with you throughout all these videos not just this
one but all the rest is I want you to
always keep in mind that everything that I'm telling you
that seems abstract it is abstract it's a principle it's
a guideline it's a rule of thumb but you need
to take it upon yourself to then find ways of
applying it because this this is how I interpreted commitment
this works for me this is not going to work
for you you don't need 60 double A batteries it's
not gonna do anything for you you need something else
in your life commitment for you is gonna mean something
totally different but the idea of it is still going
to apply the abstract principle is gonna apply how it's
gonna actually manifest that's for you to decide you have
to use your best judgment but all these concepts that
I'm throwing at you they are practical so don't tell
me they're abstract you just aren't using the way that
I want you to be using them you're not taking
the initiative you still have to do the work I'm
not here to solve your problems I'm here to give
you ideas I'm here to inspire you and to keep
you honest with yourself and to keep you accountable to
your highest self and I do that by providing wisdom
knowledge inspiration whatever so this is what it comes down
to right start to be smart about this start to
see how wisdom manifests in the world in practical ways
like this and you will start moving forward really fast
in your life because all the stuff that you know
is right you're gonna start doing it and it's gonna
start manifesting it's gonna start happening you're just gonna start
taking action and stuff it's going to connect with you
and you're gonna say ah so that's what that principle
meant and you're gonna start to say oh okay so
that principle is actually it was abstract but it was
actually kind of powerful there's power in the abstractness of
it because I can give you very very my new
shoe type tips and try to end techniques but that's
not going to make you resourceful plus it's just not
very practical with this format where I don't really know
you too well through the camera but the more powerful
thing here is that you start to develop an understanding
an appreciation of what abstract principles and ideas can do
for you when you start to see that Wow when
you really feel it you really buy into this that
wisdom can actually be practical and can actually be transformative
to your life and improve your life in very tangible
ways what's gonna happen is that you're really gonna buy
into this whole idea of self mastery than I'm promoting
you're gonna buy into the self-help movement you're gonna start
reading books you're gonna start accumulating more wisdom you actually
gonna start thinking about wisdom and that's what you need
it's not enough to just sit here and absorb information
for me it's not even enough to go and apply
a principle I want you to go above and beyond
that I want you to not only apply a principle
successfully but to see how this works but I want
you to start to cultivate a deep appreciation and understanding
that these principles are power and that you should want
to learn about them and understand them almost for their
own sake not even for what they do for you
although they can do a lot but almost for their
own sake because of the power that they have and
then the majesty of wisdom all right so this is
