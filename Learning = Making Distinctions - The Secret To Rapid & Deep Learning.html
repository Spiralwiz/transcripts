one of the biggest secrets to wrap it in deep
learning is making distinctions and in fact this episode here
is really like a part three in a miniseries that
we got going on learning the first one was called
an episode called learning equals behavior change and the second
one was called learning equals observation so those were two
distinct episodes that gave you a certain perspective on learning
and I told you in those episodes these are just
particular perspectives and so now here I want to give
you a third perspective on learning which is that learning
equals making distinctions and will elaborate upon this in great
detail and give you examples and exercises to drill this
home for you but as an aside before we get
to that why do I cover learning so much why
does the topic of learning warrant three or even more
episodes there probably will be more in the future well
because learning is one of the master keys to all
of life if you can figure out how to learn
or in other words if you can learn how to
learn and you master this process this will be a
meta skill one of the most valuable meta skills that
you'll have throughout the rest of your life that you
will use to transform every aspect of your life from
your spirituality to your relationships to your business to your
dating life and to your art and many other things
so the point here and it's a really simple point
is that to really learn something learning is not about
memorization of facts like they taught you in school see
one of the biggest problems with school as is structure
today is that school doesn't actually teach kids and teens
how to learn and so once they get at school
they have filled their minds with a bunch of ideology
and a bunch of paradigms and beliefs and facts that
these kids have been forced to memorize and hey you
know I went through this whole process myself and a
certain amount of that is necessary but it's way too
so they fill your mind with all of that garbage
but they don't actually teach you how to teach yourself
and then people go the rest of their life not
really learning anything so one of the keys to learning
is making distinctions and I mean it really is that
simple just go into every situation making finer distinctions specifically
specifically go into every situation where you want to learn
something with an intention to find distinctions and to make
nuanced distinctions so I'll give you some examples from my
own life and then I'll give you some exercises and
show you how this works so in my own life
recently I went through the whole process of buying a
house I just bought a house it's the first house
that I've ever bought and it was a very interesting
experience because I didn't just go and buy a ready-made
house this house was actually built for me from the
ground up so I selected a plot of land which
was just barren desert basically and then and then they
built the house it took them like five or six
months to build it and so on anyways not to
go too far afield here but what was interesting about
this process was because the reason I bring this up
is that when you're building a house and I was
sort of involved with the design process because I get
to sit down and pick out you know what all
the interior features of the house were going to be
it wasn't a fully custom house it was based off
a model so I didn't actually like do you know
work with an architect er but but I did a
lot of the interior decor options and stuff like that
and there was so much stuff there like you you
have no idea until you buy a house and you
go through the design process of picking out all the
stuff like you have to make such fine distinctions and
if you don't then your house is not going to
come out the way you want and this is actually
a little specific example of a much broader problem that
we encounter in life is that anything that you want
to really accomplish in life in a masterful way requires
that you make really fine and nuanced and accurate and
clear distinctions so with this house when I first started
like I didn't know any of the terminology for any
of the stuff in the house now of course I'm
familiar with lights and wall sockets and all of this
but there's there's like so many fine distinctions to make
like which kind of wall sockets where should they be
located on the wall how far apart which walls deserve
a wall socket which ones don't and then you know
and then like within every category there's further and further
distinctions that could be made and if you're wanting your
house to come out the way you want then you
have to walk around and inspect everything that they're doing
because as they're building it of course they're making mistakes
they're placing things in the wrong areas and if you're
not careful you don't have a keen eye for spotting
these distinctions and differences and noticing where things are that
they should be or shouldn't be you got to point
those things out otherwise the house is not gonna come
out the way that you want distinctions between colors distinctions
between different textures different types of wood different types of
marble different types of quartz and surfaces and then distinctions
between different types of insulation different types of wiring different
types of heating electrical systems and AC units and all
of this and then plants what kind of decor do
you want for your landscaping you know even distinctions between
like the kind of pebbles that they're gonna use on
your driveway or in your yard many different types of
pebbles now how do you know which pebbles do you
need and this is a challenging process sometimes you're sitting
there and not only do you have to make the
distinctions but then you also have to clarify for yourself
what kind of preferences you have like do I prefer
these kinds of pebbles or those kinds of pebbles do
I prefer this shade of grey for the walls or
that shade of grey for the walls how do I
know that was an interesting process and then actually I
started thinking about like what kind of landscaping I want
and I decided that I want a palm tree but
then I knew nothing about palm trees of course we've
all seen palm trees our whole entire lives most of
us probably have if you grow up in that kind
of are the where there are palm trees a lot
of them in America and the West especially and but
I didn't know like what kind of palm tree should
I plant so I went to a giant nursery where
they have palm trees and I was walking around for
hours just studying palm trees and I went to various
kinds of nurseries I research stuff online but you know
online is not so good because you don't actually get
a feel for the size of the tree and the
different variations of the trees and so forth and their
costs and so forth so I actually went to a
nursery walked around for hours and looked at different pumps
and you'd be amazed within a few weeks of doing
this I learned every fine distinction between different kinds of
palm trees I learned like every different palm tree that
exists Canary Island date palms Mediterranean fan palms Sabal palms
Queen Peru palms King Peru palms pygmy palms and and
other ones that Mexican fan palms there's like eight palms
there's so many four types but you learn them and
then what was so amazing about this process is that
now every time I'm driving down the road just throughout
a city that has palm trees I'm looking just my
mind is subconsciously looking for palm trees and immediately naming
them labeling them making fine distinctions between them and even
assigning like dollar amounts to palm trees like I could
be driving down the road or I'm just standing there
at a red light near some shopping center and I
see like oh there's eight palm trees oh these are
date palms and they're such and such these are fully
mature date palms they must be like thirty years old
and each one of them must cost five thousand dollars
and then I can kind of tally that whole thing
up in my mind and get a price tag for
what those trees are worth it it was an amazing
process to go through that because I was very conscious
of how I was making these distinctions so of course
you and your life you've probably mastered some domain of
life whether it was in school you master some subject
whether it was math history there's a poetry whatever or
you're good at something you're good at computer programming maybe
you're good at writing maybe you're good at critiquing film
maybe you're good at analyzing video game mechanics because you've
played a bunch of video games your whole life and
so on so what I would suggest to you is
that any area in your life where you're masterful or
you're skillful and and good you're an expert in something
you're able to make fine distinctions and you've spent years
making these or sanctions now what's different though about this
episode and what I'm teaching you now is that even
though in your life you have subconsciously and implicitly been
using the technique of making distinctions you've done you've done
this throughout school you've done this throughout University and your
work and so on with your hobbies even even with
your entertainment you've been doing this with music you've been
doing this with sports you've been doing this and in
many other domains you've been doing this but you've been
doing it unconsciously and the difference now is that I'm
gonna teach you how to do this explicitly so that
now when you go into a new situation you're gonna
have in the back of your mind this memory of
this conversation that we've had this lesson that you're learning
today and you're gonna remember like oh now that I'm
going to the situation I can set an intention because
I know this is a like a learning situation I'm
going into and I want to rapidly learn this thing
and to really master it consciously now not unconsciously and
now you can explicitly use this technique of making distinctions
so the way this technique works is that of course
you've used it like I said in many areas of
your life and many times in your life but the
difference now is that when you go into this new
situation or it could be an old situation that you're
still working on mastering you go into this situation and
now you actually set the intention the explicit intention of
making distinctions recognizing that that is what learning is about
is making these distinctions and so you actually go into
the situation and you will specifically look for contrasts and
differences between different elements and components of whatever field you're
studying or trying to master and you will notice that
now that you're doing it explicitly consciously with intention you're
deliberately asking questions that try to highlight differences between the
different elements and you're actively looking for those differences you
will see that you learn to spot the differences much
faster and the whole process will just be much more
clear explicit and conscious than it ever was before and
in this way you're going to be able to learn
deeper and much more rapidly that's my claim and one
of the techniques are going to be using to do
this is you're going to be specifically trying to amplify
contrasts and differences between things that you're studying or trying
to learn so for example let's take the example of
shopping for a car normally a person shops for a
car he or she just goes to the dealership walks
around looks at different models maybe asks to see the
interior maybe takes one for a test drive that he
likes something like that right it's sort of an unconscious
lazy process but if you're gonna apply this method of
making intentional distinctions doing this consciously what you're going to
do is you're going to go into the dealership and
your mind is going to be focused with that intention
of drawing contrast between all of your different options so
now every time you're looking at a car you're gonna
be actually comparing you'd be asking yourself that question of
like well how is that model different from this model
or how are they the same both of these questions
are very powerful questions how are they different and how
are they the same really it's the same question just
being asked sort of in the inverse because by seeing
how they're the same you see how they're not different
or by seeing how they're different you're seeing how they're
not the same you see just inverses of each other
so we're like a concave and convex so when you're
talking to a dealer you can then actually consciously ask
the person who's shown you the car specifically what's the
difference like well what's the difference between the tires on
these two cars and what's the difference between the engines
and what's the difference about their interior and what's the
difference in terms of their price what's the difference in
terms of their financing what's the difference in terms of
the warranty what's the difference in terms of the different
brands that might be a toyota this might be a
Mercedes or something in your comparing them and I mean
you would have been doing this anyways it's just that
you would have been doing it unconsciously sloppily less masterfully
and therefore it simply would have taken you a lot
more time to actually learn all these distinctions and therefore
you would have been making poorer choices probably you would
have bought a less than optimal car for you and
then through that process you know if trial and error
of course you you learn to make these distinctions anyways
you've been doing it your whole life but here you're
just making the conscious the process more conscious and and
towards dissent I actually have a I'm gonna give you
two exercises that I want you to try to actually
do to sort of homework assignments cuz this is a
very sort of hands-on and practical teaching this is not
a very abstract theoretical you know metaphysical discussion this is
this is pretty hands-on type of stuff the thing you
have to understand about distinctions is that to actually draw
a distinction first of all there are many degrees of
drawing a distinction you can draw a mild distinction or
you can draw a really sharp one you can have
a vague notion of a distinction or a very clear
notion of a distinction and it's almost like carving a
groove into a stone like if we have a stone
tablet and I just give you a knife and you
just sort of chisel at it scrape away at it
you might carve a little bit of it but you're
gonna carve a very faint groove it'll be maybe a
hairline groove in this in this stone but if you
keep doing it over and over and over again you
can chisel through through that stone a really deep groove
you see and so that's sort of like what making
a distinction is like inside your own mind and so
when you're doing it consciously with intention deliberately asking these
questions and trying to compare and contrast things then you're
you're deliberately it's like taking a knife and just running
it through that groove over and over and over and
over and over again many times until that distinction becomes
very clear in your mind and if you notice any
human being who's masterful at anything whether it's art entertainment
sports film video games combat martial arts military strategy business
marketing relationships spirituality psychology philosophy mathematics science physics biology whatever
whatever they're an expert in they are so masterful precisely
because they have so much experience drawing these very fine
distinctions so when a newbie comes into some situation like
when a newbie starts thinking about politics or a newbie
starts to learn how to cook their distinctions are so
gross and so sloppy and so imprecise that like a
newbie cook doesn't know the difference between boiling rice for
10 minutes or boiling it for 20 min doesn't know
the difference between undercooking a piece of salmon or overcooking
a piece of salmon doesn't know the difference between cooking
that salmon on low heat or medium heat or high
heat you see like for a master chef he's gonna
have very fine degrees of distinction on that heat knob
on his stove it's not just gonna be low medium
high it's gonna be like 10 different shades of of
heat intensity of heat and he's gonna know that like
this is a piece of salmon I have to cook
it for you know on number two or number three
intensity of heat for X number of minutes in order
for it to come out such and such so that
it's it's perfectly cooked it's not undercooked it's not overcooked
and so on and then of course a really fine
chef will make even finer distinctions when a chef is
picking out a piece of salmon at the grocery store
first of all he's gonna make distinctions between which grocery
store he goes to a newbie chef is just gonna
go to the nearest grocery store that sells the cheapest
salmon but a master chef will actually recognize that where
the salmon comes from is very important so he'll start
to make distinctions between different types of salmon different parts
of the world the salmon comes from is this a
farm raised salmon is this a wild salmon what's the
difference between the two they have different tastes they come
from different parts of the world they have different nutritional
content different fat content right so all these fine little
distinctions that you only learn through experience you have to
cook salmon hundreds or thousands of times before you learn
all these things and then when you're at the grocery
store of course you go to the right grocery store
that has the best freshest salmon then you learn how
to pick out the salmon you learn how to tell
whether the salmon is fresh or it's a few days
old you could actually ask your you know your fishmonger
like when do you get your shipments of salmon a
newbie would never even think of asking that kind of
question but a master chef would would know that Oh
salmon comes in on Mondays and and then they don't
get any deliveries over the weekend so don't buy salmon
on Saturday and Sunday especially because that's old salmon it's
been laying around because they only get deliveries on Mondays
or something like that you see and then you can
actually make distinction between different cuts of salmon is it
the tail section is it the midsection is it towards
the front is it the belly of course there's different
flavor profiles for all those and if you were making
a certain type of dish like sushi you might want
a certain kind of cut of a salmon like the
belly versus another kind if you were baking it or
grilling it and then of course there's different species of
salmon alaskan salmon atlantic salmon sockeye salmon and whatever else
king salmon you see so you're making all these distinctions
that a newbie wouldn't make and that's why the newbie
is not so good at cooking salmon and that's why
you want to go pay extra money to buy salmon
cooked by a master chef and people do people go
and they pay hundreds of dollars just to get one
piece of salmon grilled by some master chef that's what
that's how that's how chefs make their money you see
so but this is just one instance this this happens
everywhere this happens in computer programming this happens with movie
making video game making arts and crafts sewing knitting and
of course it happens in personal development and it happens
in spirituality which is why it's so important because see
you can apply what I'm teaching you here not only
to just sort of external activities in the world materialistic
pursuits like the pursuit of money in business where this
will be very helpful for you or in the stock
market or with investing or mastering some skill set or
on your life purpose but you can also now apply
to self development and to spirituality where it becomes really
important because the more advanced you become in your spiritual
pursuits the more flight or distinctions you're gonna have to
make and then this whole notion of distinctions becomes much
more existential and metaphysical and we'll get into that later
but anyways let's go back to the the two homework
assignments I have for you so the first homework assignment
is this I want you to get a pencil and
some labels and make a trip to the grocery store
a nice grocery store with a lot of variety you're
gonna go to the produce aisle and you're going to
buy one of every Apple that they sell typical grocery
store around where I live in the western part of
the US they might sell 10 different varieties of apples
so you're gonna buy every single one that they have
you're gonna want at least five different varieties but hopefully
you can find 10 different ones and as you're buying
them make sure that you label them because usually apples
they don't have good labels on them so that you
know which Apple is which otherwise you're gonna get lost
and confused once you bring them all back home so
you know you buy a Fuji apple and then you
put a label on it and you write Fuji and
then you buy another Apple a Granny Smith and you
write Granny Smith and then you buy a McIntosh and
you write McIntosh you buy a Honey Crisp and you
write Honey Crisp on it whatever so you get all
the apples there are you're buying them all at once
not separate trips all at one trip then you bring
them all back home then you wash them then you
slice them up and then you put them on plates
you have ten different plates with all the apples sliced
up and really you only need one slice or two
slices from each one and then you're gonna taste each
one and you're gonna have a label of the name
of the Apple on every plate and you're gonna taste
each one and you're gonna specifically taste them and maybe
this is the first time in your life that you'll
be doing this with such precision so explicitly and consciously
and with such intention you're gonna be applying what I'm
telling you here it's a very simple principle you're gonna
be applying the intention of noticing the differences of making
these distinctions such that you're going to really learn the
difference between all these different types of apples and just
do that and then report back in the comments section
of what you learned or just maybe take notes for
yourself what you learned so you're gonna learn two main
things here two categories of things first you're gonna learn
the actual differences between these different types of apples I
bet you for most of you that of course how
many times have you eaten apples in your life probably
hundreds of times and how many times have you walked
by the grocery store department where they sell the apples
and you see all these different apples and you're kind
of unsure which one should I buy should I buy
the yellow ones the red ones the green ones I
don't know some of them are more expensive some are
less expensive how do I know which ones to buy
and you kind of like because you never deliberately sat
down and compared all 10 of them to each other
you've never actually figured out which kind of Apple you
like best and it probably never occurred to you to
actually run a rigorous experiment on which Apple you like
best or maybe you didn't even bother to say that
there's a difference between them you say oh well I
don't really care just grab some apples like mom want
some apples for apple pie it doesn't matter which ones
just grab some and bring him home she doesn't care
something like that right this is a very kind of
sloppy naive way to purchase apples so the first thing
you're gonna learn is actually the actual differences between these
apples you might notice that there's a lot of difference
or you might notice that the difference is is very
mild and subtle and maybe to you there is no
difference and you might say well the Honey Crisp apple
is very similar to the Fuji apple I can't even
tell the difference well first of all if you're very
very perceptive with your awareness I guarantee you you'll be
able to tell the difference you'll tell the difference in
taste in sweetness in sourness and texture in the even
the the skin around the Apple how different it is
so you'll be able to tell all that and you'll
probably have a favorite that's the first thing you'll learn
that's sort of the content of what you're learning and
then you're going to learn sort of a meta lesson
which is the meta lesson is going to be that
you're going to learn that learning is making distinctions and
that's actually the real reason why you're doing this experiment
I'm not having you do this experiment cuz I care
about you being able to distinguish different apples it doesn't
matter it's insignificant right to our purposes here but what
I do care about is that you do this exercise
so that you actually get an experiential feel for the
difference between approaching a situation unconsciously making distinctions versus approaching
a situation and consciously deliberately explicitly with intention making distinctions
and so that itself then becomes a sort of a
Metis distinction you see because now you're distinguishing between making
distinctions unconsciously versus now making distinctions consciously and then you'll
see how much more you learn when you do it
consciously with intention explicitly and then you can take that
lesson and now that's that's a golden lesson because now
you can apply that transfer that over to all other
domains of life whether it's into dating into business into
other types of food that you buy that you cook
into music into film into self-improvement and ultimately into spirituality
which is where it'll get really important see so that
will be your first homework assignment I recommend you actually
do this don't just sit there and nod your head
and say oh yeah that that sounds cool and then
pretend as though you did it because that's not the
same as actually doing it see distinctions it's not enough
to make a distinction just by believing in the difference
between certain things so even though right now in theory
I explained to you the difference between making distinctions consciously
and unconsciously you think you understand but you don't really
understand you haven't really learned the lesson until you actually
do it so you have to actually do it and
go through the experience of feeling and noticing and becoming
aware of these differences so it's very important that you
actually do this exercise and then I have a second
exercise for you this one might be a little easier
for you who are lazy and don't want to go
out to the store but I recommend you do both
the second exercise is the following I want you to
open your web browser and go to youtube and find
samples of music for every major category of music I'll
name some of them for you I want you to
find one jazz song one hip-hop song one R&B song
one rap song one heavy metal song one classical rock
song one just classical music like Mozart or Beethoven piece
and what are their other categories I'm forgetting find some
techno find some disco and open each one in a
separate tab so you're gonna have like let's say 10
different tabs open with one of these songs from each
category in each tab and then what I want you
to do is I want you to play each one
just for 30 seconds just to sample it so play
the rap song for 30 seconds get a sense and
listen consciously to that rap song and get sense for
for what a rap song is your your sort of
listening to get the essence of what rap is about
so you're not so much focused on the particular song
as rap in its essence and of course into this
situation you're going to be bringing in the conscious explicit
intention to find differences and to make distinctions so you're
gonna listen to that rap song they're gonna switch over
to the R&B song and you'll listen to that for
30 seconds and then you'll ask yourself what's the difference
in their essence and then you'll switch over to some
disco and you'll listen to that for 30 seconds and
listen to the two the difference the essence the difference
between their essence then maybe you'll play that jazz song
and compare that then play some classical country or I
mean your classical music and then you can play some
country music whatever and do this and compare all of
them together and again as you're doing this the first
lesson you're gonna learn is sort of the the low
level lesson the unimportant lesson which is simply the actual
differences between these these song categories but then you'll learn
the more important metal lesson of what it actually feels
like to approach a situation explicitly deliberately trying to look
for distinctions see and you'll see that what it gives
you is it gives you a sense of clarity that
you didn't have before so maybe your entire life you've
been listening to all these songs maybe your entire life
you've listened to country into jazz and to classical and
all this and you think you know the difference between
them but the thing is with distinctions remember like I
said there's many degrees to drawing these distinctions so if
you sit there and listen to third for 30 seconds
to each song that will definitely get you a general
sense of the differences but these distinctions will still be
at a at a crude degree now if you were
a master musician who spent five years of her life
carefully playing all the different categories of music that there
are analyzing them note by note chord by chord lyric
by lyric melody by melody harmony by harmony and all
this you would have such a deeper understanding of the
differences and also the similarities between these different types of
music and then of course the power that would give
you is that now that you know how they're structured
you know the deep distinctions that are constructing the structure
of this music now you're able to jump between them
now you're able to cross-pollinate them and now you're able
to even come up with entirely new categories of music
or interesting hybrids or you can you know you can
figure out in this way what kind of music is
popular what kind of music fits the kind of audience
that you're trying to target so you see this is
this is this is a critical skill because you can
use this skill to make millions and billions of dollars
just this one skill of of learning how to make
fine distinctions it's just of course a matter of that
learning how to apply it and then applying it in
a sort of productive and consistent manner throughout your whole
life so that's the second exercise I recommend you try
that one as well actually do it and notice what
it feels like to be consciously making a distinction maybe
this is the first time in your life or you're
going to be consciously making a distinction and notice that
there's a difference between doing it consciously versus unconsciously a
lot of people get themselves into trouble in life by
either being really really sloppy with their distinctions or making
misguided overly simplistic distinctions and then taking those distinctions as
absolute truth or absolute reality so that's usually what is
happening with a person who's a fool a person who's
a fool makes overly simplistic distinctions lacking nuance and doesn't
know that that's what's going on and from their perspective
it seems like what they're doing is that they're being
smart and that they have all of everything figured out
when actually they're just using very gross distinctions and then
they're mistaking those distinctions for reality so here now we
need to warn you because this is a very powerful
ability that your mind has to create distinctions and I
want you to start to observe yourself from a sort
of a meta level when you're making distinctions that you
are constructing these distinctions so it's not simply that you're
going out into the world and that you're tasting these
different apples or you're listening to these different songs and
that you're already finding the distinctions like you're just discovering
them it's not simply a process of discovery and this
is where we get a little bit of we go
a little existential and metaphysical on you and we go
a little bit spiritual on you actually your mind is
playing a creative role in constructing these distinctions so in
a certain sense you're sort of picking them up it
feels as though you're discovering them because you know you
might say well but leo you know that Apple that's
like that's a red apple that's a green apple that's
a yellow Apple aren't those different colors just inherent in
the apples and so therefore how can you say that
I'm constructing the distinction of the color red or green
or yellow isn't that just found out in nature isn't
it just a given it will seem that way to
you at first but as you go deeper and you
observe more carefully really what your mind is doing you'll
discover that it's not so simple that actually your mind
is is playing a constructive role in drawing these distinctions
at the very least simply by the way you're assigning
labels you know red green yellow and so on these
labels you're assigning this is not just an innocent activity
this this brings in it with it various latent meanings
and values and so on maybe not with the color
red or green or yellow but oftentimes when you're making
distinction this is also another trap that people fall into
is that they're making distinctions but at the same time
as they're making the distinctions they're also subtly judging and
placing value on the different categories that are being constructed
by the mind you see the mind is a categorization
system oisin and it creates labels that attaches labels then
it strings those labels together into complex webs of meaning
that's how language works and this is not just a
merely a word game where we're just assigning different labels
for different things because the labels take take on a
charge they take on an emotional charge they have survival
value they become so useful that then we actually start
to operate on these labels themselves and we live in
a sort of a a matrix where we're in this
augmented reality where we're walking around all the time and
our mind is casting and projecting various labels and meanings
and values and judgments onto all of these physical objects
that we're finding in the outer world so to speak
see so when I tell you that well that car's
a Chevy and this cars a Toyota see you might
seem like well that's just a word game but it's
not just a word game because your mind has associations
deep associations with what it means for a car to
be a Chevy versus what it means to be a
Toyota because you've watched different commercials and your pinion maybe
your dad drove a Chevy and it always broke down
and so you got this image of a Chevy you
know unreliable or maybe the opposite whatever or maybe your
dad told you the old Toyota's are foreign cars you
know you should buy American and then he told you
to never buy a Toyota and then see that Association
gets lodged into your skull really deep into your mind
and then that will color how you're actually able to
make distinctions and to make judgments in the future because
of course now you're gonna be biased towards one category
or against the other see and if you want a
really clear example of this just look at how race
relations work you categorize people based on race Asian Indian
Somali you know Western European Eastern European Italian French whatever
Japanese Chinese and you know racist people get into a
lot of trouble because what they do is they have
very crude distinctions that they make between different races and
usually of course what they do is they place their
own race up at the top and then all the
other races they don't make very fine distinctions and they
say oh well you know if I'm if I'm white
European or if I'm American let's say then I'm probably
not gonna make very fine distinctions between different types of
Asians to me maybe the Koreans and Japanese I'll confuse
them with Chinese and all this and I'll just love
them all together see and then of course I'll have
various kinds of associations about that they're smart or they're
smelly or they're hard-working or they're lazy or they're trustworthy
or they're sneaky or they're evil or they're whatever and
then Middle Eastern people they're all you know it's a
lot of terrorists or whatever you start to get into
this this problem of over generalizing people and so and
then and then what you do is then you try
to reify these distinctions which means that you actually you
don't acknowledge that it's your mind that constructed these distinctions
you start to actually believe that these distinctions are out
there in the real world as though it's not like
just that my mind has constructed a narrative that all
Asian people are hardworking and all Middle Eastern people are
lazy or whatever it's not that I constructed that it's
that it is that way it's genetics its biology its
physics or something like that see and then people start
to create ideologies around this and so on so you
have to be very careful here because your mind is
playing a constructive role it is projecting a lot of
this stuff out into the world and you're not very
conscious of how it's doing that and the less conscious
of it you are the more you're gonna be trapped
and mistake your own distinctions and projections for something that
is inherently found out there and then this gets you
into a lot of trouble I notice for example in
politics this is a real big problem I study politics
a lot from a sort of meta perspective because politics
is really good at understanding how people delude themselves how
ideology works how groupthink works house power dynamics works and
so on I hope that you are a student of
politics but from a mattr perspective when you're not actually
getting sucked into the mud mud mm slinging in all
of this that is going on especially right now because
we live in a very polarized time with our politics
but you look at what's happening with politics and you
look at how polarization happens and you you you look
at people who are very ignorant about politics who are
just kind of newbies who don't actually read or study
politics so deeply or think about it deeply what they
do is they just take a position they identify with
it then they started defending it and what you notice
with these people is that fundamentally they lack the nuanced
distinctions that are necessary to really be an educated voter
and to vote for the right politicians and the right
people and that's why we get people electing the wrong
politicians because it's very easy to fool somebody who makes
very sloppy distinctions so for example foxnews is a great
example of this they deliberately as part of their ideology
and part of their worldview what they do is they
deliberately try to cast liberals and Democrats as socialists and
as communists as Marxists because they're unable to actually sit
down and make fine distinctions between what is a Marxist
what is a socialist what is a communist and what
is capitalist even for that matter so the funny thing
is is that these people who claim themselves to be
staunch capitalists they themselves don't really understand what capitalism is
they never bothered to sit down and actually think about
it deeply to contemplate it to study some literature on
what it is because there's not such a clear distinction
between what is socialism and what is capitalism is the
military a capitalist enterprise or a socialist enterprise what about
Social Security what about pensions so yes so something like
FoxNews what they will do is they will deliberately conflate
liberals in America left-wingers in America for socialists which they
think are the same as the Socialists and communists in
Venezuela which they think is the same as the Socialists
and communists supposedly in in the Scandinavian countries which are
the same as the Soviet communists of the Stalinist era
and and the same as the Chinese Communists as of
all of these are all the same when in fact
Chinese communism probably has more in common with capitalism than
it does with communism you see but to make these
fine distinctions you would have to actually care about truthfulness
and accuracy in your distinction making process which of course
Fox News doesn't care about any of that all they
care about is reinforcing their right-wing ideology now I'm not
just blaming Fox News for this I mean liberals can
also fall into a similar trap I notice a lot
of liberals fail to make proper distinctions when they think
about conservatives like a lot of liberals will tend to
think of like oh well all conservatives are just Trump
supporters and this is a very sloppy distinction because if
you actually go and study different conservative law you'll see
that they're not all Trump supporters there are many conservatives
who are appalled by what Trump does and don't support
him at all even though of course there's some overlap
between perhaps Trump's policies maybe preference for tax cuts and
and with a traditional conservative but but then there's a
lot of divergence as well and see from a liberals
perspective because the liberal is so biased by their liberal
paradigm and they don't want to look at the world
from any other point of view they don't make these
fine distinctions between different types of conservatives they just kind
of lump them all together in the same way that
a white the European might lump together all all black
people or all Asian people see it's the same problem
and so when you think about society and government and
economics and healthcare and geopolitics by using crude and sloppy
distinctions this gets you into a lot of trouble you
start wars with the wrong people you offend people you
you wouldn't need to offend you you are fearful of
people you don't need to be fearful of and then
at the same time you overlook those threats that truly
are the threats you should be worried about it's also
the case that distinctions can be drawn across each other
see um a lot of times people get themselves into
trouble because like imagine if if we have a pie
just like an apple pie and a distinction is just
a slice through this pie and people tend to just
assume that well we can slice the pie in one
way like we can just slice it we can cut
it this way and this way and this way and
we'll just have three different lines and that will give
us six pieces of the pie something like that but
what a lot of times they don't realize because this
requires more sophistication is that it's possible to draw a
distinction in one direction sort of in one dimension and
then you can draw another distinction across that distinction through
another dimension see you don't always have to cut the
pie through the center you can cut the pie like
a cord through a side through sometimes you'll go through
the center sometimes you won't go through the center you
could know you can cut the pie this way then
you can cut through the cut you've already made through
the pie see not only that but if you want
to get really multi-dimensional about it you can even cut
the pie from beneath and from the side right so
there's a lot of different possibilities for how you can
cut a pie but most people they're very simplistic thinkers
they're one dimensional thinkers and they will only adopt the
distinctions that their culture has programmed them with because they
don't think independently for themselves they're just operating based on
dogma and ideology and culture and groupthink so whatever distinctions
their culture gives them are the only distinctions they understand
for example your culture you grew up in a traditional
culture that tells you that there's men and there's women
and there's children and that's the only distinction you understand
you don't understand the distinction of a some sort of
transsexual person or some sort of person who identifies with
being asexual or whatever these distinctions they don't compute for
you right because your culture hasn't developed these distinctions yet
and so you're just operating on like women men and
children that's it all right but reality is much more
complicated than that and then of course you could have
distinctions that cut through each other for example you could
have men and women and children but then you can
also have like white and black and Asian and European
and then all of them can intermix in complex ways
so you can have like a black transsexual gay you
know whatever person and those are like multiple distinctions cutting
through each other right and then even further they like
she could also be a a socialist but then there's
different varieties of socialist as well so that doesn't certainly
mean that she's a Soviet Stalinist type of socialist she
might be more of a Bernie Sanders type of socialist
or a democratic socialist or a Scandinavian style socialist see
so this is where things get quite complicated and you
have to be very careful about disentangling all these things
disaggregating them because sometimes it's really easy for your mind
because your mind is always working to reinforce its own
worldview and its own paradigm and its own ideology so
it's very easy for for the mind to sort of
look at this pie and to slice that pie in
the way that is most favorable to your own mind
and in fact that's exactly what your mind is doing
all the time see people assume that all well we
just go out into the world we find distinctions out
there and then that's just what it is and then
we're just talking about what's out there in the external
world and then that's very factual and scientific and and
it just is what it is that's not the case
at all in fact what's happening is that your mind
is very sneakily selecting those distinctions which are most favorable
to the survival of that mind see my two-part series
understanding survival part 1 and part 2 which goes into
depth about how survival works but that episode that series
now connects with what I'm talking about here in the
sense that see now because your mind is the thing
that is actually drawing these distinctions your mind is not
just gonna draw neutral objective quote-unquote scientific distinctions no no
your mind is going to be X we biased see
my episode called self bias I believe do I have
two episodes about self bias or one I don't remember
I might have two if I have to go watch
both of them that also interconnects here because this is
this is where your mind really starts to play tricks
on you because of course there's something called confirmation bias
that your mind tries to reinforce what it already believes
and thinks reality is so for example if you're a
right winger you're only gonna acknowledge the validity of those
distinctions you're only gonna see those distinctions which your mind
drew which are favorable to your point of view into
your worldview and you're going to overlook the other ones
you're not gonna acknowledge their validity and you're probably not
gonna acknowledge that your mind drew those distinctions in the
first place to serve you as part of your self
bias and part of your survival see just to acknowledge
all of that it's already a huge huge burden and
responsibility way more than than most people are willing to
bear to really observe how your own mind is constructing
a worldview in a selfish manner in a self biased
manner that reinforces your own survival at the cost of
other people creating collateral damage for others hurting others and
distorting reality to admit that to notice that about your
mind that's that's huge that's huge that would take you
probably a decade of study and careful self analysis and
a lot of self honesty and even a lot of
emotional turmoil to admit all that to yourself see let
alone to to stop doing it and this is where
self-deception happens see my three part series on self-deception this
is one of the one of the biggest self-deception mechanisms
right here is how you draw your distinctions and speaking
of which see there's this method that I'm teaching you
of going into a situation and deliberately with intention drawing
distinctions the reason is such a game-changer is because for
the first time in your life now you're assuming responsibility
for how your mind is drawing these distinctions whereas before
even though you drew distinctions really what you were doing
you were drawing them you were blindly following groupthink like
a sheep and you were just assuming and adopting the
distinctions that somebody else in society drew for you which
got baked into your culture so really you're just acting
out some conditioning or some indoctrination so even even to
go into a grocery store that's what I'm telling here
this is a deep point see if you can grasp
the significance of this this is huge even when you
grow into a grocery store and you accept the pre-made
distinctions of that's a granny smith apple that's a Honey
Crisp apple that's a Fuji apple just to accept those
distinctions already what you're doing see you're not you're not
taking responsibility for drawing them you're just adopting them from
your culture after all where did a granny smith apple
come from it came from your culture see this goes
so deep because not only are you adopting those distinctions
blindly completely oblivious see when you go to a grocery
store you probably even go to a grocery store since
you were a kid buying apples but it never occurred
to you that you're like these these these apples are
broken into four categories where do these categories come from
somebody made them up it's part of your culture you're
just assuming that they're true what if they're not true
what if they're fabricated what if there are better distinctions
that could be made between apples you see and it's
not just you is doing this it's everybody around you
it's the grocery store clerk who's organizing these apples and
placing them into different carts and baskets he's also just
blindly accepted that these apples are what his culture tells
them they are the farmer who's growing these apples has
also assumed these categories and these distinctions of apples he
doesn't question them because he all he cares about is
just growing some apples and selling him he doesn't really
care about the the epistemology and ontology of apples and
and how it plays to culture and ideology and spirituality
no this is way beyond him right even the scientists
studying the apples even they themselves aren't thinking very deeply
about the distinctions of different apples which of course corrupts
their science and biases their science and all of this
limits how your mind is able to think about apples
work with apples create new apples of course Apple itself
is just a distinction what happens if we genetically modify
some Apple to become some new variety is it still
going to be an Apple what if we put some
genes of a pear or a peach with with it
now what is it gonna be a third thing see
this becomes especially important when you're trying to be creative
and innovative in any field because by definition creation and
innovation is the process of creating new distinctions and in
fact all of reality is made up of distinctions and
this is a point that I won't really go into
here I'll have a separate episode about what a distinction
actually is because that's such a profound thing we can't
get into that here here I just want to get
you to start getting some experience with drawing distinctions and
learning through this method and then later if you're still
interested we'll we'll talk more deeply about distinctions but the
bottom line is that everything including physical objects is distinctions
and so if you want to be highly creative in
some new field in science and physics and biology if
you want to create a new type of Apple and
your type of fruit a new type of dog breed
or whatever you want to create a new political system
a new government a new life for yourself a new
way of thinking a new way of feeling you're gonna
have to be creating new distinctions which means you have
to take responsibility for creating distinctions because we're talking about
something new that means by definition it's not part of
your culture yet that means you couldn't have gotten indoctrinated
with it yet you can't take it for granted so
while there's millions of distinction is that you've been programmed
with that you can take for granted like apples and
oranges and Granny Smith and Honey Crisp and all the
sorts of stuff and you can take for granted the
difference between jazz music and rock music and classical music
and techno music and hip-hop music and rap music and
all this you take these all for granted as though
they're just a given but what most people don't realize
that someone had to invent these distinctions at some point
someone had to sit down and say that well rap
is different from R&B and R&B is different from hip-hop
and hip-hop is different from rock and rock is different
from something else now it seems now you know after
the fact once your program with with these distinctions it
seems so obvious like how could people not have known
the difference between rap and rock and roll and so
forth but at some point they didn't it had to
be invented and created and that took a visionary that
took someone who was actually exploring distinctions experientially and not
just feeding off of whatever the cultural echo chamber or
some ideology was telling them see so this is a
crucial distinction to now we're making now see how powerful
this is now we're making the distinction between distinctions which
you get from your culture has indoctrination versus distinctions that
you derive or draw for yourself through direct experience and
exploration of reality you see that's a huge difference to
be able to do this for yourself to take that
responsibility and to develop the capacity to develop these new
distinctions this is what makes you a visionary this is
what makes you a cutting-edge leader this is what allows
you to see the future that others cannot see because
others are simply operating on the old distinctions that visionaries
have made in the past that's why they're thinking inside
the box and you're outside the box so you in
this can be highly lucrative to be the first one
to make a new distinction a new invention to invent
something new you have to make a new distinction powerful
stuff I see so many mistakes being made by many
even intellectual people like folks like Jordan Pederson or Sam
Harris you would think that these are highly intelligent people
who say intelligent things but really what they do is
they make simplistic distinctions and they make inflation's between different
distinctions they draw the wrong distinctions and then the people
who follow them fall into the sort of sloppy distinctions
that these intellectuals make or people like Richard Dawkins for
example Richard Dawkins supposedly a scientist Sam Harris is also
supposed to like a scientist but then you start talking
with these people about religion and spirituality for example and
they start to blur the distinctions are not able to
for example separate mmm pre rational dogmatic spirituality which we
usually call religion versus post rational mmm spirituality which is
more advanced than science but see this distinction is lost
on someone like Richard Dawkins maybe Sam Harris would be
able to appreciate this distinction a little bit more but
still like for example you talk with Sam Harris he
I bet you he's not going to be able to
make a quality distinction between for example God as the
bearded man in the sky that is conceived of by
most Christians or Allah as conceived by many fundamentalist Muslims
versus actual God actual God see that that's a super
important distinction if you confuse those two you're never gonna
discover actual God you're gonna say actual God doesn't exist
because you're thinking when I say god you're probably thinking
a beard man in the clouds that sounds ridiculous to
you and then you don't understand and then you could
never discover God or I might say God you might
say oh well by God what Leo means is he
just means some some some some sort of notion of
just emptiness or no self like the Buddhists talked about
that's what Leo means by God no that's not what
I mean by God I mean actual God actual God
says so you see it's really easy to delude yourself
with drawing the wrong distinctions Jordan Peterson does it again
with with with Marxists and with communists and with socialists
Jordan Peterson can't understand the distinction between Stalinist style socialism
which was spiral dynamics staged red and blue versus Bernie
Sanders style socialism which is father damage staged green see
that's a huge mistake for an intellectual to make huge
mistake and it misleads millions of his followers millions and
millions of people who follow him are gonna now fall
into that conflation and that's why sprouted Amex is so
powerful what is father damaged small dynamics if you haven't
seen a go check out my multi Series multi-part series
on spiral dynamics where I explain it a lot of
detail but most of you should be familiar with it
but what is small dynamics the reason small dynamics is
so powerful if you've been using this model it's been
it's been kind of opening your eyes and you've been
like whoa Leo I can see the world in a
totally different way now that I understand some other dynamics
well why is that because spiral that AMEX is just
a set of distinctions that's all it is red is
the distinction blue is a distinction orange green yellow turquoise
these are the distinctions we draw with spiral dynamics they're
extremely power felicitations it'll change your whole life if you
understand these distinctions so go watch that multi-part series and
and to know how to make those distinctions because spotlight
amaz is a complex and nuanced model that requires dozens
of hours of study I would say it'll probably take
you 50 to 100 hours of deep study to get
an experiential feel for the distinctions of Spile and AMEX
red versus blue versus orange green yellow and turquoise 5200
hours of research and study and that might seem like
a lot that's a lot of work just to draw
off what five six distinctions but at the same time
distinctions are so powerful certain ones are so powerful certain
distinctions are stupid and useless but certain distinctions are so
powerful that they will change your whole life which is
what's violent dynamics can do for you it's a very
powerful model yet at the same time as powerful as
it is precisely when a distinction is very very powerful
that's when it becomes very dangerous because of course when
something is powerful you tend to then believe that it's
real it's very easy to start to use Sproul that
a mix and start to see it everywhere to look
through the Spile dynamic lens and everything and then to
forget that it's just a single lens and that in
fact we constructed it you constructed it it's not something
that's found out there smiling Amex isn't found out in
the world brother Amex is a projection of our own
minds it just happens to be a very useful projection
but at the same time it's it's got its limits
you have to acknowledge the limits of your projections we
can't really survive without projections but we can become much
more aware of our projections and realize their limitations and
be adept at manipulating our projections in a conscious way
and being able to either project or the turn off
the projector you see so these are sort of meta
skills that we develop that's par the Namek stage yellow
and above that most people don't have see most people
they go through life projecting all the time they don't
know how to turn it off in fact they will
deny that their projections are their projections they will insist
that this is just something that's found out there in
the world like you know many conservatives will say well
men and women this is just biology you just you
just find male and female out in the world and
there's no other categories but those as though that's just
like baked into biology into physics into chemistry this is
not the case at all if you start to deeply
study the animal kingdom start to study plants and fungi
and different organisms and you start to study human psychology
you start to study human sexuality you start to study
how humans are sometimes born with different combination of anatomical
parts how they have different hormones running through their through
their system some people are born with too much hormone
of a certain kind or too little of a certain
kind you discover just how fluid gender is and this
notion of gender fluidity it is this this horrify as
many conservatives and right-wingers and many traditional people because these
types of people have very conformist minds and all they
do is they just they just soak up the distinction
that their culture gives them and of course your culture
because these are new developments these are new Sciences and
new fields of of research that that were taboo for
hundreds of years so they're just coming online in the
last 10 20 30 years you know homosexuality was extremely
taboo for for centuries in many cultures so it's it's
no wonder that they're there these taboos have been indoctrinated
into many conservatives and right-wingers and so they're not able
to really understand the fluidity of these distinctions because they
just naively assume because they're running under the materialist paradigm
which of course is also something that was just indoctrinated
into you you just assume that there's a objective external
rigid physical material reality out there beyond your own mind
you just assume that because that's what your culture taught
you because we're living in a materialistic Dark Age right
now the Dark Age of materialism were really other possibilities
aren't even considered seriously in universities and in schools and
by religions for the most part even our religions are
materialist which is just a complete travesty but anyways that's
just the error that we're in right now and so
so yeah so you just assumed this materialism and then
you just assume that as part of materialism what materialism
sort of tells you is that distinctions are inherent in
the world we're not constructing them which is of course
untrue so when we talk in a following episode about
the existential nature of distinctions what I'm gonna tell you
is that the entire world is actually constructed out of
distinctions because consciousness itself which is what all of the
world is is just consciousness there's nothing but consciousness everything
you know and see right now is consciousness consciousness is
a field an infinite field which creates distinctions this is
the universal mind that is generating this dream that you're
in right now and you're constantly drawing distinctions these distinctions
are not just drawn at the mental level where you
can look at an Apple you can say well that's
a red one that's a green one that's a yellow
one these are these are in a sense conceptual distinctions
especially when you're labeling them Granny Smith Honey Crisp and
so forth these are obviously conceptual now the colors you
might think but the colors are inherent in the apples
and that's not something my mind is doing but it
is something your mind is doing on a deeper level
of which you've not yet become conscious of you can
become so conscious if you do spiritual practice that you
will actually realize that even the distinctions between the actual
colors red yellow and green and so on is something
your own mind is constructing and in fact the distinction
between absolutely anything is something that your own mind is
constructing so the distinction you think exists between Leo and
yourself is something that is your mind's construction you're imagining
it and in fact that's all that reality is is
imagination and imagination is nothing other than the imagination of
distinctions or differences between things and if you are in
a state of absolute consciousness or God consciousness what you
realize is that there's no distinction between anything and everything
merges into one absolute total unity and if you do
that if you succeed in doing that then you realize
that everything is one and everything is consciousness everything is
God and everything is love that's what love is love
is just the collapse of all distinctions until everything merges
into one pure field of infinite consciousness which is your
essential nature which is what every religion is trying to
point out to you but which because they're drawing incorrect
distinctions they're being sloppy about it everyone has gotten so
confused that they never reach this state of realizing that
all distinctions are absolutely relative and imaginary so when you
become extremely conscious what I'm telling you is that you
will be so conscious that there will not be a
difference between me and you and a saxophone and the
Sun and a man and a woman and a dog
and an atom and Albert Einstein and Donald Trump and
a terrorist and Hitler and a cannibal and a rapist
and whatever else there literally will not be a difference
so from God's point of view from absolute consciousness point
of view there's no difference between you that's just a
little preview of where we're going to go later on
with with this notion of distinctions for now do those
exercises go buy some of those apples go listen to
that music and actually start to learn by making distinctions
all right that's it I'm done here please click that
like button for me and come check out actualize that
org that's my website you will find my blog you
will find my book list on there you will find
the life purpose course other courses that I hope to
be releasing in the years to come will be posted
there and you could find the forum as well and
if you'd like to support me on patreon you can
go to patreon.com/scishow and that helps to keep my channel
independence and keeps me from having to sell out to
advertisers and so forth the final thing I'll say is
this I want you to notice how many new distinctions
you've made if you've been following along with me for
a few years watching my content think back to where
you were when you began self-improvement self-help and spirituality think
about how clueless you were how few distinctions you knew
how to make in this field of psychology and philosophy
and metaphysics and epistemology and all this and now compare
that to where you are now and now create a
distinction create a distinction between where you were and where
you are now between how ignorant you were how sloppy
your distinctions used to be and now how much more
nuanced your distinctions are see now you can distinguish between
different qualities of guru you can distinguish between maybe Awakening
and different degrees of awakening different facets of awakening you
can distinguish between absolute love or no self or God
consciousness or whatever you can distinguish between meditation and between
concentration or you can distinguish between this technique and that
technique or you can distinguish between this emotion and that
emotion like now you can finally distinguish between anger and
sadness and depression and and whatever frustration you can distinguish
between happiness and suffering you can distinguish many different kinds
of suffering see and this has made improvements in your
life a lot of times people will leave me comments
they will email me I get emails and private messages
and comments basically every month every week of people saying
how following along with my content for five or three
years they've been following along and it's completely transformed their
whole life they used to be depressed they were stuck
they were they didn't know what to do with their
life they didn't have a way forward and then they
stumbled upon my content and they learned all this stuff
and and now now they see a path forward now
they have hope well why is that because new new
possibilities were opened up to you new distinctions were made
see and this makes you more masterful at controlling this
biomechanical organism that you are or that you think you
are conventionally-speaking it makes you more adept at controlling that
and it's especially important to make distinctions for example between
different emotions between different feelings between different states of consciousness
and so if you really want to become adept at
life if you want to live the good life you're
gonna have to make a lot of very fine and
nuanced distinctions especially in the realms of emotions psychology mind
philosophy metaphysics epistemology relationships and spirituality within those domains now
of course all of those domains are themselves distinctions so
just to know those domains is already very helpful but
you're gonna have to go way beyond that to actually
create hundreds and thousands of new distinctions within each of
those domains to carefully separate things out and and that's
what will ultimately set you free but what's really interesting
and this is sort of the paradox of it where
everything goes full circle is that you're going to master
life by making a bunch of distinctions very fine distinctions
whatever areas you want to master including self-development and spirituality
but ultimately what that's ultimately gonna lead you to in
your final Awakening and final enlightenment is that you will
transcend all distinctions and you will realize that all of
those distinctions were construction of your own mind they were
all purely imaginary everything will merge into one and literally
the difference between anything will completely disappear such that there
will not even be a distinction between life and death
anymore and that's when you become God and that's when
you discover infinite love and that will be the culmination
of your whole journey but even though that happens you
will still come back and you will still be able
to retain all the old relative distinctions that you've made
in the process so it's not like you're gonna abandon
your distinctions it's not like you're gonna become God and
then you're not gonna be able to know the difference
between a rattlesnake and a puppy you're gonna know that
you're still gonna be able to know that difference but
from the absolute point of view you're gonna realize that
there is actually no difference between a rattlesnake and a
puppy so you're gonna you're gonna be able to do
both you're gonna transcend and include as Ken Wilber says
it's a very good saying what we're talking about here
transcend and include so you're not just going to transcendence
and leave everything you learned behind you're gonna retain the
the old lessons with you which are still gonna allow
you to be functional and masterful at whatever you do
you can be awake and you can be a great
musician you can be awake and you can be a
great cook you can be awake and you can be
a great software engineer you can be awake and you
can be a great inventor or a great artist or
whatever in the relative world but ultimately you'll know that
all of these distinctions are purely imaginary and that that
just is what reality is it's just infinite imagination you
