hey this is leo for actualized.org and in this episode
i'm going to be talking about 5meo dmt the most
powerful psychedelic in the world the magic pill to enlightenment
and god warning the information provided here is strictly for
educational purposes misusing 5meo dmt can be lethal the first
thing we need to clear up is the difference between
5meo dmt and regular dmt these are not the same
things at all even though they sound similar you've probably
heard about people smoking dmt and that's a very powerful
psychedelic but 5meo is more powerful it's 10 to 20
times more potent than regular dmt which is quite crazy
if you've ever tried dmt but not only that it
produces qualitatively different results so it's not just more of
the same it's different very different even though the names
are similar so don't confuse these two substances 5meodmt i
believe is the most important psychedelic for the work that
we're doing here with actualize.org i personally am not interested
in just tripping out or experiencing pleasurable experiences that's not
why i use psychedelics i'm interested in raising my consciousness
to the highest levels humanly possible uh using whatever methods
or techniques are out there that allow me to do
this and 5meo from what i've discovered is beyond all
other psychedelics and it's extremely practical in its ability to
transform your consciousness in permanent ways so what i believe
this is my theory and this is something that needs
to be proven which i will be working on to
prove for myself is that five and meow can be
used to have genuine enlightenment experiences and also not only
to have these peak experiences and then coming back down
to normal egoic existence but to actually attain permanent enlightenment
i think that five of meow is capable of doing
that in fact i found an individual who has successfully
done that and uh i'll talk more about that as
we continue but first let's address this issue of the
anti-magic pill dogma that i see out there so you
know people who are into personal development generally we take
as sort of as a dogma that magic pills are
bad and that anything like is a shortcut shouldn't be
done shouldn't be used because it's not genuine it's not
natural it's not good that's kind of like what we
might think but let's remember this notion of magic pills
the reason that we don't like generally magic pills is
because generally many magic pills don't work you see we're
not opposed to magic pills on principle if you're opposed
to anything on principle that's ego that's dogma i'm opposed
to magic pills when they have bad consequences and when
they flat out don't work that's a problem and i
continue to be opposed to magic pills in that regard
but let's also consider that humanity if we take a
look at the broader perspective humanity has invented many successful
highly effective magic pills throughout the last several thousand years
of our civilization and by magic pills let's really broaden
out this idea because what is a magic pill it's
really just a technology it's a technology that works very
effectively and can save you a lot of time or
energy that's really what a magic pill is now the
question is is the technology effective or not we can
find many examples of highly effective magic pill technologies for
example computers penicillin other types of medicines modern medical surgery
which can cure certain kinds of cancer and can do
others certain kinds of stuff electricity right gps systems the
internet so these things are real magic pills and uh
these we have no problem using because we're not opposed
to them on any ideological grounds for example if you
need to add up a billion different numbers you have
no problem using a calculator or computer to crunch those
numbers for you when otherwise it would have taken you
10 years to add them all up but see when
it comes to spirituality a lot of people because they
hold dogmas about spirituality and because the ego is so
involved with it then they'll have this objection and they'll
say well leo you know don't use psychedelics if you
use psychedelics to have some sort of consciousness a higher
consciousness experience that's not genuine that's not authentic but you
have to see it from the broader perspective from the
broader perspective it's just a technology that's what it is
and the question is does this technology work and the
only way you can know is by trying it yourself
lots and lots of trials then you can see if
it really works and you can see what are the
long-term consequences what are the repercussions is it sustainable in
all of that okay let's also not forget that spirituality
if you do some basic study and research of the
history of spirituality you quickly see that spirituality from the
very very beginning 5 000 years ago if you go
back to ancient ancient hinduism and ancient um uh judaism
and ancient forms of christianity and so forth you see
that all the greatest spiritual masters have gone to hardcore
extremes to pursue enlightenment and they developed technologies to do
this and some of these technologies are so hardcore that
they're shocking to the average person so let's take a
look for example at yoga yogic techniques i don't mean
the yoga that we do a gym class i mean
old school hinduism yogic techniques what were those those were
special very exotic ways of breathing and manipulating your mind
so that you can reach union with god that's what
it was in fact some forms of yoga are so
extreme that what they do is they will snip the
little ligament that attaches your tongue to the bottom of
your mouth that thing right there they will actually snip
that with a knife or with scissors why is that
so that you can so that the yogi can take
his tongue and curl it back up into his throat
up his nostrils because you can't do that easily without
snipping that ligament so that he can breathe a little
bit more efficiently so that he can attain enlightenment faster
now if i told you if i came up here
and i said hey you know what let's go snip
that ligament in your mouth you would say wait a
minute leo that's a bit extreme i don't know if
i want to do that well the yogis have been
doing that for thousands of years what about starvation people
have been starving themselves near to death not just fasting
but actually starving themselves since the beginning of spiritual traditions
they've been doing that right think of jesus think of
the buddha nearly starving themselves to death so that they
can put themselves in a state of mind that would
produce some sort of higher consciousness visionary experiences think of
the native americans they have traditions like the vision quest
where they send you out into the wilderness into a
barren desert with the no food and no water for
like three or four days and you're on the brink
of death out there in the scorching sun with no
water until you start hallucinating and you start to see
visions and that was done for spiritual purposes or think
of the sun dance native american sundance tradition where they
will actually get you out in front of a tree
they will take these metal spokes and they'll stick them
into the skin the flesh of your abdomen producing lifelong
scars they will tie a rope to those metal skewers
that they stick through you and then you're going to
spend two or three days running around that tree that
they tie you to with that rope singing songs and
dancing in the burning scorching heat in order to experience
some sort of visionary higher consciousness states and that will
leave you scarred for life those scars don't completely heal
pretty radical huh but also consider baptism old school baptism
you know what that was they would take your head
and they would submerge you under the water until you
were nearly drowned and only then would they lift you
out of the water what was the purpose of that
the purpose of that was to put you on the
very brink of death and then bring you back to
life and then that was supposed to have some sort
of spiritual effects think about asceticism ascetics have existed for
thousands of years since the very beginning these are people
who went off and lived by themselves in the mountains
isolated for decades all by themselves and if you think
that that's not hardcore think about the fact that three
thousand years ago when you became an ascetic you couldn't
order [ __ ] on amazon shipped to you you
couldn't go to a grocery store and stock up on
canned beans and rice and this kind of stuff yeah
so asceticism was like a life and death decision you
have to live out there there are like marauders and
thieves and robbers and warlords who could come and kill
you anytime you're completely defenseless living there by yourself on
the mountain or in the forest somewhere or in the
middle of the desert that was a hardcore life and
death decision to become an ascetic also we know that
mushrooms psychedelic mushrooms have been the foundation of many religious
traditions including the christian tradition including native american traditions south
american traditions african traditions indian traditions and uh aboriginal australian
and new zealand traditions see uh in hinduism one of
the oldest texts in hinduism is the rig veda and
there they cite a substance called soma we don't exactly
know what soma is but our best guess is that
it's a psychedelic mushroom perhaps the amanita mysteria mushroom or
the psilocybin cubensis mushrooms or some variation on that but
clearly they highly regarded the mushroom and in fact because
uh the oldest tradition we have of non-duality comes from
hinduism from india the whole thing might have started with
mushrooms that might be how human beings discovered enlightenment or
higher consciousness and then it might have spread from there
also the ancient greeks were onto this they were onto
psychedelics they have a 2 000 year old tradition called
the illusion mysteries it was a cult a very popular
and huge cult where thousands of people every single year
for 2 000 years up until the fall of the
roman empire would gather in a temple and they would
drink a substance called cachion this was a psychedelic substance
that would send you into rapture and visions of various
deities what was in the substance it's hard to tell
but the best that we can guess it was some
derivative of lsd the greeks found a method to derive
lsd from ergot which is a fungus that grows on
wheat and they did this for 2 000 years and
this wasn't just some sort of little side cult this
was mainstream all the major greeks and romans of the
time partook in this including plato aristotle the roman senator
cicero and the roman emperor nero and those are just
the ones that we know of there might have been
even more than that that we don't know of on
record so um firstly we have to acknowledge that psychedelics
have been closely linked to spirituality from the very very
beginning of time so there's nothing sacrilegious here about using
psychedelics because honestly for people who are interested in knowing
the truth and experiencing god they don't care these are
hardcore people and they will use whatever methods they can
including stuff like meditation you know meditation in the east
is a very hardcore tradition where you can sit for
hundreds thousands of hours in a row meditating your ass
off until you reach enlightenment and that's a technique that's
a very very very hardcore technique it's very difficult to
practice that technique we have to be careful not to
bring our ego into this and to say well we
need to do it the one most hardcore way we
can through meditation you know actually as humanity is evolving
we should expect that new technologies will come online that
will make it easier and easier to attain enlightenment and
that's i think what we're experiencing now because we have
the luxury of modern chemistry and we can really study
these psychedelic substances really understand what's going on and that
will only continue into the future so this is not
something to reject this is something to embrace or at
the very least try it and verify it for yourself
so uh what i've found through my own research and
personal experience is that 5mdmt is the most valuable tool
we have for enlightenment because what it does is it
produces pure 100 ego death very consistently more consistently than
all other psychedelics there's not a lot of visuals with
this substance you don't go on very mystical sort of
journeys you basically remain lucid throughout you can think your
thoughts are not distorted they're very clear and what happens
is that it just raises your consciousness to infinity while
at the same time reducing your ego down to zero
which is the ideal technology for enlightenment if you think
about it if you think about it you couldn't have
even imagined a better technology than this i mean within
just five to 15 minutes you will experience god and
yourself as absolute infinity what more could you want from
a technology this is the perfect technology of course you
have to know how to use it and that's what
i'm going to talk about here is how do you
use this substance and i'm going to give you some
guidelines and tips discuss the pros and cons and so
forth this just think of this as like meditation taking
your current meditation habit or your current self-inquiry habit and
multiplying it by a thousand it's not a replacement it's
a catalyst okay make sure you get that i'm not
advocating that you stop self-actualizing that you stop meditating that
you stop self-inquiring no all those things are still necessary
but we add the catalyst of 5modmt and that takes
you to levels that you couldn't have ever imagined by
the way i have a theory about enlightened masters you
know sometimes you read those books and they say that
somebody had an enlightenment experience and then they became fully
enlightened in a flash and they remain that way for
the rest of their life that's extremely rare in practice
what happens that you need to have multiple enlightenment experiences
before they stick the first one usually doesn't stick so
one objection people have is that oh well five of
me is just a temporary experience well you know what
if you're meditating if you're self-inquiring you'll have many temporary
units of experiences that will not stick so it doesn't
doesn't mean anything right the point is that each one
gets your awareness higher and higher and higher and higher
until finally something cracks in your brain and then uh
enlightenment is had okay my theory about enlightened masters is
that firstly there's a genetic component a strong genetic component
to which people become enlightened how quickly some people seem
to get it really fast easier than others and some
people seem to never ever get it in their entire
lifetimes why is that because i think there's a genetic
component to how your brain is structured and my current
theory is that actually 5meo we're finding that it's a
natural substance in your brain it's not a foreign substance
it's a natural neurotransmitter and that your brain can naturally
develop it so with enlightened masters what i think is
is that their brain either has parts in it that
naturally produce more 5meo which makes it easier for them
to become enlightened or they have a higher baseline level
of consciousness than the average person and or they use
techniques that develop the brain through for example meditation concentration
practices yogic practices self-inquiry and so forth they develop their
brain over doing that year after year after year after
year for thousands of hours to the point where their
brain starts to pump out the 5 meo or whatever
other chemicals are relevant to produce enlightenment and to sustain
that enlightenment okay so this idea that five amio is
not natural somehow well maybe it's not natural but also
consider maybe it is natural huh so let's talk about
5ml and how it can be used so firstly it
comes in two forms the first form is the natural
form which comes actually from the buffo alvarius toad here's
the picture of the toad it's also called the colorado
river toad it lives in only one part of the
world which is around the colorado river in the sonoran
desert in northern mexico and in southern arizona these toads
spend the majority of their time hibernating so you will
not find them they come out only during the summer
in the rainy season for a few months and then
they go back to hibernation these toads produce a substance
on their skin from these glands that they have on
their arms and their legs and this liquid is 5-meo
plus some other chemicals but basically primarily 5-meow and in
this you can take this liquid you can collect this
liquid you can smoke this liquid and there you have
your trip you might have heard about uh psychedelic toads
well this is where that myth comes from so actually
you can't lick psychedelic toads the way that people sometimes
talk about it you can only smoke the substance because
it has to be burned first before it can convert
into 5-meo which is active in your brain but these
are yeah these are the psychedelic toads you've probably heard
of these there's only one toad in the entire world
that produces 5meo that we know of and this is
it so that's one way to acquire this substance although
if you ever get the idea to go out there
and go find some toes or whatever just keep in
mind that um we don't want to put a strain
on the toad populations because there's only so many of
these toads don't kill these toads don't harm these toads
and don't destroy their natural environment if you do go
out hunting for them the second form of five meow
is the synthetic form this is uh the kind of
substance that you create in the laboratory so we know
how to create fiber meow in the laboratory here's a
picture of what fibo meal looks like in synthetic form
it's an off-white tannish sort of powder which has the
consistency of moist table salt and the synthetic comes in
two forms either the hcl version or the freebase version
this is important because the hcl version needs to be
snorted not smoked and the freebase version needs to be
smoked and not snorted all right and this produces two
slightly different effects so this substance can be smoked or
snorted if you smoke it it acts extremely quickly within
10 to 20 seconds and very powerfully it just hits
you like a sledgehammer so um and then it lasts
how long does it last like five or ten minutes
or maybe 20 minutes at the most that it lasts
then you come back down with snorting the hcl version
you snort it takes about five to ten minutes to
take effect it comes on more gradually but it's still
very very powerful and then the peak lasts longer it
lasts for 30 to 40 minutes and then after 40
minutes you come back down to normal personally i haven't
smoked it i've only snorted it using the synthetic form
and that's mostly what i'm gonna be talking about here
but uh you can read the trip reports of people
who smoke it versus snort it um there are similar
experiences just slightly different in the way that they act
i actually think that snorting might be preferable to what
we're trying to accomplish here which is we're trying to
not only have a peak experience but we're trying to
understand what's happening to us so that we can take
that understanding back with us into our everyday life and
i think that the the length of the peak on
snorting is actually more conducive to that i could uh
scarcely imagine what it would be like to smoke this
substance get pummeled by just absolutely pummeled by it for
like five minutes and then come back down and then
you're like what the hell was that i have no
idea what just happened to me it would be completely
disorienting and very confusing so um the idea here is
not only are you experiencing it but you're actually understanding
what you're experiencing it's very important that you use a
milligram scale to weigh the dosages of these substances because
whether you're smoking or snorting because 5meo is so potent
that every single milligram counts a few milligrams means the
difference between a light dose and a heavy dose speaking
of which what are the dosages here are the dosages
if you're freebasing it which means you're smoking it then
you're going to use slightly lower dosages 10 milligrams is
a good starting dose 15 milligrams sort of an average
dose 20 milligrams is a high dose 25 milligrams is
probably the most you should ever do and anything above
25 milligrams is probably overkill and can create health risks
below 25 milligrams you should not have health risks if
you're a normal healthy individual not on medication and you're
not mixing this with alcohol or any other stuff the
hcl version you take a little bit more of so
20 milligrams might be a good starting dose uh 25
might be medium and then 30 milligrams might be a
breakthrough dose and anything above 30 milligrams you got to
be careful with because you're starting to get into uh
territory that might cause you health risks if you overdose
on 5 meo what's probably going to happen most likely
so you're going to go unconscious for the duration of
that experience and you're just going to wake back up
10 or 20 or 30 minutes later not knowing what
really happened to you you can also experience seizures you
can experience all sorts of heart issues because it elevates
your heart rate elevates your blood pressure and so forth
so you do have to be careful there and i'll
talk more about that as we continue the highest i've
done is 30 milligrams that was my breakthrough experience to
experience absolute infinity that's what you should be aiming towards
is a breakthrough experience you don't want to just try
this substance and then just see what it does once
you want to work to the breakthrough experience start low
work up high until you get your breakthrough okay that
way you know that you're not going to overshoot if
you slowly work your way up what's the procedure for
snorting the substance this is interesting i did some trial
and error and found a pretty good method that works
for me let me share with you first what i
do is i weigh out my dose into two halves
so if i'm going to take 30 milligrams let's say
i'll weigh out 15 and then another batch of 15
milligrams why two halves because you got two nostrils and
you want to divide the dose equally between the nostrils
so that more of it can be absorbed what you
do then is you create a little plastic tube you
can either get a plastic straw cut it so that
it's short or you can take a little piece of
paper or like a post-it note and roll it up
into a little tube short little tube which you can
stick in your nose and then snort this uh these
two piles of white powder when you snort it it's
going to feel like you just snorted some finely ground
white ground pepper into your nostrils which you can imagine
is going to burn and sting a bit and some
people don't like that sensation but actually i find it
kind of uh oddly interesting and kind of like pleasant
it's not pleasant but it's kind of like this odd
interesting sensation which isn't too much of a problem for
me because the experience you're about to go into is
going to be so freaking explosive and crazy that you're
not going to have any issues you're going to completely
forget any little physical discomforts that you have from snorting
the substance now the key that i found is that
after you snort it go quickly sit on your couch
because you got about five or ten minutes until this
really hits you hard and what you need to do
as you're sitting on your couch and just relaxing is
tilt your head upside down so that this substance doesn't
leak out of your front nose and it doesn't leak
back out down your throat if it leaks out the
front or the back you're going to lose a large
quantity of the substance it's not going to absorb into
the nostril tissues and you're not going to have the
trip that you were expecting it's going to be far
far far less so what you need to do what
i do is i sit on the couch i tilt
my head down almost until it's touching the carpet floor
and i just leave it like that for about five
or ten minutes because i just want the all that
stuff to kind of accumulate in my nose and not
drip down anywhere and uh get absorbed into the flesh
of the nose and then go straight to my brain
and as your head is down there you're gonna start
to feel this thing quickly quickly taking effect on you
after about five or ten minutes when you know that
this stuff has really gotten absorbed then you can lift
your head back up and just sit back and relax
uh you'll probably have still a little bit of leakage
so have some tissues handy to just kind of like
wipe your nose but also keep sniffing it all in
don't let it leak out like this just keep sniffing
it in throughout the whole experience so that you can
get as much of your trip as you can you
don't want to waste the substance and then yeah all
you got to do is wait five or 10 minutes
and then it's going to hit you really really hard
what's the experience feel like of taking 5 meo well
at first what you're going to experience is you're going
to experience terror fear and panic the first time i
took five meow i took a small dose just to
test it out and i experienced a full-blown panic attack
because remember what the substance does is it rips your
ego away from you your ego is everything you hold
dear in life it's your entire life you're facing your
death here and i'm not exaggerating it will feel like
you're dying at first not because it's painful but just
because it feels like you're going away and you're not
sure if you're ever coming back of course you're coming
back but you're not sure of that when it's happening
to you and it feels quite weird and your consciousness
starts skyrocketing and your ego starts dipping down to zero
and that can be a pretty freaky experience if you're
not ready for that so you're gonna have to face
your own death before you can see god you see
because the only thing blocking you from god is your
ego that has to go but that won't go without
a struggle you know i've never had a panic attack
in my entire life i'm not a very panicky person
i'm pretty emotionally grounded but here i took the substance
and i had all these negative thoughts like what did
i do maybe i poisoned myself where is this going
to take me because i knew it was going to
be powerful although i still didn't know how powerful is
going to be but uh yeah it made me freak
out for about five or ten minutes and what i
have to do is just completely calm myself down through
meditation and um just relaxing my body letting everything all
the muscles kind of relax opening my body up to
surrender to the experience and so once i surrender to
the experience it just took me over overwhelmed me and
then i got to the peak the peak experience is
nothing short of experiencing god as absolute infinity god is
not a person don't anthropomorphize god god is absolutely everything
that's possible that's what god is so you can experience
that you can become that and when you do become
that it'll be such a shocking experience to you that
you will think your life has ended and that you
have ascended to nirvana and that you have experienced full
awakening and it'll feel like this is it this is
permanent like nothing can ever touch you again you will
feel untouchable you will feel immortal and these will not
be delusions this will be truth this will feel more
true to you than anything you've ever known in your
entire life and you will immediately recognize that your entire
life what you call reality what we collectively call human
reality that this is a this is a dream and
that you finally awoken from it it's extremely powerful it's
a life-changing experience you could meditate for 10 or 20
years and not go this deep it's that powerful it's
so powerful that i've read reports of 5meo being used
to treat heroin addiction it's very effective against heroin addiction
what they do is they take a 20-year heroin addict
who's been living on the streets his whole life for
20 years taking like two or three grams of heroin
per day for 20 years and they give this guy
a hit of 5meo and he's cured in one hit
even though this guy has tried methadone he's tried therapy
he's tried rehab many many times and nothing helped him
but he gets one hit of five meow he sees
god and his whole life has been flipped upside down
from that point on that doesn't happen with every heroin
addict but it's actually a quite common story among heroin
addicts and this substance 5meo is gaining popularity and it's
being used in medical context for example in mexico to
very successfully treat uh substance addiction from heroin to other
drugs to alcohol it's proven very powerful for that now
imagine imagine how powerful of an experience you would have
to have if you were a 20-year heroin junkie and
nothing has ever helped you that one of these experiences
cures you imagine how powerful that experience would have to
be now you have a little bit of an idea
of what fmeo can offer now some people might say
well leo what you're talking about here sounds way too
good to be true what's the catch here i mean
it sounds like you're saying i can just take this
pill and get enlightened well not so fast first of
all there's a lot of ignorance about 5ml you wonder
how come is not everybody taking five emil well first
of all it's illegal in many places uh and it's
illegal because people don't know what it can do also
most people don't know about it even people who do
psychedelics don't know about fidemio because they're simply ignorant you
know now because you've been very lucky to hear about
it for me and chances are if you haven't heard
it from me you haven't heard it from anybody else
so at this point in human uh civilization and history
most people don't know about five meow if everybody knew
about five meow we'd be living in a totally different
world so there's the catch of ignorance there's also the
catch of close-mindedness most people including maybe yourself are too
closed-minded to actually take this substance and to experience everything
it has to offer you because i'll tell you this
if you take this substance every single one of your
world views and beliefs whether it's religious or scientific or
atheistic or whatever will be shattered are you open to
that if you're not you won't even come close to
this substance that's a freaky thing when all your beliefs
and ideas about reality are shattered within minutes many people
can't handle that many people aren't emotionally or psychologically mature
enough to deal with that there's also your ego which
is a huge catch your ego will do anything it
can to maintain itself to maintain its delusion and to
not die and with this substance you're going to be
subjecting your ego to death and you might say well
leo that's fine i don't care about ego death that's
not a big deal to me you don't know yet
what it's like to face your own death for real
not as an idea but for real right now you
feel like oh yeah i can do it i have
no problem with that but then when you snort that
substance up your nose and you got five or ten
minutes until it starts kicking in oh and then you're
gonna feel it then you're gonna feel what it's like
and whether you're really ready or not to die and
whether you can surrender to that or whether you're going
to resist yourself and fight it all the way see
so that's a huge obstacle and a huge catch here
also 5meo is quite rare it's difficult to find it's
not popular amongst regular psychedelic users you're not going to
find your weed dealer providing you with 5meo you're going
to have to go out of your way to find
it just several years ago it was outlawed in the
united states believe it or not four years ago 5meo
was technically legal uh also very recently just a year
ago it was outlawed in china that's important because the
majority of the production of 5meo takes place in china
so now that it's been outlawed in china you can't
manufacture it there illegally and so supplies of it are
very short so that makes it even harder to acquire
5meo is still legal in some areas for example in
mexico still illegal in mexico so in theory if you
wanted to try it legally you could go visit mexico
find somebody who provides it and have your trip and
by the way that would be totally worth it if
you had to pay several thousand dollars or even travel
halfway around the world to mexico to try five meow
it would still be totally worth it because this experience
will completely change your whole life forever you see um
if it costs you a million dollars to have this
experience one time in your life it would still be
worth it this experience is worth more i think than
you know some people pay millions of dollars some rich
people to like fly out into space they'll pay 10
20 million dollars to have the russians fly them out
into space so they can look down on the earth
and that's like supposed to be a very cosmic sort
of experience right once in a lifetime sort of experience
i would bet you that 5meo will do more for
you than if you flew out into outer space and
saw the earth from [Music] from your spaceship that's how
powerful it is and you know people travel to places
like peru all the time to do ayahuasca ceremonies and
uh 5meo is way more powerful than ayahuasca it's going
to be way more pleasant than ayahuasca and peru is
much further than mexico from most places another catch is
that one dose of fiber meal will not enlighten you
i think it'll give you a genuine experience of your
absolute nature as god in absolutely everything and also nothing
but it's not going to make you permanently enlightened so
is it a magic pill well i'm going to talk
more about that as we continue because i think that
there's a possibility to use it towards enlightenment but that's
more than just the way that most people use it
most people even if they have tried five meo they
took it once or twice they experienced something crazy and
far out there and now they're just back to normal
and that's it but that's not what i'm interested in
what i'm interested in is full enlightenment how do you
get full enlightenment well first of all you have to
be serious about enlightenment and most people who do psychedelics
are not they don't even know about enlightenment that's another
catch to this whole thing is that most people are
not serious about non-duality so even if they do psychedelics
it doesn't do much for them you have to be
a student a deep student of nonduality you have to
be a deep practitioner of it already to really get
the benefits here also there's a risk of abuse with
5 meo it could have potentially lethal and other serious
psychological and health consequences you could overdose on it you
could do it in the wrong setting you could do
it at a party or something like that you know
um you could do it and you can misinterpret it
because you haven't really studied nonduality so there's a lot
of potential catches here and why this thing is not
just a straightforward magic pill that just any idiot can
use you have to be careful and intelligent about how
you use it it's a powerful tool and like every
powerful tool it can be abused speaking of which let
me give you some warnings and tips for how to
use this safely and effectively first of all remember that
this will create an experience of total psychological death in
you are you ready for that can you handle that
or are you going to freak out if you're going
to freak out don't take it if you can't surrender
to death don't take it also don't take 5mm if
you have a heart condition or high blood pressure because
what will happen especially in the first 5 or 10
minutes is that your heart rate will go through the
roof as you're experiencing your death also don't take it
if you are on various kinds of medications especially something
like anti-depression medication or antipsychotic medications do not mix 5m
with those don't take this if you're mentally unstable don't
take this if you're under 21. i don't recommend it
because you're not going to be mature enough to fully
understand and appreciate and integrate this experience chances are it'll
just freak you out and leave you confused build your
foundation first then you can take it always start with
a low dose and this is interesting because with 5mao
actually the low dose is more likely to give you
a panic attack than a high dose because what the
low dose will do is remove your ego sort of
but not give you a big enough boost to your
consciousness to experience absolute infinity so the low dose actually
will freak you out more but i still think you
should start with a low dose get the freak out
out of the way with your first dose and then
all your successive doses will go a lot smoother it'll
be a lot easier also don't start with a large
dose because you just don't know how much it'll affect
you you know for some people they might be very
very sensitive and so for the for them even an
average dose might actually turn out to be too high
it's super critical that you weigh your dose very carefully
and accurately make sure you have a milligram scale remember
that every milligram counts and make sure your scale is
calibrated properly only do five mo in a safe setting
i recommend only doing it at home when you have
the whole day off nothing to do you've removed all
the dangerous objects in your house all the knives all
the swords all the guns uh any sources of fire
or flame and do it in your living room where
you don't have any sharp corners nothing you can hit
your head against or something like this right so make
your setting very very safe comfortable and so that nobody
ever distracts you don't do it outside don't do it
at a party don't do it with a bunch of
friends that's all nonsense surrender fully to the experience this
is the number one rule that you need to remember
to have a good experience on five meo fully surrender
what does this mean this means when you're starting to
have negative thoughts you're starting to freak out and tense
up and your body starts to contort and close up
what you need to do is the only thing you
really can do is open your body up physically make
sure your arms are crossed your legs aren't crossed open
yourself up relax your body let every muscle go limp
and loose and relax your mind use any kind of
meditative techniques that you have and just calm yourself down
and completely give yourself over to the experience come what
may that means if you're gonna die you're gonna die
and you're fine with it you just accept it and
you give into it now that's a tall order to
fill many people can't do that in which case well
you might have a horrible horrible horrible experience so 5
meo will blast you into absolute infinity but you still
have control and if you decide that you don't want
to go to absolute infinity if you decide that you're
going to hold back and you're just going to sit
in your little ego and that you're not ready to
die and all this kind of stuff if you get
egotistical once you've taken the substance that's going to be
like pushing the gas full throttle in your car and
hitting the brakes right after that's going to be the
effect it's not going to be pleasant right you will
basically eliminate the possibility of all the positive amazing stuff
you can experience and magnify all the negative stuff because
you're going to be resisting it full throttle and that's
going to be terrible if you read trip reports about
5meo it has a huge range of trip reports from
the most horrific and hellish that you can possibly imagine
to the most beautiful and divine why is that i
think mostly that is because people who try it are
not actually aware of what the ego is and what
it means to surrender the ego they haven't done any
kind of preparatory work they don't understand non-duality at all
and so they're freaked out and once they start to
get towards the higher end of the experience they say
nope nope nope no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
do that i'm not gonna do that i'm not ready
to die and they're going to cling and then that's
when they have their hellish experiences so if you've taken
the substance and you're sitting there on the couch and
you're just waiting for time to take down and you're
freaking out just remember what leo told you fully surrender
and open your body fully surrender and open your body
this is the thing that will save you and the
last tip i'll give you is give yourself time to
integrate the experience so after you come back down you're
going to be sort of like normal except you've seen
something that no other human being around you has ever
seen this is going to freak you out it's going
to shatter your notions of what's real and what's possible
in life everything's going to be turned upside down in
your life you're not going to know what this means
for your relationships for your career for your marriage for
your kids and everything else and so you need to
give yourself time to to work through that not to
hide it under the rug not to run away from
it but to work through it that's where the real
growth comes in see a lot of people think like
oh this is a magic pill it avoids you having
to do any emotional work actually no this is a
catalyst that thrusts you into dealing with all your inner
demons and the more inner demons you have the more
[ __ ] you will have come up and that
you will have to deal with see so be prepared
for that give yourself time the day after to do
that don't just run off to work and then shove
this under the rug also 5-meow seems to have no
tolerance which means you can take it often if you
want to take it every day it seems like you
can i haven't tried it but seems like you can
but i would recommend that you don't take it more
often than once a week just so you make sure
you don't develop a psychological dependence on it this substance
is not addictive but any substance or anything in life
you can develop a psychological addiction to you can develop
a psychological addiction to sleeping or walking or talking right
so um so you can with 5meo but it doesn't
seem to have a tolerance like other psychedelics so you
can do it often but i recommend waiting at least
a week probably a good idea if you're going to
be taking this habitually in order to work on your
consciousness probably want to do it maybe twice a month
at the most because this is such a powerful substance
there is no way you can integrate this stuff in
just one or two days you need to give yourself
time to come back down really think about it integrate
it fully um after my last breakthrough dose i haven't
done it for a month even though i kind of
want to but every time i want to i kind
of just go oh man it was such a powerful
experience i don't know if i'm ready right now to
handle that maybe i'll wait another week and so i've
been waiting a week a week a week a week
and a month has gone by see and i don't
feel like it's addictive to me at all it's actually
quite frightening it's quite challenging it's very emotionally challenging even
though it's very beautiful what about the health effects well
i think that if you're a normal healthy psychologically mature
adult then you should not experience any negative health effects
but of course we can't be sure about that there's
risk with any medication you take whether it's a non-prescription
drug or a prescription drug right we just don't know
that's why you want to try small doses but from
anecdotal evidence from other people who've done it it seems
like you can do five meal hundreds maybe even thousands
of times without any negative health consequences one of the
reasons i think that that is is because five meow
is a neurotransmitter that naturally occurs in your brain already
so the only way you can really damage yourself is
by overdosing which you have to be careful about but
if you don't overdose i don't really see serious long-term
consequences um generally speaking remember your health i don't know
about your health i don't know about your genetics everybody's
different everyone's unique so the risk is totally on you
you have to take full responsibility if you want to
play around with this substance and the other thing i'll
warn you about is that you have to be careful
with how fibre meal potentiates all their psychedelics after you
do your 5 meo trip and you come back and
then let's say a month later you want to try
some mushrooms or some lsd or some dmt regular dmt
you might be shocked to learn that your mushroom trip
even at the low doses is going to be epic
epic epic epic and deep because after 5 meo everything
else becomes a little bit like 5 meo and you
start to see the infinite the absolute infinity on any
psychedelic that you're on i took a mushroom a low
mushroom dose about a week after my big five meow
experience and man that um that was a really tough
mushroom trip because it it really took me by surprise
it blindsided me because i was expecting some fun little
light experience and i got this very very heavy deep
um dose because it was potentiated by the 5meo that
i had a week prior can 5meo be used for
enlightenment that's the million dollar question and uh that's the
most beautiful thing i think that i've discovered is that
it can my theory is that five meow if used
repeatedly and in conjunction with meditation and self-inquiry and personal
development if all of that does if all that is
done simultaneously over a long period of time like over
the period of a year then what will happen is
that eventually these peak experience that you're having on five
mio they will crack your mind open they will crack
the ego they will sort of deliver a mortal wound
and eventually your ego will bleed dry and you will
then become permanently enlightened that's my theory i've discovered one
person who has done it this way and it's worked
for him this way i will actually be interviewing that
person i actually already interviewed him i just need to
post the video and that will probably happen over the
next month or two so look out for that that'll
be very interesting um but i also intend to field
test this theory myself so over the next year what
you will see with me if you want you stay
tuned watch me and we'll see what happens to me
with this sort of practice what will happen what will
happen to my consciousness where will it take me i'm
still continuing my meditation habits still continuing myself inquiry habits
still doing all the personal development habits so all those
are still in effect for me this is just a
catalyst it's not really a magic pill because it's still
emotionally taxing this is not easy work you will still
have to work through all your inner demons you'll just
have to work through them faster rather than spreading out
all this inner demon work over the course of 10
or 20 years it's going to be condensed into the
course of one year you see faster tougher but also
uh the fruits should come faster too this would be
not much different than enrolling yourself for example in a
zen monastery because you want to catalyze your progress towards
enlightenment well this is sort of like that just uh
a different technology i actually think that 5meo culturally at
this point in our human evolution might be the most
important technology that we have right now we don't need
faster computers and faster airplanes and bigger nuclear weapons all
right we've got enough of that humanity as really a
tipping point right now because collectively our ego is so
vast and our ignorance is so deep and our wisdom
is so shallow and our consciousness is so low as
a species that over the next 200 years we have
a real chance of annihilating ourselves or damaging this ecosystem
that we're on uh critically okay because right now what
we have is we have materialism run amok religious dogma
run a book political ideologies run amok and there's no
end in sight it doesn't look pretty humanity needs to
wise up and needs to wake up and what's going
to do that the traditional enlightenment path that's very very
[ __ ] hard it's grueling i'm not even sure
that most human beings can handle it given their upbringing
and given their genetics quite frankly i don't even know
if their minds and their brains can handle it but
with 5meo this is a technology that we recently discovered
that can make god empirical you see it can make
higher consciousness an empirical tangible thing a scientific thing rather
than some sort of airy fairy woo-woo thing only for
deeply religious people that's been the problem for the last
2000 years that we've had religious people but those religious
people have actually distorted religion they have turned religion into
a technology that actually prevents people from becoming enlightened rather
than facilitates it and then the scientific community has reacted
against that because the scientific community thinks that all that
is hogwash and so the truth is lost in the
midst of all that well here we have the perfect
technology if there's anything that will make enlightenment mainstream it's
m eo because you can take it no matter who
you are republican democrat christian hindu muslim young or old
developed or undeveloped rich or poor you can take this
substance and within 15 minutes if you surrender to it
and you're open-minded you will experience the deepest wisdom that
our religious traditions and our spiritual traditions are founded upon
and that will be a life transforming experience for you
that will break your ego down so that you stop
creating this cycle of self-destruction both individually in your life
and collectively as part of the community and part of
the species so i actually think that five amio is
more than just uh a psychedelic and it's more than
just a way to personal enlightenment it really could be
uh the salvation of the human race and so in
the future i anticipate that i'll actually be a champion
of five meow and um i look forward to getting
more people to know about it because i think uh
quite frankly the uh the future of humanity could depend
upon it so follow with me follow my journey if
you want see what you can experiment with on yourself
i will be adding some new books to my book
list about psychedelics and about 5meo that will give you
more of a deeper understanding of the tradition of psychedelics
as it stretches back into our very beginning as a
civilization and that will be some good research i always
recommend if you're going to get into psychedelics make sure
you do the groundwork and the research about where they
come from and how they work and who's used them
and what kind of experiences people have had so check
out my book list those will be coming soon and
uh i will be releasing soon that interview with the
with the guy who i found who has become enlightened
through 5mao use that'll be pretty exciting uh that's it
