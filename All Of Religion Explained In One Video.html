hey this is Leo for actualised org and here I'm
going to attempt to explain all of religion in one
video one of the most fascinating questions that we encounter
as human beings living this social existence and having this
one life that we live through and we go through
and discover all this stuff about what life is is
the existence of religions not just one religion but many
many many religions and is very fascinating how seriously people
take their religions how passionate they are about them how
they're willing to fight to the death to defend them
and also how science plays into this and the whole
history of religion so in this video I want to
tackle this topic it's a pretty big topic to tackle
and it's going to play out in a much different
way than you probably think now let me preface by
saying that this is my personal perspective alright this is
my personal perspective from a lot of study that I've
done and I haven't done study so much on religions
but I've done study on philosophy and I've done study
on personal development and most recently I've done a lot
of study on consciousness what is consciousness and that led
me to the study of enlightenment and what is enlightenment
and all of this has very interesting ramifications for my
understanding of religions in fact I just came back from
a from an enlightenment workshop I spent seven days immersed
in a workshop mind-blowing profound realizations that I've had them
I'm seeing reality differently now from that workshop and I'm
seeing religion in a more clear light at least in
my opinion and so I wanted just to share some
of my insights with you about religion if you're kind
of curious about this you know just good curiosity sake
um and you know I used to be an atheist
for pretty much most of my life ever since so
I remember remember debating some really religious friend that I
had in high school uh and just not understanding how
someone could be so religious he was a Christian Protestant
I believe I don't exactly remember which denomination but it
really really devout Christian and it just I couldn't grasp
it because from a scientific rational perspective religions don't make
a lot of sense and yet you've got so many
people believing in religions and so you start to wonder
like well how could this be how could you have
billions of people so bought into religion and if religions
are false which is what the scientific perspective says about
them that they're just kind of fairy tales and stories
and myths then why are there so many similarities between
different religions and how could religions have gotten such a
strong foothold on culture and society so very deep and
perplexing question that's not as easy to answer as you
might think now I'm going to warn you that you're
not going to like what I have to say in
this video if you're rationally minded and I am rationally
minded to but I've gone through a long journey of
exploring lots of different stuff and I'm extremely extremely extremely
open-minded so this has helped me in my ability to
investigate this stuff but what I find is that a
lot of rational people they're rational but they're actually also
very similar to religious people sometimes very scientifically minded or
rational or even atheistic person will think that they're a
hundred and eighty degrees away from religion but actually what
I'm going to suggest to you is that if you
are that type of person that you have a lot
more in common with religious people then you like to
admit and we'll get to that as we continue also
though even though I'm going to be saying some stuff
here that your rational mind is not going to like
this video is not a defense of religion and in
the end what I'm going to tell you is that
you should be dropping religious beliefs if you've got any
so let's just start cracking into it another important tablet
that I want to make here is that what I'm
going to be telling you in this video is going
to really strain your rational mind but everything I tell
you here will be empirical I'm making empirical factual verifiable
claims that I claim you can verify in your own
direct experience so this is not going to be some
mystical talk this is not going to be like most
religious talk which is just talk about stuff that you're
supposed to have faith in and believe on blind faith
and really there's nothing tangible that you can verify or
not verify prove or disprove what I'm telling here is
going to be very provable if you want it if
you want to prove it it's gonna take a little
work though so the core problem here between this whole
religion versus science debate is that human beings are extremely
extremely dogmatic dogmatic that's the key word here dogmatic what
does dogmatic mean dogmatic doesn't pertain to religions or to
science or to any particular thing dogmatic means that you
cling to a particular worldview or belief now when you
do this you don't tell yourself that you're clinging to
a worldview or to our belief what you tell yourself
is that you have the facts and that this is
just a fact and it's true it doesn't feel like
you're clinging to anything but in fact what you are
doing is you're clinging and this closes your mind down
and doesn't permit you to do a very exhaustive open-minded
search right so the trick here is not only are
we dogmatic but we lie to ourselves about being dogmatic
right we don't honestly tell ourselves that were dogmatic we
just behave dogmatically and we do this unconsciously and we
will defend often to the death our dogmatism denying that
it's dogmatism so this is not a problem of religion
this is a problem of the human psyche right this
is a problem of the human psyche because when the
human psyche takes on a core assumption or belief no
matter what it is whether it's a religious one or
something totally different doesn't really matter you cling to it
you make it a part of your self-identity you make
it a part of your self-image and when you do
that you identify with it and you feel like you
need to defend it and that's why having a discussion
about religion at the dinner table will often turn into
some heated debate or argument or people's feelings get hurt
is because we don't just treat this logically intellectually rationally
we treat these issues emotionally right they trigger us emotionally
and don't think that just because you have a rational
way of looking at the world that you are not
dogmatic see your rational way of looking at the world
is still emotionally grounded and it triggers just as easily
in you so let's say a rational person as it
would in a religious dogmatic fanatical person this is a
very common mistake that I see uh atheists making is
that they think that just because they're an atheist that
they're not dogmatic well what I find in practice is
that most atheists are actually very very very dogmatic and
this upsets them to hear because they like to use
this as a separation between themselves and religious people but
actually you're on the same side on that point right
the difference you have with religious people is that you
have a different kind of dogmatism when I'm suggest to
you here though is that you'd be much better served
to move away from dogmatism entirely because then you could
see this whole debate from a much higher elevated viewpoint
and you can get a lot of perspective and a
lot of emotional release from giving up your dogmatism but
this is a trick thing to do see another problem
here is that rational people see religion as foolish right
why well because we go out into the world and
this is you know how I thought for most of
my life is that I I'm here in life and
I don't see any supernatural phenomenon I don't see any
gods I don't see any miracles I don't see Zeus
you know throwing Thunderbolts on onto the earth I don't
see any supernatural stuff so why would I assume that
supernatural stuff exists and because of this fundamental incongruity basically
religion looks like a hoax because religion is talking about
supernatural deities and beings and and miracles happening and all
this stuff but then you look at at real life
and you're like dude I mean just get real what
are you talking about this stuff is clearly not here
what are you smoking right so that's that's one issue
we've got here um but really you have to ask
yourself why does religion exist not just one but many
many religions and these religions it's not like they're all
just totally random different religions they seem to have a
lot of common elements and threads between them even though
superficially they might look very different also from a big-picture
point of view they all sound and start to converge
and look very similar so why is this going on
very interesting question you have to think about this question
very open-mindedly though because I a lot of explanations that
come to mind and I mean I've come up with
these explanations for myself when I was younger and I
you know bred books and heard other people talk about
what the origins of religion might be and I want
to suggest that the following origins which I want to
list off are not good explanations so one explains you
might think well religion is just primitive stupidity right primitive
cultures thousands of years ago they really don't understand life
didn't understand themselves they don't understand how the mind works
or science and so they just were basically foolish and
their primitive ideas somehow evolved it into these organized religions
I want to suggest to you that that's not a
really good explanation nor do I think religion is merely
superstition that's been formalized and codified I don't think that's
a really good explanation either nor do I think that
tradition is a good explanation for what religion is and
why it originated it's not merely from tradition that these
things arose there seems to be a much stronger force
at play there than just tradition because there's a lot
of different kinds of tradition that we could have had
that was not mystical or religion based or God based
nor do I think that this explanation of religion as
a social political controlling mechanism is a satisfactory explanation for
example some people would say that well the region religion
existed is to control the masses right especially in the
old days where the masses were really stupid and there
was less social structures we didn't even have countries we
had like city-states and tribes that in this kind of
environment you basically needed some kind of abstract system of
belief that would kind of bring together and make cohesive
a bunch of different people give them a sense of
direction and purpose in life or whatever or maybe it
was used by some ruler or king to control his
people and to pacifies people against rebellion that sort of
stuff and while I think that that's definitely been done
in the past is that political leaders and religious leaders
have used religion as a controlling mechanism for for basically
that it's like social engineering and to profit themselves and
other such things to gain power to maintain power over
people that certainly happened but it doesn't make sense that
that was the origin of religion and nor does it
make sense that religion is just merely a collection of
myths or fairy tales this also doesn't make sense because
the myths and fairy tales they could have been very
random and very different than they ended up being and
it doesn't quite explain what and why religion is so
all of those things might be true to some degree
but they miss like the core they miss the core
that's there and the core that I want to tell
you about right here which I've been thinking about a
lot about this this this week as I've been working
really hard on my enlightenment and studying a lot of
consciousness material and this is the thing that you're really
really not going to like you're really not going to
like this your your rational mind is not going to
like this is that there is an absolute truth and
this absolute truth is accessible to human beings again there
is an absolute truth and this absolute truth is accessible
to human beings and here's the really nasty bit that
you're not going to like it's not accessible to the
rational mind it is not accessible to the rational mind
the scientific rational mind hates this it hates this idea
this idea is not something it wants to accept so
what I submit to you is that if your mind
is rejecting this idea and it's not even open to
this possibility than what your being is you're being dogmatic
now here I just stated this but I want to
go in and explain how this can be possible and
why you're missing this why your rational mind is missing
this because your rational mind is rejecting out of hand
this idea that there could be something outside of the
rational mind it seems silly it seems superstitious it seems
mystical it seems well religious and religious is a bad
word but I want to urge you to be a
little bit more cautious and careful and open-minded here because
I'm going to lay something on you that's going to
be pretty deep so here's how it works I'll tell
you exactly the structure of the core of religion and
my claim here is that this structure is actually true
this structure is actually true so here's how it works
you've got a sense of self of personal self you
believe that you're a body and you believe that you're
this mind and the brain inside the body and you've
got this personal story you can remember the time that
you were born and the way that you grew up
and where you are now and you believe you're going
to die and yada yada yada right and that all
makes pretty good sense except there's one problem and that
problem is that if you look really carefully and really
deeply what you're going to realize is that this sense
of self that you have is actually an illusion and
if there is no such thing as a sense of
self so the thing that you call you the thing
that you the thing that you think you are most
certainly when we say your name the thing that points
to well that thing is actually a big confusion and
a big mistake in your mind so what's possible then
is it it's possible to basically jailbreak your brain right
you know how they jailbreak cellphones to break out of
the crappy operating system or whatever install whatever software you
want well what's empirically possible is to jailbreak your brain
and you can jailbreak the mind from the brain pretty
cool in doing so what you discover is that the
self the self that you believe that you are everything
you believe that you perceive is actually not being perceived
by a you and this answers a very deep existential
question and the existential question that it answers is that
it answers who you really are you believe right now
that you're this physical body well what I'm telling you
is that that's false that's a false identification you're identifying
with your physical body in the same way that maybe
a psychotic person might identify with being a a chair
or a tree or something in the same way you're
identifying with your body it certainly feels very real but
it's not true when you break through that illusion and
you find what's true is you discover something well that's
quite unfathomable and literally in communicable and that is that
the self the true self not the false self but
the true self is nothing and this nothing is a
very special thing this is not something to be dismissed
lightly nothing here I mean literally you are literally nothingness
this cannot be believed or logically understood it has to
be directly experience you are the nothingness so you are
it once you realize it you can actually be it
you can be the nothingness so the self is nothing
okay that's step one the second step is to and
by the way when you experience that that's called enlightenment
when you realize that that's called enlightenment so after you
get your first enlightenment about yourself then comes the next
even bigger enlightenment and that is answering X essentially what
is existence have you ever wondered about that what the
hell is existence how can existence even exist ever wondered
about that well what it turns out is that you
can have an enlightenment experience that will reveal to you
the absolute nature of existence and what that absolute nature
is is nothingness existence and nothingness are the same they
arise out of each other or more accurately existence arises
out of nothingness and that nothingness doesn't go away it's
always there this is referred to as the void in
certain Buddhist traditions or maybe Zen traditions they call it
the void so all of reality comes from nothingness now
this might seem like okay that kind of maybe make
sense or whatever but see I'm not telling you here
to believe it or to take it on as a
theory I'm telling you that you can actually get a
direct encounter with this truth the other enlightenment that you
can have there's multiple enlightenment so you can have another
Lightman you can have is that other people others around
you everyone you see are also noting also nothingness and
what that means is that because you're nothing and they're
nothing that you and them are identical the same at
an existential metaphysical level you're identical so you could have
that enlightenment experience and then ultimately what you discover is
you piece all these things together and you get a
direct experience of the absolute truth and the absolute truth
is basically that existence arises out of nothing this nothingness
this ultimate void is God the word God refers to
this nothingness because it's the source of everything right it's
not a personal God it's not a God with a
beard it's not a goddess him or her but it's
God in the sense that is the source of all
reality and this nothingness is a unity it's one and
it has no space it has no location it has
no distance it has no size because nothingness doesn't have
any of those qualities what we're talking about here is
not an idea of nothingness which is something but we're
talking about literally nothingness and what you discover is that
you are nothing and God is nothing and so because
this because of this you are God that right there
is the core of every major religion all major religions
are grounded in the truth of no self that's what
I like to call it the truth of no self
Christianity is founded on this as is Judaism Islam Hinduism
Buddhism Taoism Zen even Sufi ISM and yogic practices in
India and in the East all of these different religions
are really different ways very roundabout way is often to
explain what I just explained to you now there's an
additional really big wrinkle in this whole thing is that
what I explained to you here is just like a
vague vague vague vague story still a story not reality
about what reality is right and so just consider for
a second I know that what I said might sound
crazy to you I sound very implausible or whatever but
just consider for a second that if this mechanism that
I explained is actually accurate and correct it would certainly
explain a whole hell of a lot about why religions
are and how they are and how they came to
be wouldn't it wouldn't explain a whole hell of a
lot if you look at religions through this lens let's
take a look at it right but you have to
take into consideration that this idea of no self this
truth of no self as I call it that this
is something that has to be directly experienced this is
not something that can be spoken or logically analyzed why
because when you think about nothingness it's already something what
is the one thing that you cannot intellectualize about its
nothingness you can't intellectualize nothing that's because when you're intellectualizing
that's something so the problem here becomes that if you
want to get at the nothingness you can't do it
through your conventional practical everyday logical thinking you can't do
it through scientific thinking you can't do it through language
and by the way science is language science is language
you cannot do science without language so because of this
you have to be open to a radical new third
alternative of understanding reality what do I mean by a
third alternative well you've got one alternative which is to
conceptualize about it right you can create a model of
how reality works and that's what science loves to do
and that's what we do with even non scientific pursuits
we create models religion creates models - we create models
in our everyday life we create maps of reality and
all this kind of stuff it helps creating these models
so you can create models and concepts and you can
think about reality that's one way to understand reality a
second way arguably even better and more direct is to
actually experience it with your own senses first-person experience who
can doubt what they actually see when you look up
in the in the sky and you see the Sun
or the moon it's really hard to doubt that that
thing exists because you see it right there before your
eyes so experience is really nice and you know one
of the crowning achievements of science is that it what
it did is that it founded its models on experience
so science is great because you actually get to look
at what's their reality experience and then you get to
create a model but that model it's not just some
any model you want to create otherwise that would be
a fairy tale it's actually a model that's pinned down
by experience right so it's limited it's constrained there's verifiability
built into it so that's real cool and then what
we do is we say well that's pretty much all
we've got right you've got experience and you've got your
conceptualizing of experience that's how we know stuff and I
mean that's the end of the story right well what
if it wasn't what if there was a third way
a third way to know stuff what would that way
be you might ask well what if you could actually
be the thing itself think about this so for example
when you're looking at my hand right now you're seeing
it right now the question is you're looking at it
and you see it and it looks like a hand
to you now the question is to the hand itself
to the hand what does the hand actually appear like
does it appear the way it appears to you does
it have colors and stuff or does it actually have
its own being which is different than the way that
it appears to you you're probably going to say yeah
sure it does leo but what are you trying to
say that I can be this hand how can I
be the hand it doesn't make much sense well this
is where the truth of no self becomes very important
because the problem is when you're identified with yourself and
you believe that you're this right here this body and
this mind and these thoughts well then you're stuck and
you can only be this you can't be anything else
now though if you jailbreak your brain if you really
dis identify from everything in your experience including your body
and your thoughts and everything else then this gives you
the freedom to be everything in anything I'm not saying
this figuratively I'm saying it quite literally so this sounds
pretty crazy and it sounds like well it's just just
some sort of myth or something like that but what
I'm saying here is that you can actually do this
in your own experience it's not a myth you don't
need to go read a Bible or whatever to do
this you can actually it can be done now the
trick though is that it's difficult to do this it's
not quite easy and why is that well because you're
extremely attached to your self to your self hood to
your self image and so decide this process of jailbreaking
your mind from the brain this is a very serious
psychological undertaking this does not happen easily because everything in
your psyche resists it in the same way that when
you try to hack an iPhone or whatever the software
in the iPhone resists you hacking it right but there
are hackers who are good enough to hack it and
then what they can do is they can do some
remarkable stuff when they get rid of all those all
those limits that the you know the original phone manufacturers
put on the damn thing all those limits can be
overcome so it's kind of the same with your mind
and your brain now the problem here though is it's
again human beings think extremely dogmatically right remember the original
core problems talked about at the beginning human beings are
extremely dogmatic well if this truth of no self is
communicated to other people because you communicated right you can't
communicate being being something you have to be it you
can't communicate about it anything you communicate about is just
a more story so the only way to get and
use this third alternative of being is to actually do
the being yourself but see the problem is it because
it's so difficult to actually jailbreak your own mind that
when you talk about these things to other people what
they do is they construct stories and they turn this
stuff into belief systems right and then those beliefs they
turn into myths and a lot of times the way
that people talk about these things is through analogy because
that's the only way you can talk about it you
can't talk about it directly to talk about it directly
would be to be the damn thing yourself but see
I can't make you be it you have to do
it yourself so this creates a really big problem because
other forms of human knowledge can be easily spread for
example if you want to write about mathematics you can
write some formulas in a book and you can explain
everything then you can print a million copies of this
book and send it around the world and create classrooms
full of you know calculus books or whatever that will
teach calculus and problem solved now how do you communicate
the truth of no self well you can write it
in a book but the problem is that the person
reading that book just by reading that that doesn't jailbreak
his mind so he still believes he's the self and
he's so dogmatic he doesn't understand he's dogmatic so what
he does is he conflates reality with a belief system
and he thinks that just believing it is enough so
he reads the book he reads about no self he
reads about some God idea or nothingness or whatever and
then he turns it into a belief and so the
only way that you can mass spread the truth of
no self is by turning it into a belief system
which makes it necessarily false you can turn it into
a myth if you want to stay true to the
truth of no self the only way to do that
is through silence you can't say anything so this presents
a really big problem because it turns out then that
you can't mass distribute the truth of no self this
is one of the few truths that cannot be mass
distributed unlike most of science and all the other stuff
that we know all right so this should this should
start to be clicking in your mind you should try
to get this Oh aha right as all the things
you know about religions start clicking into place when you're
looking at it through this lens that I'm sharing with
you let me just continue a little bit more so
now think back to thousand years ago what life was
like or maybe even 5000 years ago back then our
understanding of science and scientific principles and sound philosophical reasoning
processes was non-existent right human beings at that point did
not develop good practical analytical thinking skills so there was
not a really good scientific way very careful methodical way
to explain what I'm explaining to you now in fact
human beings weren't really clear about all the trickiness that
the psyche presents the whole idea of a psyche or
a subconscious mind these ideas they're just a couple hundred
years old a couple hundred think what it was like
to live life two or five thousand years ago it's
like you were living in the dark you were living
in a totally different reality you did not understand reality
the way that you understand it now through science and
so therefore people resorted to mythology and storytelling to talk
about this truth of no self now how did this
work in practice well you have some extremely hardcore really
[ __ ] hardcore guys maybe one in a million
or one out of ten million that will break through
and see the truth of no self by jailbreaking their
mind these were the Mystics these were the Yogi's these
were the Jesus Christ's and the Buddha's these were the
sages these were the Swami's there's so many different names
for these kinds of people right these were the Zen
masters before there are even words and masters you got
a figure this is how it happened and then what
happened is when they break through this and they they
see this amazing mind-blowing shift in perspective on life what
they do of course is that well some of them
remain silent and say nothing but some of them want
to share with others because it's like oh my god
you're living in a [ __ ] dream you're living
in a [ __ ] dream you're mistaken about how
your whole life works and you don't even know it
you don't you don't even have a suspicion of not
even an inkling and if I'm the yogi here and
I'm sitting here I'm looking at you like it's just
preposterous it's preposterous I've broken out of the matrix I
want to help some other people break out of the
matrix and so what I do is I try to
explain it to you in the best way that I
can but again I can't explain it directly I need
you to experience it but the problem is that it's
pretty difficult for you to jailbreak your own mind and
you know 5,000 years ago 2,000 years ago the process
of jailbreaking your mind and achieving an enlightenment experience was
not well studied was not well known and it really
was just kind of like something that happened almost by
blind luck so there was no reliable process to give
to others for having them achieve enlightenment of their own
and see the truth themselves so all that you could
do is you could tell stories and so that's what
people did is they told stories right and as they
told these stories this idea of no self was explained
and tailored to the local culture because the way that
we understand the truth of no self here in the
West in America let's say might be one way and
if you tell it to us in some sort of
cloaked and veiled Indian culture way then we're not going
to we're not going to be receptive to it so
it has to be told in an American way and
if we tell it in Europe it has to be
told it in a European way and if we tell
it in the Middle East it has to be told
in a Middle Eastern way and if we tell it
in India it'll be told in an Indian way and
Africa it'll be told in an African way and so
on and so what you have here is you have
the same truth but it's tailored to the culture and
to the era and the time in which this truth
is discovered now the truth is absolute but every culture
is different right and every culture has stuff that it
likes it doesn't like and dogmatic and close-minded people they're
not very tolerant people so if you want to explain
this stuff to them you have to really tailor it
in such a way that their mind their limited mind
will find it palatable palatable right it's like giving someone
a pill a taste bitter but to make them swallow
it you have to like coated in sugar sugar coating
the pill so in a sense that's what religion tries
to do right and also in a sense no matter
what explanation you give of no self it doesn't really
matter because every explanation is wrong it's not like there's
one right explanation the only right explanation is to actually
have the person become the truth themselves and get it
for themselves everything else is already wrong so in a
sense you could say that you know every twist and
turn that religions put on it it's just like a
a teaching mechanism right it's just a tool now the
question is are you going to be receptive to this
tool is it going to help you to achieve enlightenment
you're for yourself or won't it maybe it'll get you
lost in stories and ideas and looking somewhere where you'll
never find enlightenment and what ended up happening very ironically
actually is that most of religions devolved into exactly this
is you just had people talking and talking talking about
this stuff and believing in it creating dogmas around it
fighting over it and all this of getting psychologically invested
in it without realizing what the hardcore Mystics were really
talking about if you go and you actually study every
major religion we're going to discover is that there's a
hardcore mystical strand it's called esoteric right the esoteric strand
within every religion it exists you'll find it in Christianity
you'll find it in Judaism with Kabbalah you'll find it
in in Islam with stuff like Sufis you'll find it
in in Hinduism and you'll know you'll find it with
yoga and all this stuff you'll find like the hardcore
mystics those are actually the people who are living religion
in a true way but the problem is that they
seem very radical they seem very anti mainstream and that
is of course how it has to be because the
truth of no self is very radical and it's very
anti mainstream you can't mainstream it by definition it's completely
individual it makes the spread of religion impossible it really
does so you have these hard-core mystic esoteric splinter groups
very tiny little niche splinter groups within every religion and
usually what happens is that they're marginalized those people are
demonized they're killed they're driven into caves and into the
woods and all this stuff because there's no way that
they can compete with the hyped up [ __ ]
that's generated when you take the truth of no self
and you spend a bunch of crazy mind-blowing stories about
it right and you give it to the dogmatic mind
the dogmatic mind cannot understand no self but it can
very easily take no self spin some tales about it
and then understand those and latch on and cling to
those which is exactly what religions do right so that's
basically how it works in my mind when I look
at religions is very clear to me through this lens
how it looks the closer you get yourself to enlightenment
the more your awareness is raised about some of these
issues with self image and self concept and jailbreaking your
mind and uh how nothingness really works that nothingness can't
be something this that you can't perceive nothingness because at
reception of nothingness would be something and not nothing when
you start to learn about the the problems with conceptualization
and the fact that to think about something you need
to use a language system to think about it and
that language systems have in hair by Isis and problems
and challenges and when you start to look at all
this stuff you start to see from a very very
clear perspective like oh of course of course there's these
religions of course they work the way they work of
course people buy into them of course right and the
reason you say of course is because you recognize in
yourself that dogmatism that dogmatism that up fanatical religious person
has that dogmatism is in you it's in you you
just deny it maybe you hide it a little bit
better than that person maybe you don't take it to
some really far-fetched extreme maybe you don't act on it
as much but it's still there in you and the
way you can recognize that is just by actually by
feeling it right you can feel that dogmatism when someone
starts disturbing your worldview or your beliefs maybe with a
video like this one what starts to happen is actually
you experience emotions strong emotions distaste fear anger bitterness uncomfort
you know feelings of discomfort demonizing of the other person
burning the person at the stake or whatever creating a
straw man argument out of what they're saying closing your
ears clicking the off button telling your friends how stupid
the idea was that you heard writing a nasty comment
or you know whatever whatever means you use to to
protect your worldview you notice inside though that this is
a it's like a dirty feeling once this happening and
you it's a dirty feeling sometimes it's hard to to
pinpoint it but if you're very self honest you can
say oh yep there it is there's that dirty feeling
inside me it's inside you so in wrapping this up
one thing I want to address is atheism right so
you might you might ask well Leo what about atheism
so is atheism wrong is it false is it true
what's going on well in a sense it's like the
atheist is half right right because what does the atheist
say the atheist says there's no God well the religious
the true religious person what he wants to say is
that there is a God but this God is nothingness
so in a sense that the Atheist and the true
mystic agree right because it's like um there is no
god but the fact that there is a nothingness becomes
the God see nothingness it seems like nothing this is
this all it's just like its nothingness so that lets
you know it's kind of pointless and shallow and Hollow
and there's not much meaning there but actually nothing is
this is a profound absolute existential nothingness it's hard to
appreciate how powerful this nothingness is because there's nothing this
is the source of all life it's a source of
all reality so because it's so profound and because it's
so all inspiring people call it God now the atheists
could say well there is no God but see if
you take that atheist and you actually give him an
enlightenment experience for real and you get him to feel
directly to be the nothingness he is going to have
a real difference of opinion a real difference of attitude
a real difference of perspective things are really going to
change for him and it's not going to be the
typical kind of atheism that you see you know people
talking about so what about science is science wrong well
science is great and with science we can build a
lot of cool stuff and technology and whatever and we
can learn about electrons and protons and all sorts of
cool [ __ ] but there's a really big problem
at the core science right yes signs very practical there's
a really big core problem and that's the matter qualia
problem and this is a problem that science has never
addressed it's a problem that really signs skirts all the
time and my current understanding is that science will never
ever ever ever be able to rectify this problem here's
the problem is that science says that there's physical matter
and there's a physical world and that sounds all great
you know we've got protons and electrons and quarks and
strings and all this energy and whatever other physical things
you want to talk about but science says nothing about
our perceptions so the things that you are considering most
real in your life your feelings your emotions the colors
that you see the smells that you smell the tastes
and the sounds and the qualitative aspects of all that
those things are not atoms or energy or strings or
quarks or molecules or anything else like that if we
cut open your brain we're not going to cut you're
not going to find the color orange in there if
we cut open your brain we're not going to find
the feeling of love or happiness in there and if
we cut open your brain we're not going to find
the sound of a guitar in there and yet these
entities these experiential entities are very very real to us
the thing that science does with this problem is that
it really kind of skirts it under the rug doesn't
like to look at it sometimes it'll deny the existence
of qualia altogether or sometimes it'll come up with some
ham-fisted way of taking matter and qualities of how combining
the together and explaining something away but in the end
it doesn't really resolve this issue now maybe I'm wrong
on this maybe in a thousand years science will resolve
this issue but from where I stand now and from
what I understand about enlightenment is that you're not going
to be able to resolve this issue if you want
to resolve this issue what you have to do is
you have to become enlightened and then the issue resolves
completely like that so the resolution of the issue is
enlightenment but then what that does is that really throws
science on its head really starts to get you questioning
some core assumptions that science makes right so real quickly
I want to just go through and explain a couple
of key terms and concepts that religions rely on pretty
heavily I want to tell you exactly what they mean
in no-bullshit terms so the first one is what is
God God is absolute nothingness it's absolute it's real you
can encounter it you can be it you actually are
it you just don't realize it yet because you're identified
with your body so that's God God is not some
bearded man in the clouds or whatever the [ __
] your religions tell you he is number two have
it in hell what does this mean is their natural
heaven in hell no hell is where you presently live
hell refers to your current existence of being stuck and
identify with your body that is literally hell because you
suffer for it every single day you can't avoid the
suffering because you live with a body that's going to
die right so there's going to be suffering heaven is
the dis identification of yourself with your body and becoming
absolute nothingness you know what's cool about being absolutely no
one and nothing is that nothing can harm you and
nothingness it exists absolutely all the time forever so there's
no worry about your death or whatever other problems happening
to you so this makes you untouchable and that is
heaven okay next idea is faith faith what does faith
mean well faith is actually very interesting this is a
very interesting realization I just had last week from from
this workshop that I did what faith is is your
ability to open your mind up to the third possibility
so you know we have concepts and we have experience
the third possibility is being right this the third possibility
of being well this is something that it's very hard
for the rational mind to open itself up to and
what I've literally found in myself is that I have
to have faith in it now this sounds like a
dirty word to you if you're rational / SEC faith
no I don't want to have faith Lee oh that's
for stupid people and I agree with you except that
in this case if you actually want to have an
Enlightenment experience you're going to need faith you're not going
to do it without faith and so it's kind of
like well is faith really that scary are you so
dogmatic that you're going to be clinging to this idea
of never having faith in the third option and therefore
never experiencing the third option or you can have the
faith to take that you know that leap of faith
and try to go for the direct experience and actually
get the direct experience actually be the thing and then
see what I'm talking about for real for you so
faith is important their next term is good and evil
what are these things mean these are not absolute terms
these are relative terms these are metaphorical terms so what
is evil first of all evil is selfishness evil is
identification with your body and all the actions that you
do to live and perpetuate your ego that's evil that's
literally what evil refers to so also the devil we
should bring the devil in here too what does the
devil refer to the devil refers to you the way
that you're presently living you're a goa Clive so you
are you are the devil right because you're tricking yourself
the devil is deception you're deceiving yourself about being this
body in this mind here which is just not true
and then what is good good is everything you do
from a selfless state good is when you become God
is when you see that your nothingness and therefore you
also see that your everything and you start behaving in
a good way why because when you see that everything
is you you want to treat it well the reason
you treat other people or even physical objects poorly the
reason you litter the reason you steal something the reason
you lie or deceive is because you believe that well
I'm here I need to protect this and that thing
over there is not important screw that so you do
something to improve this at the expense of that well
if you literally believe that your everything you don't want
to hurt anything at the expense of anything else and
then you're good how about afterlife what is afterlife mean
well afterlife means understanding the absolute truth of nothingness because
when you understand the absolute truth of nothingness then you
are in the afterlife already why because you can't be
destroyed you're untouchable nothing less lasts forever and lastly what
is salvation mean salvation means being saved from your wicked
state so metaphorically speaking if we say that you're the
devil right now then what I could do if I'm
enlightened or whatever is that I could communicate this truth
of enlightenment to you sort of maybe within you something
will recognize a spark of truth here and you'll come
towards the light and you'll try to go for the
Enlightenment experience maybe you'll have some faith and you'll open
up yourself to the third possibility and you'll have a
direct experience and then you will become good from evil
and that will be a true salvation a remarkable rebirth
I'm being very poetic in metaphorical here but that's exactly
what the Bible is is a very very loose very
very very very very loose very very very metaphorical very
very very very poetic way of describing some of the
stuff that I've been talking about here and just a
couple of last points to wrap up is that everything
I said here can be directly experienced for you so
the reason that what I'm telling you here is not
religion um is that what I'm telling you here I
invite you to go and realize in your own life
you can verify it right I'm making a verifiable claim
verifiable claim and of course the irony of all this
is that is that religion is really a terrible way
to get to know God the people who are the
most religious are the furthest away from God that's the
whole irony of this thing but of course that means
that if you just become atheistic you know that like
the typical atheist the dogmatic atheist that also puts you
very far away from God so if you really want
to understand the stuff and you want to be one
with God and you are God then what you can
do because your nothingness is you can you can attempt
to attain an Enlightenment experience or two and then in
that process you will become religious but in a non-religious
way in a very non dogmatic way you're not going
to hold a single belief you're not gonna need to
have any theory you're not going to need to partake
it in any ritual you're not going to need to
pray or to meditate or to do anything at all
because your absolute nature is nothingness and that absolute nature
is the same forever and always and it has no
place it has no space it has no time boundaries
it has no problems whatsoever and it's the most beautiful
truth that you can discover in this life so what
I really recommend here even though it sounds like I'm
here promoting religion or whatever you can see that this
video is very nuanced I didn't take any sides here
I really kind of carved out a new space new
space for you hopefully this space looks cool and appealing
and you want to go and try to maybe experience
a bit of it for yourself taste a bit of
it for yourself what I recommend for you is if
you are a religious person and if you do hold
a single religious belief of any kind that you drop
all your religious beliefs because every belief that you have
religious ones or scientific ones or whatever other kind you've
got all of these are holding you back from realizing
your true nature and now hopefully you can appreciate why
true mystics are so rare because it's extremely extremely extremely
difficult to let go of all the beliefs that must
be let go of in order to realize this truth
it's really a scary [ __ ] business it's a
scary [ __ ] business it's not an easy business
this is going to be one of the most difficult
and emotionally grueling and challenging endeavors that you will undertake
in your life and it might take you many many
many years and much much much struggle to do it
and you might even invest all that time energy and
you might fail so so yeah some good news for
