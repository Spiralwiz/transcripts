            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/CyGPqFMy6vY' target='_blank'>Understanding Survival - Part 2 - Advanced Insights About Survival</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Observation and awareness in survival strategies</b>: Leo emphasizes that observation and awareness in personal experiences are important in understanding survival strategies. Humans and other organisms have complex survival strategies, but they are often unconscious of them. Understanding these strategies is key but many times they're overlooked due to their complexity. 
</li><li><b>Symbiotic survival</b>: Survival isn't always a selfish act. Like squirrels and oak trees, survival strategies can sometimes be symbiotic where one entity benefits another even while pursuing its own survival needs. The key point is that the actors, including humans, are often unaware of these benefits and act on autopilot. 
</li><li><b>Hiding the complexity of survival</b>: Modern society often outsources and hides the complexity of survival leading to a disconnection from our survival functions. This can become dangerous as it disconnects people from their role in societal systems which can lead to irresponsible actions.
</li><li><b>Survival and emotional attachment</b>: Emotional responses are often tied to survival mechanisms. Objects central to an individual's survival, like children or parents, bring about a stronger emotional response when threatened compared to objects of less importance like a car or a towel.
</li><li><b>Intelligence in survival strategies</b>: Survival strategies are highly intelligent, adapting over time to ensure the survival of the species. However, this intelligence does not imply consciousness. Many organisms, including humans, are often unaware of their survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity in survival strategies</b>: Personal survival strategies are subjective and dependent on unique contexts, environments, and cultures. It is important to respect and understand these unique perspectives to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
</li><li><b>Importance of worldview in survival</b>: The protection and defense of one's worldview, or "operating system", is a significant aspect of human survival. It shapes personal identity and influences interpretation and understanding of the world. Challenging this worldview can lead to defensive actions as part of their survival strategy.
</li><li><b>Higher consciousness and survival strategies</b>: To transition to higher consciousness survival strategies, individuals need to become conscious of their current survival strategies and the negative impacts they have. This consciousness shift can drive a change in behaviour leading to less harmful actions.
</li><li><b>Understanding survival as an inevitable part of life</b>: Survival is a fundamental and inevitable aspect of life. However, the approach can be changed to become more holistic and harmonious. Consciousness about survival strategies can lead to personal transformation and healthier survival strategies. 
</li><li><b>Shifting consciousness from survival mode to a state of being</b>: Gura discusses techniques like observing objects without personal interpretation or using tools like meditation and psychedelics to shift consciousness from survival mode to a state of being.
</li><li><b>Improving survival strategies with consciousness</b>: Gaining consciousness about one's survival strategies can lead to their refinement. This can result in less selfish and more ecological behaviours, ultimately improving society and reducing suffering.
</li><li><b>Understanding the role of survival strategies in personal transformation</b>: Survival strategies play a key role in personal growth. Although changing these strategies can be difficult due to the need for survival to maintain homeostasis, understanding that they are fantasies can aid in personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Appreciating the intelligence of life through understanding survival strategies</b>: Understanding survival strategies can help in appreciating the intelligence and complexity of life. Studying and understanding different cultures and environments can offer valuable insights in this regard. 
</li><li><b>Interconnectivity in survival strategies and society</b>: Survival strategies and society are deeply interconnected. Survival is not just about individual gains but also about social acceptance, comfort, and fitting into societal systems. Collective fantasies often shape survival strategies and become realities dictating social norms and constructs. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the sophistication of life through survival strategies</b>: Gura encourages viewers to study and understand survival strategies to appreciate the sophistication of life. He stresses on the importance of observation and self-work to gain a better understanding of one's survival strategies and contribute towards personal transformation and liberation.
</li><li><b>Emotional Investment and Survival</b>: Individuals are more upset when highly invested objects central to their survival like children or parents, are threatened than less central objects such as lost shoes. We often justify this emotional attachment with elaborate stories about love and goodwill without acknowledging the underlying survival strategy. 
</li><li><b>Failure of Survival Strategies</b>: Survival strategies often fail and are not necessarily intelligent. Some strategies like robbing a bank are detrimental and risky, yet still a survival strategy, entailing survival of a certain state of mind.
</li><li><b>Identity and Survival</b>: Survival is linked to personal identities that are hard to remove, as they have been instilled through habit and societal conditioning. Examples are smoking and being a criminal. Despite being self-damaging, these habits serve their survival as it provides comfort and maintains their state of mind and identity. 
</li><li><b>Depression as a Survival Strategy</b>: Depression can act as a survival strategy, signaling the need to change harmful situations or lifestyles. Many ignore these signals due to fear or laziness, exacerbating the depression. In extreme cases, people adopt a victim identity out of the depression, using it for attention and survival.
</li><li><b>Understanding Survival Strategies</b>: Survival strategies are unique and differ for each individual based on their environment, needs, societal conditions and personal perspectives. What works for one individual may not work for another. 
</li><li><b>Suicide as a Survival Strategy</b>: Extreme actions like suicide bombing, while seemingly counterproductive, can be seen as survival strategies by people with strong convictions and beliefs, including belief in afterlife rewards.
</li><li><b>Impacts of Environment on Survival Strategies</b>: Survival strategies need to perfectly align with the surrounding environment. For instance, what works for someone in a Western urban environment might face failure in a rural community or in the Middle East.
</li><li><b>Problems with Imposing Survival Strategies</b>: Efforts to impose personal or cultural survival strategies on others can lead to destructive outcomes, such as culture wars or social conflict.
</li><li><b>Need for Respect of Unique Survival Strategies</b>: Respecting the unique survival strategies of others, recognizing their unique needs, and understanding their level of development can help to prevent conflicts and misunderstandings due to differences in survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Survival Strategies and Social Institutions</b>: Survival has co-opted all social institutions. Politics emerge in all social institutions and form part of human survival strategy in social environments. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Adapting Survival Strategies</b>: Survival strategies must adapt to the resources available in the surrounding environment for successful survival, as illustrated by distinct cuisines globally.
</li><li><b>Unconscious Survival Strategies</b>: Many survival strategies are picked up unconsciously from culture, environment, schooling, or parental influence, which can often lead to self-destructive behaviours. Awareness of these strategies can help in reforming them.
</li><li><b>Significance of Identity and Worldview in Survival</b>: Leo Gura elaborates on how our identities and worldviews, shaped by ideas and beliefs, play a central role in our survival. This is so important to us that we often defend them fiercely, even more than our material possessions, and at times, more than our own family members. Our identity and worldview acts like our operating system, influencing how we interpret everything in our lives. Gura notes that some people would rather disown their children than alter a part of their worldview, demonstrating the severity of this aspect of survival.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Change in Identity and Worldview</b>: People become hostile when their worldviews or identities are challenged or threatened, as this upsets their system of survival. If people acknowledged that they manufactured their own identities, which are not actually real, they may question the need to protect or survive it. This, Gura notes, is very threatening and problematic for people, leading to defensive behaviors and denial.
</li><li><b>Defensive Strategies to Support Identity</b>: When people's deeply ingrained identities or beliefs are challenged, they become hostile or defensive, employing various survival strategies to maintain their identity. Such defensive reactions could include threats, insults, or even acts of aggression to prevent change or dissolution of the worldview they have become attached to for survival.
</li><li><b>Understanding Survival Beyond Material Objects</b>: Material objects, people, and relationships are often associated with survival, but Gura emphasizes that the importance of our identities and worldviews to our survival is often underestimated. He explains that people could even battle to the death over a conflict of worldview, indicating the central role of beliefs and ideas in survival.
</li><li><b>Interplay of Survival, Truth, and Belief</b>: Gura notes that people become hostile when you tell them they are God, as it undermines their belief in a separate, divine entity, which they use to justify their survival strategies. Because these identities are often not based on factual truth, but on manufactured beliefs, they need defending; truth does not require defense. This defense mechanism plays a key role in peoples' survival. 
</li><li><b>Reaction to Threat to Physical Identity</b>: People tend to attach their survival instinct with their physical existence or identity. When this identity is threatened, for instance, by suggesting that aspects like gender are social constructs, rather than fixed entities, people get upset and threatened. They resort to survival strategies like denial, criticism, and violence, among others to protect these identities. 
</li><li><b>Humans as Social Constructs</b>: Gura suggests that key human identities like religion, law, government, or even science are all social constructs. Such constructs shape our worldviews and identities, and thereby our survival strategies. Recognizing these constructs might lead to an understanding that our physical identity itself is a social construct, which can be profoundly threatening to people's survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Sophistication and Obliviousness of Survival Strategies</b>: Leo Gura stresses that individuals and societies often remain unaware of their survival strategies, particularly if they are low-consciousness strategies. He gives an example of Wall Street workers who may resort to manipulation and exploitation to secure high earnings. However, becoming conscious of these strategies would render them untenable and compel these workers to find higher consciousness survival strategies. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Consciousness and Responsibility in Survival Strategies</b>: Gura asserts that people living in desperate conditions may resort to inhumane practices for survival, which high consciousness teachings may threaten. Becoming conscious of one's survival strategies encourages responsible and decent human behavior, reducing the likelihood of resorting to harmful actions like theft or exploitation.
</li><li><b>Societal Justification and the Morality of Survival Strategies</b>: Highlighting the self-serving nature of survival strategies, Gura explains that societies often justify their survival activities as being for the common good. This justification gives one the moral high ground to deny others their preferred survival strategies. He further emphasizes that such judgments of others' survival strategies are manifestations of one's own survival methods. 
</li><li><b>Survival as the Root of Evil</b>: Gura underscores that what is often labeled as 'evil' are simply survival strategies. These strategies vary and could range from conventional immoral activities like theft or murder to culturally sanctioned practices like female genital mutilation or slavery. He discourages judgement of people based on their survival strategies, alluding that judgement is also a survival method.
</li><li><b>Imperative of Non-judgment for Personal Growth</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of non-judgment and understanding when dealing with survival strategies, asserting that demonizing some strategies while pursuing others is inherently hypocritical. He also points out the dangerous potential of collective hallucination of morality that can mislead people into judging certain survival strategies as evil.
</li><li><b>Survival and Morality - A Gazelle-Lion Analogy</b>: Bringing the arguments to a conclusion, Gura demonstrates the importance of understanding survival strategies by drawing an analogy between gazelles and lions. Like the gazelle who doesn't demonize the lion but simply survives, human societies need to understand and respond rather than moralize survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Relentlessness of Survival and Understandings of Evil</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that all survival strategies are inherently driven by forms of love, though the degrees of this love can vary. Some are limited and divided, while others encompass a universal love for the self as the entire universe. Survival, therefore, is a brutal yet relentless process that neither is inherently good nor bad, but simply is. Humans are inherently selfish, but there are varying degrees of selfishness. This understanding helps explain why perceptions of evil differ; considered fundamentally from a survival perspective, evil is anything that hinders one's survival, which explains its relativity. To overcome evil by this standard requires transcendent realization that all actions, even evil ones, are grounded in manifestations of love.  
</li><li><b>Transcending Survival through Spirituality</b>: Gura highlights that spirituality and survival are often intertwined, with many individuals using spirituality as an enhancement to their survival strategy, rather than a means to transcend it. This results in the formation of a "spiritual ego" used to maintain a moral high ground. Truly effective spirituality will lead to the realization that the very game of survival is a fantasy that must be transcended. The ego, however, often co-opts spirituality to forge a unique self-actualization identity that aids survival, rather than transcending it.
</li><li><b>Victimhood as a Survival Strategy</b>: Victimhood is noted as a significant survival strategy, and it is often employed in conflicts on both a personal and societal level. The validation of one's victimhood attempts to secure the moral high ground and justify retaliatory action.
</li><li><b>Transcending Evil with Love</b>: Gura puts forth the counterintuitive notion of defeating evil through love. He explains that people often seek to fight and suppress perceived evil, which inadvertently amplifies its presence. Recognizing that evil actions are resultant of varying degrees of love is key to truly defeating evil, as it transcends the self-focused survival instinct and embraces a wider scope of love and understanding. 
</li><li><b>Confrontation of Selfishness and Dishonesty</b>: Leo Gura confronts the brutal reality that all humans are uniformly selfish, but with varying degrees, and dishonest about this selfishness to themselves and others. The acknowledgement of this reality is critical for personal growth and maturity. Alongside this, he asserts that these survival traits are neither intrinsically bad nor good; they simply aid in survival. 
</li><li><b>Persistence of Evil</b>: Lastly, he remarks on the enduring nature of evil and its counterintuitive relationship with survival. People fail to suppress evil because their survival-driven attempts often instantiate more manifestations of evil.
</li><li><b>The struggle with awakening and evil</b>: The reason why people seem continually bound by negative actions and struggle to awaken is due to the relentless grip of survival instincts, which often lead to unconscious and ignorant actions, causing harm not only to others but also to oneself in the long run.
</li><li><b>Survival functions being subconscious</b>: Survival is so important that certain functions are assigned to one's subconscious mind, like a heartbeat, to maintain life. Emotions such as fear, anger, or depression are the body's survival strategies at play, and often individuals are not consciously aware of these triggers.
</li><li><b>Results of unconscious survival strategies</b>: Unconscious survival strategies lead to short-term selfish actions, neglecting the larger picture and leading to unsustainable and unequal outcomes, eventually backfiring with catastrophic consequences. An ecological, sustainable approach requires consciousness and understanding, guiding individuals away from short-term selfish actions and towards long-term responsible actions.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness is key</b>: Unchecked selfishness eventually leads to self-destruction because of the inherent interconnectedness of life. People cannot isolate themselves from their environment and expect sustainable prosperity. Isolation and disconnection lead only to despair and unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Rethinking survival strategies</b>: Awareness of these dynamics can lead to a shift in survival strategies away from selfishness towards an understanding that all is interconnected. This change is the beginning of true spiritual growth and eventually transcending survival. Selfishness seems like a good short-term strategy but eventually, its limitations become clear due to life's nonlinear, interconnected nature. 
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness and globalization</b>: As we live in an increasingly globalized world, it is counterproductive to have nationalistic policies that prioritize individual nations. Integration leads to immense advantages, and society evolves towards more collaboration and interconnectedness.
</li><li><b>Redefining survival strategies as society evolves</b>: As societies continuously evolve, survival strategies also need to evolve, emphasizing more on holistic and harmonious methods rather than unsustainable individualistic strategies.
</li><li><b>Understanding global identity</b>: Societal developments have broadened our identities making us more accepting of differences in religions, cultures, and lifestyles in contrast to times when intolerance was common due to perceived threats to one's identity.
</li><li><b>Balancing selflessness and selfishness</b>: Achieving a balance between selflessness and selfishness is essential; it is dependent on individual circumstances and cannot be governed by a general rule or formula.
</li><li><b>Different survival strategies</b>: Different levels of survival exist; extreme survival instincts result in pathological behavior, causing discord within communities and environments, which is destructive in the long run.
</li><li><b>Importance of healthier survival strategies</b>: Progressively developing and refining survival strategies to be more harmonious and healthy is key to the evolution of societies and governments, leading to increased consciousness, happiness, and peace.
</li><li><b>Inevitability of survival's failure</b>: Survival is eternally thwarted by the inevitability of death; the pursuit of survival strategies to achieve a more permanent reality is fundamentally incompatible with life's cyclical and impermanent nature which allows diversity and maximizes goodness.
</li><li><b>Changing relationship with survival</b>: Transcending survival is unattainable, however, it is possible to improve ones survival techniques significantly and change our relationship to survival to achieve a sense of freedom and relief.
</li><li><b>Non-survival elements</b>: Certain elements such as unconditional love, truth, beauty, and absolute being do not constitute survival.
</li><li><b>The state of being</b>: It is important to shift the state of consciousness from survival mode to a state of being, that entails viewing objects without one's own interpretations and projections.
</li><li><b>Shifting consciousness through meditation</b>: Practices such as meditation and psychedelic experience can aid the transition from survival mode to a state of pure being or samadhi. This distinction is crucial because it changes the raw, sensory experience's interpretation and context, which can liberate from survival mode.
</li><li><b>Impact of subconscious mind</b>: The subconscious mind plays a significant role in interpreting sensory experience, even when it appears that one is not engaged in survival, as in the example of observing a rock, indicating the deep-seated influence of survival instincts.
</li><li><b>Understanding Survival - Pure Being State</b>: Leo Gura explains that through practices such as meditation or psychedelics, one can achieve a state of "pure being", distinct from survival mode. In pure being, individuals experience the world without the filter of survival instincts. While this state of consciousness is temporary, it offers a unique perspective on life, allowing for a new appreciation of our universal interconnectedness. Its experience can inspire individuals to refine their survival strategies, embracing more universal and ecological approaches. 
</li><li><b>Survival is Self-fulfilling</b>: According to Gura, survival does not have inherent meaning, value, or purpose. It justifies its existence through a self-fulfilling prophecy, thus, it can be interpreted as an absurd farce. Liberation comes from appreciating one's true, formless, immortal identity and detaching from the temporal form of existence, which is bound to end. 
</li><li><b>Survival and Perception</b>: Survival instincts impact the individual's perception, reasoning, and attachment, shaping how one views reality. However, changing survival strategies is difficult since they have to be tested against reality and prove effective. 
</li><li><b>Collective Fantasies</b>: Humans can collectively agree upon certain realities  social constructs  which then become part of their survival strategies. An example of this is how societies agree on the value of money. These shared social constructs shape societal survival strategies. 
</li><li><b>Studying Different Survival Strategies</b>: Gura suggests studying and comparing the survival strategies of people from different groups and backgrounds to understand how survival is relative and contextual. Documenting these differences can provide insight into the nature of survival and its diverse manifestations.
</li><li><b>Understanding Survival Strategy Conflicts</b>: Leo asks viewers to become more aware of conflicts within families, companies, and governments, noting that these conflicts typically stem from differing survival strategies. Observation and non-judgment are critical steps in understanding others' survival tactics. 
</li><li><b>Studying Animal Survival Tactics</b>: Leveraging nature documentaries, Leo suggests examining the survival strategies of different animals to gain a broader understanding of survival methods and tactics. All living things have sophisticated survival strategies that are perfectly adapted to their specific environment. Notice the design and fine-tuning of survival strategies between predator and prey. 
</li><li><b>Influence of Environment on Survival Strategies</b>: Recognize that environments shape survival tactics. Analogy used - just as a fennec fox is optimized to survive in its specific desert habitat, humans are optimized to survive in their respective cultural environments. Differences in survival arise in various environments such as New York City versus rural Alabama, Wall Street versus prisons, or Africa versus Scandinavia. 
</li><li><b>Systemic Observation and Study of Survival</b>: Leo encourages viewers to examine survival tactics as they manifest in different systems. Survival is a multi-faceted concept that encompasses work, education, worldview, culture, ethics, and more. Understanding the big picture requires the assembly of numerous small insights. 
</li><li><b>Revisiting Survival Content</b>: To fully appreciate and study the information, Leo recommends rewatching the entire survival series multiple times. The objective is to help viewers see the large-scale picture of survival and life.  
</li><li><b>Shifting Survival Strategy Through Observation</b>: Leo advises viewers not to judge or theorize, but to do observation work. Realization and correction of potential inaccuracies become possible through diligent observation.
</li><li><b>Long-term Skull Expansion</b>: While observation work can be emotionally challenging and often met with resistance due to its potentially life-altering implications, it is key to obtaining an advanced, holistic understanding of humanity and reality.
</li><li><b>Infection by Passion</b>: Leo expresses his personal fascination for collecting deep concepts about life and viewing life from unique vantage points. His hope is to infect viewers with the same passion, leading to richer understanding and self-liberation.
