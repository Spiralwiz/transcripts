            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2_18oWkVq08' target='_blank'>Positive Attitude - The 3 Pillars To Cultivating Positivity</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Cultivating a positive attitude is a rigorous process</b>: Cultivating a positive attitude requires a great deal of inner work and time. Often, people assume that a positive attitude will automatically generate when they achieve their external goals, but such notion is resoundingly false. True positive thinking will not emerge from external comforts or things but through rigorous inner work. 
</li><li><b>Attitude should be independent of external factors</b>: Having a positive attitude does not mean having a fragile positivity that shatters when external comforts such as a stable job, a nice car or a comfortable house are taken away. Now, this does not mean that they do not contribute to one's sense of satisfaction; however, they do not cause genuine positivity. True positive attitude means being positive regardless of the circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Acceptance of the present moment</b>: One has to understand and accept that the present moment is inevitable. In order to cultivate a robust positive attitude, the current moment has to be accepted as it is, regardless of whether it is perceived good or bad. Resisting the present moment leads to unnecessary struggle and anxiety, which subsequently impedes one's ability to have a positive attitude. 
</li><li><b>Acknowledgement of the futility of worry</b>: Accepting that worry is useless is an integral part of cultivating a positive attitude. Many individuals tend to believe that their worries and fears are justified and serve a purpose; however, this notion only increases negativity and anxiety. The sooner one realizes and internalizes this principle, the closer they are to cultivating a robust positive attitude.
</li><li><b>Debunking the Utility of Worry</b>: Despite anecdotes where worry appears to motivate action, such as finishing a report due to fear of disappointing a boss or losing a job, Leo argues that worry is generally disempowering. It's posited that the stress worry presents often leads to procrastination, negative visualizations, and resistance to facing the problem, clogging the process of taking concrete action steps and producing quality outcomes. Leo himself acknowledges that completely eliminating worry is challenging, even with the logical understanding of its lack of utility, and therefore requires consistent effort and mental retraining.
</li><li><b>Interrelation of Worry and Positivity</b>: Leo reiterates that cultivating a positive attitude cannot coexist with worrying, particularly if worry is believed to hold intrinsic value. To truly maintain a positive attitude, one must fully believe that worrying serves no beneficial purpose. This is a belief that must permeate the subconscious and guide daily actions.
</li><li><b>Cheerfulness as a Method for Problem Resolution</b>: Leo proposes that maintaining cheerfulness, even amidst negative circumstances, is the most effective strategy for problem-solving. He points out a common discrepancy between believing in this idea and implementing it; when negative events occur, people tend to discard positivity as a luxury, allowing circumstances to dictate emotions. Such a mindset breeds a fragile positive attitude that lacks consistency.
</li><li><b>Strategy Detachment from Outcome</b>: In the context of developing a positive attitude, Leo discusses the importance of strategy and the common misconception that a strategy's worth is determined by the immediate outcome. Using a poker analogy, he demonstrates that sometimes, despite unfavorable odds, a player might win due to chance. The takeaway is that a proper strategy remains correct irrespective of the outcome, underscoring the importance of persistence and not being dissuaded by short-term downsides. Understanding this can reinforce a positive attitude by preventing external circumstances from dictating feelings.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of the present moment</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that cultivating a positive attitude includes fully accepting the present moment as it is, regardless of its perceived quality. This acceptance erases tension and unhappiness, encouraging us to become more open and accepting of our current circumstances.
</li><li><b>Cheerfulness as the best strategy</b>: Leo expounds on the idea that cheerfulness, even in the face of challenges or hardships, is the best strategy for navigating life. He encourages the listener to exercise self-control and discipline in actualizing this principle, noting that the justification for this seemingly counterintuitive strategy lies not in ignoring or denying the hardship but in recognizing that sadness or fear offers no direct benefits in dealing with these situations.
</li><li><b>Realism vs. Positive thinking</b>: Leo addresses the objection that positive thinking might be dangerous or unrealistic, suggesting that this derives from a misunderstanding of true positive thinking. True positivity does not involve setting inflexible expectations or being deeply attached to specific outcomes, but rather embraces a level of relaxation and detachment. He underscores that unexpected events and 'downs' are inevitable aspects of life and points out that realists and pessimists who become overly attached to expected outcomes are prone to disappointment.
</li><li><b>Building a true positive attitude</b>: In building a true positive attitude, Leo asserts the significance of accepting the present moment completely, acknowledging the uselessness and counterproductiveness of worry, and embracing cheerfulness as an ultimate life strategy. He acknowledges the challenge of this endeavor but emphasizes the long-term potential and immense rewards of achieving this state of mind, with the ultimate goal being self-actualization and internal growth. 
</li><li><b>Continuous investment in self-growth</b>: Leo underscores the importance of continuous self-growth and consistency in developing a positive attitude, reminding the listener that cultivation of a positive attitude is a gradual process that requires dedication and continuous effort.
