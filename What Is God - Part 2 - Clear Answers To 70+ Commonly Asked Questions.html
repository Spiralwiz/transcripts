[Music] what is God part-2 fa Q's and objections make
sure you go watch part 1 of this miniseries where
we cover the foundations of what God is otherwise you're
gonna be very lost here but after I released part
1 I gathered a lot of great questions and objections
from you guys which I'll be answering right now probably
over 50 of them maybe close to even 80 different
questions some really good ones here so let's dig right
in after we answer all these God should be very
clear for you all right the first question is Leo
are you saying that I'm part of God or that
I am God I'm saying that you are God but
also you are part of God so it depends on
what you define you as in that sentence so if
you're meaning you in the conventional sense of you as
you think of yourself this biological creature that was born
the ego-mind in other words that you is a part
of God but the deeper you the you that you
will discover after awakening through self inquiry through yoga through
meditation that you the the ultimate you the self with
a capital S that thing is God proper fully God
not just a part of God and sometimes I hear
this objection from people who do spiritual work or who
are religious and they say well yeah okay Leo I
buy the the fact that maybe I'm part of God
but now you're going too far by saying that I
actually am God I'm not actually God I'm just a
part of God that's what you mean right and again
until you know if you go deep enough with your
consciousness work if you become fully awake which you'll realize
is that you literally are the whole of God that's
a radical statement that many Orthodox exoteric religious teachings do
not tell you which is why it confuses people but
nevertheless it is the case you just need to go
very deep into your realization of God and usually when
you first start to realize God you might start to
realize that you're part of God but not yet realize
that you're the whole of God so that just requires
going deeper and doing more work next question Leo if
I'm God why don't I experience it or feel it
after all if God is real why can't we see
it this requires a little bit of explanation because it
is tricky see God is a trickster by his very
nature and why is that because trickery or illusion is
the substance of reality what you know of as reality
you know you've taken reality for granted your whole life
and you've just assumed that reality is just a given
well turns out reality is not a given reality is
only possible when you imagine that it's possible and you
believe in it in a sense so you have to
trick yourself in order to experience reality in the solid
concrete physical way that you do so in fact you
are experiencing God right now you've been experiencing God your
entire life the entire universe is God so you've been
looking at it the whole time the problem with God
though is that it's so total that precisely because its
totality is absolute there's nothing beyond it there's nothing outside
of it it encompasses absolutely everything it's because of this
that when you are born as a human being you
mistake God for this little physical reality that you're in
right now and this happens because of the sense of
ego or the sense of self that you have and
the sense of self is what helps you just survive
so you are in God all the time but you're
not realizing it precisely because it's not important to your
survival for you to be able to be conscious of
God to clean your dishes to wake up in the
morning to go to school to go to work to
have sex to earn money to raise a family to
buy a house and to maintain all of that it
turns out that you don't need to be conscious of
God in fact being conscious of God in a certain
sense hinders those things because a lot of those things
are predicated upon lies and illusion you know it's hard
to to devote your whole life to earning billions of
dollars if you're conscious enough to realize that money is
an illusion so you have to appreciate that the substance
out of which everything is made is actually completely irrelevant
to you in your everyday life which is why you
ignore it you sort of factor it out right because
God is the common denominator between all things that's precisely
why you can factor it out your mind filters it
out because you don't you don't notice anything but God
so then what's the point of even talking about God
if everything is God well of course you can become
conscious that it's all God and that's a very significant
thing to become conscious of that radically changes how you
see the whole world so it's not just a word
game so you're seeing it right now reality this is
it but you're not conscious of what it is next
question Leah why is god hiding from us why is
God so tricky after all if God is good good
with a capital G like you said before why would
God be so deceptive it seems like God should be
honest and straightforward rather than tricky well you have to
appreciate though that if God was totally honest and straightforward
and not tricky then you couldn't exist you couldn't be
born because for you to be born you have to
be born as a lie as a trick as a
deception you see God is hiding from us precisely because
God is a shapeshifter it's God's very nature to be
formless and then also to materialize all form so think
of God as an infinite chameleon God takes the shape
of a of a Pepsi bottle of an apple of
a tree of a car of a house of a
man of a woman of something beautiful of something ugly
of something good of something evil as you of course
as well God is taking all of these shapes because
God's most essential nature the nature of the Godhead is
pure formlessness pure potentiality from this potentiality all form precipitates
or emerges so before any form can precipitate a human
body or an atom or a car or a tree
or the planet or a galaxy or the Big Bang
or anything all that is formed before that can precipitate
it has to start as pure potential emptiness and so
that's the Godhead but then because God is a shapeshifter
and takes all of these different forms then it's difficult
to spot because you confuse the form for a physical
object precisely because God is so so good at shape-shifting
it's perfect at it so when God turns itself into
a a Pepsi bottle you really believe all that's just
a Pepsi bottle or when God transforms itself into a
physical planet you believe like oh that's a physical planet
no that's God playing a really good disguise and that's
why it's tricky now you might wonder well why does
it need to do that well like I said before
because there's actually no difference between illusion and reality this
is how God creates this is the very mechanism of
the creation of anything appearance is reality the illusion is
all you can have if you insist on having no
illusions that's okay you can do that you can go
into a deep meditative state where you can expunge all
illusions all sensory data and what you'll end up with
is just pure nothingness and you'll be conscious as that
nothingness the entire universe will be expunged and then you
come back into the world of form you can do
that and you can realize that both are actually the
same thing the world of form in the world of
formlessness when you're not meditative state they're not they're not
really different you can merge those two together to realize
that it's all actually one seamless whole and so what
we call our formed physical world is is a constant
never-ending process of things emerging forms emerging out of formlessness
like every word that I'm saying is form emerging out
of formlessness it's happening all the time right now that
is what reality is so God is not somehow bad
or evil for for being tricky it's just the nature
of creation that it must be tricky next question Leo
how come well how convenient is it for you to
claim that God is this invisible being because this lets
you be very unscientific because it seems like it's impossible
than to falsify your God so is your claim in
God falsifiable and if it isn't then isn't it just
fantasy look at some point like we said before you
have to get to rock bottom of what is true
and what reality is you have to accept it for
what it is and if you get to the rock
bottom of reality and you discover there's an invisible being
there you have to accept that as it is rather
than arguing oh well how convenient that it's an invisible
being it just is what it is you can't justify
it any further it's not a matter of convenience it's
actually highly inconvenient that this being is invisible because it's
very challenging to find this invisible being and yet of
course it is possible to find it it is you
just search deeper inside yourself and feel that invisible being
inside of you I mean after all what are you
can you point to yourself your body is not what
you really are you believe you're inside the body you
believe you're an observer inside the body but what does
that observer well it's some invisible being which of course
is God right so that invisible being was there the
whole time now is my claim in God falsifiable well
strictly speaking not but you have to understand why that
is it's not falsifiable because God is pure truth you
can't falsify that which is true you see a lot
of rationalist materialists and atheists they get hung up on
this notion of falsifiability someone taught them this silly notion
that everything must be falsifiable anything scientific and valid must
be falsifiable I mean that any theory that's not falsifiable
is somehow bad is somehow superstitious and mystical there's some
import to that within science and it's good to be
empirical when you can but like we said before if
God is prior to empiricism and prior to science and
it's prior to the notion of falsifiability theories are falsifiable
god is not a theory God is pure truth you
have to be open to the possibility that there is
such a thing as pure truth and that you can
directly access it using your consciousness at least give it
a shot and see whether that's possible so rather than
God being falsifiable because you can't falsify the truth what
God is is a verifiable you can verify what I'm
saying so that's what makes my claiming God different than
just some blind faith or some superstition I'm actually challenging
you to verify the things that I'm saying you can't
falsify the things that I'm saying because they're true so
how can you falsify it you can only verify it
so there are actual experiential correlates to the things that
I'm saying which means that you've got to do the
practices and by doing the practices you could actually have
some of these mystical States and various experiences and then
ultimately you reach the absolute truth and that is self
validating and at that moment you discover that actually there
is nothing but absolute truth everything that's ever happened to
you has always been absolute truth you just weren't conscious
of it there actually is no such thing as falsehood
there is only truth God is absolute truth falsehood doesn't
exist only delusion exists which is really what you think
of as falsehood next question leo but isn't it the
burden of proof isn't the burden of proof on you
to prove that there is a God why are you
making me prove some of your silly claims you should
be doing it well we already addressed the issue of
proof and the challenges of it and that you can't
actually prove truth because truth is prior to proof we
talked about in apart what about that in part one
but um but see again a lot of people like
to call themselves skeptics so-called skeptics and they use skepticism
falsely and they go around demanding proof from other people
for various sorts of things expecting absolute truth to just
be delivered to you on a silver platter well that's
not going to fly as it turns out if you
really care about the truth you need to be willing
to actually go and validate it for yourself that's how
this works so if you're too lazy or you're too
skeptical to take on the burden of the responsibility of
discovering what is ultimately true about the universe where the
whole universe came from if you want to cut through
all the illusions of social conditioning and everything you've been
taught and indoctrinated with in school and by your parents
and by religion and by science and by academia and
by philosophy if you want to cut through all that
that's gonna be a personal journey that you go on
truth-seeking it's called this is the spiritual quest it's the
quest of seeking the truth this is the ultimate hero's
journey is finding the truth the Holy Grail is the
truth and it's gonna take a lot of work from
you and you need to take responsibility for that don't
expect other people to deliver it to you I'm doing
you a huge favor compiling all this information in such
an easy to digest and clear-cut fashion by no means
am i obligated to do that for you and by
no means am I gonna bend over backwards and waste
a bunch of my time to try to convince you
in your stubborn skepticism and cynicism that there is a
God ultimately no one can force you to see the
truth unless you're willing to go and find it yourself
that's how truth works even though truth is true and
in that sense it's unquestionable it's very easy for the
human mind to ignore or to deny or to resist
the truth simply by being closed-minded or cynical or skeptical
very easy and that's the whole trap of false skepticism
that I've talked about before see people falsely assume that
well if it's the truth then it should just overwhelm
me and I should be unable to deny it know
your mind is very good at denying stuff it's an
expert at it your entire life you've been denying truth
and so nothing in the world can prevent you from
denying truth you can take the most powerful psychedelics that
revealed the truth to you in minutes but if you're
really adamant on denying it you can deny it you'll
go through hell but you can deny it you can
read and watch all the best videos and books about
truth and if you're stubborn you can deny it and
that's exactly what people do and I've addressed that in
my mini series on self-deception you have to really appreciate
the power of self-deception the power of self-deception is total
and in the sense that is the power of God
so we talk about God being all-powerful well God is
so powerful that God it turns out is capable of
deceiving itself that it's not God now that takes real
power to be able to do that but also at
the same time God also has enough power to overcome
that deception but of course that's going to take some
work which is why awaking is possible so God has
power in both directions God has the power to fully
deceive itself and God has the power to awaken itself
through all that infinite deception and that's the game we're
playing your life so it's sort of tug-of-war this battle
between truth and delusion next question but Leo aren't you
just saying that God works in mysterious ways aren't you
just making the old God of the gaps argument and
you're just taking those areas of science where science hasn't
figured out all the answers yet casino science is honest
science admits that does know everything and so now is
because of that you're exploiting that that little loophole within
science and now you're stuffing God into those gaps this
is how the atheist thinks this is how the atheist
defends his position the reality is is that God does
work in mysterious ways reality is a mystery science is
in the business of demystifying reality and it succeeds to
some extent but like I said before in part one
it never fully succeeds nor will it ever fully succeed
because the bottom line is is that reality is infinite
there's infinite form infinite things for science to study so
science will never complete its mission of demystifying reality and
in fact the more it tries the more deluded it
becomes because actually by explaining one piece of reality in
terms of another piece of reality you're missing the total
mystery of it all so in a sense God is
the gap God is the nothingness in between all the
surfaces so you know if you take an apple and
you cut it in half what do you get you
get more surfaces you cut that in half more surfaces
more surfaces you cut the cells of the Apple in
half just more surfaces you cut those in half you
get atoms cut those in half you get other things
always surfaces no substance have you noticed this there's no
substance to anything within reality and just surfaces so what
is the substance that of reality it's nothing it's the
gap it's the emptiness between the surfaces that unifies all
the surfaces into a oneness that's what you're missing next
question leo you say that God is nothing but isn't
that the same as atheism you know as an atheist
I also believe that God is nothing there is no
God what is it that the atheist or the materialist
is missing is there any practical difference between what you're
saying and what I believe is an atheist there's enormous
practical difference and I will give you a list of
it right now of the most important components but when
I say God is nothing that is not what the
atheist means that is not what the atheist believes this
is a different kind of nothing than nothing that you
imagine it's a nothing that exists and you can become
conscious of it which is not what the atheist holds
so here is what the Atheist and the materialist is
not actually recognizing about reality which he will recognize once
he becomes conscious of God he's not recognising that objective
physical reality doesn't actually exist the atheist and the material
system to the illusion of objective physical reality and that's
that's a huge thing to deconstruct and to see through
try to understand how huge that is right there but
that's only one point another point is that the Atheist
is not recognizing that reality is relative and subjective there
is no such thing as objectivity the way the atheist
or materialist believes there is only your subjective experience that's
what reality boils down to and reality is relative there
is no way that reality is reality is however you
hold it that's very twisted and that that confuses a
lot of people another point that the atheist doesn't recognize
is that there are no human beings human beings don't
exist what you call human beings and the thing that
you think you are as a human being this is
the universe being sentient of itself this is God consciousness
that you've confused for human beings other people your parents
these are all figments of god's imagination and that's a
very shocking thing to discover to discover that your parents
never existed for example that's not a joke that's not
a word game that's a shocking insight I remember when
I had this insight about a year ago like it
it it startled me so much that for the rest
of the day I had to actually contact some but
somebody that I knew a friend of mine who was
enlightened I had to contact him and just double check
with him whether this is correct because I couldn't like
I couldn't just accept it he was unacceptable so at
the war on the one hand I I became conscious
of it but I couldn't yet accept it the ego
couldn't accept it but then of course what made the
situation even more worse was that of course this friends
that I was contacting was also just a figment of
my imagination so I felt completely alone there was nobody
I could ask I felt like I was going insane
like I was losing my mind quite scary that's the
very significant insight that you're not recognizing as an atheist
see as an atheist you think you're so skeptical well
you're not skeptical of the existence of your parents are
you see you've never really questioned that have you of
course not because it's a skeptic all you're doing you're
just buying into all the scientific materialistic believes that society
has taught you we didn't ever question them you're not
skeptical about them your skepticism is [ __ ] that's
what it is just a smokescreen another thing the Atheist
doesn't recognize is that reality is sentient intelligent alive and
a mechanical this is big because the Atheist believes in
a dumb brute force physical reality a mechanical reality where
things happen mechanically as though inside of a computer that
is not how reality is the sentience that you feel
inside of yourself your own personal intelligence your own aliveness
that you feel that is not yours as a human
being that is the universe the universe essentially the universe
is intelligent and alive and you are just a little
piece of that that's a big reframing of how you
see reality when you realize that that's huge and also
when you realize that reality is a mechanical it's not
a clockwork this is really hard for a scientifically minded
people to wrap their mind around because they their mind
around because they expect reality to be a mechanical system
with simple linear causes and effects but that's not how
it works reality is one spontaneous occurrence therefore you can't
explain it through any mechanical process because there is no
process it's instant it's direct nothing is really happening through
a process think of the entire universe is just being
one solid block of stuff that has existed for eternity
there is no process to it it's just there it's
being being is a mechanical and this is a radically
different way of looking at the world the Atheist is
also not recognizing the importance of love see the atheist
treats love as though it's a it's a petty human
emotion feelings over facts some new-agey sappy concept some religious
mumbo-jumbo some girly thing the atheist is not recognizing that
being is love everything that's happening here physically the physical
substance of existence is mad of love and that's really
difficult for that for the atheist to understand because the
atheist thinks of love is just an emotion within the
human brain somewhere not recognizing the centrality of love to
everything that's going on to the centrality of love to
evolution for example the atheist doesn't understand this it's completely
outside his of his paradigm the atheist also doesn't recognize
oneness the atheist thinks of the world as being fragmented
a bunch of physical objects all separate from each other
that just exists independently that come into an out of
existence the atheist doesn't understand the literal oneness of reality
and his own deep personal connection with the oneness as
a scientist you're not sitting outside the universe observing it
objectively you are intimately in the universe which is how
you can know the universe at all you're not really
interfacing with the universe through perceptions you are the universe
there is no veil between you and the universe the
way that science tells you that's a huge Epiphany another
thing the atheist doesn't recognize is that space time past
future matter energy cause-and-effect birth and death are all illusions
that's huge that's huge your whole life is made out
of those things now of course you might say Oh
Lee oh yeah I know that I know that time
is an illusion because I've read some Einstein and he
says time is relative and space-time and all this blah
blah blah yeah yeah you know that intellectually but you're
not actually conscious that there is no such thing as
time or space or past or future or matter or
energy or cause-and-effect or even your birth and your death
you believe in your birth you believe in your death
you believe in cause and effect you believe you can
explain reality through causes and effects you believe in matter
and energy and you believe in a physical 3-dimensional four-dimensional
universe whatever it is or twenty dimensional twelve dimensional strength
it doesn't matter see you're still believing in that and
to realize that all of those are concepts that's a
huge difference between the way it used to look at
the world and the way you see the world now
after you've awoken to God the Atheist doesn't recognize higher
states of consciousness the Atheist operates as though his state
of consciousness is the best one the highest one from
which everything can be understood you recognize right that all
of your skepticism and all your questions and all your
doubts is coming from your current state of consciousness especially
if we just change your current state of consciousness even
a little bit that all of your doubts and fears
and concerns will change you recognize that science is completely
contingent on your current state of consciousness if your state
of consciousness was even a little bit different your entire
science would change there would be a new physics the
materialists an atheist doesn't understand this the atheist doesn't recognize
that consciousness is not a byproduct of the brain this
is a huge trap for virtually all materialists and atheists
they don't recognize that the brain is something happening within
consciousness rather than the other way around I've talked about
that before at length in my episode why brains do
not exist go check that out if you're interested in
more details on that the Atheist doesn't recognize that science
is limited the Atheist assumes that scientific method can be
used like a hammer to hammer everything you know when
you've got a hammer everything looks like a nail that
old saying well that's how the atheists treat science assuming
that science will be able to understand everything including God
well turns out you can't do that science has certain
limits certain epistemic limits that you must take seriously and
if you want to understand God you got to go
beyond science and use other methods that are outside of
science and see many atheists aren't open to that because
to them they just assume that science is supposed to
be able to resolve everything well that turns out to
be a false assumption of course that assumption was never
scientific can you prove to me the science is capable
of resolving every question of course not that's a completely
unscientific claim that's a philosophical quasi religious claim it's a
dogma atheists also don't recognize the existence of paranormal phenomena
as a deep topic that I can't elaborate upon too
much here go check out my episode called making sense
of paranormal phenomena but basically there are paranormal phenomena at
the trans rational levels at higher stages of consciousness or
sorry at higher states of consciousness you can access various
kinds of paranormal phenomena which generally material science denies it's
in denial about it even though there's lots of good
studies that that show possibilities for telepathy and remote viewing
and clairvoyance and channeling and other sorts of interesting phenomena
like that the atheist doesn't recognize that he created himself
see the Atheist believes that he's just like a a
thing like a what I guess you're a little embryo
that was born from from another creature and that creature
was born from some other creature from some ape from
some something else not recognizing that actually you created yourself
as a god that's a huge mindfuck right there to
realize that the Atheist doesn't recognize that all dualities that
he uses to understand the world with and all knowledge
of all Sciences man-made conceptual and man-made not objective truth
that's it that has huge ramifications for how we do
science and how we do high quality knowledge the atheist
doesn't recognize that he is God who sums of course
the elephant in the room you are god you're missing
that as the atheist even if you agree with everything
I'm saying right now you're still missing the fact that
your God you're not conscious of it the atheist is
also not recognizing that reality has no limits outside of
the physical universe outside of the Big Bang there is
an infinite sea of possibilities where anything is possible you're
not bound by any physical laws you're not bound by
the speed of light you're not bound by gravity you're
not bound by any universal constants it's literally infinite out
there and in this infinity everything is possible any kind
of rules any kind of logic there are no limits
the universe doesn't have to obey some sort of logical
or scientific rules that you have discovered as a scientist
I mean those can be valid within the current state
of consciousness that we're in but when you change your
state of consciousness all those rules fly out the window
and the state of consciousness can be anything you want
there are infinite number of states of consciousness next question
Leo can God be a hallucination or a delusion and
the answer is no of course you can certainly be
deluded that you are conscious of God that's possible you
can trick yourself you can convince yourself that you did
experience God when actually you didn't that's possible but when
you actually become directly conscious of God that is unmistakable
because God is the absolute truth you become conscious of
the absolute truth through no intermediary not through language not
through symbols not through perceptions not even through experience per
se but directly imagine that there is an absolute truth
and that you have become the literal apse of the
truth so there is no doubt possible at that point
you can understand that doubt and the possibility of delusion
and the possibility of even hallucination is only possible when
you're not directly interfaced with the absolute truth when you
have a mind that can think and come up with
ideas of hallucinations or delusions none of that applies when
your action the present and fully conscious of the absolute
truth the reason this objection comes up that God could
be a hallucination is because of this next objection which
is Leo but couldn't God just be a brain state
after all I mean you take psychedelics leo and you
say five mio DMT can give you experiences of God
so doesn't that actually proved my point Leo because if
you can take a chemical a neurotransmitter which you know
DMT is supposedly that effects your brain and that gives
you an experience of God so doesn't that prove that
God is just some chemical no it doesn't prove that
not at all what you're not understanding is that all
of it is consciousness the brain is consciousness the chemical
v m EO DMT that you're taking is consciousness so
it's consciousness interacting with consciousness that's what it is and
what happens with you after you take five amino DMT
is so radical and flips your reality so inside out
that you forget you ever had a brain you forget
that chemicals existed you forget that the universe ever existed
and what you realize is you realize that the five
Meo DMT is not a brain state and it's not
a chemical and it's not a neurotransmitter what it is
is it's God actual God is what it is but
you can only understand just how profound what I just
said is if you go through the experience of it
see you can't sit here in your current state of
consciousness or you believe in brains and in chemicals and
you believe that consciousness is a phenomenon of the brain
see while you have all these concepts and ideas and
beliefs what I'm saying makes no sense and so from
your perspective yeah God can be a hallucination or a
brain state but when you actually become conscious of God
you realize that God has nothing to do with the
brain and it's not even a state it's not even
an experience it's not a hallucinations on a delusion it's
not a perception it's not anything you've ever known its
God it's absolute truth and of course that's so shocking
that it ends your whole reality your whole reality collapses
the moment you realize that in a way that's impossible
to happen as you're sitting here just listening to me
it has to actually happen to you next question Leo
how can you trust that psychedelics reveal anything true at
all well this can't really be explained to you unless
you actually go through the process of taking psychedelics in
sufficient enough doses that you have a breakthrough experience and
only then will you understand B it's shocking it seems
impossible and when it happens to you you'll be saying
this is impossible it's impossible and it'll be happening to
you anyways because you see you you got to stop
trusting what you your mind tells you is possible or
impossible like I said before everything is possible consciousness can
do anything there's nothing that consciousness cannot do because God
is omniscient consciousness I mean not admission about omnipotent all-powerful
consciousness is all-powerful it has no limits it can imagine
anything it can imagine you taking a psychedelic and arriving
at the absolute truth and that becomes the truth be
careful about judging and try to evaluate psychedelics that actually
having done them none of that is correct because you're
evaluating again going back to the matrix example you're inside
the matrix trying to evaluate things I'm telling you about
what's outside the matrix from within the matrix and that's
not going to fly it's sort of like you're asking
but leo you say you've been outside the matrix but
how do you know that you've actually been outside the
matrix and that it wasn't just more matrix and you
think you're being smart by saying this but actually you're
being stupid because what you don't realize is that to
exit the matrix is not to just exit the matrix
into some new space that's similar the one you left
to exit the matrix is to realize that there is
one matrix inside of another matrix inside of another matrix
inside another matrix forever to infinity that's what the matrix
is is an infinity of matrixes one inside the other
you see and it's to realize that this meta truth
that is the realization of God God is not just
some experience outside the matrix God is the realization that
there's nothing but matrix up and down forever matrix within
matrix so it's not that the psychedelic shows you some
vision of Jesus or some interesting visual phenomena or something
like that the psychedelic reveals to you that it's all
a hallucination it's always a hallucination psychedelics show you hallucinations
and what you're experiencing right now is a hallucination there's
no difference and there's no possibility but hallucinations that's what
psychedelics reveal to you it's a meta truth it's a
truth at a new or higher level than you've conceived
possible next question Leo could there be something beyond God
for example could God just be part of some computer
simulation why do you speak of God is the ultimate
shouldn't we all be open to the possibility that yeah
okay even if there is a God and you've experienced
it but there's probably something beyond that too right no
you don't get it you're treating God is again as
some phenomenon like you go and you see some alien
that's how you're treating God that's not what God is
what I'm telling you is God is a meta thing
God is the realization of absolute infinity or totality you
have to appreciate when we say the word God at
least what I do what we're really saying replace that
word God with everything the word everything is a very
special kind of word it's an elastic word it's a
concept that expands to include more and more stuff so
for example if I told you everything is there anything
more I could tell you no because I've told you
everything they say olya but what about that thing you
didn't tell me no but the notion of everything includes
even that thing that you think I didn't tell you
it includes that no believable or what about that other
thing that maybe you forgot know the word everything the
concept everything expands its elastic to include everything its total
the word total also works like that when you say
something is total that means you leave no piece left
out so when we're saying God we're saying everything and
we're saying totality when we're saying reality you might wonder
well Leo couldn't there be other realities no there couldn't
because the notion reality includes everything if there's two separate
realities what's connecting them the new reality is that there's
two of them so there's a meta reality that contains
the two smaller realities and you might say well what
if there's two better realities right there aren't there are
too many realities and there's a meta meta reality that
contains those two and so on to infinity forever until
we got everything you see so in this way you
can become absolutely clear you can become absolutely conscious that
there is nothing beyond God God is infinite which means
it goes beyond itself forever God is the process of
beyond ding beyond beyond beyond beyond beyond infinity to the
infinite power to the infinite power to the infinite power
to the infinite power forever for infinity forever it just
keeps going and going and going and going and going
that's what the realization of God is such that when
you understand that that's it you're done you've understood the
entirety of everything there's nothing more to understand literally nothing
more as possible if you're imagining that something more could
be possible you haven't understood what the notion of totality
is otherwise you would have included that thing that you
excluded can God be part of a computer simulation no
because a computer simulation is a very specific finite thing
see to say that it's a computer simulation and not
something else presupposes a distinction between two different things there's
the computer simulation on the one side or something else
like reality on their side but God is the thing
that encapsulated both of those so computer simulations occur within
God but God does not occur within his computer simulation
see God is not a computer simulation you've been watching
way too much science fiction and you've been too addicted
to technology you got to drop that [ __ ]
God is way more radical than a computer simulation God
is a mechanical mysterious in a way that a computer
simulation is not Leo next question how do you know
that this infinity you're talking about wasn't generated by something
else well again if you're still imagining something else outside
of this infinity that could have generated this infinity you're
actually not conscious of infinity to be actually conscious of
infinity you realize that there's nothing outside of infinity in
the same way that let's let's take an example of
numbers so what I'm talking about infinity in turn in
terms of God I'm not talking about numbers I'm talking
about actual infinity this very moment right here is actual
infinity but in the in the example of numbers you
know we can take the integers and when I tell
you all the numbers here we have all the numbers
and you tell me but couldn't there be some other
number outside of all the numbers know all the numbers
contain all the numbers the infinity of numbers is all
that there is he already includes any higher number you
can say well Balea what about the the billions trillions
trillions number you've missed that one no I didn't that's
included in infinity what about the negative numbers no that's
also included what about the decimal points yeah that's also
included if we want to take for example infinite the
infinity of reals not just integers see and you say
well what about the imaginary numbers well we can include
those two so take the largest infinity stop taking the
small infinities take the largest infinity as a Georg Cantor
set of the the absolute infinite set the infinity of
infinities take that one that's what God is so you
see it can't be generated by something else because there's
nothing else but it oneness when you realize the totality
of oneness you realize that there's nothing but it therefore
it has to create itself and it has to interact
only with itself there's nothing else that God can interact
with but itself which is why God has to be
disguising itself because if God didn't disguise itself and didn't
limit itself then God would be conscious of everything all
the time see it's sort of like you're trying to
play a chess game but there's only one player there's
only you so how do you play a chess game
when you need two players but there's only one player
well what you could do is you can if if
you're good enough you can sort of compartmentalize your mind
and you can like almost be running the chess simulation
on like two different parts of your brain like maybe
on the one one hemisphere you're running the black and
on the other hemisphere you're running the white and you're
trying to compartmentalize those two so that you can't look
inside the other one you know you can't peek in
because you don't want to look at the strategy you
don't want to know like what what the other player
is planning because that would eliminate the possibility of surprise
so this is go God generates the ability of surprise
they say he tricks himself with these false separations see
and this is why there can't be two gods or
more than two gods because absolute infinity or totality or
everything you can't have two everything's you can't have two
totalities if it's a true totality it has to be
one see it's very important to understand how that works
this next question I love Leo can God create a
rock that he himself cannot lift I love this question
so here's how it really works God creates a rock
and God creates a human certain rocks are small the
human cliff those certain rocks are too big human can't
lift those so they're in acid scenario God created Iraq
that he himself could not lift in fact you are
the living incarnation of this you are the proof of
it go outside find a giant rock that's too heavy
for you to lift and notice that you can't lift
it so you are God trying to lift that rock
but you can't do it see so God imposed this
limitation on itself now you might ask but Leo but
what about what about God it's all you know I
don't mean God in the human form I mean just
God in its pure form like the Godhead can the
Godhead create a rock that it cannot lift well this
makes no sense to ask that because the Godhead in
its formless State has no form so it can't lift
anything it can't do anything in his pure formless State
the Godhead is just infinite potential so if you want
lifting to happen because lifting only happens within the realm
of form you're talking about creating different forms that can
do the lifting which means you got to create a
rock you got to create a surface that the rock
is on you got to create another creature that lifts
it or you've got to create a lever that lifts
it and so in order to do stuff God has
to incarnate itself into some specific form God has to
limit itself because see when God is truly infinite in
a sort of Godhead state it's so infinite that it
can't be a human or an elephant or a bulldozer
or a crane or something because all of those are
specific limited things and God is infinite so it can't
have any of those limitations it has to be unlimited
but it can also limit itself into these various kinds
of forms and then these forms of course have real
limitations so a human can the bigger rock that an
ant can you know a human has a mind human
can invent a bulldozer or a giant crane which he'll
help him to lift and even bigger rock next question
if God is all-powerful can he destroy himself the answer
generally speaking is no not as the Godhead because as
the Godhead God is all-powerful but it has no form
and so destruction is a concept that only makes sense
with him within the realm of form you can destroy
a formed object like a rock a human a tree
a plan of the galaxy you can destroy those but
you can't destroy the vacuum would be space so to
speak you see but God can destroy himself in his
incarnated versions so God incarnates as you and of course
you can easily destroy yourself by jumping off a tall
building if God incarnate itself as a star the star
can get destroyed by getting sucked into some black hole
and that in fact is the fate of all forms
all forms get created and they all get destroyed no
form is permanent the only permanent thing is formless itself
the Godhead the Godhead is sort of like the head
of a fountain that's always spitting out form next question
leo how do you know that your experiences of God
aren't just confirmation bias of stuff that you've read it's
a good question and you do have to be careful
about that especially when doing psychedelics but mostly because hmm
when you have these absolute Samadhi experiences all of your
conceptual knowledge flies out the window and you're right there
in the truth of it and it's self validating also
because these truths they come as such huge mind [
__ ] and they hit you so just like out
of the blue that they blindside you and oftentimes even
though maybe you've read about it even when it hits
you you still don't believe it you see it's shocking
like I told you about that example of realizing that
there are no others but me that all human beings
are unreal you know that was a shocking shocking discovery
you can read about that in a book or you
can even hear it for me but when it actually
happens to you and you realize it you're not gonna
want to accept it it's gonna be the opposite of
confirmation bias this is scary stuff and a lot of
things that I've become conscious of when I become conscious
of it it's something I hadn't read about or even
if I had read about it it was not something
I took seriously or I believed and then now it
actually becomes president my consciousness and I'm like oh damn
Wow it's it's way more powerful than anything that I
read about it it's like that and also because I
I'm very careful to cross-reference my experiences with insights from
spiritual texts various traditions so they don't get caught in
one tradition various masters and teachers that I trust who
who are very truthful and have crazy degrees of consciousness
I you know I check against their insights to make
sure that I'm not tricking myself next question but Leah
aren't you just backwards rationalizing your personal religious beliefs aren't
you just like a closeted Christian or a closeted Buddhists
isn't that you just want God to be real which
is why you're coming up with all these rationalizations and
stories no not at all like I told you I
was an atheist for most of my life I had
no interest in discovering that God was real even when
I was doing enlightenment work mm-hm I still didn't have
any tensions of discovering God I viewed enlightenment as a
very sort of Buddhist notion of just like nothingness so
you know nothing this isn't God I thought I thought
so I'm not a closeted Christian I'm not neither my
closet Buddhist I don't subscribe to any religious teaching or
tradition of course I study them I study all the
traditions but that's mostly for for curiosity I had no
religious beliefs until I started having these profound awakening experiences
and what I'm talking about here is not belief next
question leo how can you be so sure that you're
right isn't it arrogant and egotistical of you to be
here speaking with such authority about these things with such
certainty shouldn't we be more humble with our truth claims
well that's the nature of absolute truth is that it's
absolutely true under all conditions so either you're conscious of
it or not if you're not conscious of it fully
then you can't understand how absolute truth can be possible
it doesn't make sense to you under your materialist paradigm
because under the material's paradigm what that paradigm tells you
is that you're a living creature which is interfacing with
physical objective reality through a veil of perceptions and therefore
you never have a possibility of accessing reality itself but
it turns out that that paradigm is wrong and untrue
itself so even though it might seem arrogant and egotistical
it's actually not I'm just being honest and it would
actually be less honest if I came up here and
tried to put on a front of fake humility when
you recognize what God is you're clear about it all
right there's no questions or no doubts it's a certainty
that's the whole value of realizing God it's not like
scientific knowledge it's not like speculation about the nature of
the Big Bang or something it's not like that it's
a totally different type of thing you need to experience
it to find out what I'm talking about and until
then it's going to be outside the realm of your
credulity leo is it possible to understand or is it
possible to misunderstand God to have a false experience of
God and if so how can you be sure that
you haven't misunderstood God and now here's where it gets
real interesting and tricky is that yes it is possible
to misunderstand God and yes it is possible to have
a false experience of God so then of course you
wonder how how can I be certain that I haven't
fallen into this trap and there's no way to explain
that other than that you have to awaken when you
awaken you'll know what awakening is but even so you
can still trick yourself and delude yourself this is precisely
why this whole spiritual domain is so fraught with traps
and trickery and self-deception it's not enough just to have
one mystical experience and to think that oh well now
I'm in you into self-deception no actually just by having
one little mystical experience now you actually open yourself up
to a whole new realm of of possible self-deception misunderstanding
which is exactly why I spend a lot of time
cross-referencing various sources hundreds of sources studying under various kinds
of masters and Yogi's and sages listening to their wisdom
double-checking not believing anything not taking anything on faith taking
a non dogmatic approach being conscious of various kinds of
self-deception mechanisms studying myself carefully contemplating this stuff journaling about
this stuff you know this is many years of work
go into this and even so I never claimed to
be infallible I'm always open to to having new revelations
to having certain things recontextualize maybe reinterpret fine-tune some stuff
you know I'm oh I'm always open to that because
you have to be because you have to take the
possibility of self-deception very seriously but the actual experience of
God is not a self-deception there's many degrees of it
the highest degrees of it are not a self-deception certain
lower degrees of it can be quite self deceptive next
question Leo aren't you just afraid of admitting that you
really don't know what's wrong with just saying we don't
know the way that science does see science is humble
and you're arrogant like I said false humility is no
virtue saying you don't know is great when it's actually
true but when you really do know something like if
you become conscious of what God is then saying you
don't know is actually a lie and just adds falsehood
to the truth that was there so generally speaking it's
very good to adopt the attitude of I don't know
and so I highly recommend that you adopt that attitude
yourself and there are many things that I don't know
I'm not saying I know everything I'm just saying I
know what God is and that you can know what
God is and it's actually a big agnostic mistake to
make the claim that we don't know because when you
make that claim definitively what you're actually saying is that
you know that we don't know and that we can't
know but actually you don't know that you see not
knowing is a tricky thing you don't know what you
don't know so you have to be open to the
possibility that you could know something very astounding precisely because
you don't know the mistake that most scientists make is
that they they limit their own realm of possibility so
much that when something astounding some astounding possibility is is
put forth they immediately become very skeptical and very conservative
and they say well we can't possibly know something like
that that can't possibly be validated forgetting that they don't
know whether it's possible to know that and that some
people could actually have broken through through this astounding insight
next question Leo if God is all loving how come
there is evil in the world why would God create
such a terrible world why does so much suffering exist
isn't there a contradiction between the classic definition of God
as being omnipotent and and good and all loving and
yet we have the existence of evil so how could
a good all-loving all-powerful God allow for so much evil
well the answer is that in fact there is no
such thing as evil evil doesn't exist evil is a
projection of your ego mind the only reason there's evil
from your point of view is because you're a limited
biological creature from your point of view and therefore you
need to survive and your whole life is about survival
and what you call evil are those things which threaten
your survival and as a limited formed being within this
larger universe you're very vulnerable to extermination to having your
form radically change when your form radically changes that's what
you call death and so your entire existence is predicated
upon you surviving and fighting to survive so therefore you've
internalized this notion of evil and you really believe that
it exists and you really believe suffering exists because suffering
is a mechanism a psychological mechanism within you which helps
you to avoid dangerous situations that's the function of suffering
so suffering is there because it keeps you alive if
you didn't suffer if creatures didn't feel pain then they
wouldn't live for very long and therefore you wouldn't be
here questioning what God is or what suffering is or
what evil is or why there's so much evil in
the world you wouldn't exist at all you would be
that infinite formless Godhead which can't do anything because it's
infinite and formless which isn't very interesting so we need
to God needs to incarnate itself into the world but
when it incarnate itself it makes itself limited and therefore
it obligates itself to now play the game of survival
which necessitates pain and suffering so from God's point of
view there's no such thing as evil nothing terrible is
happening in the world the world is perfectly fine and
beautiful and so there's no contradiction at all in fact
the world is perfect you can't see it because you're
looking at the world through the egos eyes so to
really dry this point home for you here's a great
analogy think about going to the movies you go to
the movies and as the audience member you're sitting there
in the movie with your popcorn and you're watching some
horror movie or some some action movie where people are
getting shot bad guys are getting shot and so forth
know from the point of view from from your point
of view sitting there in the movie theater you're having
fun you're entertained even when people are getting shot on
the screen but from the point of view of one
of the characters on the movie screen you can see
how that character might say what kind of sick evil
twisted / and would create such a movie where I
get shot and my girlfriend gets raped and there's this
war and there's this bad guy and there's torture and
slavery and all this stuff and there's blood and there's
monsters you know what kind of sick human being or
sick creator would create a horror movie why is why
why is there so much evil why is the Creator
so evil for creating this horror movie but of course
Saul illusion it's a fantasy the movies not real so
the movie would be terrible if it was real but
because it's an illusion it's not bad at all you
see it's all good so from the point of view
from the higher vantage point of the audience member who's
enjoying the movie there's no problem with a horror movie
and monsters and aliens and people killing each other it's
all just fun and entertainment the trick is not to
get sucked into the movie too much can you imagine
if you were at the movie theater and you were
watching this horror movie and like a monster was chasing
some little girl in the horror movie and then you
you actually started to believe that this monster's gonna eat
this little girl and then when the monster actually does
eat the girl in the movie you actually start crying
and you get upset and you get offended you know
how dare this monster this monster killed that little girl
and he made her suffer look at all the pain
and you know what kind of sick movie director would
sacrifice a little girl a little girl for this monster
to feed this monster how sick is this you know
and then you'd call the child services you'd get you
get out of the theatre you call child services and
complain and you'd you'd write down the movie directors name
you know when the credits roll you'd write it down
and then you'd call the police you'd call the FBI
and telling you know this this guy he'd killed a
little girl for this monster see it's delusion literally delusion
and this is exactly what's happening right now in your
life the problem is that you can't you can't believe
that this actually applies to your life because hey after
all it's your life and your life is the most
important thing there is and death is the worst thing
that there is and suffering feels so bad and pain
feels so bad and so you confuse all the suffering
in the pain and the idea of death you confuse
all this for reality and the reason you do that
is because you're so goddamn egotistical and selfish and the
reason you are that way is because you had to
be in order to be here at all to experience
the universe see so you're caught in a bind you
are God caught in a bind you put yourself in
this situation and now you got to live through it
until the end in the same way that you know
have you ever gone on a roller coaster like a
really epic roller coaster like the most wicked roller coaster
in the whole park and you get on it with
your friends and you know at first you're just guys
are just kind of like talking [ __ ] before
you get on it you're like oh yeah we're gonna
go to the let's get to the biggest roller coaster
yeah I want the most epic roller coaster all this
yeah we can handle it and then you get on
it and then the roller coasters inching up inching up
inching up to the very top to the very top
to the very top and then when you're when you're
at the very top and the roller coaster finally starts
to crest and to finally you know really get juicy
and your stomach starts to sink and at that moment
you still hope you tell yourself holy [ __ ]
what I get myself into what the [ __ ]
is this why did I ever agree to this see
that's exactly what's happening with God and with human beings
we're putting ourselves as God into these situations and we're
living through them and it seems very horrible but also
at the same time it's kind of exhilarating and fun
it's like the ultimate virtual reality a virtual reality where
your own life is on the line actually kind of
like them in the movie The Matrix you know I
remember when I was 24 years old for my birthday
present what I wanted was to John out of an
airplane to go skydiving and so I did and I
did a solo jump so usually when people go skydiving
they they jump tandem which means that they are strapped
to the belly of some expert skydiver and so in
that case it's very easy you just jump with the
skydiver you're basically attached to the sky to the master
skydivers front and he just you know pulls the chute
and he does everything for you just kind of enjoy
the ride well I wanted to jump solo because I
was trying to be macho and so I found a
place in Dallas that actually allowed solo jumps which is
quite rare there's only a few places in the u.s.
that allow solo jumps for newbies but they had to
you have to go through a long course like a
weekend long course where they taught you all the all
the necessary instruction for how to jump solo and so
I went through that whole course and I was excited
about I thought it was gonna be all great and
then I jump out of the airplane and I remember
so vividly my my first thought that came to me
after I jump at an airplane and you know jumping
out of the airplane actually wasn't the scary part pulling
the cord of the parachute that's the scary part but
before I even got to that when I jump out
of the plane my first thought was I'm never [
__ ] doing this again if I live and my
thought was why the [ __ ] did I put
myself through this because it was so what they don't
tell you is that it's so uncomfortable to jump out
of an airplane it's really cold you've got this like
torrent of air speeding into your face at 120 miles
an hour as you're falling down it's really really cold
it's like you're in a refrigerator and you're just getting
blasted in your face and in your no thanos and
in your mouth with this like torrent of cold air
imagine someone took a cold water firehose and just like
sprayed you with it for several minutes straight and it
was just like pummeling your face it's really uncomfortable so
I didn't enjoy that part and yeah I promised myself
I would never do it again and I haven't since
and yeah pulling that cord is the scariest part because
you'd be surprised at how many times the parachute fails
to open properly quite often you have a reserve chute
the reserve chute is much more reliable than your standard
chute but the standard chute a lot of times well
most times it'll open successfully very rarely does it not
open at all where you have to cut it away
but a lot of times the chute will open but
it won't open properly it'll get tangled up one of
the cells in the chute will get collapsed and you
have to deal with that nightmare while you're descending down
so um I remember when I was about to pull
that that cord I was and at that point I
didn't believe in God at that point I was an
atheist back then this was before I did any actualized
I'd work stuff and yeah when I was pulling that
core I was praying to [ __ ] God to
all the gods that I knew I was afraid of
that parachute would open successfully and sure enough it did
I didn't have any tangles but it did get caught
in my crotch a little bit and that was kind
of painful but anyways that's my skydiving experience so that's
you know that were addicted to to excitement as human
beings were addicted to excitement were addicted to violence or
to horror were addicted to sex worth of food wordings
it's a pain we're even if they fit to suffering
we enjoy it secretly you love your suffering you don't
want to give up your suffering to be happy if
you did you'd you'd be awake long time ago next
question Leo if God is all loving and good how
come God doesn't care if we are murderers rapists and
so forth well it's actually precisely because God is all
loving that it loves everything and so he doesn't judge
so see you as an ego because you care about
survival you judge murder and war and rape and criminality
as bad and wrong but the only reason you judge
it as such is because you have something to lose
from it because you've created a an identity that you
need to defend and you've also created an identity of
being moral and good and upright and so you view
yourself as the defender of innocent people against murder and
war and rape right of course and see so actually
the reason that you don't understand why God doesn't condemn
us for these things is because actually you hate murder
war rape and criminality see you're filled with hatred you
hate these things but God is all loving God loves
all these things which is why they exist if something
exists God loves it and since everything that there is
exists God loves everything and this is the infinite love
of God but this love is way too radical for
you you're not able to embody this love because you
have way too much to lose because you have your
life riding online you have your children to defend you
have your money to defend you have your company to
defend you have your religion to defend and so you're
not able to be all loving for you to actually
embody true unconditional love you'd have to be dead which
means you'd have to be God you'd have to be
the Godhead not God incarnated as a little human being
or at the very least you'd have to be conscious
that you're a God and that's exactly what you become
conscious of when you become fully awoke leo next question
Leo if God is infinitely good and loving as you
say why isn't it also infinitely evil and hateful why
are you cherry-picking here it's a good question it's a
good question because like I said evil doesn't really exist
evil only exists from the ego Minds point of view
so God literally cannot see evil and there's nothing for
God to hate if God wants to be evil or
if God wants to hate what God needs to do
is to incarnate itself in some limited form so for
example in a certain sense God is evil and hateful
but it's doing it through humanity see God loves evil
and hate so much that it doesn't mind living through
it as a human being which is why you're here
tah-dah you see God wants to know what it's like
to experience getting murdered getting raped going to war getting
your arm blown off being a slave being in a
concentration camp and every other evil that you can imagine
God wants to know it all but you probably don't
as a little human being thing so in a certain
sense God is both infinitely good and loving and also
hateful and evil but but in another sense that the
evil and the hate is only visible so to speak
from a limited human point of view and this is
really difficult for people to accept hmm Spile dynamic stage
blue people just don't want to accept many even stage
orange people just don't want to accept this even stage
green people don't want to accept this they want they
want God to be all loving and they want God
to not have anything to do with murder and rape
but you know murder and rape are creations they exist
if they exist where they come from what do you
think you think that the God created everything except murder
and rape that though somehow he wasn't responsible for those
he was responsible for the entire universe he created the
entire earth but the creatures who are killing and raping
each other on this earth well he's got nothing to
do with that of course he does God created everything
including all the stuff that you think is evil the
trick is is that it's only evil from your point
of view so in the ultimate sense God is just
good and loving next question is there a devil and
if so did God create the devil you have to
understand what devil means devil just refers to the mechanism
of survival devil refers to the ego devil refers to
separation illusion and falsehood not some man with a pointy
tail and horns if you want to know more about
what the devil really means check out my episode what
is the devil so in a certain sense there is
the devil you are the devil the ego is the
devil the thing that's going to die is the devil
and of course God created that not only did God
create the devil not only did God create the ego
God is the devil because remember we're talking about oneness
totality because of the oneness there cannot be anything separate
from God you can't separate evil from God the ego
from God or the devil from God and now at
this point is where the stage blew people just lose
it how dare you Leo compared God with the devil
when clearly they're opposites but they can't be opposites because
if the devil exists then it's a part of the
creation and if it's a part of creation who created
everything God so God created the devil in fact really
what the devil is is just a disguise of God
see when the when the when God incarnates itself into
various forms into various disguises because it's a shapeshifter it
will incarnate itself into devilish forms which create evil which
are selfish and and through that God gets to experience
what it's like to be a devil and that pleases
God very much but it probably doesn't please you or
your ego next question why is mainstream religion so confusing
diluted and inaccurate why can't they explain God in a
straightforward manner the way that you're explaining it here Leo
why all the silly metaphors why do they say that
God is separate from me why are we told to
worship God why are we told that God will punish
us for being bad and so forth religion is a
very tricky thing and you have to appreciate its origin
where it came from it's very problematic to evaluate religions
like Christianity or Islam from a modern perspective you have
to really look at it from the perspective of 2,000
years ago when these religions were mostly created mankind was
that a very unsophisticated level of cognitive development back then
there wasn't even such a thing as the notion of
science the way we know of it today science as
we know of it today is really a modern invention
several hundred years old so this notion of very carefully
analytically empirically breaking stuff down I mean it exists in
certain Buddhist traditions and certain yogic traditions but generally speaking
this is a modern notion so to expect religions from
thousands of years ago to be very precise and scientific
and clinical and also to be very integrative and also
to share modern values and to not be homophobic or
to not be patriarchal or to not be moralizing this
is absurd the era in which these religions sprang forth
most people were at spiral Adamic stage purple or red
at that time we're talking about very unsophisticated levels of
development and so religion was a vehicle for promulgating the
idea of God but how do you do that with
people who are not scientifically minded people who are not
integral people who are highly racist in ethnocentric people who
are very closed-minded people who have no sense of the
world back then people didn't even most people didn't even
know that the world was round of course the educated
people knew but regular people for whom religion was was
meant they didn't know they didn't know how to read
they didn't know mathematics like they didn't know anything about
the world you have to understand this so how do
you get these very tribal people to recognize the higher
truth of God well you have to couch it in
some kind of language that they can understand so you're
gonna use metaphors you're gonna use stories there weren't even
printing presses back then there were no books you couldn't
even print a Bible back then so of course you're
gonna use various kinds of metaphors and analogies that make
sense for that time and this stuff was passed down
oftentimes as stories not even written down and of course
as you're doing this the people who are passing it
down and then writing it all down these people are
not the most enlightened people so even though maybe Jesus
was very enlightened you might imagine or Muhammad was or
the Buddha or somebody else these people they didn't write
any books didn't record any videos so Jesus's story was
recorded hundreds of years after the fact and the people
who recorded the story will who knows different people reported
different Gospels various conflicting accounts and these people who made
these recordings of course they might have tried to like
get the gist of Jesus down and his teachings but
they themselves I doubt were significantly enlightened and so they're
filtering it through their own mind through their own ethnocentric
and maybe spiral dynamics tej red or blue worldview and
they're putting it into metaphors and stories that ordinary folk
can understand so of course it's going to be confusing
and diluted and filled with inaccuracies of course and then
of course the way it works is because these stories
get passed down through the ages it's like a game
of telephone where every person talks about God to another
person to another person so the knowledge gets further and
further removed from the direct awakening experience and how many
of these people actually were able to follow the instructions
and the teachings of Jesus and actually have for example
some massive enlightenment very few I would bet and then
how do you talk about it in a way that
isn't dogmatic that isn't overly ethnocentric that isn't overly moralistic
because you see whatever spiral dynamics stage your cognitive level
of development is that when you have these epiphanies and
realizations you're gonna filter your experiences of God and understanding
of God through that lens because you have to bring
the truth back down to earth and embody it here
within this particular country within a particular era within a
particular community within a particular culture and so because of
that for example a lot of old religious teachings are
very moralistic and they talk about right and wrong and
lawful and unlawful and and that they make various kinds
of rules against what you should and what you shouldn't
do because back then that was advanced for their time
back then back then before there were even countries before
there were legal codes this was actually an innovation to
couch morality and law and to ground it with religion
but you see of course also what happened is that
all of these religions and spiritual teachings they become corrupt
the ego and the devil corrupts all these teachings he
uses it for its devilish purposes so of course various
kinds of countries and nation-states rulers and kings got ahold
of these religions started using them to control the masses
starting using them to justify their own rule and to
justify the various kinds of wars and legal codes various
kinds of things that they wanted for their government so
you see the ego seizes a powerful tool like religion
if you have a really high quality spiritual teaching the
ego will seize it co-opt it and actually it will
become the chief tool by which the devil will then
spread falsehood confusion delusion and egotism and so that's exactly
what happened which was why I have to be very
careful with religions and in general the whole problem with
God is that because it's such a it's such a
personal and subjective realization that you can't codify it and
you can't spread it through mass means you can't write
a book that's gonna spread it you can't create a
video about it you can try but people will misunderstand
and then even even if you do a really good
job writing a great book or creating a great video
well some of your followers they will just be fanatics
and they will just believe the stuff they won't actually
do the practices because the practice are too hard for
them and they will just believe in it and then
after you're dead they're gonna create a cult and they're
gonna perpetuate this ideology and that's what generally happens with
these spiritual teachings that's we got to be very careful
and so you have to learn how to read these
teachings properly sort the wheat from the chaff and you
have to be careful to account for the various spiral
stages that are present for example in the Bible so
when they when they tell you to stone homosexuals in
the Bible or something like this you know you have
to be able to say okay with it that that's
old old style thinking from 2,000 years ago we don't
do that today all right you don't wanna take that
part seriously but then other parts of the Bible are
still legitimate and has legitimate wisdom in their next question
why do all the religions disagree so much fundamentally it's
actually amazing how much the religions all agree with each
other considering that they were started in different continents at
different times by different people under different situations there's a
shocking amount of agreement between Buddhism Hinduism Christianity Islam Judaism
and others that is if you know how to look
and study the texts properly and then you might wonder
well you how do you know you're studying text properly
well you need direct experience direct mystical experience by having
these mystical experiences by having a personal understanding of God
it becomes extremely easy to sort the wheat from the
chaff in these various religious texts and it's also then
extremely easy to see the commonalities a lot of the
disagreements can be explained simply because like I said different
cultures different times call for different types of explanations religions
will stress one thing over another thing because their culture
needed that religions will also use different language they will
carve up God into different parts because the human mind
categorizes things in different ways and there's various kinds of
categorization schemes not one ultimate one and because there's so
few people that actually have the full awakening experience of
God that usually oftentimes they have more minor awakenings various
other kinds of visions and mystical insights and experiences but
not like the full monty and so because of that
most people never reach full non-duality and so then they
end up having partial understanding not a full integral understanding
and also of course these religions they are not integral
they don't seek to understand each other they always seek
to kind of monopolize the truth for themselves they tend
to favor themselves in their own culture while denying other
religions other cultures so the attitude of trying to integrate
religions this is a rather modern notion which was it
really only existed like from the last 50 or 100
years at most and it's something that I love to
do I love taking that kind of integral holistic approach
when studying spirituality but um a lot of people don't
do that and so of course when you don't do
that then a lot of surface disagreements will seem as
though they run all the way down to the bone
but they don't they're just surface level stuff different language
different rays of phrasing things so you got to learn
how to understand these religious texts in fact one of
the things that made me so convinced of the possibility
of Awakening before I even awoke was I started studying
really studying various religious traditions and spiritual traditions and seeing
just how much commonality there is between the things they
talked about and to me that actually became very convincing
corroborating evidence that this was really worthwhile to pursue because
if all these people across all this time are talking
about it in such similar ways then surely there must
be something there and it can't all just be a
fantasy and superstition and that turns out to be exactly
correct there was a reason why billions of people on
the planet throughout all of human history across all continents
and eras have believed in God it ain't just a
superstition of course very few of these people have actually
experienced God but their belief in it and the fact
that this belief spreads so easily says something more than
just mass psychosis or mass hallucination or just groupthink there's
actually something there and that's something that a lot of
atheists don't appreciate as an atheist I challenge you to
come up with some crazy fantastical idea and try to
get to spread to billions of people across the entire
planet before the age of the internet before books before
television before radio that was not easy to do so
it's not as easy as you think to just mind
viruses and delusion always delusion has to be grounded in
some kernel of truth so usually the delusion isn't just
mad a whole cloth there's a kernel of truth underneath
it which is what atheist misunderstand about religion next question
but Leo isn't religion responsible for most of the war
and evil throughout history that's true religion is responsible for
a lot of so-called evil what we as humans perceive
as evil and religion has definitely been used by kings
and emperors and nations and governments to justify all sorts
of wars and atrocities and all that but then again
you know technology is also used for a bunch of
evil capitalism is used for evil many wars have been
started purely for capitalistic purposes mmm a lot of people
were killed simply with various kinds of technological advances from
nuclear weapons - there's kinds of chemical warfare gas and
bows and arrows and so I mean you have to
you have to separate out the fact that people are
selfish and they're egotistical and they're very tribal and they're
very warlike whether they have their hands on religion or
not so just because that is true doesn't mean that
God isn't something that you can discover for yourself next
question Leah why use the word god it's such a
loaded word it's so misunderstood by people why not use
the word like reality or even invent a new word
well it's true that the word God is very much
misunderstood by most people but at the same time it
is the most proper word when you have this experience
the first words coming to your mind will be oh
my [ __ ] god that's actual God I'm in
the presence of actual God that's what you're gonna say
so that's why I use that word of course we
could always use different words in a certain sense it's
a stylistic choice you could call it nothingness you could
call it Buddha mine you could call it being you
could call it infinity you could call it some new
word that you invent but really it's just God there's
a lot of confusion around it but understand that no
matter which word you use there's gonna be a lot
of confusion around it because that's how the devilish ego
mind works is that it always seeks to co-opt the
truth and turn it into falsehood so whatever knew you
were you would invent people would come along and they
would find ways to delude themselves about it you almost
can't help it the ignorant mind can't help but being
ignorant and if you call it something very neutral like
reality the problem with that is that well people also
think they know what reality is so people have a
lot of conceptions about reality which are completely wrong so
if I was just gonna call it reality then it
would be very difficult for an ordinary person to distinguish
what I'm talking about from their ordinary experience because everyone
thinks they know what reality is at least when I
say God and it's like well God is something kind
of controversial is something different most people don't believe that
they've experienced God and so that's why I use that
word next question why do different religions or different religious
people have different experiences or visions of gods for example
a Christian might see Christ whereas a Hindu might see
Vishnu or a Muslim might see Allah or so or
Mohammed or something like this so people talk about various
kinds of mystical visions and how do these mystical visions
relate to God cuz Leo you say God is formless
but then how come someone can see a vision of
Christ is that a hallucination or what what is that
because reality is one giant mind this mind uses various
kinds of symbols to understand understanding is done symbolically even
scientific understanding which you might think is literal is not
actually literal it's still symbolic it's still metaphoric so your
mind needs to make sense of the formless in some
kind of formed ways in order to talk about it
to think about it to believe in it to pray
to it and so forth so when a christian who
grew up his whole life with symbols of Christ pictures
of Christ and Bible stories and so forth when he's
having the experience of God it might appear as though
like the vision of Christ and vice-versa for uh for
a Hindu with one of his deities whatever date he
believed in and was growing up with and got attached
to you see the mind gets attached to various kinds
of symbols and likewise if you're highly scientific like if
you're a mathematician and you have a mystical experience you
might interpret that in a mathematical sort of language you
might see a formula that you think of it as
which was actually sort of what happened for example with
Georg Cantor who was the father of modern set theory
when he discovered the absolute infinite set all right he
called it God and he was a Christian he framed
it in Christian terms that's how it sort of works
so this is not this is not actually an argument
against God it's actually um it's actually exactly how you
sort of expect it to work is that your understanding
of God is going to be again filtered through your
culture and the stuff that you grew up learning so
if you're a scientist you can have a scientific understanding
of God if you're Christian it'll be a Christian understanding
a Hindu some kind of Hindu understanding and so forth
you know of course also understand that most people when
they have awakening experience they don't get a full pure
non-dual god consciousness of the formless Godhead very rarely does
that happen usually they get more minor mystical visions and
those usually can come in the form of various kinds
of avatars and light shining from the clouds or some
sort of stuff like this and these can still be
valid but they're just not that like full-on pure like
Buddha Mind full awakening that you would get if you
were you know sitting and meditating for thousands of hours
very rigorously hmm and that that's that's all fine it's
just like very few people become totally awake and that's
one of the values of 5ml DMT is that it's
a tool that allows you to be totally awake very
clearly without any kind of visual distortions or hallucinations or
visions it's just like pure full-on consciousness which is why
it's really good for cutting through all of the nonsense
and all of the various imagery and symbolism just going
straight for pure consciousness so that's why that happens another
question next question leo aren't you just stealing and rebranding
ideas from advise of a danta Zen yoga and Buddhism
various Eastern religions no actually I study all spiritual traditions
of course in the East they have some really good
high-quality teachings generally speaking the Eastern teachings are less corrupt
than the Western teachings they're more strict they tend to
be a little bit more scientific like for example with
Buddhism or with Zen or with advise Vedanta but that
doesn't mean that the Western teachings are are bad or
that there's not amazing stuff to be found in the
Western teachings so yeah I recommend that you study all
this stuff and as far as stealing and rebranding you've
to understand that that no religion and no culture has
a monopoly on the idea of God or spirituality now
the Hindus like to say that all we are the
first ones you know leo in India we've been doing
yoga and we've known about Brahman for five thousand years
blah blah blah blah blah we were the first certainly
India has an amazing rich tradition has some great traditions
like advised Vedanta but don't kid yourself to think that
you were somehow the first you weren't the first modern
Homo sapiens have been dated back to 450,000 years ago
and I would be willing to bet that mankind has
known about God and about various spiritual techniques and teachings
and insights for at least that long for four hundred
fifty thousand years long before there was in India and
it's been known all around the world in Africa in
Aboriginal Australia the Eskimos in and in North America knew
about it the Native Americans the South Americans knew about
it you know the Irish and the British knew about
it before even the Romans and the Greeks the Egyptians
knew about it I mean so don't don't get too
partial about your culture yeah you love your culture everybody
loves their culture so what let it go nobody has
a monopoly on the truth these these truths were there
from the very beginning of human history before history was
recorded so so yeah I mean of course yeah we're
all talking about the same stuff basically the Christians the
Buddhists the Jews our you know stealing is one of
them stealing from the other no it's just think you
can access these things independently and then of course there's
cross-pollination we also borrow ideas from each other we try
to find the best ideas from each tradition sure that's
that's totally natural that's how it should be next question
but Leo Buddhism and Hinduism are actually different Buddhism doesn't
have a God what are you talking about of course
Buddhism hasn't got the God of Buddhism is mu the
Ox no self Buddha mind the Dharmakaya Nirvana these are
various ways of talking about God within Buddhism the mistake
that some Buddhists make and some Hindus make is that
they think that there's a there's a substantial difference in
enlightenment between the Buddhists no self and the Hindu self
with a capital S as though these are two different
things to different enlightenment they're not two different enlightenment what
there are there are there are degrees of awakening at
the earliest stages of awakening usually what you become conscious
of is the truth of no self that's a powerful
insight but that's not the end of the road and
usually that's not enough to have consciousness of God to
have conscious of God you need to go beyond the
insight of they're not just being a self but to
realize what is the ultimate self what is the nature
of reality itself what is form you need to not
only be able to realize God is the formless but
also God is the form and then also to unify
the two together and to see that God is both
the form the formless in that there's actually no distinction
between the forum and the formless so Buddhism certainly has
a God it's just that in Buddhism it's not talked
about as God in the traditional sense and so this
can give you the impression that Buddhism doesn't believe in
a God well that's right Buddhism doesn't really believe in
a God per se but Buddhism has practices that get
you to a consciousness of your true nature which is
God same thing Nirvana the Dharmakaya the mu mu that
is talked about in the Zen riddles next question belay
oh god is not an experience what are you talking
about experience well don't get too pedantic on me here
I use the word experience rather loosely because we don't
have really any other word for for how to explain
once access to God really the proper word would be
something more akin to being or direct consciousness but oftentimes
I just use the word experience instead because most people
don't have a reference point for what being or direct
consciousness is but they understand what experience is so if
you expand your notion of experience to also include direct
consciousness or being then then what I'm saying makes sense
also understand that when you're when you're coming into contact
with the Godhead the pure formless God which is free
of any sensation there any quote-unquote experience there's kind of
like no experience there's just like nothingness the void you
can have that and that's good but you also need
to understand that you got to bring that back down
to earth and integrate it with the experience that you're
having here you need to become conscious that this experience
that's happening right now all the colors sounds feelings and
all this that this is actually identical to that pure
empty void which you might experience in some deep meditative
trance see so the fact is that this experience right
this very moment is God you just need to become
conscious that that's what it is that will recontextualize the
experience that you're having here to the point that you're
not even gonna think of it as an experience anymore
really what's happening here is not an experience we conventionally
call it an experience but what's happening here is just
absolute truth absolute truth is happening at all times there's
nothing but absolute truth we just confuse it in various
ways next question Leah what is the point of cross-referencing
sources like you say you do when God is a
direct experience so why do you need these other sources
well precisely because you can trick yourself precisely because there's
the danger of becoming a Zen devil see my episode
becoming a Zen devil which talks about the danger of
pursuing Zen practice without reading the scriptures without grounding yourself
in some theoretical foundation that turns out to be important
and because it is possible to have half-assed experiences it
is possible to have an experience but not to fully
understand it to misinterpret it or to have some ego
backlash and then to use it in a narcissistic manner
to to to do whatever for your survival agenda you
know because all that is possible it's important to have
high-quality sources to double-check yourself definitely don't just take your
mystical experiences at face value validate them against what the
best scriptures and teachings of ancient times and modern times
say so that you're in accordance with that find some
high-quality sources books teachers videos YouTube channels audio books whatever
find some great Yogi's some great masters and then cross-reference
your experiences with that double-check the things that I'm telling
you again other sources then you won't be so skeptical
and you won't be so stubbornly close-minded about it you
see the more sources you you cross-reference the more convinced
you're going to become that this is something that's worthwhile
for you to pursue and then it's not just New
Age mumbo jumbo and superstition next question why not just
kill yourself and become God right now if you say
that death is God then why didn't you kill yourself
leo well yeah it's true that when you die you
will become God but but also you're gonna lose this
life and there's a reason why God incarnated itself into
this life in the first place you're here to experience
this life you see so I mean you could cut
it short if you want but also I mean understand
that if you kill yourself you're not going anywhere but
exactly here there's nowhere to go you're gonna end up
right back here God is constantly reincarnating itself so it'll
just incarnate itself into some other form maybe you'll become
a a crow sitting on a building squawking away or
maybe you'll become an alligator or something else you know
so while you're in this incarnation make the most of
it I say that's sort of my theory do the
work to become enlightened and the reason you want to
become enlightened sooner rather than later is because you want
to experience the fullness of life you want to be
able to experience the magnificence of this life of this
particular incarnation that you have and how are you going
to do that if you're preoccupied with delusions and if
you're so self-involved in narcissistic and you're suffering and you're
in pain all the time and you hate the world
and you're depressed and you're anxious and you're miserable how
are you going to really fulfill your mission as god
of experiencing this incarnation you won't so if you become
enlightened now rather than later you know then you'll get
to experience a long rich life of living and walk
living is much better than living as a zombie addicted
and suffering and miserable and confused about life you don't
want to wait till your last breath to realize God
in a sense that's very sad because if you realize
God in the last five minutes of your life on
your deathbed well all you're gonna realize is how much
of your life you could have lived being conscious of
the miracle that is here rather than being so frustrated
and bitter all the time hating on other people doing
violence to other people fighting with other people manipulating other
people right so uh-huh the point is to live a
conscious life as soon as you can ideally unless you
want to suffer and you know what sometimes God just
wants to suffer and so maybe in this particular incarnation
the purpose of your birth was that you as God
are gonna live through the worst possible form of egotism
and just cause yourself all sorts of hell and suffering
and misery and not wake and hey ya know that's
the case for 99% of people but it doesn't have
to be that way for you you have some say
in the matter you can change that by doing spiritual
practices so I would say don't wait until the end
become enlightened now and and make the most of your
life it's kind of like a video game you turn
on the video game and now you get to play
and enjoy it so of course you could always turn
off the video game if you don't want to play
um but the only thing to do in the universe
is to play these games there's nothing but games to
play so you might as well kind of like try
to make them but the most of it and enjoy
it as much as you can next question Leo how
can I go exist in the presence of God if
God is all-knowing well it's precisely because God is all-powerful
that God is actually able to set up a situation
where it forgets itself and then has to awaken to
itself see because that pure formless Godhead it doesn't really
have the ability to awaken to itself because it already
is itself and it doesn't really have any kind of
mind or form that can kind of like realize what
it is it's too empty for that all it does
is it just sits there and it just bees but
you as a human you can awaken precisely because you
do have a mind and your mind is filled with
all sorts of concepts and delusions and false ideas about
the world and you don't know everything and so because
of this you can precisely awaken to to that formlessness
and then you can also kind of like bring it
back into your earthly life and then you can you
can then see how that formlessness is manifest in all
of the various forms that exists and you can sort
of see how God manifests itself as a lamp as
a dog as a tree as a car as a
galaxy as the night sky as murder as war as
rape and all these other things and you can marvel
at that but see the Godhead itself can't really do
that because it's it's just pure potential and pure pure
emptiness so in a sense the Godhead incarnate itself into
form so that I could see the full ramifications of
what it is and so really what God is up
to here is God is becoming conscious of itself what
does it mean to be God it doesn't just mean
to be a formless singularity it also simultaneously means all
of the form and structure that you've experienced in your
life it means that puppy that's being walked down the
street in the morning it means the hot cup of
coffee that you spill on yourself when you're rushing to
work it means getting a flat tire and then having
to deal with that in the rain it means getting
some money stolen from you by a business partner and
making you feel bad about your business it means war
and famine and political chaos and corruption it means all
of this but see forgot to really understand what it
is what it means to be God it has to
live through it it can't be a theoretical exercise God
has to actually incarnate and live through itself to know
itself and so that's what's going on here in your
life is just one little infinitesimal fragment of the entirety
of God that God must live through to understand what
it means to be God so what it means to
be God is what it means to live through your
life my life and every life that has ever lived
as a human being on this planet since the beginning
of humans but not just that also every ant every
dragonfly every butterfly every monkey every bird that has ever
lived on this entire planet and will ever live so
God needs to incarnate as all of that to experience
what earth really is you can only understand Earth by
living through it through the perspective and eyes so to
speak of all the different creatures that live on earth
but of course it's just earth I read just yesterday
that the latest estimate by scientists is that there are
like a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy
just the Milky Way galaxy and now the estimate for
how many galaxies are in this universe is one trillion
galaxies so just think about how many earths are out
there in all these trillion galaxies in this one universe
out of potentially many other universes you know comprising a
multiverse and how many creatures God is simultaneously living through
but of course not just this slice of time but
throughout all of time throughout infinite time so just you
know it's staggering it's staggering to consider that so God
has to go through all of that in order to
realize oh so that's what it means to be God
all right in the same way that you know when
you were born do you remember being amazed by your
own body and just like looking at your body when
you were born cuz you you didn't know yourself as
a body even you have to like actually look at
your hand and at first it was kind of amazed
like why do I have five fingers why not six
and you know what what can my fingers do like
when you were a baby you didn't even know what
your fingers were capable of you have to actually like
learn that your fingers can bend forwards but not backwards
or if you push your finger too much to to
one side it's gonna cause pain you have to learn
that by actually going through it you couldn't learn that
by being told about it you had to live through
it and you have to actually like feel your body
you have to actually like I remember when I was
little I would have to like open my mouth in
front of a mirror and like look inside and see
teeth because I didn't know what teeth looked like or
why were there even teeth in them and then like
new teeth start growing when you're in in elementary school
you know you get your second set of teeth and
then and then the baby teeth fall out and it's
all so weird and like you don't know what's happening
then like when you're not a lesson your body is
changing hormones and all this and then so you know
your facial hair is coming in and so it's like
you're feeling it you're looking at it like what is
this [ __ ] what is what is going on
here I don't even know myself well that's exactly what's
happening at large with God see God doesn't really know
itself until it lives through itself next question what is
the point of talking about God the point of talking
about God is to make you aware that this is
the possibility that you can realize for yourself and that
this is an amazing possibility it's not just like talking
about some little thing like oh yeah you could start
up a cookie baking business that's a possibility but for
most people you know cookie baking business isn't their thing
so talking about it isn't that relevant but when we're
talking about God this is relevant to absolutely everybody because
everybody is God it's the one common denominator and not
only that but it's so relevant because it completely transforms
your life and it makes you well if it frees
you of all the suffering and delusion and opens your
life for the possibility of true genuine joy and health
and well-being so the point talking about God is to
make you aware of that because most people aren't aware
that and to point you to techniques for achieving that
because it's not enough to be aware of the possibility
got to actualize the possibility and also to point out
all the trickeries and traps that exist along the way
that almost everybody inevitably falls into and there's hundreds of
different traps so there's actually quite a lot to talk
about even though while we're doing all this talking we're
never actually gonna get to God through our words and
through our talking the talking is still extremely valuable so
don't dismiss the talking don't dismiss the teachings sometimes a
teaching can seem repetitive you can seem like all this
stuff I already know well to really know it you
got to live it so sometimes you got to go
through the repetition in order to really get it to
motivate yourself to inspire you that's a lot of what
spiritual teachings are about to inspire you so it doesn't
matter if you've heard this stuff before the question is
are you living it and if not then maybe you
could stand hearing it another time until you really get
it till it hits you and you actually start to
do the practices and then you can let go of
the teachings and the talking once you're fully awake but
for most people we're talking about decades before they become
fully awake and many mistakes that they'll make and many
areas in which they'll get stuck before they become fully
awake and even if you are fully awake there's still
more to talk about because there's development as well there's
not just God to realize there's also emotional mastery and
there's other components and how do you how do you
apply your realization of God in the everyday world that's
sort of called a post Satori practice next question well
science ever be able to understand God depends on how
you define science the way science is defined today no
because science today is conceptual and symbolic and by definition
God is not a symbol God is being so you
can't get there with symbols you can't get there with
equations but of course science will evolve and mature in
the future and it will open itself up more and
more to mysticism into non symbolic methods of investigation first-person
experiences will be admitted as legitimate and not just anecdotal
psychedelics will become a legitimate scientific tool scientists will begin
using psychedelics to do better research on themselves not just
in clinical trials on any pigs and stuff and so
I anticipate that with it within the next couple hundred
years science will recognize God of course it'll be sort
of a different version of God it won't be the
Christian God it'll be sort of a scientific version of
God so maybe science will acknowledge something like absolute infinity
or nothingness that will be easier for most scientists to
swallow but it'll only do that by really transforming itself
so the old science will die and the new science
will basically incorporate mysticism into it because you know what
we already have a science of God we've had a
science of God for over 5,000 years you know it's
called is called mysticism mysticism is the direct empirical pursuit
of God and the study of God through meditation contemplation
yoga and other methods so we have a rich science
of God the problem is that it's separated from modern
academic materialist science and so these will need to be
bridged and it's already beginning the bridge is already being
built by five visionaries and pioneers so it's already started
to happen and so in the future more and more
scientists will have these mystical experiences for themselves and when
that starts to happen that's when science will really explode
because once you become a mystic and you also combine
that with science well then you can make some amazing
breakthroughs because your mind is so much more integrated and
you can have so much such powerful insights that you
couldn't have before but also understand that at that point
science will sort of become mysticism to a certain degree
so you see the line between science and religion and
science and mysticism that's not a hard line that exists
in the world that's a line that the human mind
is drawing that's a culturally drawn line and so culture
will have to change for that line to change will
change our definitions of mysticism and science in such a
way that they will be more closely merged together another
question is isn't it possible Leo that science will answer
all questions given enough time and that we really don't
need mysticism we just need to give science more time
the answer is no not unless you radically redefined with
Sciences if you redefine signs to include mysticism then yes
the answer is yes but modern science no it's gonna
have to shed its materialistic dogmas and it's gonna have
to recognize limits science has serious limits science only works
through language through concepts through the mind and yet there
are aspects of reality which are beyond the mind so
how is science going to deal with that at some
point science is gonna have to relent and acknowledge that
there are aspects of reality which are true but which
are not provable in the traditional materialistic sense and which
are beyond the mind and which needs to be accessed
through methods that are not equations or charts or graphs
or particle colliders or rulers or photographs but something else
next question is it possible that science and spirituality work
together in the future yes that's just what I was
describing in fact I see personally my greatest contribution I
think to mankind will be to help to integrate science
and spirituality that's basically what I'm doing here I'm laying
the epistemic foundation for the reform of science that's really
what I'm doing that's where most of my intellectual efforts
go it's not into creating videos that help you to
awake and per se although I enjoy doing that it's
mostly to reform the epistemology of science because I see
very important reforms that need to be made within the
foundations of Western science which will then advanced advance both
science and it'll advance spirituality as well so it's already
happening I'm working on that right now I'm working on
on books and things that I'm writing in order to
do this I'm working on videos in order to do
this but it won't just be me many people will
be doing this over the next 100 or 200 years
and it will be a very important and revolutionary development
within Western civilization and within the history of science it'll
be a it'll be a new scientific revolution when that
is complete but there will also be a lot of
resistance and it won't happen within our lifetimes next question
if God is all alone does God feel lonely does
God have imperfections like loneliness or is God completely satisfied
and sufficient in itself so here again we got a
distinguish between for Godhead the formless Godhead and God incarnated
as various things so the formless Godhead is completely devoid
of qualities so it's not lonely even though it is
all alone it's not lonely he doesn't feel anything and
loneliness is a sort of feeling but God in His
incarnated form as a human being or maybe as a
as an animal in that way God can feel lonely
and that's precisely why to keep you from feeling alone
you have created the notion of other people and other
beings which gives you company and when you realize that
all these they're beings are really just figments of your
imagination your own projections well at that moment you will
start to feel very alone but that's still your ego
reacting once you accept that you get past it you
will realize that actually being all alone is God is
a is great there's no one about it except yourself
but yeah you can always fall back into the delusion
that there are other people and that can I can
relieve you of your loneliness but generally speaking when you're
fully fully conscious and awake you're not going to feel
lonely even though you will be alone you're the only
thing there is and can never be next question why
are some people very curious about God while others are
not it's a good question I've been thinking about this
one for a while and I don't have a clear
answer so I'm gonna speculate a bit here this is
my best attempt so far I think that people are
born with different brain types different genetics and also there's
a strong environmental factor to how you're raised where you
go to school and so forth and so I think
that certain people have a brain type which is more
metaphysically oriented like myself and we have been curious about
metaphysical questions since we were kids throughout our whole life
and we just can't turn it off we're always asking
where's reality coming and why is it here what's it
doing here what is the point of life and and
so forth where did consciousness come from right we're very
naturally curious about very fundamental issues but most people aren't
most people are just interested in survival taking care of
their basic needs having a family business work sex entertainment
and so forth I mean I'm interested in those things
too so don't get me wrong I enjoy all those
things but um but fundamentally I'm very metaphysically curious and
you probably are too if you're following actualized I don't
work in a lot of depth but most people you
meet won't be that way and that's probably because of
combination that they don't have the right brain type but
also they probably weren't raised in such a manner where
they were exposed to these things you know if we
had a really good education system we would expose children
to the joys of epistemic and metaphysical inquiry and spirituality
very early on and then I think many more of
them would be curious about questions of God and spirituality
and so forth also I think that you have to
understand that some people are just born spiritually gifted whether
its genetic or I don't know what it is but
it just seems to be that way and and I
think and this is just a theory of mine but
it's interesting theory that ancient humans if we're talking about
four hundred thousand years ago or even ten thousand years
ago ancient humans were much more spiritually interested and curious
than modern humans but as modern civilization arose about ten
thousand years ago during ancient Egypt and then through modern
times we had an enormous amount of war genocide torture
and just slavery brutality of a very kind and so
because the competitive survival pressures became so large on all
human populations as the world got overpopulated what happened was
that I'm willing to bet that a lot of very
spiritual people were just killed off because that's how survival
works when you're not overly obsessed with your survival but
everyone else around you is that gives them a certain
competitive advantage so in a certain sense people today are
very focused on their survival and they're very egotistical and
materialistic and that is because they needed to be that
way in order to survive all of the wars and
brutality that happened during the last ten thousand years of
human civilization that was the cost of building modern civilization
but also that comes at a at a great well
at a great cost because because now we're starting to
see the limits of that you know we're starting to
overpopulate the whole planet and we might even kill ourselves
off as a species if we continue with our materialism
unabated so I can easily see how thousands of years
ago deeply spiritually attuned people people who were literally Genet
we predisposed to being very mystical and to have easy
access to God and various other kinds of mystical insights
and paranormal abilities that these people just killed off because
they were practical to civilization and because they were a
thorn in the side of most kings and dictators and
tyrants who wanted to rule the world and so I
think millions of people who were naturally spiritually gifted were
just killed off to the point where the most ruthless
and egotistical one survived and also remember the reason why
few people are so curious about God is because curiosity
killed the cat and curiosity is a dangerous thing you're
playing with your whole sense of reality and life here
when we're talking about curiosity it's not just curiosity as
I like oh yeah I'm just curious about watching some
YouTube video about God no it's like if you follow
this rabbit hole all the way to its conclusion it's
gonna kill you and you don't want that so so
of course most people aren't that curious most people's curiosity
is just skin deep next question by what mechanism does
God create things this is so challenging to explain to
a materialist because you're used to having mechanisms for everything
and science sighs this whole job is to break reality
down into chains of cause and effect and mechanisms that
you can manipulate to make technology and so we think
that there well then God must also do that the
universe must somehow like have mechanical rules or mathematical equations
or it must be a computer simulation shuffling nura electrons
back and forth via circus or something like that in
order to actually create the universe but they actually the
answer is much more simple than that the mechanism of
God is direct there is no mechanism what you see
is the mechanism so conventionally this present experience that we're
having together right now you would think that this experience
right here is caused by some neurons some neurotransmitters in
the mind or in the brain rather biological phenomena or
even molecules bouncing around quantum mechanic effects or whatever you
believe physical laws equations none of that is actually true
the entire universe is spontaneously a mechanically existing it's just
being it has no mechanism the mechanism only appears to
you cause and effect chains only appear to you when
you are looking through it using the human mind and
trying to make sense of little pieces of it then
you can mechanically break it apart and it seems as
though there's mechanisms and causes and effects actually there is
no mechanism there's no mathematical equations behind the scenes there's
absolutely nothing what you see is exactly the mechanism here
it is the problem is you're not conscious of it
the problem is if you became conscious of it you
would see and realize that it's literally one solid miracle
and that's precisely what you're resisting as a materialist that's
something you're gonna have to experience a rude awakening into
to realize you might wonder well Leo how is it
possible that a thing can appear spontaneously a mechanically as
if by magic but how is anything possible how is
anything possible you see as a scientist and materialist you
need to have some kind of ultimate elementary particle that
is grounding your entire sense of reality so quarks strings
atoms whatever it is so you might ask a scientist
how can there be quarks what is the mechanism of
their being quarks and the answer will be we can't
say we can only get to the bottom level and
as we get to the most bottom level we can't
say any more about it than that sometimes some scientists
will say well it's equations but then you can always
ask but well what's the mechanism for the generation of
the equations and by what mechanism do the generate but
do the equations actually run the universe to which the
answer will be we can't say so in a sense
what you're doing with science is you're pushing the explanation
down down down down down down down down to the
lowest level and then you're excusing it away and you're
saying well maybe we'll figure it out in the next
hundred years but you never figure it out because it's
infinite you'll you're gonna be pushing that explanation forever what
you need to realize is that the what you can
do is you can treat the entire universe as one
elemental molecule so instead of saying that quarks just are
elemental and fundamental and they just exist and they just
are or equations just are imagine if you just said
this present moment just is and there's no explanation for
it and you will never explain it not in a
million years because there is no explanation because the explanation
is itself the explanation is being you see it's it's
so direct you can't point to it is the problem
it's so direct you can't explain it it's so direct
you can't know it but you can become conscious of
the fact that it is just pure magical manifestation from
nothingness and that's an amazing thing to realize next question
where did God come from God has always existed God
is a turtle so imagine a thing that he has
existed for ever and will exist forever that's God God
also created itself name I wonder Leo if God is
a turtle then how come you say it created itself
isn't that a contradiction it's like either it was a
turtle or it was created but can't be both actually
it's both depending on how you understand God so that
formless Godhead he's a turtle but form you might say
is sort of created and so in this sense I
say God created itself I say that you created yourself
in the sense that you like created your own body
created your own mind created this particular moment but at
the same time this moment in this body this mind
has also existed eternally so in us it's a weird
it's a very weird paradoxical thing it makes no sense
to explain it I'm kind of the way I'm doing
now but you just like you can become conscious that
it's both eternal and that you created yourself both are
true you might also wonder why did God create itself
and the answer is that well first of all is
eternal so it's always been but also it created itself
like I said earlier because it wants to experience itself
creation and being are really the same thing so to
say that God created itself is just to say that
God is is being and so for God to be
it needs to be in all the ways that it
is in all the ways that it can be you
know that's saying be the best that you can be
make the most of yourself well that's what God is
doing God is following that motto God is making the
most of itself God is creating itself every second so
don't think of it as like God created itself sometime
a long time ago before the universe happened God created
itself no no no God is constantly creating itself every
word coming out of my mouth is a creation of
God which is happening every second it's happening as though
for the first time right now and right now and
right now and right now in every moment forever it's
a never-ending process of self creation and being next question
can God be an alien or an AI and the
answer is no it can't because an alien or an
AI is a specific limited thing so if you have
an AI you have something that's not an AI which
is possible if you have an alien you have something
that's not an alien which is possible but God is
the totality of everything it's the meta thing God includes
all the different ai's all the different aliens all the
different humans and everything else in between so it can't
you can definitively know that AI God is not AI
or an alien which is not to say you can't
have a eyes or aliens you could probably have both
I don't know I don't know if there's aliens out
there but if there are they certainly aren't the end-all
be-all they aren't the Godhead but also they are the
Godhead too because God is incarnated through the alien through
the eye or whatever else you're gonna find out there
next question could God have evolved to which the answer
is that God is eternal so in that sense no
but at the same time God is constantly evolving so
creation and evolution are one in the same process evolution
is happening right now every thought you're having every word
you're saying it's all evolution it's all happening evolutions not
limited to biological creatures or to sexuality evolution is the
movement of the entire universe as a whole and so
God is in a sense evolving next question how do
you reconcile God with scientific traditional Darwinian evolution because these
can seem like they're at odds they're actually not at
odds they're the same thing design and evolution are actually
the same thing when a human being sits down to
design a skyscraper or a clock it might seem like
what he's doing is not evolution actually it is that
is evolution to evolution definitely occurs in the sense that
animals change their forms and they adapt to their environments
and all of that and it happens through various genetics
and all that we have understand that there's a larger
context for scientific Darwinian evolution all of that is happening
within the larger context of the mind of God and
all that half is happening with intelligence and sentient and
by design so to speak it's not happening through randomness
or chaos and just fluke luck that some creature evolves
with with wings or with eyes or with feathers or
whatever next question Leo if I created myself as God
then why did I create this shitty life well that's
a good question you do have the option to change
your life at any time so feel free to exercise
that option feel free to exercise the option of spiritual
development to grow yourself and to awaken and then you
won't feel like your life is shitty anymore but really
I mean you have to understand that culture and society
it's all evolving the world it is still in the
dark ages basically and so God is trying to bootstrap
itself so civilization society it's all bootstrapping itself and evolving
forward so of course you think your life is bad
now imagine how your life might have been back in
the in the Roman days where 40% of the Roman
population were slaves so I mean life can get very
hellish and that's just part of the brutality of life
see the thing that's really difficult for people to understand
is that God is really truly in love with all
of creation to such a radical degree that it's difficult
for most human beings to fathom that such a love
is actually love try to imagine being in love with
with the most shitty situations that you as a human
can imagine and yet God is in love with those
it's living through all of those it doesn't judge anything
so you know God is going to live through every
possible scenario that a human being has ever lived through
in fact you as God will live through every possible
scenario that any human being will ever live through so
you will know what it's like to feel a depression
and death and cancer and disability and heartbreak and cheating
and lying and thieving and all this sort of stuff
so really that's why the Buddha said that life is
suffering and the only solution to that is to awaken
awakening is what allows you to deal with any kind
of shitty life so to speak that's what allows you
to deal with it gracefully and really of most people
in life they're only joyful and happy to the extent
that life is going their way they don't realize just
how fragile their happiness is so easy to lose your
happiness in life because it's so conditional which is why
you should strive to awaken but you know fear not
if you have a shitty life you can change it
too that's what all this content is here for all
these self-help techniques and books you can educate yourself and
you can improve your life enormous li and most of
all by awakening next question is it possible to become
conscious of God at all times in everyday life and
not just as some peak experience or some five amiyo
trip or only in some meditative state and the answer
is yes it is and this is something called sahaja
Samadhi sahaja Samadhi is kind of considered like the ultimate
state of Samadhi its neuro Kalpa Samadhi taken to a
permanent degree so you're constantly permanently awake it's like being
in a high meditative state all the time 24/7 whether
you're going through your day doing your chores cooking eating
doing whatever and even sleeping so that's really like what
the the ultimate attainment would be with this work is
for you to attain sahaja Samadhi but don't expect to
attain that easily with one awakening most of your first
awakenings will just be peak experiences which will fade which
brings us to the next question well Leo how come
people realize God but then fall back into duality they
awaken and then they go back to sleep why don't
these mystical experiences stick this is a really good question
I still haven't totally answered it for myself I think
there's a lot of factors involved but I think my
theory about is so far is that what happens is
that because the absolute truth is such a huge thing
that you're rarely gonna get it in one go you're
gonna have to glimpse it piece by piece by piece
and to assemble it and not only that but also
you're gonna have to deconstruct a lot of your old
ways of living life and understanding reality and that is
just it's difficult to do that it's difficult to deconstruct
the entire illusion of life in one single moment that's
gonna take some real serious work before that happens and
so I think that for these experiences for these P
experience to really stick so to speak what needs to
happen is that you got to grasp them at the
very deep level you have to like fully deconstruct the
illusion that was there it infused consciousness into it such
that you can never get tricked by that illusion again
usually what happens you get some mystical insight you're not
even sure what it is you saw exactly you just
know it was amazing and and mystical and awesome and
life transforming but you can't quite put your finger on
it yet and usually it escapes you and then you're
kind of like falling back into duality and your old
habits and maybe you even have some ego backlash that
even kind of feels like it regrets is you in
your development that's totally normal and so what needs to
happen is the sort of constructive process that's why it
can be helpful to actually sit down with a journal
and start deconstructing your whole life deconstructing your beliefs so
that you can really see through the illusion and you
don't buy into it again see the illusion is so
powerful that even when you break out of it you're
very tempted to fall back in it's almost hypnotic in
how it sucks you back in and of course all
the temptations of sex and food and money and family
and business and career and politics and whatever ideologies you've
had whatever but religions you subscribe to but that even
if you escape them for a little while it's just
so seductive that it sucks you right back in and
that's gonna take a lot of work for you to
overcome that next question why does it have to be
so hard to realize God because of the survival mechanism
that is driving and dominating your entire life what people
do not understand is the significance of the survival Drive
which is responsible for everything in your life thoroughly dominates
your entire life God is the undoing of this survival
Drive God is really the opposite of life God is
death from the egos point of view it is the
surrendering of this survival Drive how do you surrender it
when you've spent literally your entire life addicted to it
it is the thing that is responsible for you sitting
here and being able to listen to me it is
the thing that's responsible for you putting food in your
stomach for breathing for getting water and those are just
the basics what about your social survival strategies all of
the ideologies you have they're all tied in with survival
everything you believe your family everything you love it's all
survival and not only that but there's millions of years
of evolution within your genetics which is running you because
your ancestors those of them that didn't have a strong
survival Drive well they were killed off long ago and
maybe some of them were very spiritual but nevertheless they
were killed off you see there's no problem dying there's
no problem with God getting killed but it won't exist
then in a formed incarnated way it'll be formless so
as formlessness it doesn't need to go through survival but
once you're in the formed realm here what we call
physical reality then you need to pay very close attention
to your survival and so it's hard to realize God
it's hard to awaken it's hard to make these mystical
insights stay because you have decades of habits that you
need to undo and the mind and the brain is
slow to change itself neurons have to rewire themselves and
so forth in order for you to be able to
change your behaviors and your habits now of course don't
make that a limiting belief in a certain sense God
could also be easy to realize in a certain sense
all you have to do to realize God is lock
yourself in a room for 30 days and sit there
and do nothing and by the end of those 30
days you will be conscious of God or something close
to it if you literally do nothing for 30 days
straight including not fantasizing and thinking for 30 days straight
so I mean how hard is that you're doing nothing
literally nothing but at the same time this is the
most hard thing you could possibly do in your life
is to just sit for 30 days straight and do
nothing and not even think not even fantasize so it's
both hard and it's easy depending on on you a
lot of it of course depends on how serious you
are it becomes very hard to realize God when you're
not fully committed to it and you're wishy-washy and you're
pursuing all these other things and you're distracted and you're
trying to raise your family and run your career knew
all this sort of stuff yeah that it's quite challenging
to realize God but if you're super laser focused you
know the Buddha when he sat down he supposedly did
it in under a month of course he had years
of training before that but still when you're really serious
you can do it in under a month next question
can I realize God while running a family or a
career the answer is absolutely I have books in my
book list by enlightened people who became enlightened while they
were also in relationships while they had children her family
while they were going to medical school or being a
doctor so it's been done before and you can do
it the only thing I would recommend is don't try
to do it all at once don't try to start
your family at the same time as you're starting your
career at the same time as you're starting your serious
pursuit of enlightenment you want to space those out so
maybe spend five years raising your kid until she's at
a certain level where she's off at school okay good
now you can spend five years building your business or
your career until it's stabilized good and then you spend
five years by yourself pursuing serious spiritual research and practice
so you could definitely do it that way and in
fact you know like in India they have entire spiritual
schools that are devoted to helping what are called householders
to pursue a spiritual path because most people are not
going to become monks and renunciants and ascetics so most
people are running a family in India you know they
have big families they need careers to maintain those families
and so forth but various schools of yoga teach powerful
yogic techniques that you can practice while you're running a
family and your career and then in five 10 20
years all those results sack up and you awaken for
example the one of the founders of Kriya yoga he
he was a householder she had a family that he
ran and yet he practiced Kriya yoga and became a
guru became very awake next question Leo how come God
can be realized through visualization after all you say that
God is is beyond the mind that the mind is
the chief obstacle to God and so shouldn't visualization be
an obstacle to realizing God well this is very interesting
you think so but this is kind of a counterintuitive
point remember also though that the key to realizing God
one of the keys is concentration so the way that
these visualization methods of realizing God work and these come
from for example Tantra yoga and certain Tibetan Buddhist traditions
what you can do is you can actually visualize with
enormous concentration some kind of deity that you believe in
whether it's Christ or Krishna or sus or something else
and you visualize it with such intensity that because the
mind is a giant or the universe is a giant
mind and because what you imagine tends to become your
reality you can literally sort of materialize a vision of
your deity and then what usually happens is then though
you merge into it so this is where the Samadhi
happens is you actually merge into the deity and so
your vision of the deity and your sense of self
they collapse and merge together and that's where you have
your non dual unitive mystical experience and that can be
how you realize God now of course there can be
some limitations with this because you can get too attached
to the form of this day that you're visualizing so
like we talked about earlier if you can be visualizing
Christ the problem with that is that yes you might
realize some facet of God but are you going to
really fully get that full non-dual formless realization of the
Godhead or are you gonna attach to this image of
Christ of yours so you do have to be careful
because otherwise you might get too partial of view of
what God is or of what awakening is because the
deepest awakening is not going to have any form to
it it's not going to be an image of Shiva
or Krishna or Christ or anything else or Buddha it's
just going to be pure formless void so you want
to make sure you break through to that but there
are a lot of visualization techniques within Tantra yoga and
Tibetan Buddhism do I recommend them probably not I think
it's a little too esoteric and too specific I would
recommend something more like self-inquiry or Korea yoga or just
regular old meditation next question am I too young to
pursue God some of you are in your teenage years
and you might be asking yourself that look I was
asking questions about God basically back when I was 14
years old now I was an atheist back then so
I didn't really believe in God or the possibility of
God but I was asking questions about what is the
universe and where did it come from and how come
reality works this way and I was asking epistemic questions
and metaphysical questions which basically were questions about the nature
of God I just didn't call it God at that
point I didn't realize that this was spirituality was I
called it philosophy and so I became a philosopher around
that time so I don't really think there is such
a thing as too young and another similar question is
is it possible to awaken as a teen or in
your early 20s certainly you can I know enlightened masters
who became enlightened in their early 20s so you can
definitely do it and the sooner you become awake the
better the only thing I'll say about that as a
caveat though is that you also want to make sure
as a teen and someone in your early 20s like
many of you are that you're also taking care of
solving your survival in your teens and early 20s you
need to spend a lot of energy figuring out how
to educate yourself properly learning how the world works learning
how social relationships work learning how sexuality works getting your
diet and health in order so that you don't destroy
your health when you're older figuring out how to make
a living how to be financially independent off by yourself
so you're not leeching off your parents finding your career
yourself a sense of direction your life a sense of
life purpose so all this is very important for you
practically speaking as a team so be working on that
because if you only pursue awakening you're gonna be very
deficient in these other categories and that might create problems
for you down the road so as a teen and
in your early twenties you've got a lot of work
to do to figure out how to live life next
question can God be experienced at any stage of the
spiral can God be experienced at the pre rational and
the rational stages of cognitive development or must one be
at the trans rational level the answer is that yes
God can be experienced at any stage of the spiral
you don't have to be stage turquoise or even yellow
you don't have to be trans rational either but remember
that how you experience it will be strongly affected by
your level of cognitive development and where you are on
the spiral so if you're a stage blue person and
you have an experience of God you can have a
very limited partial ethnocentric version of God a very moralistic
version of God one that accords with your religion and
if you're a stage orange person you're gonna have a
very scientific materialistic version of God and this this will
create problems for you so you definitely want to also
work on raising your level of cognitive development to get
to tier 2 at least yellow so you have a
holistic understanding of God and spirituality once you do experience
it and also the higher you are in your spiral
level of development the easier it will be for you
to have mystical experiences and to interpret them properly because
most for example stage blue people are so wrapped up
in their dogmas about God and their beliefs and their
morality and their religion that they won't be even open
to for example reading some of the advanced spiritual books
on my book list that I recommend or doing some
of the practices that I recommend because they're gonna be
so caught up in their stage blue perspective on the
world same thing with sage orange people so it's very
important that you move into tier two because really people
who are Tier one they are so preoccupied with their
survival needs that they don't really ask very good metaphysical
questions and it's difficult for them to spend a lot
of time thinking about that stuff or to pursue that
so climb as high as you can and your your
fullest deepest understanding of God will come into your -
with yellow and with turquoise next question why does God
need to self realize well of course the answer is
God doesn't God is perfectly fine with living a life
that's not self-realized in a certain sense but also in
other sense like I said earlier God's whole point is
just to be to exist and to experience itself to
live through all of its possibilities and of course to
realize what it is so of course it's living through
the possibility of your current life but unless you awaken
in this current life you won't experience what it's like
to live in a wake life as an awake human
being and you won't fully understand what God is there's
certain ways and things that you can understand about God
only because you're in this human form that you couldn't
if you were a dog or a worm or something
like that so make sure that you should use it
but there's no need for you to do it it's
just like if you want to next question is God
personal or impersonal the answer is both this is hard
for people to understand so what do we mean by
personal versus impersonal well the atheist has a very impersonal
view of a universe the atheist thinks the universe is
just like an impersonal object atoms are not personal and
so the a this is very opposed to any kind
of personal notions of reality or existence as though existence
is somehow here for the benefit of mankind or that
existence has any kind of human personal qualities to it
and in a certain sense that's right the Godhead itself
is impersonal in the sense that it doesn't have any
kind of human personal qualities but at the same time
it's also deeply personal because it's you you are it
this Godhead is you it's inside of you right now
being conscious of all this you see and the universe
does have human qualities in a certain sense because this
intelligence that you're experiencing right now as you're sitting here
listening to me the emotions you feel the laughter and
all the human qualities that you exhibit the universe has
these qualities it's not that a human being has these
qualities it's no it's the universe is taking on human
qualities in a sense the universe has all qualities but
when you're a human is especially got human qualities and
so you got to that you got to integrate the
personal and the impersonal together it's very it's a very
personal experience when you become fully conscious of who you
are as God very personal experience and yet at the
same time there's a sense of no self a sense
of transcending your biological biographical self so that's sort of
the paradox next question does God take an active role
in manipulating our lives again it sort of depends on
what you mean by God here if you mean the
Godhead itself then not really know the Godhead is just
very passive it just sits and observes doesn't really do
anything but at the same time the God is not
really different from all the form that is here and
all the thoughts you're having this is all the work
of God your whole body everything that's going on here
all your thoughts your emotions your plans for your life
your ambitions on all this this is God sort of
using the body as a puppet to do its bidding
so in a certain sense it is manipulating your life
all the time next question does God have an agenda
or a plan for the universe where is creation going
again all of these answers basically have this sort of
double sided 'no stu them in a certain sense god
has no agenda or plan for the universe there is
no purpose or point of the universe other than the
being of the universe you see being is its own
point being is its own purpose just to be is
all that really the universe is doing but at the
same time there's also that evolutionary process that's unfolding especially
from our perspective humans it definitely seems like the universe
is evolving and moving towards greater complexity greater self-awareness and
it seems reasonable to me to assume that that's gonna
keep happening and so I would assume that what's happening
is that God is becoming more and more complex experiencing
itself in more and more forms and ultimately sort of
reaching to a singularity or to an infinity in the
sense that you might imagine that in like ten thousand
years from now we could imagine that all of humanity
is linked together through some kind of neural networks and
we're integrating our brains and our minds with computers and
with a eyes and all of it is merging together
into just one giant hive like hyper mind which is
able to experience life through all sorts of different sensory
modalities and it's able to you know query Wikipedia pages
take that knowledge to get inside of its computer mind
and combine it with it's calculating mathematical knowledge like a
calculator like a supercomputer it's able to crunch numbers like
crazy but also it's able to feel emotions the way
that a human can all of this kind of integrated
and all of the experiences of every human being and
every living creature on the entire planet is all linked
together into this ultimate like singularity maybe it's heading towards
something like that that's what I would imagine next question
which is more true pantheism or pan and theism so
pantheism says that everything is God all of reality is
God pan and theism is a slightly different version of
that which says that everything all of reality is inside
of God which is very slight little distinction and really
it's kind of a distinction without a difference in reality
both are true it's true that everything absolutely everything is
God but at the same time everything is inside of
God because God is the Godhead the formlessness that is
sort of the background against which all the form is
happening and at the same time the formlessness is not
different from the form the form in the poses are
identical so really it kind of depends a little bit
on your perspective on how you're looking at it and
when you're becoming conscious and awake to these things you
might at first experience it as though it's pantheism and
then you might experience it separately as pantheism and then
you might also experience that both as as both of
them simultaneously in a kind of a superposition overlapping each
other that's the paradoxical nature of non-duality next question how
did mankind first learn about God well of course I
don't know for sure I don't have perfect historical knowledge
of human history but I can take a guess I
can speculate I think mankind has known about God like
I said for over 450,000 years since the very beginning
of modern humans and maybe even before that maybe even
before they were modern humans are anthropoid ancestors even they
might have had some mystical insights into God but basically
the way I think it happened is probably a combination
of things I think people human beings used to be
more spiritual in the past and so it probably was
even easier for them to access God also you know
four hundred thousand years ago what was there to do
there was no television there was no distractions there weren't
a lot of humans even so there wasn't a lot
of war going on there wasn't farming there wasn't much
to do so human beings sat around a lot and
effectively what they were was meditating as they were sitting
around and doing nothing and so I think many of
them had spontaneous mystical experiences I also think that they
used psychedelics because psychedelics are readily available on all continents
around the entire world and herbalism and shamanism we know
dates back tens of thousands of years at least that
we have good historical evidence for so that shamanism probably
dates back all the way to 450,000 years ago and
also remember that some people are just naturally spiritually gifted
when they're born whether it's genetics or whatever however you
want to explain it through past lives or whatever so
some people are just naturally born and they have spontaneous
awakenings and so I think that um before there was
Jesus before there was Buddha there were thousands of Jesus's
and Buddha's that date back for hundreds of thousands of
years that just nobody knows about because they've been long
forgotten because there were no books there was no writing
back then and so this stuff you know people had
these realizations but they probably weren't able to communicate it
very well or it was just kept very locally within
their little tribe that was her tribe died out and
all that knowledge died out with them and it was
only later once we got systems of writing with the
ancient Egyptians and so forth that we finally started to
codify these insights and turn them into various kinds of
religious and mystical schools and systems next question why did
God decide to take on my particular human form well
God is taking on every possible form simultaneously one of
which is this particular human form that you're in so
don't take it too personally God's doing everything at once
next question why did God create humans and animals again
because God is everything that's possible so it's gonna take
on every possible form that it can humans animals aliens
a eyes and a million other things that you can't
even possibly imagine yet it's doing all of it simultaneously
and I think to it humans and animals are especially
valuable because you get to actually experience what that's like
to be some creature or some sentient entity in a
way that you can't really do with an atom or
with a rock but of course God is also atoms
and rocks it's just that items and rocks are so
simple that there's not enough complexity there to really create
a rich experience but you know in the form of
a human God can experience all sorts of things laughter
jealousy sexuality love emotions that rocks and even other animals
can't experience so it seems that generally speaking this evolution
is creating more and more complex life forms which can
experience reality in richer and richer ways richer senses richer
emotional capacities richer intellectual capacities richer conceptualization abilities with language
and with religion and culture and entertainment and all this
so it seems like that's gonna keep going and whatever
comes after humans you can imagine it's gonna be like
a step above in the same way that humans are
step above animals in their ability to interface with the
universe next question how can the realization of God be
used from the human perspective this is a bit tricky
because the ego loves to ask this question and loves
to think about how you can use God to earn
money or sex or something like that and of course
you can people have used the realization of God to
become famous and to become successful or money to get
sex and write books and do tours and become a
celebrity yeah you can do all that that would be
very uh very tricky though because you can get easily
lost in all those materialistic trappings but you can use
the realization of God from the human perspective to elevate
the consciousness of mankind so once you yourself become awake
it becomes very easy and effortless for you to transmit
that awakeness to everybody around you and this helps to
wake up the rest of the world you can use
the realization of God to teach you can use it
to master your emotions you can use it to improve
for example how you do science you can use it
to be hyper creative you can become a really great
artist from this place it will improve every aspect of
your life you can use it to become a better
athlete you can use it to become a better father
or mother you can use it to raise a better
family you can use it to improve the quality of
your relationships and your sex life and many other things
basically consciousness helps to improve everything you do you can
even use it to improve your ability to run a
business of course that sort of assumes that you're gonna
be running a conscious business if you're running a very
unconscious business where you're fleecing people and gouging people hurting
people then that's probably not going to be compatible with
awakening but you can transform your business and your conscious
business same thing with your relationships if you're inside a
very toxic dysfunctional relationships and awakening will probably end those
relationships but then you can forge new relationships which which
will be much healthier and more conscious next question does
realizing God give you any special powers or abilities this
is a bit of a dangerous question because the answer
is that yes it can it can this is the
realm of paranormal abilities and cities what the Yogi's call
cities these special spiritual powers even so these are the
powers that have been written about in various spiritual books
magical healing abilities clairvoyance telepathic abilities and abilities to see
auras and other things like this so this is a
whole separate subject matter that can be studying a lot
of depth it can also become a big distraction to
awakening the pursuit of these powers is usually sought by
an ego which can be very problematic because the ego
is hungry for power but uh but yeah some people
do develop these abilities these abilities are real but you're
not guaranteed to develop any particular ability and most people
who awaken probably won't develop any abilities but some people
will I think that genetic predisposition has something to do
with it and other factors that I don't quite understand
yet next question our miracles possible well first you have
to realize that everything is a miracle literally this very
moment right now is a miracle all of existence is
a miracle but that's not what you're asking you're asking
can-can miracles happen within this physical reality and the answer
is that I think yes in the sense of paranormal
stuff can happen certain paranormal healing can happen which is
very well documented certain synchronicities can happen in synchrony so
knees are kind of a weird thing that are difficult
to explain unless you're already awake and you're experiencing them
so in this sense miracles can sort of happen but
I also think it can be kind of over exaggerated
I don't really know if Jesus walked on water and
this sorts of stuff I wouldn't really pay too much
credence to that but stuff like for example healing people
I think is definitely possible next question so is everything
in the Bible false the answer of course is no
there's a lot of good stuff in the Bible but
also a lot of outdated stuff there's racist stuff in
there as an eccentric stuff closed-minded stuff there's factually incorrect
stuff because the Bible is written by humans and it
wasn't even written by Jesus so you should expect that
there would be a lot of inaccuracies and errors in
the Bible but at the same time there's really good
stuff like there's a passage in the Bible that says
where were Moses Moses communicates with God he sees God
and then he asks God okay so I'm gonna go
back to my people and tell them that I saw
God but what should I call you and God tells
them you can tell them that I am my name
is I am and that's a really good passage very
very accurate that tells you exactly what God is I
am you are you are God when Jesus said that
the kingdom of heaven is found within that's a really
good pointer to where you find heaven within Nirvana's found
within heaven it's not outside of you so you can
find all sorts of little interesting clues and and pointers
in the Bible but at the same time you know
there's a lot of fluff in the Bible a lot
of misleading stuff so I wouldn't consider it a really
high quality practical spiritual text you can find much better
modern books that will teach you how to actually do
the practices of being able to realize what the Bible
is pointing to next question what is our duty towards
God what should we do should we worship God should
we pray to God well in the ultimate sense you
have no duty towards God since you are God what
duty can you have to yourself your duty is simply
to just be however you are is you fulfilling your
duty whether you're a monster you're an angel you're fulfilling
your duty in other sense your duty is to awaken
and to help to raise the awareness of all of
mankind and to help to raise the awareness of the
entire cosmos and to participate in this creative evolutionary game
that God is playing it should you worship God or
pray to God the problem with this that I find
is that people who worship God or pray to God
are doing it under the presumption of a duality between
God and themselves so you need to make sure you
realize that the thing you're worshipping or praying to is
exactly yourself so really when you're worshiping or you're praying
it is a form of masturbation and you should be
conscious of that and then if you still want to
worship or prayer I don't really know why you would
I guess you could but this is a classic mistake
that many Orthodox religious people make is that they just
they worship God so much that that then becomes the
obstacle to realizing that I am God because you know
Leo if I have been worshiping God for twenty years
what the hell was i worshipping if I was just
worshiping myself exactly exactly that's the whole point there's nothing
to worship but yourself so careful with that next question
what does God want from us well again really nothing
just be however you want to be and gods happy
with it whatever you do God is fine with it
doesn't matter but in another certain sense try to be
as conscious as you can try to appreciate your own
magnificence is God otherwise it's sort of like your hey
you're not realizing how amazing you are how I may
this whole thing is your dad I'm missing the beauty
of life it's wasted on you it's almost like we're
going to a really great movie and we're sitting down
to the theater to to watch the movie and instead
of sitting pointing your face at the movie screen you
turn around and look backwards at the projector the whole
time and of course in a certain sense it's like
you're wasting this opportunity if you would just turn around
and look the right direction you would see a really
beautiful movie so why are you getting in your own
way but at the same time also if you want
to sit backwards that's also fine God doesn't really care
there's a certain point in doing that too then you
get to experience what the back of the movie theaters
like next question well following my religion lead me to
God should I abandon my religion I'm sort of biased
actually against religion I have an allergy against any kind
of dog more fundamentalism or any belief system whatsoever I'm
mmm I'm even allergic to ideologies secular ideologies economic ideologies
and political ones and so forth so personally I recommend
that you do abandon your religion because it's mostly gonna
get in the way have the courage just to let
it go after all it's just brainwashing is all that
really is you can never lose the only true thing
there is which is God so if you really care
about your religion and you really care about God then
abandon your religion and then you will discover that all
that there is is God and you won't need a
religion anymore your religion will become the real thing God
you you are the source or the thing that religion
is pointing at nothing but you so why do you
need all those belief systems try to let them go
as much as you can next question leo my religion
like the Quran the Bible Buddhism Vedanta already says all
the stuff you're talking about it's already filled with all
the wisdom so what's the point of your teachings aren't
you just rehashing the same stuff plagiarizing them no it
might seem like I'm rehashing the same stuff but actually
I'm talking about at a different level I'm actually talking
about at a higher level I'm talking about it from
a stage yellow stage turquoise perspective from an integral holistic
perspective in a way that the Quran or the Bible
doesn't the problem with the Quran with the Bible with
traditional Buddhist sutras and even traditional Vedanta is that it's
a very ethnocentric version of spirituality it's not truly holistic
it doesn't take into account all the different other spiritual
schools that exist it tries to be exclusive it also
is dogmatic it teaches you certain things that it wants
you to believe and just to take on blind faith
it's not very empirically based it's also not very well
integrated with modern science and so while all those traditions
are great and you can glean certain insights from them
really in the 21st century you need to be going
beyond there's a lot of stuff that these thousand-year-old spiritual
traditions just will not teach you because those things weren't
known back then we have modern psychological insights modern insights
from quantum mechanics from chaos theory from sociology anthropology history
economics linguistics modern philosophy post-modernism you know that there's just
there's so much stuff beyond what you will learn in
the quran or in the bible or through classical Buddhism
or Vedanta and we need to do that we need
to we need to be constantly evolving our spiritual practice
we can't be living in a spiritual tradition of a
thousand years ago that's way too medieval it's not gonna
work in our modern world you always have to adopt
your spiritual practice to fit the modern world and to
deal with new technological realities and complexities that just didn't
exist back then because the entire universe is evolving and
it's evolving at an ever-accelerating rate so my teachings are
really trying to be the cutting edge of spirituality I'm
trying to teach spirituality in a way that I think
it needs to be evolved into in the 21st century
so even though I speak about a lot of timeless
truths I also do put a new twist on it
and I point out important traps that you won't learn
about in many other places for example are you going
to read about cult dynamics in the Bible or in
the Quran or it within Buddhism or Vedanta no you're
not they're not gonna teach you about cults because that's
more modern psychological theory which we've learned recently or for
example spiral dynamics you know the quran i'm going to
teach you about spiral dynamics and that's that's a great
problem the quran is also not going to teach you
about various kinds of psychopathologies and shadow work and other
things that weren't known back then which are really important
for for you to be successful in your practice today
next question what is the number one requirement for realizing
God I've thought about this for a long while and
I came up with actually with three important requirements number
one is concentration you need to develop laser focused concentration
abilities for hours on end number two is radical open
mindedness you need to literally open your mind so much
that you even open your minds to death to evil
to all the stuff that you resist and would never
even imagine is possible and third is you need to
be genuinely metaphysically curious this is so important because you
got to actually have a desire to want to understand
what is existence and why is it here and why
is there something rather than nothing and what is God
you have to really want to get to the bottom
of those answers not as beliefs or theories but actuality
so those I think are the three keys next question
but Leo how do I know that I can trust
everything that you're saying and of course the answer here
is that you shouldn't just blindly trust me that's one
way in which stuff that I teach is different from
the Quran or the Bible or Buddhism or something else
you shouldn't blindly trust me you should validate everything that
I'm saying here cross reference read different sources verify things
for yourself experiment with psychedelics experiment with yoga experiment meditation
experiment self inquiry and so on and discover what's true
for yourself some of the things I'm saying could be
wrong I could be deluded from your point of view
I could be a cult leader I could be insane
you don't know do you must verify but at the
same time also don't miss trust me in a cynical
sort of way as well that would also be a
mistake because if you mistrust me talk too much then
you're not going to give your yourself enough open-mindedness to
even kind of like bootstrap yourself out of whatever situation
in life right now that you're stuck in you need
to you need to have kind of like mmm enough
openness that you're willing to consider these possibilities seriously and
follow up with them and to actually test them in
the same way that a good scientist can't be so
mistrustful that he can't even run an experiment for a
few years and get the results back he has to
be able to have enough trust to run the experiment
and then to to either confirm or to dis confirm
what's being said so that's the end of the list
those are all your questions still confused after all this
well God is a very confusing topic but you also
have to understand that in the end all these conversations
that we're having about God all these answers that I'm
giving you it's just story you're never going to figure
out God through this sort of question-and-answer thing this question-and-answer
stuff can go on forever your mind loves to ask
questions because it's a great way to avoid doing the
actual work and the answers at some point they become
an obstacle because your mind gets filled with all these
answers but you're not actually discovering them for yourself it's
like looking up the answers in the back of a
book for your math problems rather than solving them yourself
so in the end the only way to understand God
is to awaken to God to become God and then
to look and to feel yourself as God and then
from that will come all the answers remember that you
cannot awaken before you awaken some people try to get
like a preview of God they try to find out
all what's God gonna be like I want an image
of it I want a metaphor I want this I
want a map I want a model I want like
what's it gonna be like when I awaken you can't
do that if you truly knew what it would be
like to awaken you would already be awake that's the
whole challenge of awakening so um just try to be
comfortable with not knowing for a while while you're doing
your practices and then trust that one day you'll figure
it out what actually comes but if you try to
get a sneak preview of it that's actually gonna get
in the way of you awakening and the last thing
that I'll just remind you of is that one awakening
is not enough to understand that everything I told you
in this miniseries I have described God in many different
facets in many different ways from many different angles which
took me over a dozen separate awakening experiences to piece
together and it probably will for you as well I
highly doubt and I think you'll be very disappointed if
you go in to this process expecting to understand everything
that I talked about in these two episodes after one
awakening experience I just find that very difficult to believe
it's way too much for you to understand at all
with one experience you're probably gonna need multiple glimpses and
then you probably can also need to spend time thinking
about it integrating it maybe reading some books maybe talking
to a guru kind of figuring stuff out in your
mind before you really understand at the level that I
described it here in the last two episodes this is
this is a very thorough comprehensive explanation that probably many
Zen monks and Yogi's unless they're super masterful they won't
know all this stuff they probably will be missing some
of these facets because it's hard to have this many
awakenings most people have one or two awakenings in their
whole life if they're lucky not a dozen or thirty
of them which is again why psychedelics can be so
beneficial because you can use psychedelics to create 30 awakenings
for yourself over the next couple of years which would
be virtually impossible through other methods but of course yoga
and self inquiry can also basically do the job so
don't feel like you have to do psychedelics it's just
an option alright that's it I'm done here please click
the like button for me and come check out actualize
that org that's my website you'll find resources there like
my blog the book lists the life purpose course and
the forum the final thing they'll say is that actualised
org can help you to discover God I receive emails
and private messages on my forum every month of people
who have awoken maybe not fully awoken but they had
some kind of glimpse or even a significant awakening from
following the stuff that I say doing the practices that
I talked about maybe reading some of the books that
I recommend on my book list and just getting on
with the program so if you're serious about understanding God
for yourself experientially then follow along try to do the
actual practices that I recommend I recommend some very powerful
practices I'm sort of a no-nonsense kind of guy and
I like to do techniques that actually work that don't
waste my time and I spent a lot of time
experimenting over the last three years with various kinds of
techniques and I think some of the techniques that I
offer are some of the most potent techniques that you'll
find anywhere within spirituality so don't take them for granted
take them seriously and it doesn't always take that long
I have people who have been meditating for 6 months
or 12 months and they're already having awakening experiences you
know so don't create limiting beliefs for yourself don't tell
yourself it's gonna take 10 years it doesn't have to
you can you can awaken within a couple of years
if you're serious about it so I recommend you get
started and then stick around for more as I will
be helping to guide you in the future pointing out
various kinds of traps that you'll be falling into giving
you various other kinds of pointers sharing other techniques that
I'm still researching there are techniques that I haven't shared
yet with you I'm always looking for cutting-edge stuff that's
what excites me about this work I don't like rehashing
old stuff I like talking about new stuff which is
why I'm always doing lots of research and there will
be a lot of that coming in future you
