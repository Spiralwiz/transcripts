hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about the curse of being
human I don't know if you thought about this but
at the very end of your life if you're like
most people like 99.9% of people then you are going
to die with one regret one major major regret in
your life and this is going to happen to virtually
every human being on earth this one regret if you're
even lucky enough to have a slow conscious death and
that regret is the regret of having gone through life
and not having smelled the roses not having stopped to
smell the roses you know I went out today to
run some errands during the day and I was running
the errands I was so busy running the errands that
I came back home I came back home and right
now it's springtime the spring is just starting here in
Las Vegas and it was really beautiful outside but I
didn't see that beauty then I was listening to some
audio tapes and just doing my self-help stuff and my
mind got tuned to the fact that the present moment
is beautiful my mind just got tuned to it and
then I went out a second time to run a
second errand had to drop a letter in the mailbox
and this time I saw the beauty that I was
missing the first time that I went outside the colors
looked really crisp everything was bright the birds were singing
it was gorgeous like a gorgeous beautiful day clear perfect
clear sky all the colors were just sparkling the wind
was blowing and as I was walking home I couldn't
help but just stop near some trees giant pine tree
and the Sun was shining through the needles of the
pine tree and the wind was blowing and the birds
were chirping and it was just the perfect temperature in
the perfect day and it struck me then how much
I don't connect with that on a daily level and
I immediately saw that when I'm going to be on
my deathbed if I'm lucky enough to be conscious then
my biggest regret is going to be this is going
to be letting life slip through my fingers and not
seeing what was right there under my nose the whole
time and that is what I call the grand illusion
the grand illusion and the curse of being human I
was working with a client recently and I was coaching
her because she was having some relationship issues with her
marriage things aren't going too smoothly there she's not sure
what to do but one of her issues is that
she really really feels like she needs a relationship to
be happy she needs love you women are all about
this you want love you want intimacy in your relationship
you want that partner who really knows you deeply and
there's nothing wrong with that per se but the problem
here is that she wants it so bad she wants
it so bad that she almost wants it at any
cost and therefore is destroying the relationship and so we're
talking about this we've spent weeks talking about this she's
paid me thousands of dollars to talk about this and
we're getting her deeper deeper understanding we're going deeper and
deeper into why these patterns are playing out in her
life and just the other day what we kind of
came to is we came to this very deep fundamental
truth and that is the truth of not needing anything
to be happy in life and that to have a
powerful relationship counter-intuitively paradoxically which you need is you need
to be able to let go of the need to
have a relationship in the first place and you can't
fake it you have to actually be genuine in that
it's not a manipulation it has to be a genuine
attitude towards relationships that you have to see that you
don't really need them that they don't have true value
for you and when she started to realize this it
was like she was having this aha moment and was
really powerful and put a glow on my face but
also the next question the very next question she asked
me is she said below if you're telling me that
this is how it is and that I don't really
need this relationship or any relationship for that matter then
why am i doing all this stuff why work why
build a business why have this career that takes up
so much time why start a family why even get
married why do anything at all and that's exactly the
question that I have for you is why are you
doing these things and that's exactly the point is that
they are not necessary for your happiness they are not
but the problem is that you tell yourself that they
are and that right there is the grand illusion the
grand illusion quite simply is looking for happiness in the
future this is what you do you look for happiness
in the future all the time and this is how
I know that you cannot be truly happy sometimes people
post comments to be and say but leo i know
this person is very happy my friends are happy my
wife is happy my mom is happy I'm happy you're
telling people that they're not happy how can you know
if I'm happy or not you don't know well actually
I do know because I understand how your psychology works
and all our psychology is work in the same way
on this point that it's not possible for you because
you're living in the future all the time and this
is how I know that this regret that I foresaw
me having on my deathbed today when I was outside
looking at the beautiful nature in the trees that this
is how I know that it will be true for
me and it will be true for you on your
deathbed too is because your mind is creating this illusion
of future happiness and so it means what this means
is that you're not living in the present moment you
can't appreciate what's right here under your nose right now
and I got a really simple but shocking fact for
you what's under your nose right now what's in front
of your eyes right now whatever it is what's around
you right now right this millisecond that's reality that's real
everything else everything you believe about your future and your
goals and your wishes and your desires and your worries
and your frustrations and your fears whether it's about your
relationship your business your life your family the economy the
country the world that that is all the construction of
the conceptualizing mind your mind is creating a conceptual future
and you are living in that future and therefore you're
living in this matrix Don Miguel Ruiz in his very
popular little book called The Four Agreements has a really
powerful section at the very beginning where he talks about
how human beings are masters at domestication and he says
we've domesticated a bunch of different animals from dogs two
cats to cattle to birds but the greatest animal that
we domesticated is we've domesticated the human animal we've domesticated
ourselves and I got a really poignant taste of that
today when I was outside because I could clearly see
that I am living in a cage of my own
construction my apartment where I'm living right now is a
cage I mean in a sense it's a great place
I love it and I get a lot of fulfillment
from where I live but in a sense it also
keeps me caged from like nature from reality from the
bigger world from the open sky from the trees from
the birds from the from the wind and there's something
about that when you go and you travel or you
go on a hike or you go somewhere scenic like
a national park you get back in touch with like
your humanity and that humanity is somehow very intimately tied
with nature very interesting and then when you come back
after you've like let's say you've been hiking for a
few days then when you drive back you come back
home and you're walking in your front door you know
sense it can be kind of nice because you're you
want those comforts of everyday life like a hot shower
and some food and stuff but also you can see
that as you're walking to that door and you're walking
into your cage you're a caged animal and you've caged
yourself without knowing it and even once you realize it
you still keep yourself caged it's not like you leave
that cage you say screw this I'm going to go
live outdoors or something you don't do that most people
don't do that in fact it's interesting because I remember
hearing that they did some research I don't remember where
this research came from but basically what they discovered about
the human mind is that the human mind finds imagery
of nature more appealing on a subconscious level than images
of non natural things so for example what they'll do
is they'll show up a landscape painting with rolling hills
and some trees and stuff you know a natural scene
and the human eye will just fixate on that and
find it more appealing and pleasing it'll focus on it
for a longer period of time then it will for
example on some photograph of a city landscape you know
an unnatural kind of environment and it's even I think
gotten to the point where what you can do is
you can get a little sketch something a little schematic
not even a photorealistic painting but just a little schematic
of a picturesque kind of a outdoor scene like literally
you can just draw a couple of wavy lines for
the hills and you can draw a little circle for
the Sun and you can draw a little wavy line
for the river and the human mind because we grew
up in this natural environment for hundreds of thousands of
years this is where we evolved that the human mind
finds this pleasing whereas if you look at a grimy
cityscape then you don't get that same effect and I
think that I don't identify myself at all for example
with New Age thinking or with with hippy mentality and
philosophy but I think that one of the things that
kind of that hippy Green Peace kind of you know
segments of lifestyle and of society that one of the
things that kind of they understand that the rest of
us domesticated human animals don't understand and us kind of
national scientific thinkers is that they kind of understand the
power of the Nate young nature and they align themselves
with with that whereas we domesticated humans were like off
that's that's so silly that's so new-age and hippie and
whoo and one thing that I notice a theme throughout
my personal development is that as I'm moving towards more
more consciousness and more and more kicking ass in my
life like kicking ass in hardcore ways so like I'm
no hippie like for me kicking ass means earning more
money and getting better relationships and having more sex and
improving my business you know concrete very tangible things that
most people in society are looking for more money more
health more passion in your life is kind of stuff
that as I'm making that progression I'm also becoming softer
more hippy like and it's kind of a little bit
disturbing because I have these narrow negative stereotypes about hippies
I'm like well I don't want to be a granola
eating tree-hugging hippie that just doesn't kind of like fit
with my understanding of my cell like my identity is
is very different than that just the way that I
perceive myself my self-image and I think that you know
most people in society are are these kind of more
rational people rather than these hippy people and I think
that the hippie people have something to learn from the
rational side I think that the rational side has a
lot to learn from the hippy people too and one
of these things is their kind of appreciation for nature
and being in the moment so back to the grand
illusion the grand illusion is working for happiness working for
happiness cannot create happiness happiness is right now right here
you don't really need to do thing to be happy
you just need to be present the problem though is
that you can't do this and the reason you can't
do this is because of the voice the voice in
your mind that always keeps spinning it keeps spinning and
creating future scenarios scenarios of the future they could be
great scenarios or they could be bad scenarios probably in
your life it's a mixture of both but even if
they're great scenarios and you become the best positive thinker
in the world and all you think about it great
scenarios of all your goals and all your future dreams
and visions that's not going to do it because you're
still in the rat race you're still in the grand
illusion because while you're looking over there you're not seeing
what's over here it's really just that stupidly simple which
brings us to the question and the topic of enlightenment
enlightenment is a very very simple thing I have some
deep and complex sounding videos and theory that explains enlightenment
and you can go watch those and I think that
those are important but you can also explain enlightenment in
a very very very simple way because enlightenment is extremely
simple in fact it's so simple that it's just baffling
Lee stupidly simple it's so simple that you don't even
know what to do with this simplicity you need a
bunch of methods and techniques for how to get to
the simplicity because it is so simple your brain doesn't
know how to do this and what enlightenment is is
simply the undoing of this curse it's the undoing of
the grand illusion that's all it is it's the silencing
of the voice so that instead of living in the
illusion of the future the future is not real the
future is a concoction in your mind is living in
your mind you bring your awareness out into reality and
you live from reality itself you're like fully integrated into
reality and you're constantly smelling the roses because if you're
in the present moment there is nothing but to smell
the roses and sometimes it's smelling the roses sometimes it's
smelling a pile of [ __ ] but reality is
both of those things see the grand illusion is that
we need to perfect reality to suit us if we
have a pile of [ __ ] we need to
convert it into a bush of roses and so what
the voice tells us is that okay let's construct the
best imaginable environment for ourselves to be happy and through
this process we domesticate ourselves by surrounding ourselves with the
greatest creature comforts that we could find except we don't
realize in doing this that that's not going to work
that the point of life is to live in reality
not in a fantasy and even though you can surround
yourself with real cool technology technology is not a fantasy
we have all these honest-to-god great inventions and luxuries such
as air conditioning and electricity and toothbrushes and toilets all
these things are really nice and they're real but the
price we pay for creating these things is that we're
always living in the future waiting for the next thing
what's the next thing that's going to come along that's
going to make my life a little bit more perfect
and in so doing what we do is we focus
on all the imperfections in our lives everything that needs
to be improved and therefore we can't see what's already
awesome right in front of us so you can understand
enlightenment just very simply in this light with enlightenment on
the one hand nothing really changes it's not like you
have some baffling mind-blowing epiphany that all the sudden now
creates a totally new environment and reality for you that's
the caricature version of enlightenment what alignment actually is is
something so simply stupid that if you ever experience it
what some people report is they report laughter laughter after
the moment of enlightenment why is that they laugh because
it's so silly that they spent thousands of hours chasing
this enlightenment they then don't even want to call it
in enlightenment because that word makes the actual events too
significant because in the end all that happens is that
your voice goes silent and allows you to be in
the present moment that's it that's all I'm it is
just the allowing of your voice to focus off from
the future to the present moment and of course for
long period of time because you have moments in your
day everyone does where you can be present but what
enlightenment allows you to do is permanently this identifies to
the point where you can really appreciate everything around you
that you take for granted everything becomes beautiful the simplest
things become beautiful even the ugly things become beautiful even
the disturbing the uncomfortable the painful things become beautiful and
so because of this on one hand nothing changes on
the other hand everything changes everything changes because your perspective
on everything changes and one really powerful saying that I've
heard one yogi or guru saying is that perspective is
everything perspective is everything it's everything not changing your environment
but perspective on the environment that's what's truly important and
this is really hard to believe because we grew up
in a materialistic society and the whole fundamental assumption and
basis of the society that we're living in the Western
culture at least is about changing the environment and that
environment is everything if only I got a better wife
or a better husband or if only I didn't have
problems with my dog or I didn't have problems with
my kids or if only I was going to a
better school or if only I had more money in
my bank account or if only my career was this
way or if only I got this promotion sooner or
if only I was younger or if only I was
less diseased or less sick if only I could live
a little longer then that would make me happy but
it turns out to be the case that this is
a trap and that you can't win that game you
can't win that game and one of the ways you
can start to see that you can't win that game
is because you've been playing this game your whole life
and yet you're still looking for the next thing so
the question is how long is it going to take
for you how much hitting your head against the wall
is it going to take to see that this game
hasn't worked will not work and cannot possibly work and
what is it going to take you to start to
realize that perspective is everything in the words of a
little-known speaker maybe this will ring some bells for you
I have a dream I have a dream for you
a vision for you of what your life can be
like and my dream is that one day you break
the chains of your voice that one day you silenced
the voice for good that you dis identify with the
voice that you master yourself that you discover the truth
of no self and that you're able to take your
mind off the future and bring it into reality into
reality it's really that simple and I have a dream
that you will die without regret because you will have
been able to smell the roses at least for a
little bit without death nipping at your heels just yet
and because of this you will die with no regrets
because you will know that you've been smelling the roses
for as long as you could have until you die
that's my vision for you that's my dream for you
of what you can do if you pursue enlightenment and
you take this seriously there's really just one catch with
this and it's a real big problem it's a real
big problem don't underestimate how big this problem is right
here the question is do you have the balls and
you have the wisdom to give up on yourself on
your present way of being to become the no self
because very very few people do very few people do
before I let you go well I have your attention
right now while you're in this contemplative mood I want
you to do an exercise for me really simple exercise
but a very powerful exercise that will show you because
I want you to see what enlightenment could actually be
like for you a lot of people get this idea
of enlightenment as some sort of ethereal fancy state when
in fact it's the most real state it's the state
of being in reality so here's the exercise you're going
to go and grab a book off your bookshelf try
to find a book that's the most plain and ordinary
that you can find hardbacks are nice take the dust
jacket off and what I want you to do is
I want you to now make sensory love to this
book for five minutes find a quiet place where no
one's going to think you're weird no one's going to
judge you and what I want you to do is
I want you to really focus on this book and
see it and sense it and experience it as though
you're experiencing it for the first time in your life
I want you to look at every tiny little detail
every texture on the book I want you to look
at it from all the different sides to spin it
around in your hands I want you to look at
how the lettering is printed on it how uneven it
is I want you to take a look at the
corners and how sharp they might be take a look
at the straight lines take a look at any blemishes
that are there take a look at what the paper
feels like press on it tap on it even even
smell it and be completely engrossed in this process of
observation and get out of your head don't think about
the book don't analyze the book just experience it experience
the raw data that is here this is pure reality
and this right here is going to be an experience
of true spirituality see people really get confused about spirituality
and they think well spirituality that's like praying or going
to church or meditation or scriptures or whatever no that's
not spirituality at all that's [ __ ] real spirituality
is what you're going to experience if you do this
exercise and I want you to spend a good five
minutes at least to doing it spirituality and enlightenment is
the most real thing that there is it's not some
afterlife some heaven it's right here and what you're going
to notice in this experience after the fact don't notice
this during but afterwards I want you to notice that
your sense of self and identity melts away whenever you
focus yourself completely on the senses and you're able to
get completely out of your head stop thinking about yourself
stop thinking about the future and just focus on these
senses if you do this exercise then what I want
you to do is I want you to tell yourself
that is what enlightenment is like that is enlightenment the
only difference is that with enlightenment you're able to be
in this state of presence all the time imagine how
beautiful life becomes if you're able to achieve that that
kind of price it's not woo or spiritual at all
it's really the most grounded that you can be as
a human being because you're not in the future anymore
so I really want you to do this exercise take
it seriously and the last point that I want to
make is that I'm not here to give you the
kind of advice that I hear some people saying which
is just be present be in the moment this advice
doesn't work it can't work for you it's not possible
for this advice to work for you because you need
me here pushing you motivating you to go out there
and do this exercise and when you do this exercise
you're going to struggle many of you will struggle a
lot it's going to depend on your level of mental
development many of you will struggle to stay present you're
going to stay present for very short periods of time
and so it's pointless for me to just tell you
to be present because it's going to sound nice and
you're going to do it for five minutes but then
afterwards you're not going to be able to do it
and your life is going to go back into the
grand illusion so instead the point here is to use
this exercise and then tell yourself this is what I
could have this is the vision this is the dream
of where I could be if I seriously pursue enlightenment
that's the point I've only discovered one way to get
out of the grand illusion there's only one way and
the only way is by discovering the truth of no
self which means that you have to dissolve your ego
so that the ego stops getting in the way so
the voice is silent so that you can be fully
present and fully in the moment this is important for
you to do and to realize because this is what
generates the desire and the wisdom necessary to go out
there and actually do the work to get to this
state in your life it takes work even though paradoxically
you could be that that way right now there's really
nothing to do but the problem is that because there
is that voice inside your head and it won't shut
up there's actually quite a lot to do so do
this exercise right now all right this is Leo I'm
signing off posting your comments down below click the like
button share this video with a friend and come sign
up to my newsletter my newsletters right here at actualized
org is a free newsletter I release new videos every
single week on self-actualization topics I want to help you
to master your psychology so that in doing this you
can become free to create the kind of life that
you want and I'm guessing that you don't want a
domesticated ordinary kind of life because you've been living this
kind of life you've seen other people living this kind
of life and you know that it's Hollow and you
know that these regrets on your deathbed are coming and
you don't want this and so fundamentally that's why we
do personal development because we want to make the most
of this short existence that we have and we want
to be able to stop and smell the roses but
to do this requires some work as simple as it
is it requires potentially a lot of work depending at
where you're at most people are really far behind so
what we need to do is we need to work
on your psychology introduce new concepts new ideas reframing the
way you think showing you techniques getting you to take
action and action is important you don't want to just
be watching these videos but if you're watching these videos
on a weekly basis and you're going out there taking
baby steps you'll be shocked at how different your life
will be in just a couple of years they start
stacking up and eventually you start getting exponential results and
that is one of the most rewarding investments of time
and energy that you can make in your life is
investing in your own growth so if you're interested in
that and you're interested in no-bullshit personal development then sign
up right now you
