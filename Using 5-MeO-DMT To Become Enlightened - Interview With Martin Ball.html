Hey guys, it's Leo. And today we have a special
episode of actualised.org, where I'm going to be interviewing Martin
ball, PhD. He's an adjunct professor and Ashland, Oregon, at
the university there. And what we're going to be talking
about is we're gonna be talking about psychedelics, and specifically
five amnio because he's a big advocate of five MEO
and what it can do for us spiritually and for
development. So I want to talk to him because he's
got a lot of experience with all sorts of psychedelics
and specifically five Meo, and he's got some amazing insights
to share with us. So listen, close, because this could
really change your life. If you take into practice some
of the things we're gonna talk about here today. Hey,
Barton, say hey, hey, it's great to be here. Thanks
for having me on. Yeah, yeah, you bet. You bet.
So I guess the most direct question, the million dollar
question is, can fire them to actually be used to
attain enlightenment, or however you want to call it liberation,
or all the different words that are for this non
duality thing that we've been talking about? The short answer
is yes, absolutely. So we had a prior conversation just
the other week. And one of the things that we
talked about there is that I like to make a
very clear and strong distinction between what I call an
enlightenment experience, and then what is actual enlightenment or liberation,
which I would define as freedom from the confines of
the illusory nature of the ego and clear awareness of
the true nature of the self. And that's, that's something
that's different from an enlightenment experience. And it's very important
to distinguish these things, because in working with five methoxy
Dimethyltryptamine shorthand five Mao or five Meo DMT, is the
strongest psychedelic substance that exists on planet Earth. And that,
like, for example, many people take it either by smoking
it or vaporizing and, and there's other methods as well.
But that's the primary method would be smoking or vaporizing.
And when someone is smoking or vaporizing five Meo DMT,
within a matter of seconds, you go, if we want
to call normal perception of reality is zero, you go
from zero to infinity, in a number of seconds, it
comes on very, very quickly. And if the ego can
relax and surrender, during that process, which keep in mind,
many egos cannot and do not relax and let go.
So it's perfectly possible for people to fight with the
experience all the way through. But if someone relaxes, and
trust the experience, within a matter of seconds, just within
the matter of one breath, you suddenly enter into this
full, infinite non dual state of awareness where everything is
perceived as the infinite nature of the self, that there
is no subject, there's no object, there is just the
pure nature of being. That is what we can call
an enlightenment experience where when people have that the most
common reaction that people have, in coming back from that
experience, when they reintegrating in their ego, is oh my
god, that was it. That whatever enlightenment is, that was
it. And so people are able to perceive that and
appreciate that. But what tends to happen is that then
the structures of the ego reform after that experience, and
then a person is, in a sense, right back where
they were before, to some degree. Now, it sets a
radical experience that for many people, it is kind of
paradigm shattering, where prior belief systems suddenly don't make any
sense anymore. Prior intellectual systems don't make any sense anymore.
So it can cause people to kind of go through
this rather deep process of self analysis and looking at
their belief structures and how they've categorized themselves in the
world. So it can be very profound, very life changing.
But I don't qualify that as actual liberation, that liberation
is something that is the result of a process through
which people can go to unwind the ego to kind
of deconstruct it to unpack places where it has created
resistance or withholding within the individual. And that doesn't happen
just from one enlightenment experience, or even many enlightenment experiences,
because I've seen plenty of instances of people who have
had many non dual experiences, but I wouldn't necessarily consider
them as being any closer to true liberation than anybody
else. So I like to make that distinction. But once
we understand that distinction, I would say five Meo DMT
is probably the most effective tool that exists on planet
Earth. For anyone who's looking to make progress to uncover
the true nature of the self and liberate themselves from
the prison of the ego. Yeah, well, that's quite amazing
that that's such a substance can exist. And you know,
I've been interested in what you call non duality and
enlightenment and liberation for a long time now, and we've
been talking about it a lot on actualized.org and various
episodes. And one of the most difficult challenges that I
face is just communicating, like that radical paradigm breaking thing
as a concept. Because when we're talking language, when we're
just talking on YouTube and a video or something, it's
just like, well, it's words, and I'm explaining something or
you're explaining something, but it's like, and then they have
to spend usually years or decades or 1000s of hours
of meditation or something like that, to even get a
taste, not even liberation, just to get an enlightenment experience
takes 1000s of hours of work, and already extreme degrees
of open mindedness that many people don't have. Which is
why when I learned about five Meo, and I actually
took it myself, like, wow, because it's like, you get
even just, you know, a 10 minute preview of that
infinite. Absolute state is just incredible, because it's like, wow,
everything I was studying and all that stuff, it's like,
okay, that's kind of knowledge in theory, but then here's
like, the real full Monty, the real deal is like
amazing, amazing, it, it changes your whole attitude towards this
path of liberation. Yeah, and I'd really like to emphasize
what you've just said here that it cannot really be
communicated through words mean, language is ultimately a dualistic construct,
it rests on the assumption of self and other through
which there is a communication from one end to the
other. So all language is built on the assumption of
duality. And then words themselves are, by definition limitations that
they are particular constructs that identify something as this, that
or the other thing. And so we have this word,
we have this word of infinite. And we, you know,
we've all seen the Hubble Space Telescope photos. And so
we get, you know, a little glimpse, we have this
idea, okay? If it is like really, really big, and
really, really vast and just goes on and on forever.
But that's still a concept. And so we had this
idea of what infinity is, and then we and part
of the idea is, well, I can't really understand what
infinity is, because it's infinite. And so it's an idea.
But when you have the experience of being infinite, you
very quickly realize that it cannot be contained by any
word by any concept by any idea that it just,
it just is. And it, the odd thing is that
it can be experienced. But it can't necessarily be described.
It's crazy, because when I experienced it, it's at the
same time. There's such a sense of like recognition of
it, and it's like, oh, yeah, of course. And it's
also just like, the only words are like, Oh, my
God, oh, my god, like, Oh, God. Oh, and it's
me. Yeah, me. Yeah. Those are the most common expressions.
There's, there's, oh, God, can we swear on your show?
You say naughty words. Okay, holy shit. That's a common
one. And just, wow, that those are the responses that
people most often have when they have this experience. And
keep in mind that these are the expressions also of
people who maybe have spent years or decades in a
meditative practice, or even working with other powerful psychedelics and
entheogens, such as ayahuasca, that five Meo DMT opens up
this experience that is so far beyond anything else, that
I have yet to meet someone who is not radically
impressed. And just blown away once they've had this experience
yet. It's very big. Yeah. Talk to me a little
bit about, we'll see, one of the issues we face
here is because even this whole discussion of psychedelic use,
a lot of people have a stigma around it, just
because of the way they were raised and what we
were taught in school and so forth. And so some
people are like, they're into smoking pot, and they're into
psychedelics a little bit, mostly for like recreational use, and
that kind of stuff, or a little bit of spiritual
use. But what we're talking about here is a little
different than that we're talking about taking the field of
like psychotics and also combining it with the field of
non dual serious like, consciousness work and combining and then
finding like the intersection point between these two circles, so
to speak, and then kind of like really mastering that.
So we're not talking about just we're not talking about
taking like one here to find them here and then
just like okay, yeah, I got it. I got it.
That's it. Yeah. Okay, let's go back, you know, to
ordinary life. No, we're talking about like, how do you
use this substance to actually transform your entire life? You
Your entire relationship to people to things to yourself who
you think you are all these things, which most psychedelic
users, you know, I don't see doing. And in fact,
that's why there's a stigma there around it. And some
people have even criticized me for and said, you know,
Leo, you talk about not taking shortcuts and magic pills,
and here you are promoting five Meo, as like the
miracle cure for enlightenment. Like, have you lost your mind?
So, talk to me a little bit about that. Yeah,
well, it's important to understand that, first of all, psychedelics
are extremely varied. There's a wide variety of different psychedelics,
and they have different effects. I like to use the
term of Energen, when we're talking about psychedelics in the
sense that when we introduce a psychedelic into our biophysical
system, what's happening is we're altering our ability to perceive
and experience energy. And different psychedelics have different ways that
they act on the body, and therefore they have different
signatures, and they have different presentations and different ways of
accessing our energetic nature. And so the varieties of experiences
that they can engender, are very, very broad and very,
very wide. And, within that, there's, you know, there's nothing
necessarily inherently spiritual, about a psychedelic or inherently enlightening abiertas
a psychedelic because ultimately, they are just an amplification and
mirroring of the self. So someone's psychedelic experience is always
a reflection of themselves. Now, some people take psychedelics because
they want to go explore inner space, or some people
view it as astral space, or outer space, I view
it as, as an inner space as a mental projection
space. So some people, you know, think of themselves as
explorers, like, oh, I want to go see aliens and
machine elves and really weird, fantastical stuff. And you can
do that with psychedelics. And so for some people, it
doesn't really go much further than that. So it's kind
of a form of, you know, just as someone might
want to go trek across the Himalayas and challenge themselves
by climbing over mountains and encountering blizzards and snow and
cliffs and things like that, that people enjoy kind of
the thrill of taking psychedelics, that it can be this
very exciting, very novel inner voyage. It. Psychedelics also can
enhance sense, certain sensory experiences, such as music, or dancing,
or art, which is why we see people taking psychedelics,
when they go to festivals and things like that, that
it applies itself to that sort of situation. Then, there's
also a psychotherapeutic component for psychedelics that they can be
can used in conjunction with traditional psychotherapy, to help people
uncover their hidden traumas and their hidden assumptions and kind
of go through a healing process. Then we also have,
perhaps this shamanic approach where people see themselves as interacting
with entities and realms and spirits and making, you know,
contact with these entities for the purposes of gaining knowledge
and for healing. And then lastly, we have what I
would consider the non dual approach, which is something that
is not seen very much in current psychedelic circles around
the world, because there hasn't really been much of a
discussion in that area. And really, I'm one of the
only people that I'm aware of in the broader psychedelic
community across the globe, who really emphasizes a non dual
approach to working with psychedelics. So it's not something that's
really been brought out very much in contemporary culture. Now,
when we go back in time, much, much further back
in time. So we're talking 1000s of years, we go
back to the writing of the Rig Veda in Hinduism.
And this is the oldest religious texts from a currently
active religious tradition that exists on planet Earth. That's the
Rig Veda. It's the first of the Vedas, which forms
the textual foundation for, in particular Brahmanical Hinduism, and then
also later derivations of Hinduism as well. But anyway, in
the Rig Veda, at least 1/3 of the Rig Veda
is devoted to the gods Soma, and the preparation of
the soma drink, which also later gets referred to as
Amrita. And these are some of the foundational texts that
start to talk about the nature of Atman and the
nature of Brahman, and what is the relationship between the
apparently individual into individuate itself, and the fundamental nature of
reality. And so in ancient India, they're very much was
a connection between the use of psychedelics because that's what
Soma is, Soma is some form of psychedelic plant on
this somewhat mild and it could be cannabis on a
somewhat more extreme end, it could be a form of
psilocybin mushroom or even an Ayahuasca analog that we do
know that there are plenty of plants in the Indian
subcontinent that can be used as Ayahuasca analogs. And so
they're in these ancient religious texts. They talk very clearly
about them. Non dual nature of reality and how enlightenment
is about uncovering the true nature of the cell free
from attachment to illusion and beliefs and such. But many
of the currently active religious or spiritual traditions around the
world and make use of psychedelics are more within the
shamanic tradition, which has a far less emphasis on non
dual awakening and enlightenment. There, the emphasis is much more
on practical approaches to healing. And so they're kind of
like in the psychotherapeutic theater of the mind, dealing with
spirits and entities can have therapeutic value, I don't necessarily
think that it has an enlightenment value, but it has
a very strong therapeutic value for people. And so that's
where we see a lot of emphasis. And so a
lot of people in the West have approached psychedelics more
from a shamanic perspective, because that's where they see living
traditions of use of psychedelics. So they're kind of modeling
themselves after that. But their the discussion of non duality
is is rather weak. I would say there's a lot
of I would call it lip service where you hear
people say, oh, yeah, everything's one, we're all one. So
we can just love each other, whatever. So everybody says
that, I think most people who say that are just
basically parroting this phrase that they don't really understand what
that means and haven't necessarily experienced it themselves. But they
thoroughly believe it to be true. So there's Oh, yeah.
Oh, wonder just love everybody. It's all okay. The, the
people that I call hippies like to make fun of
them sometimes. Okay, yeah, great, which is why I wanted
to interview you, because you do stress the non dual
component, which I found very rare. I don't see anybody
out there talking about that. So tell us a little
bit about what your journey was like? How did you
actually use five Mao to attain liberation? Because even that
seems to be also very rare. Yeah. Well, it starts
and this is what's important for anyone who's I was
about to say chasing after enlightenment. You know, so in
Buddhism, they call it bodhichitta, that you approach the tradition,
because you have a desire to discover truth and to
be liberated. You know, why would anybody become a Buddhist
other than you're, you're born in a Buddhist country, and
so everybody's Buddhists are Buddhists. But if you actually want
to become a Buddhist and become a monk, or a
nun, or if you want to pursue enlightenment, there has
to be the desire for it. And so that's bodhichitta.
That's the awakening of the buddha mind or the Enlightenment
mind? Do you have the belief that well, there is
something that that actually is enlightenment. And that experience is
somehow fundamentally true, it's more true than my ordinary perceptions.
And that's something that I want to discover for myself.
And I think that it's very important for any kind
of non dual seeking is that you have to come
from that position of, in a sense, it's very uncompromising.
So within myself, I had this own desire, I want
to know the truth. I want to know what's really
real, and I don't, I don't want to bullshit myself.
I don't want to just fall back on comfortable beliefs.
I don't want to just believe something because I think
it's cool or because I think it's interesting or even
because I think it's right, that I'm interested in knowing
the truth for myself directly. And immediately. Now, my assumption
as an individual was, well, maybe that'll happen when I
die, maybe you know, the true nature of things will
be revealed to myself, and I'll figure it out. So
I never really held that out as a genuine possibility.
But I've certainly had that desire. Ever since I was
a little kid, you know, I grew up in a
secular, non spiritual household. But I was very curious about
well, what is this God thing that people are talking
about? And why do people believe this stuff? You know,
and I would hear stories of, especially you know, growing
up in largely Christian communities have this weird belief in
you know, the Son of God and redeeming us of
our sins. And you know, I couldn't buy any of
it is just descended like a bunch of hokey make
believe, to me, and the notion that some power sinners
and we have to redeem ourselves, so we can go
to some everlasting life, either in a place of pleasure
or place, a place of pain. It just struck me
as being ridiculous. But I was curious why people believe
this. And, you know, we'll make maybe God's real maybe
people are just wrong about what they think God is.
You know, so I got very interested in physics, I
got very interested in philosophy, I got interested in study
of comparative religion, and kind of tried out different religions
and different spiritual practices here and there found that I
resonated most with Zen Buddhism. When I first encountered that
I just felt like, oh, you know, I can accept
what these people are saying. They're not asking me really
to believe anything. They're sitting telling me to sit down,
shut up, pay attention, see what happens, and observe. Observe
the ongoing endless chatter of the mind. and just sort
of the, the nonstop bullshit parade that is inhabiting our
heads at all times. So I think that that's important,
but I had that core commitment that I'm really interested
in knowing what's real, and I'm not. I'm not going
to give my belief to anything, just because people tell
me I should believe it. So that was very important
to me. And then just to quickly circle back around
to your question, when I first encountered five Meo DMT,
and we talked about this a little bit, because we
didn't make the distinction, clear that five Meo DMT, in
case for those that are not, you know, experts on
this, it's very different from regular DMT. So it's not
an N DMT, which is the regular DMT that people
smoke and talk about five Meo, I very rarely hear
anybody talk about ever, like you're one of the only
people I've heard talk about it. So I just want
to make that point clear. Yeah, it's, you know, sometimes
when people hear five Meo DMT, they think, oh, DMT,
you're talking about DMT? Well, the majority of people when
they talk about DMT, that's n n DMT. And that's
what you find. In most versions of the Ayahuasca drink.
There are versions of iOS Oscar that are made with
five Meo DMT, but they're very, very rare. So the
vast majority is made with nn DMT. And Nn. DMT
was very much popularized by people like Terence McKenna, and
also the work of Rick Strassman and his book DMT,
the spirit molecule, and in the psychedelic underground, many people
still to this day, consider it to be the top
psychedelic compound, that there couldn't possibly be anything beyond that.
And as someone who has experienced both DMT and five
Meo DMT, I'll let you know that five Meo just
leaves nn DMT in the dust, which nn DMT is
amazing. It's very, very powerful. It's very, very strong. It
does not compare to five Meo DMT, really nothing does.
And so there's hasn't been a lot of cultural discussion
around five Meo DMT, when I first started talking about
it, and writing about it. The only other person who
was really publicly talking about it was James Orok. And
he had a book coming out right around the same
time called tryptamine. Palace, and is the first book specifically
written about five Meo DMT. And at this point, this
was back in 2008, and 2009. At this point, I
would say, I've probably written and spoken more about five
Meo DMT than anybody else, because I've written about six
or seven books in which five Meo is one of
the main subjects and I've been lecturing and giving interviews
about it for the past eight or nine years now.
So awareness is growing about it, but it's still ultimately
very low. Now, to circle back around to your question,
again, when I first experienced what I consider a full
release dose of five Meo DMT. It came at a
very significant time in my life, in that I had
been in a marriage and in a relationship for many,
many years since my ex wife and I, we first
met when I was 18 years old, so I was
rather young. And then we went on to get married,
and we had two kids. But the reality was, that
the majority of our relationship together, we weren't really together.
And I was very unhappy with that relationship. But I
covered that over with all kinds of spiritual mumbo jumbo
about how this was teaching me about non attachment and
how to overcome my desires, and teaching compassion and selflessness.
And that was all just more bullshit of the ego
trying to convince me that I shouldn't act on what
I truly felt, which was I wanted out of this
relationship. So a point came in late 2007, where I
finally fully actually admitted to myself that I knew I
was unhappy. I knew I wanted out of this relationship,
but I wouldn't even admit it to myself, let alone
anybody else. And I finally reached the point where events
conspired that I was finally honest with myself, and said,
You know what, I haven't been happy most of my
adult life. And if I don't do something about it
now, then I'm probably never gonna do anything about it.
So at that point, I ended up leaving my wife
and I left my job, and I left my kids.
And that was definitely not an easy decision to make.
But it was done within the context of this is
the truth of what's in my heart. And I'm no
longer going to lie to myself, or try and convince
myself that I should anything other than what I actually
feel and I'm going to pay attention to that. I'm
gonna follow that. And of course, you know, everybody's saying,
Oh, you have to be reasonable. You have to be
rational. You can't do that. It's like, no, no, I'm
just gonna follow my heart. You know, typical hippie line.
I'm just gonna follow my bliss. Man, I'm gonna follow
my heart. But the significance of that is that when
I first encountered five Meo DMT, I didn't have a
job, I was completely broke, I had just left this
relationship, I had moved to a new community, I didn't
know anyone, I, you know, all of my safety nets,
all of my normal structures of my life, I had
already pulled the rug out from underneath me. So in
a sense, and I had this very large child support
payment to make every month and I didn't have any
idea how I was going to make it. So I
was scared. I was just, I was ready. In a
sense, in some respects, I was ready to die, I
was ready to just give up because if the situation
that I was in was just personally very challenging, it
was very difficult. And I didn't know what was going
to come of it. So when the five MBO experience
started to unfold for me, I was just completely ready
to let go into that I was ready to die.
And that's what I thought, and that's a very common
experience, as five Meo DMT starts to unfold is that
the ego thinks, holy shit, I'm dying. And that right
there a choice is presented where the ego can say,
okay, yes. Or the ego can say, no, no, I
don't want to die. And when I encountered that as
like, okay, yeah, I'm ready. Let's just go, let's just
go. And that was the first time I had a
full non dual experience. And it's also the first time
I would say, I've encountered the true nature of God.
And that was quite profound for me, because I knew
within seconds, it was just Holy shit. It's God, this
is impossible. This is impossible. This is this can't possibly
be real. But that was the immediate recognition with as
I said, just before I even exhale, the hit is,
oh, my God, it's God, this is it. And so
yeah, that's amazing. It's amazing. How similar that estimation is,
I mean, we use the word God, but it's so
funny, but like, both of us have a very similar
background. And both of us are non religious. And in
fact, both of us are kind of like, you know,
squeamish about religion. It's like, what? No, that's the wrong
idea, right? It's anti truth. It's the opposite. It's like
the point of it is to hold you back from
discovering what's true. And what's so like twisted about it
is that the people who believe in God the most,
are probably the ones that have never actually had a
direct experience of God. No, because most, especially in Western
cultures, most beliefs about God rest on a dualistic presumption
that God is the transcendent other God is the Creator.
God is separate from creation, that God is everything that
we are not God is the ultimate authority, that we
have to submit to God that we have to obey
God that God creates rules. And so it creates this
notion of God as the ultimate authoritarian figure, who may
be considered as loving or kind or whatever else. But
it still posits the idea that God exists outside of
us or outside of reality, and somehow has control over
this thing that we call reality that God is the
ultimate boss. And he's also got like a human figure
to him, too. So it's like, whenever I think of
God is always like a being it has to have
like an anthropomorphic kind of like shape. But then yeah,
and then what's really cool is when you have the
five, Mao it's like, oh, no, it's just infinity. It's
the infinity all of reality, like, once, right? And so
that's what became clear to me in that experience is
that God is very real, in that there is one
universal consciousness and being that is, everyone and everything in
it is not transcendent in any way. It actually is
reality, that all of reality is God experiencing itself. And
it's an also I turned to the word God having
come from a Zen Buddhist tradition, that I wasn't comfortable
with the concept of buddha mind, where in a lot
of Buddhism, that pure consciousness or the buddha mind is
described as completely empty. And, you know, most Buddhism describes
itself as an atheistic religious tradition. And so here, it's
not that I'm promoting the idea of a Creator God
because this isn't a Creator God. But I felt more
comfortable with the term God than buddha mind because it
was also conscious and aware and that it is living
through the vehicle of myself as an individual human being
just as it is through you. So it's also the
first thing that came out of my mouth. So this
hit came on and the first thing and it was
just thank you God. It wasn't Thank you buddha mind.
It wasn't thank you all for that. Isn't consciousness it
was, oh my god, it's God, thank You God, I
need to express my gratitude. And I'm gonna call it
God. That's what surprised me about the experience as well
as because, like, I don't talk about God in my,
in my content, I don't talk about God in my
episodes in my videos or anything that I don't like,
though, that kind of language. I prefer, like, if I'm
rationally thinking about it, I prefer more, kind of stripped
down scientific like language. So it's just kind of like,
you know, the truth, or absolute infinity or something like
that. But what was interesting when I had the five
Meo, I just it's just like, Oh, my God, those
are the words is, yeah, like you said, it wasn't
like, oh, Buddha, I saw Buddha, or it wasn't like,
Oh, this is nothingness. It was like, No, this is
infinity. It's absolutely infinite. Yeah. And that's, that's important to
distinguish that it's not this sense of emptiness, or nothingness,
that it's the full, infinite complexity of everything eternally, and
simultaneously, and it's conscious and aware and alive. Yeah, it's
totally, totally. So you haven't asked the question, but I'll
I'll just say this that one of the reasons that
this works, the way that it does is that what
we're dealing with here, this is five methoxy, Dimethyltryptamine. And
tryptamine, is the basic building block of a human neurotransmitter.
And so actually, all mammals run off of tryptamines, in
terms of our nervous system and our conceptual system. And
as a mammal, we actually naturally produce both five Meo
DMT and nn DMT, that these two psychedelic compounds are
present inside our bodies at all times. And also nn
DMT, and five Meo DMT are very rare molecules in
that they can immediately pass the blood, the blood brain
barrier. And what that means is that when we ingest
them, especially through something like smoking or vaporizing, there's an
almost immediate translation into the full blown nature of the
experience. So that there's, you know, with many things that
we consume in our bodies, there has to be a
complex chemical process that takes place in order for our
body to utilize it. That's not the case with five
Meo or nn DMT. Basically, we introduce it to our
system. And our brain says, Yes, give me that, thank
you, that it doesn't have to go through the whole
security check system is just immediately passes. And what's happening
is these molecules, these these neurotransmitters are then activating certain
receptor sites on our brains. And, quite interestingly, someone that
I've interviewed on my own podcast, the antigenic evolution is
Dr. Thomas Ray. And he's done a wide variety of
studies looking at how different psychedelic compounds either activate or
deactivate different receptor sites in our neural networks. And what
he's found, is that five Meo DMT almost exclusively acts,
and I don't remember the exact receptor, but he says
it acts specifically on this one receptor that seems to
be most closely associated with the ego in individuated consciousness.
And so when five Meo is introduced to the system,
essentially, it holds the potential to completely overwhelm the ego,
which is unlike any other psychedelic that most other psychedelics
kind of have a broad spectrum of neurotransmitter receptor sites
that they activate. So they have, you know, you have
auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, out of body experiences, phantom limbs,
you know, all different kinds of things that people might
experience because we're activating all these different aspects of the
brain. Five MBO seems to directly target the ego and
says, nope, and just overwhelms it, which is why five
MBO is more ideally suited to helping people enter into
non dual states of awareness than any other psychedelic because,
you know, for example, nn DMT is very, very powerful,
but it heavily activates the visual processing centers of the
brain. So when someone consumes nn DMT, it's extremely visual.
I mean, it's, it's over the top visual, it's the
most high definition high resolution, visual component you can ever
possibly imagine, to the degree that many people who consume
and and DMT thoroughly believed themselves to be in alternate
universes or on other planets are interacting with aliens and
other such things. But notice, when you're in a vision,
quote, unquote, visionary state of consciousness, there's always a subject
object to reality that's taking place there because there is
a subject the self, that is observing some other some
object that is perceived to exist outside of the self.
So most reports from people using nn DMT, are still
on a very much dualistic side of things. And then
you do get very rare reports, people said, something like,
well, then suddenly, everything dissolved into a white light or
a golden light. And that I realized that I was
that light, and that light was God, and that light
was everything. So people do kind of slip into the
non dual awareness with nn DMT. But the vast majority
of it 99% of it is on the dualistic side
of things. And part of that is due to the
highly visionary nature of it, it's hard to have non
dual realization through visionary content. And, for example, we see
this in Tibetan Buddhism, which ultimately is a non dual
tradition. But it starts novices out at a highly dualistic
level, well, first, you're interacting with objects outside of yourself,
then you're learning how to visualize those objects in a
visionary space, then you're learning how to identify with the
visual content. And then when you finally get to Zog
chin to the great perfection, then you're dissolving all of
it into empty space and realizing that that is the
true nature of identity is that empty space that had
doesn't have any specific visual content. So it starts with
duality, and then gradually moves people into non duality. Where
five me Oh, just says, okay, non duality. There you
go. Yeah, I think that's one of the things that
I urge people to be cautious about if they're doing
psychedelics is that it's very easy to get lost and
trapped in the visual phenomena. And people who've never tried
a psychedelic, they'll say, Well, Leo, you know, like, you
guys are talking about this stuff. But how do you
know you're not hallucinating and just seeing stuff, which then
you come back to ordinary reality, and it's not real
anymore. And those people don't understand that actually, what we're
after here is not the visual hallucination, or any thing
that's being seen, or even thought it's a direct consciousness,
which is, which is different than anything that most people
have ever experienced in their life. Like, they don't even
have the possibility that there is such a thing as
direct consciousness, and like, what could that even be. And
so that's why five Meo is a beautiful thing is
because five Meo is very clear, it doesn't cloud your
mind, like the way mushrooms do mushrooms are kind of
cloudy, and your thoughts get kind of twisted and distorted.
And so it's kind of like, maybe I'll see something
on mushrooms, but maybe I'll kind of delude myself. Or
I'll see some weird visuals on nn DMT. But with
five Meo, my mind, my thoughts are very, very clear.
And it's just like a direct or clear, just like
a direct portal of consciousness opens up. Yeah. And it's
important, again, to emphasize that it's not about seeing or
perceiving anything, I mean, that there is a perceptual content
to it. But what's more important is the feeling and
the recognition that this is truth. And that mounts might
sound like maybe a abstract concept, but I would urge
everyone who's listening, that everybody knows the difference between when
they're lying, and when they're telling the truth? Because you
can feel it, that, you know, it might be something
as simple as, Hey, do you like my haircut? And
we say, Hey, you look great. And internally, we know
is like, I just really bolstered to that person, because
I didn't want to hurt their feelings. But actually, I
don't like their haircut at all. So you can feel
the difference. And then if if you've been lying to
yourself if you've been lying to someone, and then when
you finally admit the truth, there's this sense of release
and relief, like, Ah, finally, like when I finally admitted
to myself that actually I've been really miserable in my
marriage. When I and I always put it out on
something else, it was always somebody this is this problem,
that problem. And when I finally admitted that there was
just this opening in my heart, just like this sense
of awe, finally, you're telling the truth. And it's not
because that's objectively true, or that I can point to
this, like, oh, yeah, it's true. And I can show
you, it's like, no, I can feel it, I can
feel the truth of it. And so that's what five
Mao can do is help us enter into the state
where we just can feel like, Oh, my God, everything
really is one. Everything really is love. Everything truly is
infinite. There is nothing to be afraid of even my
own data, that everything is just the self interacting with
the self and the truth of it. You know, sometimes
people want to argue that people want to get into
arguments about whether it's duality or non duality. It's like,
look, when you enter into the non dual state, it's
just so immediately obviously clear, there's no point in arguing
past that point. And that's I'm not going to try
and prove it. To you, because it's all it's up
to you to experience it for yourself. And when you
experience it is just obvious like, Oh, yeah. Okay, this
is true. Yeah, the ones who argue are usually the
ones who just want a reason to stay, like close
minded base. Yeah, they want to argue about belief systems,
they want to say, well, that's your belief versus my
belief. And there's a very clear difference between truth and
belief. And this is one of the great things that
five Meo can help people to sort out within themselves.
Because, honestly, people are very, very confused on this issue,
especially spiritual and religious people in the new age where
people talk about, well, if you believe it, it's true,
and that we have to respect everybody's beliefs. Most beliefs
are bullshit, there's no reason to respect bullshit. It's like,
oh, you have a lovely, stinking pile of bullshit, and
you're parading it around. And please honor and respect my
bullshit, I'm sorry. But it's, it's still bullshit. And that
there's a difference between what you believe, and what's actually
true. And most of what we think is true, is
not really true. And encountering Absolute Truth is so different
than anything else, that it again, we can't really compare
it, we can't really describe it, when you feel it,
when you have the experience, you know, it, it's, and
that's why five Meo, I think it's an important tool,
let's say in our toolbox for developing ourselves, is that
it can actually very quickly and kind of rather effortlessly
reveal the difference between relative truth and absolute truth, which
is something that otherwise people would never work their way
towards it, because it just, it takes too long, it's
too hard to sit there on your ass and meditate
for, for years to get a little glimpse of it.
And even then, you know, it's, it's still very challenging.
So I think that that's why this can be such
an important tool for, for human development. But let's, let's
circle back around to how did you actually use five
Meo because, yes, you had your first mind blowing experience,
and I've had one or two of those myself. But
I don't feel liberated. So how do I now let's
say that I've tried five me a couple of times.
And now I want to like, get my liberation. How
do I get there? All right, get your liberation on
baby. Well, okay, so my own personal process, it's kind
of a long, complex story. So we're not gonna get
into that. And I'll say the same thing that I
said to you. When we spoke the other day that
I wrote a whole book about it. It's called being
infinite. And I wrote the book specifically, to address this
question of, well, how did you do it? How did
you go through this process yourself. So I'll speak a
little bit more generally, at this point, rather than get
into my own personal story. And I'd invite anybody who's
interested, my book has been infinite, it's out there on
Amazon, go check it out. But here's what I learned
very quickly, in working both with five Meo DMT, and
another other medicines during the same time period. First, I
noticed this, then in myself, and then I started looking
to see if this was true for other people, and
very quickly found that this was true. There's a fundamental
distinction. When people go into fully energetically open, non dual
states of awareness and I do qualify with fully energetically
open because that's different than say a meditative non dual
experience, which I do not qualify as energetically fully open.
When someone is energetically fully open and goes into a
non dual state of awareness and experience, what happens is
their bodies always open up with a perfectly mirrored bilateral
symmetry, where the left and right sides body of the
body always mirror each other. And nothing ever crosses this
center line of the body. So people move spontaneously, or
their bodies open up, and their hands may come together,
but they come together right here in the middle along
the center line, and then they separate and they come
back together, then you can see a transition, when suddenly
someone comes back into the ego. So they're fully immersed
in the experience and their bodies are open. And then
as soon as the ego comes in, there's some kind
of break where suddenly the left side of the body
is doing something different than the right side of the
body. For people who don't get all the way to
being fully energetically open, you give them a very powerful
psychedelic, which again, is changing the energetic experience of the
body. And you can watch them fight with it. And
you will see that there's always some kind of asymmetry
taking place in their body language when they're fighting with
it or if they're still residing in their ego. So
I learned very quickly that non dual states of awareness
coincide with balanced bilateral symmetry and the ego almost always
functions through some form of enter energetic asymmetry, which is
perfectly natural, I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, I'm
not trying to criticize it. But for example, I use
this example all the time, my glass of water is
to my right. Now, if I a subject become thirsty,
and I want my water operating with bilateral symmetry isn't
gonna get me my water, my water is over here
to the right, so I break into subject object duality
so that we can have an interaction between these two
different parts of the self. So working with psychedelics, for
the intention of achieving not only achieving non dual states
of awareness, but also working out the distortions of the
Ego means paying attention to how either symmetries or asymmetries
show up within the body. So this is kind of
the challenge that I give people is take some five
Meo DMT, and see how long you can stay perfectly
symmetrical within your body. Now, some people can ride it
all the way through. And they can do that fairly
easily. Many people, I would say the vast majority can't.
And even those who do who open up initially, and
are in this nice bilateral Senate cemetery, you will see
after 10 or 15 minutes, or for some people after
30 seconds, as soon as the ego starts to reintegrate,
they start breaking into a cemeteries. Now what can happen
is to the ego itself. And this is also just
coming out of my own experience. This is not based
on anybody else's model. This is just my own definition
of the egos. The ego itself is not a singular
thing. It's a collection of patterns of energy. So as
we're coming into ourselves, as young beings, what we're doing
is we're learning different, what we perceive as acceptable ways
of engaging our energy than here, I always make a
distinction with my dog, okay, my dog, someone knocks on
the door, my dog always barks. So there's an energetic
stimulus, and she has a natural response to that. Now,
when she does that, my dog does not then go
and say, Did I sound too much like a cat,
when I said that, or, or maybe I was too
aggressive that I wonder how that person feels about that.
Or I just don't feel like barking today that I'm
actually feeling kind of down on myself. So maybe I'll
just Wolf. Now she doesn't do that. There's an energetic
input, and she has an energetic output, and it is
completely uncensored and unstructured. So for the dog, it's completely
natural. Everything she does is completely natural human beings. Because
we have this capacity for deep self awareness that as
we're growing up, we start to observe our parents, our
society, our culture, our religion, whatever spirituality we're born into.
And we learn, oh, there are different ways people should
express themselves, there's different ways they should behave, there's different
ways they should use their bodies, there's different ways that
they should use their tone of voice. And so we
learn how to constantly edit and censor our own natural
energy. Rather than simply being as we are, that we
are. We're domesticated. It's almost like an introversion, because the
dog in that case is very just extroverted. It just
kind of like throws it out there, and it doesn't
care. And then the introvert is the one who just
kind of like goes inside and analyzes everything to death.
Right. And so what that does is that creates energetic
structures. So that rather than just saying what we actually
think, is that we learn, oh, we need to say
what's socially or culturally acceptable, and what isn't going to
piss other people off or make them feel uncomfortable. And
then we also do the same thing with our thoughts
internally. And this actually governs the entire use of our
body because our body is just an energetic vehicle. Our
thoughts are energy, our feelings, our energy, our expressions, our
energy, our body motions are the engagement of energy. And
so we create this image for ourselves, that is a
collection of these patterns of energy, where we says, where
we say, this collection of patterns is me and everything
else is not me. Okay, so we create these dualistic
divides between self and other, and then we take on
all these things. And ultimately what that does is that
creates a character or creates a persona in the same
way like for example, if I were going to play
a drunk for you right now, I had kind of
really like sloshing my words and like kind of just
moving around like that because I'm just so smashed and
I love you so much. The I just wanted I
just love you so much. Right? So that creates the
drunk character, which is different from the sober Martin character,
but it's different ways of engaging energy. Okay, so now,
what happens when we take something like five Meo DMT
is that it's so enter energetically powerful that as we've
stated, it has this infinite quality to it. All of
the patterns of our ego are all are, by definition
are limited, they're not infinite. So we have the opportunity
to actually overwhelm all of the patterns of the ego
with it. I call it energetics shock therapy for the
ego, okay? If we introduce so much energy, that the
ego just says, I give up, I can't maintain my
sense of self. And so it reaches the point where
the ego can choose to surrender, and it's very important,
I really stress this, no psychedelic can ever violate your
free will, because it's just an amplification of yourself, there's
nothing else and no one else there, it's just you.
So you get to choose if you're gonna go all
the way or not, that if you choose No, you
can fight with it. And you can actually maintain the
patterns of the ego, it's very, very difficult. It's very
horrifying and terrifying. So I don't recommend it, it's much,
much better, if you just say, Hey, I give up.
It's kind of like getting on a roller coaster. And
once you get on the top of the roller coaster,
like screaming and crying to get someone to let you
off, you can have a much better time if you
just say we and go for it, and relax. But
anyway, it can deconstruct the patterns of the ego. Now,
because we have these patterns of the ego, they tend
to create holdings and distortions of energy within the individual,
which again, my dog doesn't have. I mean, she's just
clear and clean. If she wants to bark, she barks
people, if they want to bark, they don't bark, they
do something else. And that creates all these blocks within
the vehicle of the individual. So this is one reason
why when people take psychedelics, they do a lot of
purging, a lot of throwing up, or maybe screaming and
laughing and crying or stripping off all their clothes or
having diarrhea, it's it's not the actual substance coming out
of them. That's important. It's that it's releasing stored energy.
And vast majority of people are holding stored energy in
their abdomens, because this is where we react energetically to
fear and withholding and feelings of needs of protection versus
being vulnerable. So working with psychedelics can help us to
clear out the stored baggage that we've created for ourselves.
And I guarantee you, everybody's got it. So there's no
judgment there, everybody is just walking around with a huge
pile of shit inside them that they could just let
go of, but they don't know how to do it.
Because most of the choices that we've made regarding the
structure of our ego comes from when we're very small
children. And we make choices that I'm going to behave
this way and not this way, I'm going to be
like this and not like that. So we're not consciously
aware of these patterns now. So first of all, five
MBO can get you all the way out of the
ego. So suddenly, you can experience like, oh, no, this
is the real, this is the real deal, this infinite
Nandu Wilson, purse perception, but then the structures of the
ego kind of close back in on the person, I
do this with my hands, it goes, clink, clink, clink,
clink, clink, and these structures come back in. And that
can actually help someone become aware of, Oh, I've created
myself as this kind of victim, or I've created myself
as this kind of spiritual seeker, or I've created myself
as this kind of Guru, or I've created myself as
a musician, or as a writer, or as an happy
person or as an unhappy person. And these are all
the patterns I've established around that belief. And at the
dualistic level, then you start to perceive, and this is
how I've created the characters of the people that I've
interacted with in my life, to help prop up the
story of the character that I've created for myself. So
it's actually all a self constructed narrative that perfectly fits
and matches my own beliefs about myself, and what I
think I deserve, and what I think I'm worthy of,
or how I should be treated. So it can increase
levels of self awareness. But see, the danger is then
that people immediately start engaging in those patterns. So here's
where I tell people rest in cemetry. And what you
find is that suddenly one side of your body starts
to become very uncomfortable, like, oh, because I want to
engage this pattern that actually engages the left side of
my body or the right side of my body. And
that by resting in cemetry, it allows the distortions created
by these patterns to come to the surface. Where then
if you're working with a skilled facilitator, can help you
actually work out the stuck energy and can actually dissolve
that pattern. So that then you become free to choose
something else for yourself or ideally, choose to live in
no particular patterns and learn how to be so acutely
aware of energy, that you just go with what is
as it presents itself, without ever trying to control it
without ever trying to edit it. In other words, people
learn how to simply be themselves outside of the illusory
construct of the ego. And then then rather than the
ego being a prison, then I liken it to a
garment of clothing that either comes on or goes off
or you can change it as necessary. And actually, it
all Functions automatically. So you do not ever need to
do anything, you just learn how to be true. And
that's the biggest thing is that commitment to the non
dualistic commitment to truth. And that means being committed to
truth, personally, of not committing our minds to things that
we don't know for certain are true, which is the
vast majority of everything. It means being committed to expressing
ourselves openly and honestly. And clearly, it means not backing
away from what we truly think or feel. And that
can be kind of harsh for people sometimes, because a
lot of culture is based on, you know, the white
lie, the the casual lies that we constantly tell ourselves
and other people to help society function and get along.
So we all although they'll get pissed off at each
other all the time, or whatever it is. But it
means that we're wrapped in layers and layers and layers
of lies, and we all get pissed off at each
other in the end still. That's the thing is that
telling people, what they want to hear, helps in the
immediate situation to help smooth things over at the social
level, it never helps anyone in the long run, yes.
So the process of non dual liberation means you need
to commit yourself to becoming aware of yourself of the
choices you are making of the energy that you're experiencing,
that you're either being true to, or that you are
somehow compromising or editing. And that's a process. And so
the enlightenment experience, the non dual experience helps with that,
because you need to have the non dual experience somewhere
in there. So you can actually see what's really going
on. But then the rest of it is fine tuning
and becoming more and more aware of the cloak of
the ego and how you've constructed a character for yourself.
And the problem with the ego is that it convinces
us that we are the character that we're playing. But
that's not true. It's just a character that we're playing
this one universal consciousness is playing billions of characters simultaneously.
That's who and what we truly are, is the universal
consciousness. So in different bodies, we inhabit different characters. But
it's, it's just a character, there's one actor playing billions
of characters simultaneously. So it's learning how to loosen the
grip that we have on the dualistic side of our
identity and rest within the infinite nature of the non
dual nature of the self. So basically, if somebody wanted
to apply this, everything that you just described, if someone
wanted to apply that theory, then what they could do
is they could smoke or snort some five Meo, they
could have this experience of absolute consciousness and truth. Infinity,
and then they could see like, oh, yeah, okay, so
there's something greater at work here than just myself, and
I've got this ego that's kind of playing itself out.
And then the ego will come back, and it'll kind
of close back down and it'll, you'll come back, you're
not going to be enlightened, you're just going to come
back, and you're probably going to be pretty much like
you were before maybe a little bit more open minded.
And then if you keep doing that over and over
and over again, on a weekly, monthly sort of basis,
and you keep examining how your ego is coming back
and closing down and ego is distorting and manipulating and
doing all this kind of stuff with your energy and
your thoughts and your beliefs and it's trying to cling
then after you know, a long process of that, then
maybe one day they reach a point where describe what
happened with you, where's the ultimate place that you kind
of reached? Yeah. So first, I'll just say a little
bit more about the process that this process also involves
lots of vibrating in the body, because again, people are
kind of closed off energetically. And so a lot of
shifting and opening needs to take place there. So most
people who go through this, they spent a lot of
time vibrating and shaking. It also might in tail, not
being able to speak in your natural language for periods
of time where people are just babbling incoherently glossolalia kinds
of phenomenon. It also involves a lot of toning and
vocalizing from people screaming, yelling, laughing, crying, some people have
orgasms, some people shoot themselves. There's lots of purging that
takes place. Because again, the ego has spent a lifetime
trapping this energy in and it needs to sort itself
out and that can be mentally, extraordinarily confusing, can be
emotionally tumultuous. Most people hide their true emotions from themselves,
and they have to encounter them fully. And the ego
the monkey mind is constantly going to be trying to
make a story out of it and say, Oh, well,
here's the story for you. So people get Messiah complexes
or they get victim complexes or they start to think
Oh, Well, maybe I'm this really powerful shaman or something
like that. And so they create stories and narratives for
themselves. And the ego wants to cling on to that.
So it's always like the Zen idea of look, the
monkey mind is going to be swinging from tree to
tree, your job is just to observe it. You don't
attach yourself to any of the thoughts and you don't
try and block any of the thoughts either. Let them
come, let them go. Let the stories come, let them
go. Now, for me personally, what happened was that there
was there was God on one side, and there was
Martin on the other side, and then going through this
process, the line between the two got blurrier and blurrier
and blurrier. Which of course, was very confusing for Martin,
because, because the ego is trying to think well, then
who am I? What am I? What does this mean
for me? And so that's tricky, because that's where the
ego can say, oh, yeah, that's me. I'm it. It's
all me. Right? It's not you. It's me, because it's
me. So the ego can can you know, co opt
any of this stuff that it wants to? And we
see this in religious traditions all the time and you
know, people proclaiming Oh, yeah, I'm, I actually am the
second coming of Jesus. Right. That's where the ego is,
is it? Oh, yeah, it's me and creates a story
about it, which is just more bullshit or I actually
am Maitreya. I'm the future Buddha. Or I am the
hidden the mom, you know, all the major religious traditions
have this. Or when we have Hindu gurus, they mean
that they're the avatar of Vishnu or whatever. Again, it's
just its story. Its ego, feel free not to listen
to it. Okay. Now, for me personally, when the final
crack came, because my ego was trying to understand all
of this, and what does it mean? And is it
really real? Or am I just bullshitting myself? It when
it when my ego finally just said, Okay, this is
reality, this is God, I'm God, everything is God, this
is just just just what it is. When I finally
just accepted that it was like a switch got thrown.
And as I described to you the other day, it
was essentially like I was tripping five Meo DMT, all
the time for several months on end, where it was
literally like, I just had a pipe right here next
to me was just taking hit after hit. But curiously,
at times that infinite energy would come down, and everything
would come back, and so sort of a dualistic perception,
and then the Martin character would reappear. And this would,
initially it only happened when I went to the University
to go lecture, where my entire mannerisms, my tone of
voice, the way that I speak, everything shifts when I'm
outside of my ego. So like, right now, I'm talking
to you through the Martin character. And this is what
I use for 99% of my social interaction, because that's
my character. And I don't have a problem with that.
But initially, I describe it as you know, when little
kids, when lots of little kids figure out, they can
actually take their clothes off, they prefer to be naked.
Well, when I really crack, that's what happened, where I
would just energetically the ego is just off all the
time, unless it was socially appropriate for me to have
the clothing on, like when I went and go read,
go teach at school. And so there was this tremendous
energetic release. And it was just kind of freedom. And
I also thought at that time that I probably wasn't
ever going to sleep again, because I'd be lying in
bed at night, it was like I was just tripping.
Just constantly just non stop visual explosions and fractals and
mandalas. And just infinite infinite infinite and stars and galaxies.
And so I thought, Okay, well, I guess I'm never
gonna sleep again. But then that took a couple of
weeks to die down. And eventually I was I was
sleeping again. And then eventually, after a few months, it
was like I was resting more within the ego. Because
it is first it's like, I just got to take
this thing off, just be gone, be gone. But then
it's like, okay, now I can be here. And so
that's, that's kind of where I'm at now, where I
wear it most of the time. But the difference is,
I will never again, ever because I am conscious of
how it works. Now, I will never put myself in
the prison of the ego, that I'm more than happy
to play the character of Martin through this particular vehicle.
I've got no problem with that. But the character will
never again trap me the way that it had trapped
me before because I don't identify with it. It's just
no I'm just expressing myself to this particular character. And
when I don't need this character, the character just boom
just disappears and I'm totally comfortable with that. So it
used to be a very dramatic there's Martin on one
end and then there's Wow, there's the infinite nature on
the other end. And now it's just more of this
okay egos coming off or going into non dual. Okay,
non dual. Very good. Then now we're coming back into
duality. Okay, come back and do two hours. So the
transitions are very, very smooth. It's not this disjuncture, and
honestly, this is what I've seen with a lot of
people with five Meo DMT experience is that they that
they have what I Call a jump, they jump from
the ego all the way into non duality, and then
boom, they're trapped back in the ego again. Whereas ideally
is learning how to do this in a way that
there's a smooth transition open and then a smooth transition
closed. And then it's not this disjuncture, and for many
people who experienced five Meo DMT, the non dual part
of their experience is a complete blank, it's a white
out, they don't have any recollection of it. And that's
very, very common, that they can remember their ego saying,
Oh, shit, and then they remember their ego saying, Well,
fuck, I'm back what just happened. But during the non
dual part, zero recognition, zero recollection of what that was.
So learning how to be self aware is how to
be aware of our energy in all states, not just
the closed duel, but also the infinite non dual and
how to ride the wave all the way open, and
all the way closed again, and stay relaxed, centered, calm,
and present through it all. And when you can do
that, you're golden. And if you can do that, through
every moment of your life of every day, because we're
always confronted with a choice, am I going to freak
out and try and control things are just relax and
go with what is we make that choice every moment,
every moment. And if you can do that 100% of
the time, you're golden, you're done. And so to be
clear, here, we're not really talking about using this substance
just as a magic pill. Because I don't want to
get to have people to get the wrong impression where
it's like, oh, yeah, I'll just take some substance. And
then like, I don't have to do any more personal
development work. I don't have to, I don't have to
introspect, I don't have to, like, think about myself and
my patterns and my story, you know, it's actually quite
the opposite. What you're saying is, the substance is actually
the thing that opens you up, to really get into
the really juicy, deep work that has to be done,
that normally people don't want to do or aren't even
capable of doing because their eyes really haven't been open
to these possibilities. Like it's, it's really taking and pouring
fuel on the sort of personal development journey from pouring
fuel on that whole thing. And then just like speeding
it all up. Yeah. And it's, it is not like
you get to pass over stuff. It's like, the best
metaphor I have is like it's giving birth to yourself
repeatedly. Now, and I mean, that in the sense of
the trauma and difficulty and intensity of giving birth, I
have three kids, I was present for all births. And
that man, that's tremendous. And this is what it's like
to use medicine, these angiogenic medicines to go through this
process of birthing yourself as the being that you've always
been, it means tearing yourself open from the inside out
and cleaning out and looking into every last little secret
hidden nook and cranny of your mind and your belief
system and clearing it out. You don't get to jump
over anything. And it's deeper and more effective than any
other methodology. And it's extraordinarily challenging. There's nothing easy about
it at all. I mean, people think, oh, yeah, you're
taking a shortcut, or you're just taking the easy way
out. So you do not have a clue what you're
talking about. If you think this is easy. UVI if
you think this is some kind of shortcut, it's just
accelerated, you still have to go the same distance, in
a sense, you just move into a faster in a
way that you are more acutely aware of what's going
on. And there's also the potential for people to radically
delude themselves through this process as well. So it takes
vigilance I mean, you really have to be vigilant with
yourself or else you just often lala land in your
in hippie bullshit New Age, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, it's it's a tricky path to walk. And it's
funny because last time we talked you said, you know,
oh, you know, after five me oh, you know, other
psychedelics. I started asking about like, what about mushrooms? What
about salvia, what about other stuff, and you're like, Well,
other psychedelics get potentiate it after five Meo? And I
was kind of like, Yeah, okay. And then I took
some mushrooms a few days ago, actually. And that was
the first substance I've ever taken after my five Meo
experience a few weeks ago, and it's like, wow, the
mushroom experience was totally different than and it was, like
gut wrenching this time because I had a couple of
mushroom experience where they were just beautiful, like, very nice,
very kind of like walking through lala land. You know,
it's just like, heavenly. And here I take this one
and it's like, what the hell is this? This is
not this is not what mushrooms were before. Took mushrooms.
It's like wow, this is so deep. And also a
lot of like, a lot of shit starts coming up
to my own shit. It's like oh, you know? Oh,
there it is. My arrogance you know, the mushroom gods
are punishing me for My arrogance, you know, thinking that
I got it all down. And that was a very
tough trip. And you know, like very emotionally, very emotionally
stressful. Yeah. So So here's so here's the opportunity, when
no matter what arises, you rest in symmetry. And here
body language becomes important that I, the ideal body language
says, I'm open. I'm relaxed. I'm embracing my experience, and
I'm letting myself be vulnerable. And even though you just
want to curl up into the fetal position and whimper
in the corner, you open up to it, and then
all of a sudden, you're throwing up and or whatever,
and it's releasing, and then you feel oh, I let
it go. It scared the shit out of me. But
I let it go. I moved through that. And that's
what I mean by the you are birthing yourself. And
it's, man, it's messy. And, and oftentimes, there is sort
of this sort of this flirtatious seductive quality with psychedelics,
where people think, oh, man, that was just so beautiful.
And see, then, then, then you think, oh, man, I've
got this down, I can just relax. And it's like,
okay, now I've got you. Now we're gonna rake you
over the coals because your defenses are down. And that
happens. It's very, very common, where people encounter a psychedelic,
and they think, Okay, well, this is cool, I can
ride with this. But after the smiley introduction, you know,
the courtship is over, it's like, Okay, now we're getting
down to the dirty work. And it's grueling. And it,
it is so challenging. But it's worth it because it
clears you out in a way that, really nothing else
will that because they're working on us, mentally, energetically, emotionally,
physically, it's crossing all the levels. Whereas you know, when
we go for psychotherapy, we're mostly dealing with mental content,
or emotional content. Or if you're getting bodywork, than you're
getting somatic therapy. Or if you're doing a special, you
know, cleanser diet, then you're getting gastrointestinal stuff. But this
is, this is full spectrum across the board. And so
that's what really allows all of this stuff to move
in a way that's extremely efficient. Again, it's not a
shortcut, it's just more efficient. Yeah, it's amazing. The first
time I did five, and well, not the first time,
but the first time I got my, my big breakthrough
is, like I noticed it was very characteristically unique about
it is that like, it kind of melted my whole
body. Like it wasn't just a mental thing. And it
like it melted my heart, it melted. Like, I felt
like I was like energy was just like going through
my whole it was that whole body orgasm kind of
experience. Which is amazing. And also what you're talking about,
you know, kind of the body cemetery. Like when I
was going through this tough mushroom experience, I remembered your,
your insights about that. And I'm like, Okay, I gotta,
I gotta open up, open up. And I was trying
to surrender to it. But also like, it was difficult
to surrender. And there were points where I didn't surrender
properly. And, and I noticed, like, during some parts of
that trip was like a four hour trip. But like,
I would be sitting on my couch in this very,
totally twisted up manner, like, twisted up in like grotesque
ways. Just like my legs crossed, like twice or three
times over, like in a pretzel. What is this? So
Martin was talking about, yeah, that's literally what happens. See,
because we're dealing, we're dealing with energy here. And the
left and right sides of the body are actually processing
energy differently. And so when. So when you're really energetically
open, and say your legs cross, it's like taking to
live wires, where then they start, the energy starts to
wrap around itself. And people can actually experience really severe
cramps, when this takes place. At lower levels of energy,
you'd never notice it. But the the higher level, the
entheogen, the more likely these kinds of phenomenon are going
to take place. And so part of the advice that
I tell people, because it happens, people, you know, the
ego pattern engages and people don't realize that they're engaging
in. But whenever you become aware that you're twisted up,
or you're asymmetrical, you don't beat yourself up, because the
ego does that as well. It's like, oh, you're doing
it wrong. It's like, look, just shut up, okay? I'm
just becoming aware. Okay. So when you become aware of
it, then you bring yourself back into symmetry. And then
the same thing goes for, I have this sort of
mantra of do nothing, do absolutely nothing. As soon as
you become aware that you're doing something, because it's usually
a projection of the ego where people think, Oh, I'm
healing the sacred feminine of the universe, or whatever it
is that you think that you're doing. When you become
aware that you're doing it, stop it, go back to
a neutral position, and just rest. Feel your breath. When
you say Do nothing you mean during the trip? Do
nothing. Like don't distract yourself with with stuff. Yeah. Don't
distract yourself either with physical activity or mental stories or
trying to figure things out or accomplish them. Thanks. So
that again, this is the non dual approach. Now many
people use psychedelics and they want to use him as
part of a religious ritual. And they're doing things during
the religious ritual for the spirits, or God, or whatever
it is, or singing hymns and chanting prayers and trying
to heal people. Well, that's more at the practical level
of psychedelics, that's not the non dual approach. If you're
if you want to approach them non dualistic Aliy, you
have to learn how to do nothing, because the ego
is a chronic busy body. It loves ritual and ceremony
and prayer because it makes it feel like it's doing
something that it should, it's all ego, it's all attachment,
it's all illusion, learn how to rest in doing nothing.
And when you when you actually do nothing, when you
accomplish that. The weird thing is that then the body
starts to spontaneously act on its own. And then people
might even spontaneously start to speak on their own. And
even the ego can be there's who said that? That's
those words just came out of my body. But I
didn't say that who said that? Okay. And so the
more we relaxed the ego, the more our genuine energy
is able to express itself both physically, mentally, emotionally and
verbally. And then then the doing, it's like in Taoism,
that they say the Dow is sage accomplishes everything, by
doing nothing. In my opinion, that's exactly what's intended. Yeah,
my audience is pretty familiar with it. Because I've been
pushing the idea of do nothing, not only I'm not
not specifically during tripping, but like, just in ordinary life,
like people are way too busy, they're distracting themselves with
all sorts of useless stuff. So I always talk about
kind of minimalizing your life, and just have more room
just to sit into, to kind of think or even
don't think just sit, just sit and see what happens.
Because we don't do that anymore. Yeah. And also, it
applies to activities as well. So the example that I
give here is, you know, I'm a musician. So I
spent a lot of time making music. And that's obviously
a form of doing something. But my approach to music
is, generally when I record a song, I have no
idea what the song is gonna sound like, I've never
played it before, I don't have any particular intention, and
I sit down in front of the computer. And then
I just start to do stuff. And whatever sounds good
to me, I just keep following that. And then three
or four hours later, I'll have a complete song done.
But it's not because I sat down and said, I
want to make a song that sounds like this, this
is what I'm going to do. Because that's a form
of doing where we set an intention, and say I
have a particular outcome that I'm trying to achieve. That
becomes a task of the ego. You know, like, and
many musicians, many performers know this, that the harder you
try to put on a good performance, the worse it's
going to be. Yeah, yeah, you gotta flow with it,
you've got to flow with it. And so that's a
form of, again, in Taoism, this is wu wei, this
is actionless action, that you're letting the action take care
of itself, then you become the vehicle for the expression
of that. But it's not based on your intention or
desire. It's just, Okay, I'm just gonna let it happen.
And the more we can do that, throughout all of
our interactions throughout the day, the more at peace we
are, and the more present and centered and clear we
are. It's, it's just that simple. So by learning how
to do nothing, you can do everything that you need
to do without ever getting in your own way. And
that just makes life so much sweeter and richer and
freer. Yeah, that's the goal. The goal is liberation, the
goal is freedom from your own mental prison. Okay, great.
Well, I hope you guys took that to heart. There's
a lot of stuff here. And what I liked about
this conversation is that it connected with a lot of
things that I normally talk with you guys about anyways.
So hopefully, you can see how we're talking about psychedelics.
But we're also really talking about personal development, we're talking
about self actualization, we're talking about how to let go
of your ego and to, to discover your authentic self,
your real authentic self. time in your life. Yeah. And
that that real authentic self is a universal self. You
know, sometimes when that language gets used, people think, Oh,
well, I want to find who I truly am and
what my calling and purpose is. ego, ego ego. The
true self is the universal self. It's the same for
everyone. So if you think that, oh, well, if I
if I get in touch with my true self, I'll
know what my purpose in life is. No, you won't.
Your only purpose in life is to be that's all
that you're ever doing. Anyway, that's all that the universal
consciousness of God is doing is just being because that's
all that there is to do. There's there's no goal
to be achieved. There's no you know, there's nothing to
do just enjoy yourself. It just exists existence is here
to exist. Yeah, so just be it's cool. All right,
like the dude, the dude abides, the dude abides. That's
good. All right, so we're gonna wrap it up here.
Let's let viewers know how they can get in touch
with you and some of your work, because you do
have quite a bit of work out there. First of
all, I want to let folks know that you do
host the annual psychedelics conference. Are you still hosting that
for next year? Yeah, so that's the exploring psychedelics conference
that happens at Southern Oregon University in the spring and
coming up in 2017. It will be in I think
it's the very beginning of June. This last year, we
had about maybe 500 participants, we had 35 different speakers
from all around the world. It's quite exciting. So that
was our third year. So we're going into our fourth
year. So that's something I've been organizing. I also organized
smaller events locally here in Ashland, like just this past
weekend, we had the entheogenic wisdom forums at the Peace
village festival, and I had seven different speakers for that.
So I have my podcast, which is the antigenic evolution
podcast, which has recordings from the conferences are available there,
as well as interviews that I've done and lectures that
I've given. Your podcast is great. I really recommend you
guys check out his podcast because I've been listening to
it. And he has a lot of like experts that
he interviews from the psychedelic community, and not just hippy
experts, but like doctors, PhDs, people who are really doing
serious research on this using psychedelics for therapeutic purposes, as
well as for developing consciousness for spiritual purposes. So a
lot of really great information there. I'll have links to
that stuff below, in the description, so you guys can
go click on those. And also tell us about your
books. Yeah, so I'm quite a prolific writer. I think
I've written like 17 books or something like that, you
can find pretty much all of them on Amazon or
Kindle the iBook store. So my web page, just Martin
ball.net. I write both fiction and nonfiction. Quite a big
fan of fiction writing. So I like to write fantasy,
science fiction, epics, things like that all with a psychedelic
band. I'm also a musician so you can find my
music out there. It's available on iTunes, and I'm also
an artist. So I've got a lot of visionary art
that's out there as well. So I just like to
express myself. Great. Yeah, I love some of your fractal
psychedelic art is really beautiful. Cool. All right, Martin. Well,
thank you for your time. Thanks for educating us about
five MEO and keep leading the cause because I think
that this is something that really has a lot of
potential to transform people in the future. Excellent. Well, it's
been a pleasure speaking with you and thanks for having
me on your show.
