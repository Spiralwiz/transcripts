            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/S3FE9_204Yg' target='_blank'>The 64 Most Fascinating Questions A Human Can Ask</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Existential Curiosity and Personal Development</b>: Leo Gura of Actualized.org encourages a deeper interest in existential truth and the exploration of profound questions, which he believes play a crucial role in personal happiness, meaning in life, development, and growth. He notes most individuals haven't been introduced to these areas of inquiry due to societal discouragement.
</li><li><b>Metaphysical Questions</b>: Leo raises perplexing questions about existence, such as why it exists and what it means for something to be existent. He interrogates the structure of reality, asking why it adheres to the laws of physics and if the structuring could be different. He also explores the relationship between consciousness and matter, probing whether one arises from the other.
</li><li><b>Pragmatic Metaphysical Questions</b>: He questions the fundamental building blocks of our reality- matter, energy, space, and time. He demystifies the universe by questioning what is outside of it and what existed before the Big Bang, also asking how material and immaterial groups interact or influence one another. 
</li><li><b>Exploring Boundaries of Possibility</b>: Leo introduces concepts such as what governs the possible and impossible within the universe, questioning who or what determines these limits and boundaries. In addition, he delves into the notion of emergent properties and who or what sets their characteristics and behaviors.
</li><li><b>Epistemic, Self, and Consciousness Questions</b>: Beyond these metaphysical questions, Leo introduces additional categories including epistemic (relating to knowledge), questions about the self, and questions about consciousness.
</li><li><b>Concept of Emergent Properties</b>: Emergent properties, such as consciousness, cannot be defined or understood based solely on the properties of the individual components. The video raises questions about why consciousness arises at the level of neurons, not at the level of atoms or molecules. 
</li><li><b>Object Identification</b>: The video asks what truly determines an object. It challenges the idea that a human is a single entity, posing whether we might be considered multiple objects, given the multitude of cells, bones, and systems comprising us.
</li><li><b>Reality Structures and Scale</b>: The video suggests that reality has different scales, from atoms to galaxies to the universe. It ponders whether there's a bottom or top most scale, or if these scales extend infinitely up or down.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Universe Evolution</b>: Leo raises the question of whether the observed evolution of the universe serves a purpose or end-goal, or is simply a product of random evolution.
</li><li><b>Existence of External Reality</b>: The video questions whether an objective, external reality actually exists, or if reality only consists of individual first-person experiences.
</li><li><b>Concept of God</b>: Leo explores the varied perceptions of God and the logical inconsistencies that arise with certain definitions or beliefs. This scrutiny applies to both those who believe in a higher power and those who don't.
</li><li><b>Definition of Thoughts</b>: Despite everyone acknowledging the existence of thoughts, Leo points to their difficult nature to define in concrete terms. Thoughts are neither physical nor chemical, creating an enigma. 
</li><li><b>Start of Life</b>: Leo raises existential questions about the origin of life. Despite understanding evolution, how life first began is still puzzling. 
</li><li><b>Epistemology</b>: How we know the validity of what we believe is an interesting field. Questions arising in this section revolve around what we can know for certain, how we justify beliefs, and whether belief in God is an unintelligent coping mechanism or not.
</li><li><b>Religious belief and potential delusion</b>: Leo questions why people follow different religions and how they can believe their religion to be the most accurate, while acknowledging the potential illusionment by their faith. He asserts that feelings of certainty do not guarantee truth and can often lead to trouble historically.
</li><li><b>Good vs Bad, Right vs Wrong</b>: Leo explores the disagreement and diversity of opinions on morality within families, religions, political parties, and cultures at large. He challenges whether these concepts are an objective truth or a construct of the human mind.
</li><li><b>Intelligent people and self-delusion</b>: Leo questions how even educated and intelligent people can get deluded, emphasizing that formal education and intelligence do not guarantee the avoidance of delusion.
</li><li><b>Self-bias and indoctrination</b>: Leo asks listeners to question their own self-bias and the possibility that their beliefs and understanding of the world are shaped by their egoic needs. He also raises the probability of indoctrination and encourages viewers to acknowledge and scrutinize their beliefs.
</li><li><b>Limits of science, mathematics, and rationality</b>: He invites viewers to question the validity of science, mathematics, and rationality as tools for understanding the world and to ponder their potential limits and biases. 
</li><li><b>Biases and blind spots of humanity</b>: Leo highlights the potential biases and blind spots in human understanding, attributable to factors like culture, species, rationality, mathematics, and science bias.
</li><li><b>Levels of Understanding</b>: He discusses the different levels of understanding across species and questions whether humans necessarily have the highest level of understanding. He suggests the possibility of higher intelligences that could have superior comprehension.
</li><li><b>Reliability of Experts and Models of Reality</b>: Leo raises the question of who to trust when it comes to experts and how to determine the most accurate model of reality among various existing ones.
</li><li><b>Truth & Understanding</b>: He concludes this section by exploring the concept of 'truth' and 'understanding', suggesting that they are two different phenomena, and questioning their nature and relationship.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Ultimate Truth</b>: We often have a sense of understanding, but the origin of this understanding is challenging to discern. The distinction between correct and incorrect understanding is also unclear. While we often reference minor truths such as our physical attributes or species, the ultimate truth of reality and the universe is elusive. It challenges us to question whether we can apprehend this truth given our cognitive limitations or whether it lies beyond our human comprehension. 
</li><li><b>Acquiring Knowledge</b>: Questions arise about the best methods for acquiring knowledge. These include listening to experts, reading extensively, conducting science experiments, philosophical investigation, meditation, religious practices, or immersing oneself in various cultures. However, it remains uncertain whether reality can truly be understood by humans given our psychological and biological limitations. 
</li><li><b>Self Identity and Existence</b>: Issues about our sense of self and existence present multiple puzzles. First, we have the seeming self-evidence of our existence, and if we accept this, we must then define what exactly we are. Is our being defined biologically, or other parameters? The arbitrariness of what we claim as parts of ourselves (e.g., body parts, thoughts), our sense of ego, and the roles we perceive for ourselves in reality challenges our concepts of identity and existence.
</li><li><b>Control of Thoughts</b>: The uncertainty of what thought will emerge next questions the belief that we control our thoughts. This becomes more evident when considering obsessive thinking or creative insights that appear to come unbidden. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness</b>: Conundrums surrounding consciousness include its elemental nature, the hard problem of how physical objects perceive each other, unity of our senses to form a seamless perception, unexplored higher levels of consciousness comparable to those in other creatures or beings, and the implications non-ordinary states of consciousness (e.g., psychedelic, religious, meditative states) present. 
</li><li><b>Separation and Independence of Consciousness</b>: Consciousness seems divided into isolated entities, adding to the mystery. Considerations arise about the creation of artificial consciousness, the potential splitting or joining of consciousness, and whether inanimate matter possesses consciousness. These lead to pondering whether consciousness is an emergent property of more complex entities or a fundamental component of the universe.
</li><li><b>The Undiscovered Truth About Consciousness</b>: In the video, Leo poses the question of whether consciousness, if accepted as a fundamental entity, should theoretically have specific laws which are currently missing in our physics equations. Gura brings up the puzzling nature of qualia, noting the strange phenomenon of mentally categorizing emotions and sensations linked to different combinations of neurons. 
</li><li><b>A Commitment to Deep Existential Questions</b>: Gura encourages viewers to dedicate their lives to pondering and answering profound existential questions. He argues that the quality of questions one contemplates directly impacts their lifes quality and degree of self-actualization. He warns against disinterest in such questions, which he suggests can lead to superficial lives absorbed by lower-level concerns.
</li><li><b>Value of Self-reflection and Doubting of Beliefs</b>: Leo underlines the role of introspection and self-skepticism in personal growth. He advocates for thorough questioning of beliefs and ideologies, emphasizing the self-transformative potential of this process.
</li><li><b>Link Between Philosophy and Psychology</b>: Gura stresses the ancient connection between philosophy and psychology, insinuating that a deep psychological affinity is crucial for the pursuit of answers to pivotal existential questions. 
</li><li><b>Challenges and Importance of Independent Exploration</b>: He warns against mental gymnastics for the sake of it while promoting sincere introspection into the profound existential questions outlined. Gura emphasizes the need for independent exploration aimed at self-improvement rather than turning to external sources that offer easy answers.
</li><li><b>Relevance of Exploring Existential Questions</b>: Leo insists that engaging in existential questions can transform lives. He attributes depression, lack of motivation, and susceptibility to delusions to a lack of concern for these deep questions. According to Gura, humans have the unique ability to introspect and contemplate existence, and wasting this ability on trivial matters could lead to unfulfilling lives.
</li><li><b>Potential of Self-Actualization Through Questioning</b>: Leo asserts that many of the questions on his list can be answered if they are examined with depth and sincerity. He believes that to truly answer these questions, a person will need to delve into and deconstruct themselves. He encourages his viewers to take on this journey earnestly, suggesting their life may transform in the process.
</li><li><b>Final Appeal and Encouragement</b>: In conclusion, Leo invites his viewers to take his advice seriously by researching, reading, contemplating, and seeking guidance from teachers, retreats, and workshops for personal growth. He emphasizes the transformative potential of pondering deep existential questions, arguing that it enables a fuller understanding and experience of life.
