[Music] you in this episode we're gonna explore what is
ideology this is something that I've thought about and studied
for a very long time it's part of what I
call epistemology or theory of knowledge how do we know
anything how do you know that what you know is
actually true and from really over a decade of studying
this and pondering this topic for a long time my
all my ideas are starting to kind of get crystallized
and congealed and distilled and really all of it one
day I remember I was just thinking like well what
what's the essence of what I'm trying to understand here
with epistemology and it was just so simple and so
clear and it just came to me as just one
simple rule for life and here's the rule the number
one rule for life especially when it comes to knowledge
and it's this don't be ideological that's it that's the
whole rule don't be ideological but of course the trick
is unpacking that because there's so much to that simple
little statement but it's an extremely powerful statement and because
I myself have thought about this for a long time
contemplated this and I have many examples in my own
mind that I can bring forth of why this is
true and what it really means for me I can
just tell myself don't be ideological in some situation and
then that opens me up to then overcoming a certain
obstacle that I might have had and so I want
to help you to be able to do that too
so we're gonna spend quite a bit of detail here
going into detail unpacking this statement so that then you
can just once you understand what it really means and
why it means what it means then you can just
have those four words and you could say them to
yourself for the rest of your life and it's gonna
be a very liberating for you and you will be
shocked at where it takes you in life if you're
just able to follow through on this one simple maxim
of don't be ideological you might seem like it's common
sense but but man this isn't this is not common
sense this is very tricky and subtle stuff so be
careful this is really worth your time to to explore
with me deeply ideology is the greatest obstacle to truth
seeking whether that be within science for example or within
spirituality as well ideology corrupts both science and spirituality and
of course it corrupts things like politics and other important
aspects of our lives but what really is ideology ideology
is a cohesive set of beliefs it's a web of
beliefs about how reality works and not only is it
that but there's a stubborn intellectual attachment that comes with
this set of beliefs and not only that but almost
always this set of beliefs says something about how you
think things ought to be for example how people ought
to behave who they should have sex with or who
they shouldn't have sex with or how government should be
structured or how school should be taught or etc etc
this this component of it is called normativity normativity means
that not only is this something that I hold certain
and then I'm stubbornly attached to as a belief system
but that I believe that it's true for everybody else
as well and they're therefore I believe that everyone has
to subscribe to my belief system and behave according to
it and that's how ideologues think that's one of the
functions we'll get in a little more detail later about
the function of ideology but that's one of its main
functions is to actually be normative to give prescriptions for
behavior and so what happens is that the mind and
really what we're talking about here is we're talking about
operations of the mind the mind think of the mind
like a machine and this machine has certain dynamics and
patterns and tendencies and so with ideology we're talking about
deep characteristics of the human mind and what the human
mind tends to do is it tends to get hung
up on certain pet theories that it has and then
it robotic Li defends those theories oftentimes for the rest
of its life leading to all sorts of tragic and
problematic results which we'll get into so other synonyms that
you could use for ideology that I've used in the
past and I'll probably use in the future is belief
Dogma paradigm worldview perspective now these aren't all identical so
you can have a belief but it doesn't necessarily constitute
an ideology per se dogma is is a pretty good
synonym for ideology paradigm paradigm has its own quirks and
I've talked about paradigms in the past I have entire
episodes talking about paradigms and that's a very important notion
and a paradigm is not necessarily an ideology although often
times they are so like they're synonyms but they're not
perfect synonyms so we use these words sometimes interchangeably but
sometimes to to talk about some specific important facet of
how our minds work and how how they get stuck
with various belief systems now one very important misconception that
we need to clear up right off the bat is
this misconception that people think that ideology is something that's
exclusive to religion and that's not at all the case
you can definitely be ideological in a secular or rational
or even scientific manner and this is a big trap
that many people fall into is they think that well
because I'm not religious leo therefore this whole topic of
idea ecology doesn't apply to me man I'm with you
leo I'm all against the religious people but of course
you don't realize that in doing that in believing that
you're now becoming an ideologue just like them scientists academics
skeptics they can all be ideological and you know I
hate to name names because I seem to name these
these same people over and over again but you know
what I kind of have to because they're just part
of our culture they're part of our intellectual culture right
now and people follow these these scientists academics and skeptics
and intellectuals and they easily get seduced into their ideologies
without realizing their ideologies because they seem secular for example
Richard Dawkins is ideological youtuber by the name of Stefan
Molyneux Bill Maher Christopher Hitchens Michael Shermer a big ideological
skeptic which is really really ironic because his whole shtick
his is is fighting basically ideologies without realizing of course
that skepticism in the way that he's doing it is
is a very serious ideological problem Sam Harris to various
degrees is ideological TYT The Young Turks a liberal politics
show on YouTube that's very popular Jordan Peterson also to
various degrees is ideological and so forth so the important
thing that you understand though is as i mentioning these
names first of all don't take it personally and this
is not an attack on these people I'm pointing out
deeper structures of the mind just using these people because
many folks are familiar with them and also because I
need examples which are not religion it's very easy for
me to come up here and to cite various religious
nut cases who are ideological or some you know far
right-wing political hacks and talk-show hosts who are obviously super
ideological like it's very easy for me to cite those
people and in a sense it's easy for you like
it's kind of like obvious to most people it's obvious
that those are ideological though to many many of their
fans it's not obvious but it's the more subtler forms
of ideology that are really important to point out here
ideology comes in degrees and in flavors and it can
be very subtle it doesn't necessarily have to be just
completely over-the-top raving ideological lunatic like Alex Jones right it
doesn't always mean that so if you're objecting to some
of these names that I've mentioned you might say Oh
leo but these people you know sam harris he's not
an ideologue and all this you know that it enough
well that's because you have to understand that I'm not
saying that sam harris is a copy of Alex Jones
he's not an ideologue in a sense of Alex Jones
he's an ideologue in in a in a much more
subtle manner and that's precisely why he's a good example
I want you to look at his work and to
see how he's ideological and these are the people that
I've mentioned look at it study it closely subtly sometimes
their ideological in very subtle ways and just because I
saw I call someone ideological doesn't mean that everything they
say is a hundred percent wrong or that this person
is bad or that this person doesn't have some good
ideas that might be helpful to you right so you
got again you got to be careful here nuanced none
of this black and white thinking we're not going to
be using this label of ideological just to label someone
an ideologue and then to dismiss them and to demonize
them as a bad person that we should never listen
to and we should never engage in conversations with that
would be to be ideological right so when we're talking
about ideology it's very important that were sensitive and we're
careful that we ourselves don't become the ideologues in calling
other people ideological that in and of itself is an
ideological trap so this requires awareness meta awareness of what
you're doing as you're doing this analysis many of these
thinkers are pretty sophisticated thinkers some at some times and
they have good ideas in certain situations but then the
problem of course is is that the good ideas are
mixed in with various forms of sneaky ideology that oftentimes
don't go unnoticed and that's actually what makes it so
dangerous because when you got someone like alex jones most
sane rational people can look at that can look at
has ideological hysteria and they can see that well I
mean clearly this guy has some screws loose and is
not someone worth taking seriously as an intellectual but with
some of these other people you can easily get seduced
into thinking that they're not being ideological because a lot
of times they're rational and they present good arguments and
justifications and scientific studies and facts and and so on
and they might even talk about spirituality they might even
talk about meditation and that might get you a false
sense at all well because someone talks about meditation that
means or because they talk about ego death that means
that they know what they're really talking about and they're
they're actually not an ideologue when in fact they still
have subtle ideologies lurking within them and ultimately the reason
we'll be talking about ideology here is not because we
want to be on people or demonizing them but really
so that you understand how it works and then you
can apply this understanding to yourself to find your own
subtle ideologies and you probably are not a raving lunatic
fanatic you have ideologies very likely but they're probably subtle
forms of ideology and that's precisely where this conversation will
be useful to you is if you're able to use
it to isolate and pimp those hidden unconscious ideological positions
that you hold which maybe you never even thought were
ideological and now we're gonna be helping you to point
those out and also just because you have some areas
or some person has some ideological positions doesn't mean that
everything they say is ideological you see so you have
to be careful here be nuanced it's very easy to
see how other people are ideological a lot of times
but it's often a lot harder to see how you
yourself are ideological many popular public figures are ideologues and
that's because ideologic sells and it's actually addictive to the
mind a very strong juicy mmm cohesive set of beliefs
can be very addictive it can be more addictive than
coffee or sugar or some other chemical substance to your
mind ideology can be like crack that's what ideology is
it's crack for the mind and of course drugs sell
very well precisely because they're addictive cigarettes sell well because
they're addictive because people keep coming back and that's why
a lot of these public intellectuals and public figures they
make entire careers around their ideologies because hey that's perfect
for a career I can keep publishing books videos courses
seminars speaking tours you know I can do this for
the rest of my life if I'm if I'm selling
a juicy ideology and then if if my ideology is
a kind of ideology that is useful you know for
example for certain politicians or people in power then I
can actually get money from them to peddle this ideology
because it becomes very useful to those in power for
you know whatever um you know nefarious purposes they got
but of course often those people who are peddling the
ideology they themselves are the true believers usually someone who
spreads an ideology has already been infected by it themselves
thoroughly such that when they deliver it they look like
they're really bought into it and that's actually what helps
sell the ideology it's hard to sell an ideology you
don't really believe in if you're just doing it purely
for money so I'm not saying that many of these
people are doing it purely for money what I'm saying
is that the money just kind of feeds into their
already existing passion about these ideas I love to study
ideology by the way because it reveals so many deep
inner workings of the human mind and it really helps
me to serve like a mirror on myself to see
how I'm misusing my own mind so I love to
study neo-nazis and Alex Jones types and conspiracy theorists and
arrogant scientists and atheists and rationalists and cults and just
generally a history of knowledge looking through the history of
philosophy the history of of science the history of politics
are just looking for how are people misusing their minds
to create these various kinds of ideologies which have existed
since the the dawn of time and then all sorts
of nasty stuff that happens there and also how they
rationalize it to themselves because all of these people when
they are preaching this ideology they they don't really understand
what they're doing they really believe it so here are
some examples of ideology materialism scientism atheism libertarianism ayan Rand
capitalism socialism Christianity Catholicism Islam Hinduism Judaism logical positivism rationalism
empiricism behaviorism the Hari Krishna's Scientology Darwinism creationism flat-earthers and
all sorts of other kinds of conspiracy theorists which there
are too many to enumerate here Alex Jones we've mentioned
FoxNews Nazism nationalism sports very interestingly a lot of people
become ideological about sports so their favorite sports teams conservativism
communism nihilism racism morality morality is largely rooted in ideology
Mormonism Buddhism very interesting because Buddhism has a lot of
good stuff in it has a lot of very profound
teachings but uh but you also to be careful because
people start to take it on as an ideology MOG
tao movement the men's rights movement red pill pickup feminism
skepticism if you're very careful with skepticism because you might
think that skepticism is the opposite of ideology but actually
the way that most people practice skepticism these days that
I see it's uh it's it's been turned into an
ideology post-modernism pacifism veganism vegetarianism now again just because I
might have listed your favorite ideology here one that you
subscribe to don't get offended don't get defensive and and
don't misunderstand me as saying that everything about that ideology
is wrong oftentimes an ideology can contain some deep truth
like Buddhism can contain some deep truth Christianity content contain
some deep truth veganism and pacifism can contain some deep
truth and skepticism can contain some deep truth and Anna
and many times these ideology are taken on with good
intentions so you have to make a distinction though between
the content of an ideology and being ideological yourself right
these are two different things so the real problem with
ideology is not really the content per se it's how
one goes about it how one holds it it's the
fact that's one's attached to it and that one clings
to it and that one builds an entire identity out
of it that's the real problem because that then creates
closed mindedness and stubbornness which leads to all sorts of
problems that we'll be covering here in a moment so
so you know I'm not saying that everything that feminism
talks about is wrong there are definitely very important insights
that feminism brought to the table that were very necessary
and important for the liberation of women all right but
it also can easily become an ideology so it's possible
that you want equality for women and that you generally
subscribe and believe in for example the the values of
feminism without being an ideologue about it whereas other people
they can believe the same stuff but then they become
an ideologue about it and then that's really where the
problems happen you know it's possible to just watch sports
and just enjoy some sports without being an ideologue so
I'm not saying that all sports are bad nor am
I saying that Christianity is bad or evil or all
of post-modernism is bad that's not what I'm saying I'm
just saying don't be ideological about these things remember the
number one rule don't be ideological and as it turns
out you can almost turn anything ideological ideology is not
baked into the content of your beliefs ideology is your
mode of holding the belief such that it's not a
question of God or no God science or religion no
no that's not what it's about that's a that's a
debate about the Conte what I'm talking about is the
meta structure you can hold God in an ideological manner
or not you can hold not God you could believe
that there is no God in an ideological manner or
not in an ideological manner you see so be very
careful about making these distinctions why does nobody get ideological
about bananas horses sunsets and diapers of course it's possible
that you can get ideological about the even these things
but generally people aren't ideological about this stuff because it
doesn't really meet the criteria of why people get ideological
about things in the first place and as we keep
going here we're gonna explore deeper and deeper really the
deep roots of why ideology exists at all what function
does it that's it serve for the mind if the
mind is doing it and it's expending a lot of
time and energy doing it which it does and it's
so pervasive across all human cultures found on every continent
in the world across every era and generation for the
last five thousand years which is the case so if
it's so pervasive then what is the mind getting out
of it well we're gonna explore that but first here
let me tell you the things that people really get
ideological about and you're gonna start to see some of
the reasons and some of the deep the deep commonalities
here the things people get most ideological about our identity
issues like gender sex race ethnicity culture equality civil rights
also metaphysical issues cosmology issues pertaining to the core of
what you think reality is or to truth people get
very ideological about what the truth is which of course
brings in religion and God these are some of the
most ideological topics also morality people tend to have very
firm and stubborn positions about what they think is right
or wrong or good and evil also issues of life
and death the more serious an issue is the more
likely someone is to be ideological about it now that
should give you a little clue as to what is
really going on with the mind but we'll make it
more explicit a little later here as we go on
also livelihood matters that relate to your livelihood or to
your ability to feed yourself and to feed your family
people tend to get ideological about and of course politics
politics and power so are you seeing any commonalities here
identity metaphysics life and death livelihood power sounds like maybe
we're talking about the ego here huh and sometimes you
find ideology even in the most unusual of places like
for example in video games this always cracks me up
because you would think that video games well I mean
video games are just like light-hearted and fun what is
there to be ideological about with video games but you
know um if you're a gamer and you're into gamer
culture and you hang around on online gaming forums and
comment sections and so forth then you know just how
ideological people can get about their video games and then
you got the fanboys who are into the Xbox or
they they hate the PlayStation but they love the Xbox
or vice-versa they love the PlayStation or their Nintendo fans
but they hate Sony you know and then you got
other people who are just like playing games and they're
kind of like maybe they they don't really care they
they like Microsoft Sony and Nintendo to them it's all
good as long as the game is good but then
you got those fanatics who are like no even if
it's a good game but it's coming out on a
Playstation that's a that's a travesty or something like that
and then they get into flame wars and debates and
this goes on of course a lot of this because
gamers are young usually teens are in their early 20s
and and because they start to develop an identity around
their gaming and they get like hardcore gamers and then
because that they get I'll ideological about it about a
thing which you would think it's a absolutely silly to
be ideological about video games or about game consoles but
also you find it for example with weightlifting with Fitness
with diet people get very ideological about different kinds of
diets paleo vegan vegetarian meat-eater carnivore this that or whatever
your favorite fitness routines are whether you're into cardio or
weight lifting or power lifting or bodybuilding or you know
whatever you're doing you're doing the what's that one that
everyone loves yeah it's like the px90 and this and
that like all these different workout systems and then they
they they they have start these like wars against each
other and authors write books on the other system and
and then they get into flame wars about this why
does this happen again people are building an identity out
of their fitness routines and out of their diets and
as a final example of something that's very trivial but
people can take ideological ease take art people can become
ideological about art of all things you think art I
mean what is there to be idle idle up ideological
about and yet if you're in like the art critic
world you know people get very ideological about various art
styles and what they think is avant-garde or what they
think is it deserves to be out on guard or
not or whether it's a good piece of art or
a bad piece of art or this is the right
kind of school impression is and more abstract Impressionism or
you know oh different schools that exist within art and
historically there's been a lot of controversy within various art
movements and people becoming closed-minded to new forms of art
and criticizing in and bashing it only to accept it
and embrace it 50 years later but to bash some
other new art style so what I want you to
notice is that virtually any content can be turned ideological
depending on how you hold it whether you want to
build an identity around it but of course a lot
of content just isn't worth building an identity around and
a lot of it very much depends on your culture
so in certain cultures during certain eras of human history
people would build an identity about art about fine art
you know right now in our current era in our
current Western culture most people don't care about fine art
so it seemed pretty silly so instead they build a
identity and become ideological around video games or weightlifting or
diet or exercise or something like that all right so
very much depends so you know in 500 years people
will be becoming ideological about some other thing I don't
know maybe some computer AI or something else you know
some new gadget that comes out and they'll turn ideological
about that and to them video games will be a
thing of the past and they'll look at and say
how could have anybody been ideologic about video games so
it very much depends on where you're at what issues
your culture is facing and also what kind of new
stuff your culture is developing so usually it's the new
stuff that comes out that oftentimes offends people who are
defending the status quo and that they're trying to protect
because they built an identity all around the old stuff
and now this new stuff is threatening to undermine them
spiral dynamics is illuminating here when we're talking about ideology
because if you understand Sproul dynamics and I'm whole video
series go check that out if you don't know what
spell dynamics is referring to and what these colors are
gonna be talking about is I'm gonna mention them here
but the color stage is blue orange and green are
ideological in their own ways and I'll tell you what
they are in a minute but what I want you
to understand here with ideology is that as you're developing
up the spiral what's generally happening is that you're becoming
more mature and you're becoming more conscious and your sense
of self and identity is expanding larger and larger and
larger and so as that happens your form of ideology
becomes subtler and subtler and subtler and so while it's
very easy and obvious to look at cultures that are
deeply steeped in blue ideology which is traditional religious ethnocentric
nationalist patriarchal Orthodox and often militaristic emphasizes strong borders and
defense so you can find cultures like this in the
Middle East or maybe in in parts of southern Asia
and and you might look at those from our Western
democracy if you're in Europe or in in America you
might look at those you might say well yeah look
look how ideological those Islamic people are in Iran or
Iraq or something and that's very easy and obvious to
see but what's a little harder to see is the
next level of ideology which is orange orange has much
less ideology than blue it's one developmental level up but
it still has now its own version of ideology which
is rational scientific materialist reductionist atheist analytical skeptic libertarian capitalist
individualist and often secular now I'm not creating a false
equivalency here by saying that orange is just as ideological
as blue no orange is less ideological than blue but
it's still ideological but of course because orange can't see
above what comes after orange it can only see below
where it came from it can see blue so orange
oftentimes can't see its own ideology because it's so focused
on the ideology of blue which is the case with
sam harris and people who subscribe to his rationalism there's
so much focus on the problems of blue that were
ignoring the problems of orange but then you evolve beyond
that and you go to green and of course green
has its own form of ideology which is an egalitarian
social justice warrior form of ideology here now we're fighting
for the rights of all of mankind to put everyone
on a level playing field and that's a great thing
but again it can become ideological post-modernism can turn into
an ideology environmentalism also very great and important innovation and
green environmentalism but it can also go overboard into ideology
socialism collectivism and green generally is not aware enough to
understand its own ideology for that you need to go
to the next level which is yellow and yellow is
a quantum leap it's tier two it's beyond green and
really it's the first stage that is really starting to
understand ideology it's starting to understand the meta stuff that
I'm talking about these meta mechanics is starting to see
oh yeah ideology is not particularly one type of belief
it's not particular to religion or it's not particularly to
capitalism or whatever it's a very general function of the
mind and that as the mind develops as culture develops
as humanity develops the content always changes but the ideology
stays and of course it also lessons and lessons and
lessons as our consciousness rises but it's still there and
yellow starts to become aware of this so really my
goal with this episode is to help people who are
still stuck in blue orange and green to rise up
to yellow and to help people at yellow to really
understand what's going on with the with the folks below
them so they can understand them in a in a
compassionate sort of way without demonizing them what does every
ideology have in common quite a few things actually so
firstly every ideology is conceptual and belief based and it's
dependent on language in fact it's impossible to have an
ideology without language and without concepts and without thinking that's
pretty important that might seem obvious but that's pretty important
pause and think about that if there was no language
and no conceptualizing there would be no ideologies whatsoever of
any kind imagine how how radically different the world would
look without any ideologies of any kind without any of
the stuff that I mentioned above cuz it would be
impossible so that's important to understand and support understand that
ideology is something your mind is doing and also that
there's stuff outside your mind reality is not limited to
just what's happening inside your mind reality is not limited
to your conceptualizations so in fact you can sit there
right now and stop all your conceptualizing and see well
what the world looks like with no ideologies whatsoever because
an ideology is only gonna occur when your mind is
active of course that assumes you can actually quiet down
your mind for more than three seconds which most people
can't do without years of meditation but you can try
just to verify what I'm saying here don't believe me
verify everything that I'm saying in your direct experience try
to stop your mind and see are any ideologies possible
when your mind is not active when you're not thinking
so that's their core commonality but also another commonality for
all ideologies is that every ideology feels true due to
confirmation bias because the mind will cherry-pick evidence to support
and to justify the ideology and the evidence that presents
will see very convincing so when you have an ideology
it's not gonna feel like you have an ideology when
you have an ideology it's gonna feel like you just
have the truth but you understand reality that you've figured
it out that's how it's gonna feel and it's gonna
feel like everybody else is deluded and that's very tricky
because what you're relying there is you're relying on your
own sense of truthfulness to sort of judge whether you
should believe yourself in or not and well how do
you know that you can rely on that feeling especially
when you know that there's confirmation bias and you know
that whatever you believe your mind will go out and
find the evidence cherry-pick the evidence to support that you
see that's a very that's a very tricky dynamic right
there and that should raise a lot of doubt within
you about how confident you feel about whatever you think
is true also every ideology basically claims absolute truth for
itself even ideologies who don't believe in AI absolute truth
but for example relativism like post-modernism doesn't believe in an
absolute truth but then what it does ironically is that
it holds that relativism is the absolute truth that's sort
of the point of an ideology is to claim an
absolute truth also already all ideologies are arrogant fundamental arrogance
is involved to hold an ideology because to hold an
ideology means that you're you're certain that what you have
is correct and the truth and that you really understand
reality and so you must convince yourself and to convince
yourself you must think that what you've got is actually
the way that it is and therefore fundamentally you believe
that you've figured out reality because if you didn't believe
that then why would you be so insistent why would
you cling to this particular position that you hold you
see if you were truly doubtful about something that you
believed you wouldn't be ideological about it you would be
sort of wishy-washy you wouldn't get very passionate about it
and he didn't all emotional because again you're not sure
about it if you're really not sure the reason this
is arrogant is because you're grossly under estimating reality and
this is common to all ideological positions is that they
grossly underestimate reality the fundamental arrogance is that you believe
that you've actually figured reality out when you haven't you
don't know yet not even close just how complicated and
how vast reality is and how little of it you
really understand and even the stuff that you think you
do understand how long it is and how it will
get recontextualized with a broadening of of context and awareness
and consciousness but see this is all lost on an
ideologue an ideologue thinks that reality is just simple an
ideologue thinks that reality is just this physical thing it's
just a given we see it we know it we
think about it we rationalize about it it's just logic
it's just science we got it boom or it's written
about in the Bible I read the Bible boom that's
reality it can just be easily explained using language thinking
a few diagrams a few examples a few models some
mathematical formulas BAM we got it we got it but
reality is not that way not even close but good
luck explaining that to an ideal eye all ideologies are
fundamentally stubborn and closed-minded that's the point of having an
ideology is to close your mind down to further inquiry
all ideologies refuse to self-reflect this is a very important
feature that's common to them all an ideologue is not
interested in turning inwards and really deeply questioning his own
assumptions about the ideology an ideologue just wants to defend
his ideology because he thinks it's already the truth so
why self-reflect why question the truth when I've already got
the truth makes no sense from the ideologues perspective except
of course you're forgetting one thing what you think is
the truth may not be the truth all ideologies lack
self-awareness they don't see their own inner workings they lack
awareness of the dynamics of the mind which is what
I'm talking about in this episode all ideologies in one
way or another refused to explore new perspectives and to
have radically new experiences to open themselves up to new
domains of experience almost all ideologies take themselves way too
seriously because they think they're right and what they think
they're right about they think is very important so they
treat it seriously they're not humorous or not playful and
in fact the more ideological a person is the more
serious that person tends to be and that's one really
good way to suss out ideologues is you see that
they they take their ideologies very seriously especially when they're
cornered and when you start to question them or watch
what's watch them get all serious about it that's a
very important clue as to what that ideology is really
doing in their psyche there is a very important reason
why they're so serious about it we'll get to that
in a minute all ideologies tend to be black and
white thinking they tend to fail to make subtle distinctions
between different kinds of people or different kinds of situations
they tend to lump stuff together in a black and
white way which becomes problematic as I've already mentioned all
ideologies are normative they tend to try to make rules
that everyone has to follow even other people who don't
subscribe to that ideology because see when you think you
have the truth you're so convinced by it that you
think everybody else who doesn't follow understand is deluded and
therefore that you have to now force them to follow
your truth and that's also a function of arrogance all
ideologies are defensive because fundamentally they're in denial about some
aspect of reality so this is why when you corner
an ideologue they will get defensive sometimes very defensive emotionally
so that's not a common feature is that all ideologies
are actually emotional they're not grounded in truth or in
logic the way you might think or in reasons or
in evidence they're really grounded in emotion and the irony
of it is that even people who think that they're
atheists or rationalist or scientific or skeptical that itself is
rooted in emotion it's rooted deep down it's rooted in
fear it's rooted in attachment it's rooted perhaps in hatred
of various kinds so there's various kinds of emotions that
come into play but always ideology is emotional because it's
serious and for you it's it's not a game it's
a matter of life and death your very identity hinges
on it and that's why emotions come into play because
emotions those things think about it that you're the most
emotional about what are they they are the things that
are life and death yeah of course you can you
can laugh at some comedian saying some joke that's not
life and death but the stuff that you have strong
negative emotions about your deepest fears anxieties jealousies envies and
hatreds those are those are the deepest strongest most human
emotions and those all have to do with your survival
so the reason that ideology is emotional is because it
has something to do with your survival not just ideas
but your survival your very life is on the line
with ideologies these are not just ideas for philosophers we're
not just talking about philosophy here these ideologies they govern
how you live they govern your opportunities in life they
govern who you can have sex with they govern who
you will marry they govern who you're gonna support as
a leader of your tribe they're gonna govern where you
work how you earn a livelihood you see all of
this is life-and-death stuff for you another common element of
ideologies is ideologies attack they get defensive but then when
you question them too much they lash out and they
start to attack they judge they criticize they blame a
scapegoat they demonize and sometimes this can even get a
physically violent all ideologies use projection to defend themselves because
the ideology is disowning some part of reality or your
own self to successfully do that what needs to happen
is the psyche needs to project that out onto other
people so the irony is is that if you're a
highly ideological you will actually think that other people are
highly ideological who disagree with you when in fact they
might not be like I might just say something to
you that will destroy your ideology you will then think
that I'm the ideological one for telling you that and
sometimes you see YouTube comments down there criticizing me on
just that very ground it's a projection it's an egoic
projection the person's own is being pointed out to them
but instead they assumed that no you're the deluded one
leo you're the one who's full of and of course
how do you arbitrate between who is and who isn't
full of well that's the very uh it's a very
deep epistemic question not so easy to answer but an
ideologue doesn't care about that an ideologue just / checks
out and just as well that person's crazy that bursts
the criminal that person's deluded that person's a religious nut
case whatever another common element of all ideologies that they
cause suffering they all do to various degrees now I'm
not saying they're all the same some ideologies can cause
the suffering of millions of people and some ideologies they
just cause suffering within you internally oftentimes it's actually both
most ideologies do both especially if it's a widely adopted
ideology it will harm many millions of people disenfranchised and
and and damaged many people physically in the physical realm
but also psychologically internally it's gonna damage them as well
with guilt and with shame and with criticism and blame
and self-hatred and hatred of other people and toxicity and
negativity and all that all ideologies also are incapable of
explaining all of reality all ideologies are necessarily partial which
is why they're not the absolute truth and the reason
you can't explain all of reality with an ideology is
because all of reality is infinite and your explanations will
always be finite now this is a deep point that
I can't go into here probably those of you will
understand who have heard me talking about infinity before and
y-you can't conceptualize infinity you can't turn infinity into a
belief so reality is itself and you can't encapsulate it
down into any kind of a belief system or any
kind of system whatsoever symbolic or conceptual and so all
your explanations of reality will always fall short of reality
itself because you're explaining is itself a part a small
part of the total reality so by definition it will
always be incomplete and that's a big problem with ideologies
because what if you want to understand reality as a
whole not a part but a whole you might say
well that's impossible but actually you're wrong about that it
is possible it's not possible though with ideologies it is
possible through other means and that's the problem the ideology
is that they they they close down the mind from
people accessing those other means because they think ideology is
the only thing and that's one of the other things
that ideologies do is ideologies always create this bubble around
themselves such that everything that you see reinforces your ideology
you will surround yourself with people and friends and you
will read the kind of books and watch the kind
of TV and subscribe to the kind of YouTube channels
who reinforce your bubble of ideology such that that will
make it seem like your ideology is true that's what
your ideology really is about it's about creating this bubble
of reality another common element of ideologies is that no
ideology understands the nature of consciousness itself and all of
the levels and stages of consciousness that exist because if
the ideology did then you would be way too conscious
to hold an ideology and all ideologies spread themselves like
viruses so what ideology does is ideology confuses beliefs for
reality it fails to make a distinction between belief and
experience between concept and between actuality actuality what's true what's
actual right now in your direct experience not something you
think or believe or some theory or some scientific thing
or some religious thing that you've been told but actuality
actuality means this present moment right now you need to
distinguish this present moment which is actual from all your
ideas about it or all of your ideas about reality
whether they're religious or scientific or anything else that distinction
needs to be made but this distinction is precisely what
the ideologue fails to do for the ideologue these these
two are blended and this is actually on purpose because
the ideologue is trying to construct a conceptual reality and
in fact for the ideologue the distinction between reality and
fantasy is actually ironically blurred and non-existent he cannot distinguish
between what's actual and what's figments of his imagination and
that's precisely what the mind wants so that the mind
can construct its own reality conducive to its own survival
that's what the game is all about all ideologues fail
to understand this very simple but super important point which
is that the truth can never be captured with beliefs
or with models or with mathematics of any kind ever
never ever ever not even close this is completely lost
on the ideologue the ID lock does not understand why
this is the case because if the ideologue actually understood
why the truth cannot be captured with beliefs or concepts
of any kind then that would destroy a lot of
his ideology that he claims to so why is ideology
so problematic well there's multiple reasons firstly because it closes
the mind to genuine inquiry an ID law cannot do
serious research or inquiry into any question because he has
a position and already made answer to the question which
he thinks is true so he needs the research or
the inquiry to deliver the answer that he already believes
is true so he can't do an objective unbiased honest
thorough inquiry into the subject because he already thinks he's
got the answer and so that answer is actually biasing
him from doing it a totally open search and that's
it becomes a real problem because if there's something that
is counter to what this person's position is he'll never
find it because he always needs the research or the
inquiry to deliver the thing he already believes so it's
it always will it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy this is
confirmation bias in another form another reason that it's so
problematic is become it becomes an egoic identity you develop
this big identity you get attached to your ideology such
that when your ideology is damaged threatened or questioned you
actually feel it as a personal attack on yourself and
it feels like a life-and-death matter it feels like you're
being physically attacked it doesn't feel like we're just playing
with ideas in philosophy class it feels like I'm physically
attacking you with a knife and that's why you get
so defensive about it because literally what's happened is that
your physical identity has merged with your ideas about reality
and who you are and what you think is important
in life they have merged the distinction between who you
actually are and what you believe has disappeared such that
when I attack a belief of yours you would think
well Leo attackee I believe of mine that's not like
attacking me physically with a knife that would be true
if you hadn't blurred the distinction between your physical body
and the beliefs you hold in fact your physical body
is one of the beliefs you hold in fact physical
reality is one of the beliefs you hold such that
when I questioned physical reality or what you actually perceived
that as if you take me seriously is an assault
on your very physical being in your very existence this
is not a philosophical discussion which is precisely why your
mind will immediately tune it out such that when I
tell you that physical reality is an idea that you
hold and that it's not actually real it doesn't actually
exist and when I tell you for example that your
body is actually an idea that you hold and it
has no no real substance to it whatsoever and that
you're not your body if I tell you that for
most people their mind will not even get to the
point of seriously entertaining what I just said because it
will be immediately dismissed by the mind because it's way
too threatening of a notion to take seriously so instead
the mind goes and pulls out its weapons like ridicule
and attack and character assassination and demonization and scapegoating and
blaming and criticizing and judging all these weapons come out
the mind goes on the offensive precisely because what I'm
saying is so threatening and the only reason it's threatening
is because it's true but of course the mind is
not going to entertain this even if you think you're
entertaining it that's just another trick of the mind so
you might say Oh Leo I'm not I'm not as
ignorant and closed-minded as these people you think that I'm
like I'm not like that I'm willing to sit here
and seriously entertain that physical reality isn't real nobody see
that's just another trick you've tricked yourself what you said
there is you've programmed your mind with another belief to
tell yourself yeah I'm willing to entertain it but you're
not really entertaining it you're just masturbating intellectually with it
to you it's just philosophy you're not seriously inquiring it'll
take you many years of beating around the bush before
you get to actually seriously inquiring about what I just
said and when you do you'll get scared and when
you do you'll realize just how physically threatening this is
that's not philosophy and when you do at some point
you'll realize why you've been avoiding it your whole life
and you've been playing all these games and throwing up
all these smoke screens you're like a squid squirting screens
of ink to get away because the truth is a
predator and it's chasing you all the time so your
mind has to be playing these these squid inking games
and because your mind is a survivor and you're a
survivor and you're still alive then see you've gotten really
good at it you're very skillful at it so the
mind will will weasel its way out it'll snake its
way and like a slippery eel it will just come
up with all sorts of excuses and everything just till
to to shut the mind off to not think about
any of this stuff la la la la la la
la la that's what it's like the reason ideology is
problematic is because it locks the mind into one single
perspective and what human growth and development about is about
is about expanding your capacity to take on more and
more perspectives so at every level of the spiral dynamics
spiral each stage what's actually happening as you're moving from
blue to orange is your you're taking on an additional
perspective and then to move from orange to green you're
taking on an additional perspective taking on more and more
and more and more perspectives and that's precisely what ideology
is trying to prevent you from doing so really ideology
is stopping your ability to grow and to develop that's
why it's such an important topic and we're covering in
so much detail another problem with ideology is that it
oversimplifies matters because it wants to judge and blame and
demonize so it's not really interested in exploring an issue
seriously it's interested in creating a straw man out of
it and then beating down that straw man it also
disowns parts of reality and this creates a shadow which
you then drag around with you for the rest of
your life and the shadow acts up in ways that
you don't see that it's the shadow that's causing this
stuff and for that you'll have to wait for my
shadow work episode where I'll talk about shadow and how
to work with your shadow and uncover the shadow in
more detail it's also problematic because it makes people intolerant
it tends to be oppressive violent and cruel most of
the world's violence comes from ideology non-ideological people rarely become
violent only on the under the most extreme circumstances when
their their physical survival is threatened ideology is problematic because
it wastes time and energy people devote their entire lives
to defending an ideology arguing it for it proving it
spreading it debating it and so forth it's also problematic
because it radicalizes people it polarizes it fragments ideology fragments
reality fragments people fragments society into pieces and then these
fragments also then our become antagonistic towards one another this
is radicalization polarization and then this creates hatred or in
other words ideology is the opposite of love and consciousness
which is the whole purpose of development and the whole
purpose of life is to become more conscious and more
loving ideology stalls real solutions and progress because people waste
all their time and energy attacking others that no viable
solutions come out and people are so black and white
that any solutions they come up with are so simplistic
that they can't work in the real world and handle
all the nuances and so no real progress is possible
so long as people are ideological which is for example
the problem with the situation in Israel and Palestine the
reason that problem can't get resolved is because both sides
have been radicalized and therefore the real solutions which exist
there exists real solutions in fact Spile dynamics is a
very real solution to the israeli-palestinian problem but it can't
work so long as people are radicalized it's also problematic
because it corrupts science to be able to do true
high quality science you need to be extremely open-minded way
more open-minded than most scientists are willing to be and
you need be completely non ideological and you need to
question all of your fundamental metaphysical and epistemic assumptions which
most scientists are not willing to do so the reason
that science is evolutionary it has to grow on top
of itself and struggle with itself and that their paradigm
shifts as Thomas Kuhn famously talked about within science the
reason our scientific revolutions is precisely because of ideology because
science becomes ideological then it takes fifty two hundred years
to break down that ideology for the next paradigm to
arrive and then that becomes the new ideology and then
it takes another years - to break that one down
and then there's a new ideology and so on it
goes and the last reason ideology is problematic is because
it even sours truthful things such that even if you
have some kernel of truth within your ideology it will
get tainted by the fact that you've turned it into
an ideology such that you will actually cause harm with
this truth more than good which is what happens for
example with many religions many religions contain valuable insights about
human development growth spirituality how to be a better person
how to meditate and this sorts of stuff but it's
completely soured and tainted and corrupted those truthful nuggets are
completely corrupted by the fact that it's been turned into
an ideology and it's been systematized and written in a
Bible in a book and now people are forced to
memorize it and and spout it off without any direct
experience of those truthful kernels so what is the deep
function of ideology it's to maintain a sense of separate
self-identity ideology is used to build identity it actually is
who you are is your ideology there's not such a
clear distinction as you might think between your physical body
and all the beliefs that you hold about reality because
like I said the very notion that you are and
have a physical body in a physical reality is itself
an ideology that you hold and precisely the reason why
you will deny that it's AI and ideologies plessy than
it is an ideology that's why you deny it it's
the people who hold an ideology it's not like they
walk around thinking yeah I'm holding an ideology me and
my precious ideology know someone who holds an ideology successfully
is someone who actually just walks around thinking that hey
this is reality this is how things are they couldn't
be any other way it's not your mind never labels
it ideology in the mind no scientist thinks he's ideological
no religious believer who believes in God thinks that it's
just an ideology they believe it's true they believe it's
reality they oftentimes believe it's the ultimate truth whether they're
scientific or religious so whatever ideology you're building you're doing
it to create your sense of self and also to
maintain a sense of reality because if you're honest what
is reality anyways but your ideas about reality without an
ideology what would reality really be to you you would
be lost you would be groundless you have to anchor
yourself in something so what you do is you create
the notion of reality and then what that is is
whatever you want it to be whatever your mind finds
convenient whether it's religion or science or atheism or communism
or veganism or whatever that is missing and so literally
we're talking about riadi ology we're talking about reality without
an ideology you can tell and distinguish between what is
real and what's not real you need an ideology to
tell you that which is why you get very defensive
about it because if you were to really surrender all
your ideologies you would have to admit that you don't
really know anything and you don't even know what reality
is you don't even know you're not even sure if
you were ever born if you really get rid of
all your ideas and then where would you be then
you'd be lost you'd be confused you'd be floating around
just aimlessly groundless and of course you don't want that
the deep function of ideology is to actually disown and
deny certain aspects of reality because certain aspects of reality
are so radically weird that the mind can't accept them
and so what the mind does is disowns them what
do I mean by disowning you might wonder leo how
is my ideology about atheism or about scepticism how is
that disowning some aspect of reality I don't get it
well here's here's an analogous example people often disown evil
in the world because their mind can't comprehend how the
world can possess so much evil so when you see
some evil happening on the evening news you might skip
over it you might turn your head away from the
images because it's just too much evil and you got
to disown it and even if you don't turn your
face away from the images what you'll do is you
might look at the images but then you'll create a
story explaining those images and disowning those images through your
explanation for example you will say ah that person who
was murdered that was done by a by some radical
Islamist terrorists and their evil and see what you did
though there is that you've actually denied and disowned that
aspect of reality and yourself because what you did is
you've created to split you fragmented realia said oh well
they are the the evil terrorists and then there's all
of us good guys like me and so it's the
good guys like me I guess the terrorists and and
you might say well Leo but that's what would how
else could it be what are you talking about I
mean that terrorists killed somebody and you might be right
that terrorists might have killed somebody but what you're disowning
and denying is the fact that actually consciousness is one
all of it is one that's very advanced but uh
try to try to try to stay with me everything
is one all of conscious is one so literally that
terrorist that you think kills somebody and maybe he did
kill somebody that is all true but what you're denying
is the fact that actually there's no separation between you
and the terrorists and that literally that terrorist is you
and so that doesn't fit your ideas of you being
a good citizen if you had good human being right
because because to do that to say that you're good
you have to deny all the parts of reality that
are actually bad and also you have to limit yourself
you can't be the whole world because if you were
the whole world all of reality it wouldn't be so
easy to say that you're good because there's rapists and
terrorists out there and more criminals and thieves and corrupt
politicians right so you have to you have to do
to disown and deny and sever your connection from all
those people you have to dehumanize all them but not
just to humanize them you have to also say that
they are not me they are not you literally you
have to say that you're separate from them because otherwise
you would admit that reality is a mixed bag of
of good and evil stuff and some aspects of reality
are very cruel and a very upsetting and so it's
much more pleasant for you to come for the story
of how all those bad evil people are doing nasty
stuff rather than admitting that reality is realities this very
big thing and it takes a lot of maturity to
accept every aspect of reality as actually being yourself takes
a lot of responsibility to do that but of course
you don't want all that responsibility you want a pleasant
story such that it doesn't even make sense to you
what I'm talking about here because it seems like I'm
crazy that I'm insane to even be suggesting that you
might be physically similar or actually identical with a terrorist
right like to most people that doesn't even make sense
that's not even something they can think about intellectually it's
so far well it's it's just it's too true it's
it's so far outside their consciousness that they can't even
imagine how it could possibly be true and nevertheless it
is but to discover that you'd have to raise your
consciousness and spend many years deconstructing are all your ideologies
including all your physicalist scientific materialist ideologies to actually understand
that which is our goal here under deep function of
ideology is to stop you from questioning reality when you
have a nice juicy ideology you have no reason to
question reality not fundamentally not really because you already think
you got it you think you got it basically figure
it out and the rest is just window dressing yeah
there's some stuff I don't know but science will figure
it out in the next hundred years and it won't
really change much that kind of attitude keeps the mind
from actually questioning reality and the reason that that is
is because if you start to question reality you'll start
to see reality unravel like a sweater where you pull
on on a loose thread and the whole sweater unravels
that's what is gonna happen if you really start questioning
reality and you go outside of all ideologies and so
what an ideology really is is sort of like some
glue which is holding that little loose thread in place
such that you couldn't pull on it but if you
pull in hard enough you'll break past the glue and
then you keep pulling on it and you discover that
the entire sweater is made of one single yarn and
that the entire thing will unravel and that all that
was ever holding it in place was that little bit
of glue that um that was your ideology and so
the function of the ideology is like a cement or
a glue which keeps your reality from unraveling physical reality
the point of ideology is also to prevent new experiences
because as you expose yourself to radically new experiences for
example psychedelic experiences out-of-body experiences maybe some astral projection type
of thing or some lucid dreaming or some near-death experience
or some experience of a radically different culture than your
culture like maybe you lived in in the rural south
of America and you travel to Scandinavia and you discover
that all those Scandinavian people don't have it so bad
or maybe you travel to some part of Africa where
they do have it really bad and you see oh
my god these people have it so bad there that
it actually shatters your reality you can no longer go
back to your cloistered existence where you you went to
work and you did your normal 95 job and and
you you ate all your food and you threw all
your half your food of plate away in the trashcan
and you were wasting all these resources and this and
that and you were just being completely oblivious to the
suffering of other human beings around them around the world
or the suffering of animals and the environment right so
as you expose yourself more to the suffering of humans
the suffering of animals the damage to the environment that's
being done by society and all the abuse that exists
out there all the corruption as you expose yourself more
to that you're exposing yourself to more diverse perspectives and
what that's doing is that's actually breaking down your reality
and then if you sort to expose yourself to radically
new experiences like deep psychedelic experiences you go take some
ayahuasca or something that will actually destroy your reality because
your perspective will change so much that you will never
be able to come back to your current perspective and
hold it as the one true perspective anymore ever in
your entire life because you've seen something so radically different
by exposing yourself to new experiences you're exposing yourself to
new weird unknown aspects of reality which force you to
challenge your existing models and paradigms because see your your
existing models and paradigms they were built upon your present
base of experience which for most people is a very
limited base of experience mostly have lived in the same
place their entire life same city same state same country
eat the same kind of food hang out with the
same kind of people in the same kind of family
go to the same kind of job for decades and
decades and decades such that for them they don't need
robust models of reality they don't need to open their
mind significantly because for them to explain their super limited
and constrained band of experience you know if the whole
range of life experience is like this then for most
people they have like one millimeter worth of of life
experience so for them they don't need to bother to
explain the entire spectrum the other 99% cuz all they
got is that 1% and when you got 1% you
can't tell the difference between the 1% and 90% 99%
because the 99% is outside of your awareness you haven't
experienced it so you don't need to come up with
any kind of models to explain it you don't need
to struggle you don't need to read book so you
don't need to go to seminars you don't need to
to go to gurus and ask them profound questions about
life because your life has been so boring and simple
that there's nothing there to reconcile there's no paradoxes you
haven't encountered any contradictions you haven't encountered any existential crises
but as you open yourself to more to new experiences
you will start to experience contradictions and paradoxes and you'll
become confused and you won't be able to explain the
stuff that you see in the world and you will
see that all the explanations that were given to you
by your culture by your religion by your science by
your teachers by your family that none of them explain
what you're seeing and then you will actually now start
to go off looking for the answers because now you
will really understand and have some deep questions most people
they don't have any deep questions about life and another
deep function of ideology is to prevent self reflection the
ideology prevents you from looking inwards why is that because
if you looked in words you would discover your true
nature if you looked in words deeply enough and what
you would discover there is actually that you're nothing and
that your true nature is completely empty and precisely not
all of these things that you've been identifying with your
whole life including your body and all your images and
all your cultural attachments and all the roles that you
play and all the identities and all the masks you
wear it's precisely not any of those things those are
all constructions that requires a lot of deep self reflection
so ideology prevents that self reflection from even getting started
because it's so dangerous because it actually involves physical death
to realize this that uh that you don't even want
to go down that path you don't even want to
begin you don't even want to take one step down
that path at least most people don't for most people
ideology happens through imprinting they get imprinted with it as
they're growing up because you see when you're born you're
born knowing absolutely nothing and so you're just thrown into
this life into this reality and you're trying to make
sense of it and you have no idea what any
of it is like when you start you don't really
even know who your mother and your father are or
what that even means you see how deep of a
problem this is you know nothing you don't know why
you're here what you're meant to do here what's right
what's wrong you don't know what's safe you don't know
what's gonna kill you you don't know if you can
stick your hand in that fire you don't know if
you can stick your tongue in that electrical socket you
don't know anything all right so as you're growing up
your number one priority is survival and so you quickly
have to learn and assemble some kind of models of
reality to allow you to survive and not to die
not to jump off a cliff or not to run
across the street when cars are coming right if to
quickly build up your reality and as a kid that's
what you're doing and you're not doing it perfectly you
do get hurt you break your leg you break a
finger you stick your hand in the fire you burn
yourself blah blah blah stuff happens to you right pain
suffering and so quickly through pain and suffering you learn
the stuff you shouldn't be doing and as you're doing
that your parents are quickly teaching you stuff your school
is filling your mind with information you have no idea
what you're being filled with you have no idea how
to check if it's true or not you don't know
they teach you math you don't know if it's true
you have no eye you just accept it they choose
you science you have no idea your stupid little kid
you just accept it religion you just accept it you
accept everything cuz you don't know any better so whatever
you're imprinted with that's what you got that's what creates
your sense of reality it's not about the truth of
the content of the things that you're being imprinted with
it's just about what gets imprinted into you first that's
what you consider true and then by the time you're
around twenty your brain and mind just sort of solidifies
it matures and it locks in it's not growing so
quickly anymore and and now your identity has formed now
you have a sense of who you are cuz you
were a teenager in high school and you develop your
sense of identity and now you think you know everything
now you think you know who you are you think
you're cool you're hot and whatever you think you are
that's who you are a man a woman a trans
a gay of this is but whatever whatever race you
think you are whatever ethnicity you think you are whatever
religion you think you are you've created this identity and
now you fused who you physically are with this programming
and where does programming come from were you some brilliant
Einstein sitting in a cave in a basement somewhere coming
up with all this stuff no it came from your
culture and all your friends and teachers and parents and
all this it's highly unaligned to be exactly like your
parents in your beliefs exactly like your culture exactly like
your friends and teachers with a few rare exceptions mostly
you're just like them because you're completely unoriginal so you
were programmed with this to such an extent that you
got very comfortable with it such that you don't even
know any alternatives such that you think that this is
reality because this is this is all you've known so
you were born as this nothing a blank slate and
now you come into the world and you've been programmed
with all this crap and now you think you are
this crap that you've been programmed with and you feel
so comfortable with it that now you will defend it
to the death as actually being you and now you'll
run around spreading it you'll write books shoot videos or
leave stupid snarky YouTube comments about this and about that
you'll judge or criticize or demonize you'll you'll hate Islam
or Christianity you'll hit science you'll hate God you'll hate
this whatever you hate you hate that you create an
identity out of it that's why you hate it and
now that you're gonna be doing that as like a
robot zombie for the rest of your life without understanding
why you're doing it or what the the deep dynamics
of it are and also all of this creates a
a sense of belonging for you which satisfies the belonging
need which is a very important need that humans have
you have a need to belong to feel like you
belong to some tribe to a community of people even
if you're an individualist like even if you fancy yourself
some individuals libertarian freedom for all free markets this sort
of thing you're not doing that alone why are you
libertarian out of a sense of belonging that very label
libertarian makes you belong with all the other libertarian friends
who think just like you who think that their individualist
when in fact of course it's all just a group
thing see so religion gives you a sense of belonging
science gives you a sense of belonging post-modernism gives you
a sense of belonging whatever you believe your race your
ethnicity your heritage it all gives you a sense of
belonging and it makes you feel all nice and warm
and snuggly inside and it makes you feel like okay
yeah I got I got figured out here I know
what this is basically doing I know how to survive
in life and that's all true until one day you
experience something out of the blue something radically new something
very different something that jars you out of your sense
of complacency such that you no longer feel like you
belong or you start to suspect that you're sort of
living in the matrix and all this stuff that you
thought was real maybe it's not so real anymore and
you start to question it and as you pull on
that thread the the sweater unravels more and more and
more and all of a sudden you start to feel
like you belong less and less and less and as
your self actualizing you're listening more and more to me
talk all the sudden you can't relate to your friends
to your co-workers to your job anymore to your to
your political party anymore to your coworkers - your sports
team - any kind of spiritual attachments you had even
scientific ideas even secular ideas you can't even relate to
them anymore because now you're getting into spirituality and you
can't relate to spiritual people either because they're ideological and
dogmatic so it's like you're lost you don't belong anywhere
and so then you start to create an identity out
of actualize not org so that now you can think
of yourself as belonging to actualize I don't remember you
think you're an actual Iser or you're now doing non-duality
or whatever and then you you try to get your
sense of belonging that way because deep down you're all
alone you came into this world completely alone and really
if you're honest you're completely alone even right now in
even in the midst of all the that you got
in your life all the friends and family and kids
and wife and all this whatever you've got going even
in the midst of all that you're still fundamentally alone
and disconnected and that's still there inside you haven't faced
that really and so that's what you do is you
run around and you busy yourself filling your life with
a bunch of distractions and to create a sense of
belonging a sense of identity and a sense of reality
in a sense that oh no I got this figured
out but then of course you've only got it figured
out so long as reality is going your way as
soon as reality stops going your way the hits the
fan you have a conniption cuz cuz you realize that
you ain't got it figured out you know you lose
your job your wife leaves you when your kids dies
your dog gets run over by a car etc and
all of a sudden you don't gotta figure it out
anymore you take some psychedelic trip you take too many
mushrooms Halden sudden you don't got to figure it out
anymore umm and the whole facade this whole ideological facade
starts to crumble why do ideologues spread their ideology why
are they so passionate about that because spreading distracts from
self-reflection spreading consumes a lot of time and energy you
could spend the next 20 years of your life spreading
something whatever your religion your science your atheism your skepticism
your political affiliation your gender politics your environmental ideas your
veganism or actualized at work whatever you got a spread
right that takes a lot of time and energy which
should properly be used on self-reflection so this is what
I call the lesser jihad the lesser jihad is alluring
to yourself outwards and wasting a lot of your time
crusading against stuff in the world the greater jihad is
turning inwards and self reflecting so ideology gives ideologues a
foe life purpose what do I mean by a foe
life a fake life purpose if you've taken my life
purpose course you might know how powerful life purpose is
most people don't realize how powerful life purpose is even
though I keep talking about the course but still goes
over people's heads but what you see it's also possible
to create a sort of fake life purpose and this
is what a lot of intellectuals do a lot of
these public intellectuals who are ideologues they create a sense
of life purpose for themselves but it's grounded in spreading
an ideology and this is what is happening for example
with the radical Islam why is radical Islam so appealing
in areas in the Middle East because the Middle East
is rather underdeveloped stage red and blue mostly in those
places you know places like Afghanistan it's mostly red in
Afghanistan even purple like it's super underdeveloped there Afghanistan Yemen
Iraq these sorts of places right so purple to red
level of development maybe a little hints of blue difficult
to make a living difficult to start a family difficult
to start a business difficult to do personal development work
so what do you got like you got nothing there
then people who live there they got nothing so in
that situation some preacher comes to you I mean all
you've really got is Islam but it's a purple red
version of Islam bluish version of Islam so you got
some preacher who comes to you maybe he's blue and
he can preach some good Islamic scriptures to you and
you feel like aw man that's that's something that's something
I can hold on to and then you build your
life purpose around that and pretty soon you're radicalized you
got no real good career prospects or anything like that
you can't really develop a serious genuine deep life purpose
the way that I talked about in my course because
in those countries there's not enough infrastructure to allow you
to do that in many cases of course don't make
that a limiting belief but in many cases you know
it's hard too much harder to do it there than
in Western democracies and and so this person takes on
the life purpose of be hub becoming a jihadi and
blowing himself up or helping them make bombs or train
whatever right why does that happen because because it serves
the egos deficiency needs it's a way to get a
sense of belonging with compatriots and friends it's a way
to get a sense of identity a sense of who
you are it's a it's a way to get a
sense of direction and clarity in your life because if
you're lost at least now when you're making bombs you
got a sense of direction you're doing something for some
cause it doesn't even matter that it's is it because
it a good cause a bad cause is it killing
innocent people not to say that that's a that's a
tertiary concern what matters is that now you have a
sense of direction you as a self eat a sense
of direction in life so now you got that maybe
they're paying you some money so you got that maybe
you even start to go to a party here and
there because you're hanging out with friends ever they introduce
you to a girl so maybe you even get a
wife so now you got that now you got a
family now you got kids you got to pay the
kids and it's providing you money for doing that so
see all your deficiency needs are being met by your
ideology and by your identity but of course don't think
that that's only happening in a or Afghanistan somewhere it's
happening right now it's happening to some of the most
prominent intellectuals that you see on YouTube and in the
media writing books and giving speeches and tours and lectures
and all this they're doing the exact same thing it's
a faux life purpose the reason it's a faux life
purpose is because it really it's your only satisfying your
deficiency needs and your your what you're doing is that
you're clinging to some position and now you're advocating and
spreading that position and that's not what life purpose is
supposed to be about I mean like you look at
Alex Jones he certainly created a life purpose for himself
with his work he's been doing that for like 10
or 20 years now right but that would not be
what I would consider huh you know a genuine true
life purpose because I he's totally bought into it like
for him it's serving all of his deficiency needs and
that's all that that ego cares about damn the cost
doesn't matter who's hurt or whatever happens none of that
matters it's it's a sense of direction and it's a
way to become successful and these people once they start
to become successful the money just validates the ideology because
the person thinks that oh well I have got millions
of subscribers and followers and I've got a book deal
and a thousand people came to my lecture series and
I get all these positive comments and emails and all
this so that must mean I'm doing something right that
means it can't be a faux life purpose that means
it must be real and so through this a self-fulfilling
prophecy effect occurs such that then this person gets stuck
in this ideology and to them it doesn't feel like
an ideology it feels like life feels like reality feels
like truth it feels like they're a a messenger for
the truth for the good that they're fighting against the
evil ones the postmodernist the Socialists the globalists the the
Communists the villains the terrorists the this that whoever the
enemy is you're fighting against them and it feels good
you have a sense of direction but actually it's a
it's a facade of a life purpose a true life
purpose would be satisfying your being needs not just your
deficiency needs and that comes from Abraham Maslow's hierarchy you
know the bottom the pyramid is deficiency needs the very
top of the pyramid is being needs which very few
people get to and you can't really blame this very
tricky stuff this is super tricky stuff this takes years
to understand all these subtle and tricky dynamics the mind
is extremely self deceptive as I've elaborated on in my
three-part series called self deception mechanisms why do I D
log spread their ideology it gives the mind security in
an otherwise insecure world and it avoids the pain of
going through an existential crisis think about it think about
it from the position of one of these big-name celebrity
intellectuals who's actually an ideologue think about how difficult it
would be for them to admit that their entire career
and life's work and all their success is predicated upon
an ideological position and that what they're really doing is
that they are engaged in the lesser jihad not the
greater jihad think of how painful that would be you'd
have to give up hundreds of thousands of dollars adoring
fans sex and career prospects and the ability to feed
your family your very livelihood all of that is at
stake and now you have to give all that up
in the name of truth hell no you think they're
gonna do that hell no no they're not gonna do
that that thought is not even going to enter their
mind because of how painful it would be to go
through that kind of existential crisis to re tool your
entire career from the ground up to admit you've been
wrong to admit you've deceived people deluded yourself and others
that you've been engaged in the lesser jihad just like
those savages in the Middle East to admit that come
on that's that's that's huge like that takes balls that
takes real balls to go through the pain of admitting
that no ego will want to admit that instead the
Eagle will hump with excuses rationalizations scientific evidence theories and
studies to back up why everything is doing is correct
tricky stuff huh ideology is very useful for manipulating the
masses that's also why it's so widespread it eliminates independent
and careful thinking nuanced thinking because it radicalizes people so
because of this this allows people who know how to
use and manipulate ideology to create a power base so
it's really about power and of course who loves power
the ego loves power the ego is power-hungry the ego
wants all the goodies that come with power and wealth
and success sex and luxury and amenities and lodge and
the the easy life and the flashy things the gadgets
the clothes and the watches and all this the reputation
the status the acclaim the love that comes with it
all this comes with power and it's super addictive to
the ego you taste a little bit of power and
you want more and more and more it's insatiable ideology
gives you the power to mobilize a mob because once
you've eliminated their independent thinking they've become a mob and
his group think and it's just uniform and also you
radicalized it therefore you've made it very emotional therefore it's
there to trigger and push its buttons just by saying
some one thing or scapegoating some one situation somebody does
something you scapegoat them the whole mob gets riled up
you can use that mob now to do whatever you
want it to do you have power with power comes
wealth with power comes sex which are all your core
biological needs it's not like just all sex like you
just want to have some hot girl or it's like
oh well if I just want some fancy car no
no no this is what your whole survival is right
you understand we're living in a modern society which is
the equivalent of what it would be like a hundred
thousand years ago you living in the forest hunting for
squirrels whether with a stick so the modern-day equivalent of
hunting for squirrels with a stick so you don't starve
to death is money business eyeballs fans sex with some
hot girl with fake tits and driving a Lamborghini that's
the modern-day equivalent of being in the forest hunting with
a stick and maybe once in a while you catch
a deer or something you got enough meat to share
with your friends so they love you for it and
maybe you've got some some fancy cheese seashells at the
seashore and you made a necklace out of them and
that's your Lamborghini that's what that is today the 21st
century so of course within human society because we have
the capacity to use language and oratory and logic and
ideology what we can do is we can rile up
a mob a personal mob I can create a personal
mob of my own which I can use to serve
all of my survival needs and then these these vocal
fanatics who are going to be part of my mob
they are gonna be loyal adoring fans of mine who
will kiss my ass and do me all the favors
that I want from giving me to buying me things
to hosting me parties and inviting me out to their
houses to sleep at to travel around the world all
this right this is super easy I could do this
if I want to do this with actualize that already
I could do it tomorrow all of this all of
it super easy if I wanted to and it's extremely
easy to sell to a uniformed emotional mob who's afraid
and who has some enemy that we're gonna scapegoat super
easy to sell stuff the easiest way to sell stuff
because when you have very nuanced independently thinking highly conscious
individuals it's hard to sell to them the only thing
you could sell to them is something that will actually
help to raise their consciousness which eliminates a whole ton
of that you could sell whereas if you have a
dumb uniform emotional mob you could sell them all sorts
of right like if I got you riled up about
the fact that the end of the world is coming
next year I can start selling you MREs survival kits
you know cans of food buckets of food and guns
and bullets and camo gas masks you know whatever for
the zombie apocalypse that's coming next year I can start
to sell you all that if all I do is
I just build up an ideology in your mind over
a course of 10 or 20 episodes that this is
really real and it's coming and you start to believe
it you're gonna start to buy that up and you're
gonna thank me for it and I could charge you
double for it you see how this works not to
mention I haven't even even gotten into the political aspects
of how you can use these mobs to effect what's
happening in the political sphere you can actually get people
elected or kicked out of office and all the power
and wealth and prestige and status that comes with that
with being able to have that kind of power that's
what's going on it's going on right now see how
the game is played so what's the opposite of ideology
then open-mindedness not knowing experience consciousness being presence truth actual
truth not truth conceptualized or truth it's belief but actual
truth actual truth this is right actual truth right right
now this is actual truth an empty mind wisdom detachment
and unconditional love these are all the opposites of ideology
and now you can see why I'm so big talking
about ideology and we're going to so much detail because
look what we're Altima after with development and with self-actualization
is to have everything I just listed so the enemy
of that is ideology rather than just listening and believing
me what I would like you to do is to
actually experience directly in your experience what it feels like
to not be ideological you can actually hit this point
where you sit down sit down with a journal contemplate
what ideology is and ultimately relinquish all your ideology so
much that you get to this point of just not
knowing presence just being very present in the moment right
now and just conscious and completely open with no attachments
no positions nothing getting to that point it's sort of
like a meditative state it's a very present state of
mind empty mind what does then folks would call no
mind getting to that is what I want you to
try to experiment with that will be one of your
homework assignments from this episode because you need to not
just listen to me talking bad about ideology you need
to actually within your direct experience feel the distinction between
being ideological and not like really not by dropping a
lot of this stuff and to to feel what that
feels like that's very important for you to hit that
point that's an experiential thing you can't just believe me
on you got to do it notice that any sage
any really high quality teacher will always try to steer
their students away from ideology in the manner in which
they teach their entire teaching style will be such that
they're trying to get you away from ideology trying not
to fill your mind with beliefs trying to not have
you blindly believing in what they're saying and that's what
the greatest spiritual sages and teachers do they try not
to tell you the answers which is something I'm kind
of bad at because I like to give you all
the answers so you've got to be extra careful with
me because a lot of people easily confuse the things
that I teach with ideology and that's just because I
sort of just pummel you with answers but these answers
are coming a lot of times from my own direct
experiences and my own contemplations stuff that I've worked on
for years for decades sometimes and so yeah you can
easily turn it into an ideology if you're not careful
enlightened masters and sages are really really good they're masterful
at being able to steer students away from ideology precisely
because ideology is the greatest obstacle to awakening to consciousness
consciousness is inversely proportional to ideology and also be careful
not to confuse being non ideological as me saying that
you need to be some lukewarm moderate milk-toast position taker
who just takes the average or middle of every position
as though you have no strong opinions on anything and
that you could take it this way or that way
doesn't matter it's like is global warming true or is
it not true well let's just what the difference or
it's like is our neo-nazis correct or are the social
justice warriors correct oh well let's just take the that
the midway point no that's not what I'm saying at
all Sage's can have strong opinions and strong positions on
things and in fact sages are more radical in their
understanding of reality than ideologues in many cases they have
some radical positions but the difference is that they're detached
and they're cool and they're not doing it from a
position of creating an identity out of it that's the
key you see not in the content the key is
are you creating an identity out of it are you
attached to it it might sound like what I'm telling
you with all this is that everything is relative and
that there is no such thing as the absolute truth
because after all Leo if you start talking about the
absolute doesn't that make you an ideologue and here's where
it's really ironic and paradoxical is that there is an
absolute truth and you can access it and have it
and know it and be it but it's so different
than what the ideologue thinks the absolute is that it's
not even in the same ballpark and that it has
nothing to do with ideology whatsoever and that it's not
even within the domain of the mind it's a totally
different thing this thing that I'm calling the absolute this
is this is something that you can't even imagine is
possible it's completely outside the realm of your reality and
it has nothing to do with beliefs or with ideology
so sometimes people hear me talking about the absolute or
the truth with a capital T and they'll say all
that mean leo is an ideologue because Leo thinks he's
got the absolute and that's just a conflation that's a
surface similarity that's a similarity in words to really experience
the actual absolute that's a life-changing thing and it's got
nothing to do with ideology and once you experience that
you'll know what it is and you'll know why it
is the way I say it is and until then
you won't understand and until then you're very likely to
confuse it with ideology which is why enlightened masters and
sages tend to not talk about enlightenment or tell you
what the absolute is they prefer to say silent because
they know you'll just confuse it for ideology and you'll
turn it into ideology so let's answer some frequently asked
questions is non duality and ideology and the answer is
no it's not but you can easily turn it into
an ideology and certainly many people throughout history have done
exactly that in fact that's what all religion is religion
is what you get when you turn idea non-duality into
an ideology and it's a it's a very common trap
it's very easy to commit this trap even if you
think you're not committing it you're still probably gonna come
in it many many times in your life so just
watch out but non-duality itself is absolute it's the ultimate
truth it is what's actually happening right now as I'm
standing here and talking to you is non duality non-duality
is the case it's always the case there's no alternative
to non duality it's the one and only way reality
is but that's not an ideology that's not something you
believe that's something that is actually happening right now that
you're either conscious of or you're not so non duality
is about your level of consciousness not about what you
think or believe you could have a broken brain such
that you're not able to think anymore or believe or
even remember any memories or even have a sense of
self and so you won't have an ideology at that
point but non-duality will still be the case if you're
conscious of it the next question is is actualized organ
ideology and the answer also is it's not intended to
be and I am I way to talk about all
these epistemic topics which are very nerdy complicated lengthy philosophical
sounding they bore people they turn people off they cost
me subscribers I go out of my way to talk
about it precisely because if I don't the danger is
you'll fall into turning actualized I don't work into an
ideology so nothing I say should be taken on faith
nothing I say should just be blindly believed you can
believe it tentatively for the sake of going out there
and then verifying it for yourself so you shouldn't actively
try to disbelieve me on everything like some skeptics try
to do because that would be counterproductive but you do
need to verify you do need to contemplate for yourself
think through it go read other sources lives and other
teachers hundreds of sources experience radical things go do psychedelics
go do this go do that go meditate go go
on retreats you know do all this stuff so that
what I'm teaching you doesn't turn into an ideology because
if all you're doing is you're sitting there watching these
every week and you're taking no action and not doing
even half the stuff that I say then it will
become an ideology for you and therefore you will you
will shoot yourself in the foot and more than just
shooting yourself in the foot you will then spread that
ideology because the ideology is not gonna stop with you
you will spread your version of actualized ideology to other
people and you will infect their minds with your own
misconceptions and delusions because you're lazy and you don't wanna
do any work you'll do that and then they'll do
that to other people and then you'll turn this into
a religion and that's how religion starts another question Leo
how is science an ideology you keep alluding to this
idea that science is somehow an ideology but how can
this be the case isn't science the opposite of an
ideology and I'm not gonna answer that here because that's
a super in-depth question I'm gonna have episodes in the
future that address the nature of science and problems within
science and how science is an ideology but for now
I'll just leave it to you sit down with a
notebook and contemplate how is science and ideology and if
you're open-minded and you really want to know the answer
through that contemplation process you will discover many profound answer
to that question which I will also reiterate in my
future episodes another question Leo what do I do if
I discover that I have an ideology how do I
get rid of it and the answer that is to
deconstruct it so to get rid of an ideology gotta
sit down with a pad of paper and some pencil
or pen and question it to death question all the
assumptions question why you need it why you have it
where it came from what function is serving in your
life why you think it's true question question question question
I don't care what ideology it is if you question
it enough you will eventually discover that it's false because
that's what all ideologies are they're all false they're all
disowning some part of reality they're all serving some sort
of hidden egoic agenda but you know it can take
you a while to discover that I don't think you're
gonna figure that out in ten minutes you might need
to do years of of this sort of work of
deconstruction you know to deconstruct such an ideology as materialist
science or you know if you were raised a Catholic
or a Mormon you know it'll take you years to
deconstruct that but hey you can start right now you
know you can still do a lot of work just
in 30 minutes of contemplating so don't be afraid to
to crack in and start to question all the stuff
that you were taught here's the cool thing about truth
is that you never have to worry about truth being
damaged by questioning you can question until you're blue in
the face and you will never offend or damage the
truth or threaten the truth you'll only get closer and
the only things that you will discard through this questioning
process is falsehood so you really have nothing to lose
other than your entire identity and your entire sense of
reality if it happens to not be true which you
know who knows maybe that turns out to be the
case another question Leo how do I change somebody else's
ideology I have a friend or spouse or child or
somebody or my parents who are very ideological and I
want to change them well this is tricky very tricky
very tricky problem if someone has a strong ideology and
they're closed-minded and they don't want to question which of
course is gonna tend to be the case because that's
why they have the ideology in the first place is
because they don't want to experience new stuff they don't
want to see new perspectives it's gonna be very difficult
for you to change their ideology and basically you can't
the person has to want to so be careful about
going around and bashing people for being ideologues and getting
them to change cuz what you'll actually do is you'll
make them a defensive you'll make them attack you if
you try to attack them or try to question them
too much so you got to find a person who's
at the point in their life where they're open-minded enough
that they're they're willing to explore new perspectives and if
you can get into that to that point or if
they're already there rather then then you have to try
to expose them to new perspectives so like see maybe
maybe your your spouse or your parents or your coworker
or somebody who you want to open their mind you
know maybe go try to do some ayahuasca retreat with
them and see will they go with you are they
open to that idea and if they are then yeah
do that with them help them through that process make
it as comfortable as you can make it for them
so they don't freak out and you know encourage them
to do it so that they think that they have
some companionship and some camaraderie from you and then if
they do it then that will blow their whole reality
open now of course you know how most people probably
aren't ready for an ayahuasca thing but um you know
just even by introducing books some of the books I
have on my book list you can you can give
those out to people for Christmas presents birthday presents you
know as long as they're open-minded enough and those books
one of those books can change someone's entire life if
you give it to them at the right time and
if they're ready for it you know of course sharing
my videos or sharing other people's videos who talk about
similar things getting people to travel to new places new
parts of the world places that are very different culturally
and they've experienced that starts to open people up so
just starting to introduce them to new ideas by having
conversations with them books psychedelics travel go to a workshop
or a retreat in your area go to a meditation
retreat you have a pasta or treat together there's all
sorts of opportunities here introduce them to spiral dynamics that
can be a powerful model to help open people up
so you got a lot to work with but they
do have to be open mind and like I say
there's there's no cure for closed mindedness a close minded
person is is a goner like if they're really close
minded they're a goner and can't help them it's sort
of like they've uh they've been they've been bitten by
a zombie and there's no there's no cure so as
I'm wrapping up here let me just conclude and tie
all this together by saying that we live in polarizing
times forces right now are trying to polarize you in
the political domain in the social domain and the cultural
domain and in many other domains and you need to
be wise enough not to let them you need to
be able to see through this whole ideological game that's
being played with in our culture and society and especially
on the internet - there's a lot of this polarization
going on in the internet don't believe anyone who demonizes
other people that's an immediate red flag highly conscious people
will almost never ever demonize scapegoat or blame anyone that's
Anathem unto consciousness low consciousness people behave that way do
not let anyone distract you with all this nonsense all
these culture Wars all these lesser jihads from your own
inner work from you sitting down and devoting the time
to contemplate to meditate to self-reflect make sure that you
make a distinction between ideological teachers and teachings and non-ideological
teachers and teachings and stay away from the ideological ones
or at the very least if you do partake in
them are taking it lightly don't take it too seriously
and be careful with letting them radicalize you because oftentimes
you find a seductive ideology which fits in with some
deficiency need that you have or you just get some
emotional reward from listening to somebody on somebody else or
demonize somebody else some other culture some other group of
people or some other politician or whatever you get a
you get a kick out of that so you just
keep watching and listening and listening and you go down
this rabbit hole and after a few years of that
you've become like them they've turned you into an ideological
zombie also be sure you understand that just because someone
has the air of scientific talk about them that does
not mean that they're not pushing an ideology just because
someone sounds rational or just because someone is secular that
does not mean they're not pushing some ideology on you
secular ideologies are some of the most subtle and sneaky
forms of ideology and science is something that ideologues love
to use to justify whatever ideology they've got makes it
seem very legit also I want you to notice that
an ideological person has a certain demeanor about them they
have a certain energy they have a certain way that
they talk they they make certain mannerisms and certain expressions
there's certain things that they do that they can't help
because they're an ideologue so look for those by studying
ideological people look for those red flags and get really
good training your filters for spotting that and also very
importantly train yourself to spot ideology as it arises within
you so what you'll notice if you become mindful and
start to pay more attention to your own body and
to your own psyche you'll feel yourself becoming ideological about
certain issues at certain times and then you feel the
emotions that arise within you emotions of wanting to lash
out to attack to blame to criticize to demonize or
to get defensive and get protective or get scared when
somebody questions you or in a debate someone makes some
point that makes you fearful of being wrong stuff like
that used to feel that on the inside and that
shows you that oh yeah that's that's my ideology that's
something I got a deconstruct so learn to feel it
develop awareness over that and just remember that the number-one
rule of life again is do not be ideological and
now we're done with this episode but I have some
homework assignments for you firstly I want you to contemplate
using a journal from scratch ignoring everything I've said here
what is ideology what is the purpose of ideology why
does ideology exist and how am i ideological by wish
of course I don't mean me I mean you how
are you ideological that's gonna be your homework for the
next week go deep on it contemplate from scratch isolate
yourself in a bubble from all the stuff that I
told you here today and then a week later you
can come and compare to come back and compare your
answers to my answers and see what you got right
and wrong and so forth and and also lastly what
I have for you is actually have a worksheet with
a lot of civic questions that will help you to
take your contemplation deeper asking all sorts of questions about
how to suss out your own ideologies that are subtle
ones so go download the free worksheet click on the
link down below you'll find it there and work on
that worksheet as you also do this contemplation in your
journal and that's it for this episode all-righty please click
that like button for me don't forget and come check
out actualize that org that's my website I've got resources
there for you that are exclusive and potentially life-changing from
the stuff that I post on my blog to the
forum where you can interact with people and get a
sense of belonging if you need that for support the
life purpose course the book list which has a lot
of books that will open your mind and maybe open
the minds of many of your friends and colleagues and
family members and so forth and the last thing that
I'll just end on here is remember that actualize that
or cannot work without contemplation our whole project here of
turning you into a sage making you more conscious and
explaining all these diverse topics that I talked about this
whole project of personal development cannot work unless you're gonna
contemplate these things that I talked about for yourself from
scratch and derive the answers and to see the logic
of it and to see why the things I say
are true or maybe to discover that certain things I
say aren't true contemplation is required so start developing that
habit in the future I'm going to be basically ending
every single episode by telling you to contemplate the stuff
that I talked about and giving you various questions and
if you're not developing this habit then you're not gonna
be doing these assignments and you're gonna lose the majority
of the value from these episodes and the last thing
that I'll tell you about is this little resource that
I'm going to create on the forum we're gonna create
a mega thread of examples of ideology that are found
in the media and through YouTube videos so we're gonna
have all sorts of ideologies religious ones secular one rationalist
ones atheist ones will post a bunch of them there'll
be hundreds of videos there in the end so that
will be sort of like a case study in ideology
you can come there and look at those study those
and to see you know how is the stuff that
I'm talking about expressed today right now in the 21st
century and our political climate all the stuff that's happening
all around us and you'll see live examples of that
it's really fun to look at those and you can
contribute your own examples so for a link to that
check down below and there will be a link to
the mega threat you
