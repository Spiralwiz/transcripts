Happy Holidays. I'm Leo from actualised.org. And in this special
holiday edition, I'm going to talk about how to practice
gratitude. Gratitude is a topic you hear talked about a
lot, if you've immersed yourself even a little bit in
personal development, literature, or self help books or seminars, or
even watching some YouTube video or system, some TED videos,
so a lot of people talk about gratitude nowadays. And
that's because, actually, the positive psychology movement, which has been
really active over the last 20, or 30 years, has
been quite a lot of research about gratitude. And they've
done some actual like studies and science on this stuff,
where they actually take people. And what they do is
they force them to do a daily gratitude journal, or
to just think about the things that they're grateful for
in their life. And if someone does that, is forced
to do that for let's say, 30 days, some of
these studies took did it for a whole month, and
then they query the person as to how happy they
are in their life, at the beginning of that phase
before they were doing any gratitude work. And then the
end of that phase, after 30 days of gratitude work,
what they discover is that you have about a 20%
increase in overall happiness and satisfaction with life. So that's
a pretty cool finding, pretty popular, finding a lot of
people talking about that finding. So that being the case,
you know, one of the kind of one of the
cliche things that people say in self help is practice
gratitude, practice gratitude. And there's something here. So let's talk
a little bit about how to use gratitude effectively, and
what you should be grateful about, and also some of
the ways in which it doesn't work. So one of
the real advantages of gratitude here is that there's a
trap, there's a trap that we fall into, as we're
going through our life, when we're not doing personal development,
or we're not conscious about what we're doing. And that
trap is trying to build the perfect life. I've gotten
caught in this trap a lot. When I first started,
it was about building that amazing career, then I figured,
okay, if I get my career into shape, and I
get that perfect, then you know, I'm going to make
sure I have a really perfect business to I'm gonna
get my finances into shape, too. So I want to
have a perfect career and perfect finances. And then after
that, I'm gonna have like a perfect place to live
by myself that dream house in a dream place, I'm
going to set it up all perfect inside, how nice
car and everything, they're nice furniture, and then I'm gonna
have a perfect relationship to some of the work on
myself to get this relationship going. And then after I
do that, I'm going to have some perfect hobbies to
really be really great at music, I'm gonna be really
great at meditation. And we really know, well read and
smart. And then I'm going to have some amazing friends.
And so you get into this kind of syndrome of
constructing the perfect life. And actually, I think this is
one of the things that draws you into personal development
as the you you see, after studying a little person,
the moment you're like, Oh, damn, I can actually do
this, it's actually possible, it's actually possible to go out
there and construct a very amazing life. The problem with
that, though, is that it does become a like a
rat race to try to do that. And it's almost
like, the more you try to get there, the less
you're able to get there, it's almost like you can
compare to trying to hit the light barrier, right? Nothing
can travel faster than the speed of light, at least
as far as we know nowadays. And what's interesting is
that as an object approaches the maximum Lightspeed, what's happens
is that that object, if it's a physical object, it
actually requires more and more energy to make it go
faster and faster and faster. And so what basically happens
is that the way this limit is regulated in nature,
by physics, is that literally, this object with a certain
mass is going to require an infinite number, amount of
energy in order to make it go at lightspeed, which,
of course, is impossible there No, no amount of energy
like that exists, you need energy, the whole universe to
make it go so fast. So it's kind of like
that, with trying to construct a perfect life, the more
you're trying to put everything together perfectly, the more than
starts to backfire on you. Because actually, what you discover
is that, well, you don't have that much control over
life. Like you've got control over a lot of things
in your life. But you don't have perfect control. You
can't set everything up perfectly. And even if you did
do that, life is always changing and shifting and morphing.
And so because of this, what's gonna happen is that
even if you do manage to construct a perfect life,
for one day, what happens the next day or the
next month or the next year? You know, the shit
hits the fan, something gets out of line. And if
you're always like paranoid about trying to put everything perfectly
into place, then your life becomes actually very stressful and
unhappy, rather than happy because the whole reason you're pursuing
this perfect life scenario, is because you're telling yourself well,
that would be heaven on earth. That would be perfect
happiness. Actually what'd you learn after trying that? For a
few years, as you see it, wait a minute, this
is, this is never gonna work, it's impossible. It's like
trying to take a bullet and make it go Lightspeed,
you're not ever going to make a bullet go Lightspeed
because it's got too much masculine or too much energy
to, to hit, to hit that peak. And so that's
the problem here. So, gratitude, though, is really effective for
combating this, this tendency towards perfectionism in your own life,
and with personal development. So this is where I really
like to use it. And the way that it works
is basically, you know, you have to, yes, you have
to go out there and build that awesome life. We're
all about that. That's important. But you also have to
accept that, like, you know what, life is pretty good
right? Now, I don't need the perfect car to make
my life perfect. I don't need the perfect wife, or
the perfect boyfriend to make my life perfect. I don't
need the perfect career. Even though I can be working
on all those things. Sure, I could want them, I
could have like a, you know, a desire for those
things. But also, it's cool to just be able to
stand back and say, You know what? I'm cool with
what I got right now, too. And, in fact, there's
a lot of stuff that I'm forgetting about, there's so
much that my mind forgets about so much stuff that
I have accomplished in my life, so much stuff that
I have, that I was just given that I didn't
even have to work for, I was just given it
just because of where I grew up who my parents
were, and all these other kinds of circumstances that were
largely, you know, not constructed by me. But I am
benefiting from them. So this is what gratitude really comes
in. Now, gratitude is not to be taken as a
replacement for work and discipline. This is another trap that
I that I see some people falling into, especially the
more kind of hippie ish, airy fairy, New Age type
of thinking, or, you know, certain circles within person development,
kind of like this new this New Age stuff. And
the mindset that they have there is that, well, I'll
just be gratitude, everything's so perfect, everything's great. You know,
we're living in this amazing time, everything's, Everything's beautiful, every
person is beautiful, every situation is beautiful. And so what
they do is they take that mindset. And sure, you
know, that might work great for you. If you're honestly
believing that and you can, you can believe that if
you want to. But then what happens is that, like,
you actually use that as an excuse not to actually
do any hardcore personal development, like hardcore personal means you
actually have to like, you have to identify problems and
challenges, you have to go and fix those problems and
challenges. If you've got a low money in your bank
account, that's a real challenge, you should go and fix
that at some point. If you've got a career that
you hate, deep down inside, but then you're telling yourself,
oh, everything's lovely, everything's nice. And you're being too lazy
to go out there and change careers. Because in fact,
you're just too scared, and you're telling yourself, everything's nice,
but actually, inside you're, you're too scared to make the
career transition, then that's not serving you well. So don't
fall into that trap, you still need to practice hard
work, discipline, analyze your life, have goals, all this kind
of stuff is still very important. But also practice gratitude.
So it's not an either or it's a both. The
way that you practice gratitude, very commonly, is something called
the gratitude journal, you can literally keep a journal, whether
it's a physical journal, a notebook, maybe it's in your
cell phone, maybe it's on your computer, I personally have
one of my laptop, I don't like to use my
cell phone for taking notes, I do it on the
laptop. So that's where I have it. And there you
can, you can type stuff out, type out exactly what
you're aiming for. And the idea here is that it's
just short and simple. So literally, it's just like creating
a list. So what does this look like? Well, let's
say you wake up in the morning, get out of
the shower, you finish your morning routine. And at the
end of your morning routine, you go to your computer,
and then you type down five or 10 things that
you're grateful for. And these can be literally, you know,
a bunch of different random stuff. And I'm going to
give you a list towards the end of this video
about some of the stuff that I think you should
really consider being grateful for. So that's basically it, you
write them out, you think about them a little bit,
and then you close your computer and you go off
and you live your day. And the idea is just
that practice alone right there. And it can be as
as little as two minutes. It could take you as
little as two minutes to do that exercise. If you
do that on a daily habitual basis, then it will
increase your happiness. Because what gratitude does is it makes
you feel like you don't need to chase or to
seek anything anymore. And this is a really important element
to being happy to be happy. You can't be chasing
after happiness. If you're chasing after happiness, you're not happy
in the moment. And then when you think that you're
going oh well maybe a month from now we'll actually
achieve I'll finally catch happiness. What happens that you don't
actually ever catch happiness because the way that your brain,
your brain and your mind is constructed is that it's
always coming up with new goals. So there's always the
next thing that you want to seek. So your happiness,
even if you do achieve something, it's going to usually
be very short lived, you're going to feel it for
a day or two, and then it's going to be
gone. And then again, you have to chase for another
year to to achieve it, and then it's gone another
day. So it's really a losing battle this thing. Instead,
what you want to do is you want to try
to be happy, like right now in the exact present.
Second. Are you happy right now? Right now, as you're
listening to me, are you happy? If you are, then
you're happy. And if you're not happy, then you're not
happy. And chasing something is not going to make you
happy. You have to learn how to make yourself happy
right now. And part of that is just to to
accept what the present moment is, without needing to change
it. When you need to change something that's a neurotic
tendency, always having to change stuff to suit yourself. That's
a very kind of neurotic, and self absorbed way to
live life. A better way to live life is just
to be like, hey, it's cool. Like it might not
all be perfect the way I want. But who said
that life is about me everything right now perfect. That's
not how it works. Like, why don't I just be
cool with what is much smarter way to go about
it. Gratitude helps you to do this. So you can
keep a journal. Another thing that I like to do,
I actually I'm actually doing this right now. I don't
keep a gratitude journal, I haven't kept one for quite
a while I did a couple of 30 day challenges
were actually was keeping the journal and I was doing
this as an experiment to see doesn't make me happier.
And it was but the other thing that I don't
like is too much routine in my life. So for
me keeping a journal all the time, you know, opening
up the computer, that can be little bit of a
hassle. So right now what I'm personally experimenting with in
my own life is as part of my morning routine,
I'm incorporating a little mental gratitude exercise. So what this
says is I'm not writing anything down. Just in my
own mind. As soon as I wake up, what I
do is I try to come up with three things
that I'm grateful for. These could be big things, or
these can be little things. Which brings us to the
next point between little things and big things, this is
an important distinction. Because sometimes what you'll want to be
grateful for something very big. So for example, maybe you're
really grateful that you're alive, and that you're healthy, and
that you don't have cancer, that can be an amazing
thing, that's a really huge thing to be grateful for.
You can also be grateful for something very tiny and
minut. For example, you could be grateful when you wake
up in the morning, that you're lying there, and you're
all cozy and warm, just right there in the moment.
Right, it's just a global, very simple thing. Or maybe
as you're brushing your teeth, you can be grateful for
the fact that you've got this nice toothbrush, which is
comfortable to hold in your hands. And maybe when you
go to, to drink your coffee, you're gonna be you're
gonna be granted grateful and happy that you've got this
warm, just perfect temperature coffee, just the way that you
like it. And it's got just the right amount of
milk in and it's got just the right amount of
sugar in it. It's just like perfect. And you just
drink that night. Like perfect, right, you can be just
grateful for one perfect cup of coffee, or whatever, you
know, whatever floats your boat. So big and little things.
The big things are important to be grateful for the
little things also very important. They might actually be more
important. You know why? Because it's the little things that
you take for granted the most, a lot of times.
And in the present moment, the present moment for you
right now is constructed out of little things. It's not
some epic thing. Right? Sure. You might be grateful, for
example, that you made a million dollars last year. And
that could be like, Whoa, that was a huge accomplishment.
Maybe I'll never get that again in my life. I
mean, that could be a great thing. But how often
does that happen to you and your life, not very
often. Instead, what you want is you want to like
be grateful for the stuff that happens consistently and frequently.
So for example, if you're drinking a cup of coffee
every day, and you always got it pretty much the
way you want, you can be grateful for that. And
that's going to be like happiness that you accumulate every
single day, you don't need some sort of epic thing
to happen to you. You don't need to buy $100,000
car, you don't need to buy a new house, you
don't need to get a new career, because those things
happen very infrequently. So that's why the little stuff is
important. That's why it's important to focus your energy and
attention on on the little things. So what I like
to do is I like to mix it up, you
know, in the morning, I'll have one big thing and
maybe two little things that I'm grateful for. Or you'll
have two big things and one little thing. So try
to mix that up like that. And that's it literally
for me in the morning. Right now. It takes me
30 seconds to do this. You know, it's the mental
habit. You have to train yourself. Sometimes you forget, you
have to try again and again and again until you
get more solid. So that's something that I'm experimenting with
presently. And I can feel that it does increase my
happiness a little bit because it makes me more appreciative
of just how amazing life is. It's so easy to
take it for granted. And there's tons of stuff to
be grateful for, you can be grateful for so many
things, I want to help you to generate some of
those ideas right now. So the exercise for this video
that you're going to do for me right now is
you're going to come up with a list of 100
things that you're grateful for about your life, your life,
gratitude could be something that's very personal. It doesn't have
to be this generic stuff, like people say, Oh, I'm
grateful for my family. And I'm grateful for my health.
Make it very specific and custom tailored to you. So
what is it in your life that's really special to
you that you would really hate to lose? That is
really enabling you like, for me personally, one of the
things I'm, you know, I forget about this, but I'm
really grateful for the fact that I got an amazing
education. When I was young, like I really studied hard,
I really worked my ass off. And in many ways
this, put me where I am today, it set the
foundation for so much for me, I'm so glad that
I did that. I'm so glad that I worked so
hard when I was young. Like, that's a very emotional
thing for me to I can be really grateful for
that. Because I could have not done that. That was
a very deliberate choice that I made. And I'm really
grateful that I made that choice. I'm also really grateful
like, for the time that I live in, we're living
in the 21st century. Now. The 21st century is an
amazing time, we have so much stuff now that we
take totally for granted, the technology we have the knowledge
and information we have, all this stuff is so cheap.
So free, technology is so cheap, and virtually free and
in many situations. So it's really like, it's really amazing
that we're living in this time, and also like the
political climate that we're living in so much better than
it was even 100 years ago, or 500 years ago,
let alone 2000 years ago. So this is all kinds
of stuff that you can be grateful for, I want
you at the end of this video, to actually sit
down with either a piece of paper notebook, or your
your laptop or whatever computer actually come up with a
list of 100 of these things. Don't stop until you
do all 100 Don't be lazy and just do 10
Or just to 20 the point of gratitude is to
help you see that there's actually a lot of hidden
stuff that you're missing, right, you're missing a lot. And
if you've never done a gratitude journal exercise before, what
you're gonna discover, when you sit down and actually force
yourself to do this is going to be like, Oh,
damn, like, I can't believe I forgot about this thing
here. And I forgot about that. And oh, five years
ago, I got that achievement and accomplishment. And then 10
years ago, I had that cool thing happen to me
that I'm really grateful for. And then oh, what about
my family? And what about that dog that I had
in fifth grade. So like, all this stuff will come
flooding back to you. This is important because especially for
kind of a personal development junkie like I am, then
you're very future oriented, right? You're always focusing on the
future. And it's like, okay, more, more, more more, how
can I get more money? How can I get a
better car? How can I get more knowledge? How can
I get a better career. This is kind of like
a retrospective, you take a look back, you slow yourself
down, you get a little more contemplative, a little bit
more pensive. It's a really cool state to put yourself
in. So what I want to end on here is
kind of my list of things to be grateful for.
And this is really going to be a list of
categories. So I want you and your list actually get
a lot more specific than this. But this will give
you a lot of ideas and trigger a lot of
stuff for you, hopefully. So the first category is your
home. And just the coziness and comfort of your home
or wherever you're living. Like how amazing is it that
you get to live in this comfortable place? You're sheltered
from the weather from the heat and from the cold
is so comfortable and warm here you've got comfortable furniture,
comfortable carpeting, you've got nice windows, you've got lighting and
you just got this like amazing place that you're living
in. Think about it 10,000 years ago, you would be
living in the forest, basically, in the forest, or in
the grasslands somewhere perhaps in a hot but perhaps not
even in a hot so that's a huge How about
your family and your parents. Think about all that they
allowed you to do. Think about all the things that
they taught you think about all the love that they
gave you think about all the amazing adventures they took
you on. Think about how caring and nurturing they were,
how compassionate understanding they were, how patient they were with
you how much time and money and energy they put
into you. And if you say stuff like well, but
my family no it was a dysfunctional family. And this
thing here literally is my father told me some nasty
stuff and my mom she was a little bit of
abusive to me and this, but think about it even
if you had an abusive mom or you know, ANGRY
DAD or something still you even for the most abusive
families, there's still a lot that the family enables you
to do is so played a critical function in your
life. So there's plenty of stuff for you to be
grateful there. How about your education already covered? My education
is very important to me. Think about how you're educated
the stuff you've learned, the teachers, the professors that you've
encountered, the cool friends that taught you stuff, all the
stuff you've learned all the books you read, maybe there's
that one particular book that really changed the way you
think about relationships. Or maybe there's word there was that
one book that really changed the way you think about
philosophy or history. I'm sure you've got a couple of
those. How about your pets? Think about the pets that
you have and how much enjoyment and love that gives
you dogs, cats, or whatever your thing is, food. Think
about the marvels of modern food. Modern food is pretty
unhealthy. But also think about just what you can do
with food now that you couldn't do 10,000 years ago,
the kind of foods we have now are amazing. Even
an apple, if you took an apple off the shelf
from an American grocery store, and you handed it to
a caveman 10,000 years ago, well, cavemen were longer more
than 500,000 years ago, give it to a caveman I
came to look at this apple and would salivate over
this apple would be like the most precious thing he's
ever seen in his life. The apples we have now
are these gargantuan juicy sweet apples. Take a look at
one of those crab apples, which is the size of
a golf ball hard like a rock, and it tastes
sour. That's what a caveman Apple encounter was like. So
just remember all the amazing food you've got. Take a
look at what you've got in your pantry, take a
look at what is there on supermarket shelves, and just
recognize how cheap it is to literally even go for
five bucks, you can get a full meal. For 10
bucks, you can get a pretty great meal for 20
bucks and get an awesome meal. So just think about
that. Think about all the options that you have there
all the amazing variety of food. Think about how much
you enjoy it to your ability to enjoy that food.
How about the media, we live in a media soaked
culture, there's a lot of bad stuff that comes from
the media. But still like the ability to have entertainment
so cheaply, so easily. That can entertain you thrill you
bring you to tears make you laugh. All the stuff
is available now. It's so cheap, it's virtually free. You
have access to all of it in HD now with
widescreen think about that. Think about the effect that media
movies, film drama plays, music, documentaries, all this stuff has
had on you the news? How about technology? are you
grateful for technology. I mean, we literally live in the
most technologically advanced time ever, probably in the history of
the universe. The technology we have just in the last
20 years, the stuff that we developed is just so
mind blowing, so amazing. But it's so easy to take
for granted. The cameras we have the cell phones we
have the computers we have, the cars we have, the
planes we have, you can go through and you can
create a list of 100 things just in a technology
category that you can be super, super grateful for. And
not just modern technologies, but also think about technology like
electricity. How cool is that? When was the last time
you felt grateful for electricity, or for air conditioning? Or
for birth control? Think about what your life would be
like without birth control. Think about what your life would
be like without air conditioning. Think about what your life
would be like without modern factories producing all this industrialized,
cheap products. How about your health cliche, but you know,
health is something that you really start to appreciate. As
soon as you encounter health problems. I'm getting older. Now
I'm noticing a little bit of health issues and a
little bit of like, I'm not as healthy as I
used to be when I was younger, just because the
body is aging. Even in your 30s the body's already
starting to age. So I'm certainly become more and more
conscious of that, you know, when you start to take
pills, you start to notice like, Oh, how nice it
was that I didn't have to take any pills. So
that's cool. So think about that. Think about also your
physical body, the use of your hands that you have
your feet, your legs, the fact that you have your
vision, your your hearing, your ability to taste, your ability
to move around to run the energy levels that you
have all this stuff needs to be really thought about
to be grateful about it. Also think about biology, think
about chemistry, think about physics. are you grateful for these
things? If you study these, and then you take a
look at life, your perspective on life changes, like biology
is so amazing if you study biology, and then you
think about just the vast complexity of stuff that's going
on in your body. And it's all working. It's working
pretty flawlessly. billions and trillions of cells all moving together.
And it's such this, this vastly complex like mind blowing
ly complex organism standing right here and all working together
and quite flawlessly. So it's quite amazing. Or think about
chemistry, the way that all the molecules and stuff interact
and how that works. And it works quite flawlessly. Or
think about physics, think about how the physical laws work.
And everything, you know, moves in a certain coordination follows
certain patterns. And it's got these like amazing, amazing ways
in which stuff works down to the cork level into
the really subatomic particles and like string theory and all
that stuff. If you study that stuff, and you think
about how Oh, my God, all this stuff works in
such an amazing way, I can't believe that this is
actually what reality is. And this is how it's structured.
That's quite amazing. To be grateful for that. Because honestly,
you could imagine a universe where you didn't have the
kind of biology, chemistry or physics that we have, you
could imagine much worse, universes with much worse types of
physics, biology and chemistry in it. We're lucky to live
in this very rich, almost perfectly designed universe for us
to inhabit. So this universe really enables us to do
so much about psychology, are you grateful for psychology, for
your mind, and for personal development? I hope that you
are I hope you can find at least 100 things
to be grateful for about psychology, the power of your
mind, the ability for you to change your life, to
grow, to learn. To master yourself, this is all amazing
stuff to me. How about your country? How about your
state and your city? are you grateful for that the
place that you live in, is so amazing. And it's
so easy to take for granted. The politics that we
have the laws that we have the court system, the
police system, the fire department, the medical system, so all
this is part of society that you live in. And
no matter how bad you might say your society is,
it's still amazing, modern society, even in the worst country
is still amazing, compared to what societies were like 1000
years ago, it really is amazing what we've got here
with societies, there's so much to be grateful for about
how society functions. And especially now, you know, it's very
popular to criticize governments, and to bicker about, oh, this
government is bad, and this country is doing something evil
or whatever. But in the end, like realize that overall
society is extremely positive. Society promotes your development, promotes your
growth basically allows you to live the kind of lives
that you live, even in very bad societies. And if
you live in a first world country, oh, man, you
should be so amazingly grateful for that. And all the
little details about that, that you often forget about the
economy, that's really part of society, too. But the economy,
regardless of all the people who complain and bitch and
moan about the economy is amazing. The fact that we
even have money that allows us, you know, for me
to be here doing what I do, and then you'd
be doing something totally different than for us to be
able to exchange goods through this liquid currency that we
have got, it's quite amazing how all that works. The
fact that actually, the economy works quite well, quite effectively.
And that you can earn lots of money in it,
there's an abundance of money, there's no limit to how
much money you can earn. If you want to earn
money, you can go and earn it, no one's really
stopping you. No one really is preventing you. It's quite
amazing. How about the time that we live in the
21st century, you can think about all the amazing stuff
about the 21st century, that's new and fresh, that has
never existed before, from the technology to the political system
to, to the, to the cultures that we have to
the media that we have, that there's so much there
to be grateful for the fact that we live now,
instead of 100 years ago, or 500 years ago, or
10,000 years ago. Can you even imagine what your life
would have been like, if you live 10,000 years ago,
it would have been quite miserable, it would have been
really, really miserable. You think that you've got problems now
meant like, you've got no problems at all, compared to
the problems you would have had 10,000 years ago. So
think about that. Think about the freedom and the safety
you've got nowadays. Even in countries that are politically unstable,
there's still a lot of safety, way more safety than
you would have had. Even just 2000 years ago, during
the Roman days. During the Roman days, your city could
be sacked by local city. There was no country it's
literally cities would fight other cities. There were city states,
countries were cities. They could destroy you. They can come
and rape and pillage your your entire village or family
or the place that you live without any legal justifications
or anything like that. It was quite chaotic. Think about
the freedom you've got now. Literally right now you're free
to do so much almost anything. There's very few limits
as to your freedom, especially if you live in a
rural country. Think about your safety, think about how safe
you are now, relative to all the potential dangers you
could have faced just a couple 1000 years ago, how
safe you're kept by our society, it's really quite amazing.
Also, think about awareness and think about sensation. You're aware
right now, you're aware thing, and aware of being however
you want to call it human being, whatever. But there's
this thing, which is awareness, which is basically your entire
visual and spatial field. Everything you're feeling, hearing, seeing, tasting,
all of this, everything, you're noticing everything you're thinking, there's
like an awareness there, this awareness is amazing. If you
really think about it, you could spend the next 10
years thinking about awareness, and beginning to deeper and deeper
and deeper, more profound levels of understanding and all about
the fact that awareness exists. And just what it really
is, is a very mysterious and magical thing, awareness and
sensation, the fact that you've got it. Imagine if you
were an ant, how much more limited your sensation and
awareness would be. I mean, we don't really know. But
we can kind of assume that an ant has a
much more limited field of sensation than a human being
does. They don't have as Ruch eyesight, they don't have
as rich hearing. Maybe they do, I don't know, maybe,
for example, they have really good smell. But they don't
have for example, I'm pretty sure they don't have the
same kind of nice eyesight that we have. And also,
they don't have the kind of brains we have that
allow us to have like, even deeper levels of of
consciousness. And what if you were like a bacterium. Think
about how limited bacteriums sensations and perceptions are very, very
limited, compared to what we've got. You can think about
it like this, if what you have right now is
a 4k display. These new beautiful 4k displays you might
see in this in a TV store. bacterium, it was
like, it was like a 20 pixel by 20 pixel
display, compared to the 4k display that we're looking at,
through, you know, through our through our eyes, how amazing
that is to be living in this, like very rich
universe of sensations and experiences is so cool. And lastly,
be grateful for your life. Be grateful for life itself,
the fact that life exists, the fact that you are
part of it, the fact that you got the chance
to be here, when a trillion other organisms didn't. The
fact that you grew up and you live through your
birth and your childhood, and there were so many dangers,
and you escaped all those dangers, and you persevered and
you made it here today. And here you are now
you're living your breathing. In this moment, it's this amazing,
magical thing. There's a lot of other life forms around
you. All of them are somehow affecting one another. We
live in a universe on a planet that allows for
life. What if the earth didn't allow for life? What
then, like there's a there's so much we take for
granted here? What if we lived in a universe that
just couldn't sustain life at all, because of the physics
that was there, or the the biology or the chemistry
just wasn't right, or the kind of life that was
sustained, wasn't as rich as the kind of life that
we have. And just the fact that you're able to
be here, the fact that you're a human being and
not some other animal or some other creature, human being,
you know, one of the most intelligent and advanced and
also stupid life forms that we've encountered so far. So
think about that. Think about how grateful you should be
for the fact that you've got this life. And think
about how grateful you should be for the time that
you have still remaining in this life. No matter where
you are. Doesn't matter if you're 20 years old, 30
years old, or 70 years old, you still got time
remaining. And that right there is something to be really
thankful about. So those are some of my thoughts, what
