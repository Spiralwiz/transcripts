[Music] we still have much more to say about holism
and holistic thinking in this episode we're going to take
a look at what holistic thinking actually is we're going
to offer many examples many from the personal domain but
also some from the collective domain of what happens when
you're not thinking holistically and we're going to try to
teach you how to develop it as well but before
we get into that just a personal note i want
to fast right now i'm doing a 14 day water
fast this is day 7 which means i haven't eaten
any food in seven days which uh so if i
look a little bit uh thinner in the face that's
why i lost about uh eight pounds so far from
the fast and uh it's made me a little bit
lightheaded and low energy i don't have a lot of
energy and so we'll just have to see i've never
i've never recorded one of these episodes not having eaten
for seven days and it is it is challenging i've
gone through a lot of suffering in the last seven
days so i don't know if i'm gonna be able
to do it let's let's just see how it goes
uh it might even be better i don't know in
some ways my mind is more clear than it usually
is when i'm eating but in other ways i just
have so little energy and you know the brain uses
up a lot of calories and glucose to do all
this thinking which these episodes are so it's a little
bit challenging but let's get through it anyways all right
so and and by the way if you want more
info on my water fast why i'm doing it how
to do it yourself and so forth i'm going to
post a nice deep explanation of that on my blog
in a few days so go check that out once
it's available and i won't mention it here all right
so also if you haven't watched part one of this
series go watch part one if you haven't watched my
episode about what our whole lawns go watch that those
are necessary all right so let's get let's get going
here so here's my question for you to get this
ball rolling what does nutrition have to do with theoretical
physics you might say nothing it certainly seems that way
when you just look at the surface of the situation
like what does nutrition have to do with theoretical physics
it doesn't seem like much i mean maybe you can
come up with some sort of explanation such as like
well in the end the chemicals which are part of
the food that you eat you know those are made
of atoms and that's what theoretical physics studies but that's
a very tangential relationship and see many theoretical physicists might
take this approach but consider and this is especially true
now that i'm going through this fast and i've been
experiencing it myself you see the food you eat very
much affects how your brain and your mind work and
if you're a theoretical physicist and your whole life is
all about thinking and using your brain and your mind
to develop new theories make profound new connections have insights
about deep aspects about the structure of the subatomic realm
it's very important what you eat because like i've been
fasting for the last seven days and it's it's it's
amazing how differently my mind functions without food in some
positive ways and in some negative ways but if you
told the average theoretical physicist that nutrition is very important
to science he might just dismiss you and not take
that very seriously because the sort of traditional scientific materialist
attitude towards science is that well but but leo me
as the scientist i am not relevant to the issue
of what's true and what's false and so if my
science is good if my physics and my physical theories
are valid it doesn't matter what i eat i could
eat junk food and the theories would still be true
yes in that limited reductionistic sense you're right but the
theories that you're able to generate and even the theories
that you're able to understand very much depends on your
nutrition so if you're a theoretical physicist or any scientist
i'm i'm we just took the theoretical physicist here as
an example it doesn't matter what scientist it is it
could be a biologist it could be a psychologist doesn't
matter whatever scientist you are see when you're being taught
how to do scientific method they teach you all about
the method and how to do your lab work and
so forth but nobody teaches you that in order to
do high quality science you got to do good nutrition
you personally because you see there's this sort of assumption
this dualistic assumption that well the science is one thing
and then you as a scientist that's a separate thing
in fact we want to try to extricate ourselves from
the science and act as this neutral third person observer
we want to be objective we want to be neutral
but actually there is no neutrality when you do this
because if you're going to separate yourself from science and
you're going to say well my personal life doesn't matter
and nutrition is just part of my personal life but
it does matter because the quality of your science depends
upon it what your mind is able to understand how
conscious it can be very much depends on nutrition which
is why some of the most advanced sages and mystics
and yogis from the dawn of time have practiced fasting
because it has a profound effect on you on your
on your consciousness what you eat and also why the
most conscious people also tend to have the highest quality
diets see in fact if you're a materialistic scientist and
you think that all this mystical mystical stuff is all
just nonsense and fairy tales and wishful thinking and [
__ ] the reason you think that is because you
don't have direct experiences of having had mystical experiences or
meditation you know breakthroughs and spiritual insights but the reason
that could be the case is because you eat garbage
and you're overweight and that junk food is clogging up
your your your whole physiology your whole nervous system is
affected by that and it's limiting your ability to be
conscious and to recognize to have these profound experiences and
so of course then you just dismiss them as fairy
tales and nonsense and superstition but that's because you're not
making a holistic connection so why are we talking about
this holism right you need a holistic understanding of the
situation to see the connection between high quality science and
your own personal nutrition because you're not going to be
able to understand the best science when your nutrition is
bad and of course it's not just nutrition it's also
exercise it's also the kind of toxins and medications you
put into your body all of these things have an
effect on you and of course not just that but
many many other factors that i won't be labor here
you get the point you see so this is sort
of the essence of what i'm trying to communicate to
you about holism is that when you adopt a holistic
attitude towards all of life it's a game changer because
many of the problems and obstacles you used to have
you can start to see them from a higher elevation
perspective and solutions become available that cannot be resolved at
the level that you were thinking about them at at
sort of reductionistic level many of your problems are literally
stemming from a lack of holism but you don't always
see it in fact often you don't see it and
it needs to be pointed out to you which is
why we're taking this time to point this out to
you with ample exam uh examples and so forth because
it there's sort of a shift that i want you
to experience in your mind where you start to say
holy [ __ ] holism is extremely important and people
are not talking about it and taking it seriously enough
when we say holism people can just say like oh
well it's some sort of hippie idea of you know
mother earth gaia sort of thing or it's some sort
of holistic food idea or holistic medicine idea some sort
of alternative medicine idea but it's not that those are
just little offshoots and branches from the the massive tree
trunk of holism that that i want you to really
focus your attention on here right um when you adopt
this holism attitude you start to see life in a
very different way you start to see all these different
situations a different way you start to make interconnections between
things and you start to see how this domain of
life and that domain of life are really connected but
up until now you've been treating them as totally separate
and distinct things and that's why you were not getting
the best results here or the best results there or
wherever and now when you're starting to interconnect them now
you start to see how one informs and connects and
affects the other one and then you can wrap your
mind around the whole thing and then you can see
ah now i see why i was stuck for all
these years hitting my head against a a glass ceiling
it's because i wasn't interconnecting things that are actually deeply
interconnected but i was treating them as though i can
just you know compartmentalize this from that you know science
from nutrition nutrition from psychological well-being psychological well-being from my
relationships i thought these were all separate things but it's
like no they're not separate things that's the key thing
i want you to understand all right now let's get
into some more examples so here are some examples i
have a list for you of problems that stem from
a lack of holistic thinking and we're going to first
cover the collective problems of mankind then we're going into
some personal problems that you you yourself probably have all
right so obviously the number one thing is the environment
and the ecology if you care about the environment at
all if you care about the planet of course that
already assumes that you have a certain degree of holistic
thinking because people who are completely unholistic they don't care
about the environment or the ecology at all and this
leads to all sorts of problems called the tragedy of
the commons the best example of which is just people
who litter have you ever seen a person just litters
like they're maybe you're you're watching him you know a
guy driving down the highway and he just throws like
a you know a coke can an empty coke can
after he's done drinking it he just throws it out
his window that kind of thing and sometimes like to
me it's baffling like how can somebody do that and
i've actually spent some number of years puzzling over this
like what is going on in that person's mind that
they're doing that with such reckless abandon and of course
uh in the end i realized all it is is
that if they're at a lower level of consciousness and
spiral dynamics development such that they're probably a stage blue
or orange and at these stages there is no deep
ecological thinking the ego mind at this level of development
doesn't think in terms of ecology it doesn't think in
terms of systems it doesn't think in terms of what
effect am i really having on the world it's just
acting selfishly blindly selfishly so the problems here are numerous
pollution in the oceans and the rivers with plastic with
chemicals with heavy metals with oil um overfishing is a
huge problem uh when there's a lack of holism because
everyone is just rushing to fish as fast as they
can as much as they can and that kills the
fishery in some cases the fish can go completely extinct
we see this happening for example in russia with sturgeon
because of the caviar trade and also because of the
poverty of the country and the lack of development of
the country poaching poaching of animals poaching elephants for tusks
and ivory and animals are poached in in basically every
underdeveloped part of the world in indonesia in africa in
south america elsewhere sometimes these animals are just poached purely
for meat because the people that are so poor they
don't and of course these poachers they don't have any
kind of holistic understanding of what they're doing and there
are many more other ecological problems of course climate change
global warming and yada yada you've heard all that stuff
so anyways um and i'll also bring up the example
of ecological collapse due to introduction of foreign species to
an environment so this has been a problem in multiple
countries i believe it's like in australia they introduced some
sort of frog or some sort of other animals that
were not indigenous and they just took over and now
they're um you know decimating the local populations of whatever
is there i know they've had this problem in hawaii
as well like in hawaii i was in hawaii a
few years ago and i saw this uh this weird
creature running across the road and i asked them you
know what is that weird creature and it was actually
a weasel and i'm like really the weasel you got
weasels here in hawaii and they're like yeah they were
like introduced for an introduction and these weasels are actually
terrible because they eat all the eggs they eat all
and then basically in hawaii all the birds they they
don't build their nests up high in the trees they
build them on in like in the ground close to
the ground because hawaii was such an isolated ecosystem that
and there are no there are no serious big natural
predators to birds on hawaii there's very few you know
predators on those islands and so what happens is the
birds were just able to build their nest low to
the ground but now you introduce this weasel and the
sweasel eats all the eggs well it eats all the
eggs then there can't be any more birds so they
have to fight off these weasels and i mean examples
of this abound all around the world i won't waste
time mentioning them all so see that's a deep um
a very deep example of what happens when you don't
think holistically about an ecological situation right see there are
these kind of like subtle subtle aspects to how a
system works then when you don't when you don't see
all the interconnections you can easily overlook an interconnection thinking
that's not important but actually it is very important so
i mean at first glance you might say well how
bad is it to have a weasel in hawaii just
forget about it it's like not a big deal but
then you realize that these weasels multiply and there are
no natural predators big predators of weasels in hawaii which
there aren't that means nothing is limiting these weasels that
means there can be millions of weasels but if there's
millions of weasels then they're eating all the bird eggs
now all the birds die and then that leads to
other problems and so the whole thing spirals out of
control and so that's a very good example other examples
include western medicine pretty much all of western medicine is
deeply deeply unholistic and problematic um i've personally experienced this
especially a lot in the last year as i've talked
about on my blog i've been struggling with some health
issues some digestion issues over the last year and i've
been going to many doctors seeing various kinds of specialists
and so forth and i've been very frustrated with the
with the kind of attention and kind of utter utter
lack of holism that these doctors apply to their patients
like i mean it's almost criminal really in the future
you'll be able to sue a doctor for behaving this
way but today it's just standard practice i go to
one doctor i tell him i have a certain problem
he says oh well that's not my concern you got
to go to a different doctor i got to go
to this specialist so i say okay fine i'm going
to go to that specialist and of course i'm paying
for all this as it's happening so i go to
the specialist pay him even more and then that specialist
says oh well okay what are your symptoms i tell
myself he's like ah well that doesn't sound like it's
my problem go somewhere else and i'm like what do
you mean i got sent here you're the specialist on
this issue and he's like yeah but your symptoms your
three symptoms don't match my list of criteria therefore you
don't have a problem within my domain of expertise and
i'm like no i definitely have a stomach problem and
you're a gastroenterologist and he says no i can't help
you but he still takes my money of course um
and so in this way we go round and round
in circles and nothing gets solved because essentially no doctor
well there are there are some holistic doctors but the
majority of doctors in american medicine they do they do
not take a holistic approach to your health they will
only look at what a very narrow band of problems
that you have if it matches their list of symptoms
they might help you if it doesn't if it doesn't
fit the little narrow confines of the dogma they were
taught in medical school you know 50 years ago then
they don't even think that it's a serious problem i
actually went to a gastroenterologist told him all my symptoms
i had serious stomach problems and he actually suggested that
i start seeing a therapist like a shrink because he
said oh you're just making these problems up of course
later i took it upon myself to do various kinds
of blood work tests and so forth and eventually i
find out that i do have an actual physical problem
within my gut so i don't need to see a
psychologist for this it's just that he he's not thinking
holistically about this stuff see so because of this literally
thousands of people die because of this this lack of
holistic approach because again when you're treating the human body
the human body is not divided into the heart and
the gut and the bones and the teeth these are
not separate things they're all interconnected for example you might
have an infection in your tooth a chronic tooth infection
which then agitates your immune system causes it to flare
up which then causes your stomach because your stomach is
like 80 percent of your immune system is in your
gut which then causes problems in your stomach causes dysbiosis
in your stomach which you know overgrowth of bacteria and
then that causes further problems and see if you go
to a traditional doctor he's never gonna he's never gonna
look at the whole thing together he's only gonna you're
gonna you know you're gonna go to one doctor who
just looks at the heart one doctor who just looks
at the gut one doctor who just looks at the
immune system and none of them are going to be
communicating with each other properly so he's never going to
resolve that and since this is really a dental problem
and see dentistry is not even considered part of traditional
kind of mainstream medicine it's considered like a a tangent
it's never even occurred to him that maybe you have
a tooth problem because he only works on the gut
or the heart or the immune system but not the
teeth but the teeth are part of the immune system
see because your body is a is a very well
balanced fine-tuned hold on and it needs to be treated
as such if you want good health remember in the
last episode we talked about that holism is health you
can't have human health health of the human body without
holism and that's why many people millions of people today
are sick with all sorts of autoimmune disorders and other
things that uh that could easily be solved if only
the doctors and the whole medical system was much more
holistic in fact you know people who have uh cardiac
problems heart problems due to high cholesterol clogging of arteries
all this sorts of stuff the majority of these people
we know how to heal them you can heal them
through fasting you can heal them through plant-based whole foods
diets these are all of these are proven to heal
these disorders much better than any kind of medicine and
we can heal them through mostly through changes in their
nutrition and their exercise programs but of course the majority
of cardiologists in america if you go to them with
a heart problem they're not even to talk to you
about changing your nutrition or exercise or fasting or switching
to a vegetarian diet they're not going to talk about
these things at all and if you ask them hey
you know i have a heart problem why didn't you
tell me that these things are solutions to my heart
problem why did you write me all this expensive drug
prescriptions and stuff that that has all these negative side
effects what'll the doctor say he'll say well i'm not
a nutritionist that's the nutritionist's problem i'm a cardiologist i
don't i don't worry about nutrition that's the epitome of
a of the kind of problems that result from a
lack of holism and because of this literally thousands of
people die millions of people die if you take the
entire world into account like this of course big pharma
has a lot of unholistic approaches and thinking we've sort
of addressed that in the in the previous episode with
some example there now let's talk about nutrition nutrition now
there's a lot of fad diets going around these days
and nutrition is a is a tricky topic because nutrition
also needs to be treated holistically if you want to
get health but a lot of times nutrition in these
diets are not holistic in their approach and they're not
really concerned with the well-being of the body instead they
might be concerned with losing fat or gaining muscle or
improving your sex drive or tasty food recipes or something
like being vegan for ethical reasons of you know not
harming animals and while that is a laudable ethical consideration
by no means am i dismissing the importance of that
you have to consider nutrition as a whole because nutrition
is not just about any one of those things you
see that which causes you to lose fat does not
necessarily mean that it's healthy for you long term and
even being a vegetarian or a vegan for ethical reasons
that also doesn't mean it's healthy for you long term
you can be a vegan the way most people are
and you're eating garbage food potato chips and various kinds
of sauces and fake cheeses and these sorts of things
and a lot of sugar i mean it's all vegan
sugar is vegan you can eat a pound of sugar
it's vegan but i mean is that healthy for you
so you see a lot of times people get stuck
debating the minutia of these various diets they get tribal
about it but they don't consider the bigger picture and
of course the bigger picture of diet is not merely
your own health you might be saying as a vegan
you might be saying leo but my own health is
not the only factor there's also the health and suffering
of all the animals and the environment and all this
and you're right that's an important consideration so not only
are we talking about when we're talking about nutrition what's
good for my personal health but also we gotta take
whole on of the society of also of animals and
other species what effect we have on them and also
stuff like global warming because the farming of these animals
contributes to that significantly and we got to consider things
like overfishing that comes from eating a bunch of fish
and soil depletion the cutting down of the amazon rainforest
for growing cash crops like soybeans and things like yeah
it's extremely complicated and you know who has time to
think about all that stuff most of us are selfish
we just want to have the food we want to
have and we don't get too fat um yeah so
you got to consider all of these things and it's
tricky but see the problem is that if you're going
to be vegan even when it's hurting your health it's
tricky because like you might say well the the the
well-being and non-suffering of animals is more important than my
own health okay fine you can take that attitude but
then what happens when your health gets so deteriorated let's
say and i'm not saying this happens to all vegans
i mean this is kind of a rare example but
but let's say you're you're very ideological about your veganism
but actually your health is deteriorating worse and worse and
worse every year because you keep you know insisting on
that and then eventually you get some sort of disease
or maybe you even die is that really a net
positive for the world or could you have actually accomplished
more in the world by you know ethically eating some
animal products and things maybe you could maybe you could
i don't know you gotta it's a again it's all
about balance right i'm not telling you what the exact
thing is that's correct or what you should do rather
i'm trying to show you how important it is to
think holistically about these things and to take all these
factors into consideration also as part of nutrition i see
that a lot of these various diets they will sort
of reduce nutrition down to either calories or carbs or
protein or fat and so that's all there is to
nutrition as though all carbs are the same as though
all fats are the same as though all proteins are
the same as all calories are the same but of
course they're not and there's a lot more to the
chemicals that are coming into your body through food than
just calories carbs proteins and fat there's all sorts of
pigments and antioxidants that come from from various fruits and
vegetables from the color pigments in those plants there's all
sorts of other you know there's there's many different forms
of fat some of them are better than others there's
different kinds of carbs not all carbs are the same
you have starchy carbs you have raw sugar type of
stuff you have corn syrup uh but then you have
more healthy forms of carbs so and then and just
beyond these categories there are just even things that probably
haven't even been discovered yet that are affecting your health
and so when you reduce nutrition down to these if
you think that the only thing that matters are the
sort of stats that are listed at the on the
back of the box of potato chips that you're eating
on the back of it you know it gives you
maybe 10 different stats if you think that that's all
that matters to nutrition i mean that's also the epitome
of a lack of holism really that box if it
was properly done in a very conscious society that box
should be listing it shouldn't be just a little box
it should be the entire back of the you know
of the of the box and it should list like
a hundred different chemicals and all their effects and their
quantities and how it might affect your body and not
even that but they should even list like depending on
your age they might affect you differently carbs and fat
and protein calories don't affect someone at age 15 the
same way they affect somebody at age 70 and they
don't affect women the same as they affect men and
maybe they don't affect white people the same as it
affect black people so i mean there's a lot of
science and data there that of course would be too
complex to list on any box but sort of in
a hypothetical example you can see that how much how
much more precise it would be to list all that
data and uh and then how much more informed decisions
you could make as a consumer of these of these
products see but we're not there yet uh many restaurants
still don't even list the ingredients or the you know
the calories that of the meals that they serve let
alone the percentages of carbs protein fat and a bunch
of other things it'll take us decades just to get
to the point where we mandate that every restaurant menu
lists at least protein carbs and fat and maybe even
the sources of where these items came from how they
were sourced that's another huge issue you see most of
us don't know like were these were these did these
eggs come from a factory farm or do they come
from a grass you know fed pasture farm that's not
told to you in a restaurant of course so all
restaurant eggs come from factory farms because they're all interested
in the cheapest eggs but um but yeah i mean
it would be nice to know these things and in
general not just about food but just about anything like
it would be nice to see for example when you
buy some some running shoes at the athletic store it
would be nice if on the bottom of the shoes
or somewhere on the box it told you all the
materials the plastics and rubbers that were used where they
were all sourced from whether it's fair trade or not
and and so forth to help you to make better
decisions well maybe that'll happen in 100 years but we're
not there yet okay another example is with capitalism and
business so in general the very general critique i have
of business and capitalism especially as it is in america
but all around the world of course um also is
that in general the way business is conducted today it
ignores so many important and huge domains and aspects of
human life it ignores art it ignores spirituality it ignores
the environment it ignores health it ignores social well-being and
cohesiveness it ignores the health of the society and it
ignores the health of humanity at large it also ignores
the impact that that that this has on on your
epistemology and on your worldview so what do i mean
by it ignores these things well i'm not saying that
business doesn't participate in these fields it does business participates
business has tentacles in every field business has is participates
in art and spirituality environment health and society and humanity
business participates in all this stuff the problem though is
that the way it participates is that it's just looking
to extract money from these things it doesn't actually care
about these things for their own sake to most business
people when you start talking to them about the value
of art they'll laugh at you because to them the
art is merely a means for earning money so even
if they entertain your ideas about art it's only going
to be to the extent that they think they can
get money out of it like if you go to
hollywood and you want to direct some very artistic beautiful
movie that will have spiritual you know that will uplift
people's souls and their spirits and will will get them
interested in spirituality and it'll also talk about the environment
and human health you tell them how important all these
things are and about also about raising social consciousness you
tell this to some of the you know studio executives
uh and business people and they'll laugh at you and
the only way they will listen to you or take
you seriously is if you can tell them somehow how
all of this will actually lead them to earning a
bunch of money then they'll take you seriously but only
to the extent that it earns money as soon as
it's not earning the money they'll laugh at all your
stupid stuff because they don't really care about what you're
teaching what effect you're having on human souls and the
society and the environment they don't care about any of
that [ __ ] they just care about their money
and if they can get there through art they'll do
it but they don't actually care about art and so
this has produced business which is very soulless the spirit
of business has been ripped away from it because really
if you were going to be doing business properly you
would care about these things and you actually prioritize these
things above business for example the work that i do
with actualize.org i prioritize the impact that i have on
people elevating people's conscious way above the business aspects of
actions.org and much to my detriment because if i wanted
to i could focus the majority of my resources and
time just on the business and marketing aspects of of
actualize.org and if i did that i would be 10
times more successful i'd have 10 times more viewers i
would sell 10 times more courses and make 10 times
more money and be 10 times more popular and more
people would kiss my ass and more people would love
me and i'd have more status and i'd get more
invitations to interviews and i'd be more visible on tv
and all this sorts of stuff and so i've had
to make a conscious decision that's i don't want to
do that because i want to put the majority of
my attention on the actual content of this work and
that is very much missing in the business world which
is why i left the corporate business world i was
in it for a while and it was so disgusting
and soulless to me that i don't want to be
part of that at all and the reality is that
it's very difficult to actually do that within the corporate
structure it's not just that there's some elite ceos that
are preventing you from doing that it's the entire corporate
structures this way is very very unhealthy and dysfunctional and
it creates diseases within our society many many different diseases
within our society and so for me the most important
thing when i realized how dirty the corporate world was
and how little it appreciated art and spirituality and health
and these sorts of things i i had to leave
the corporate world it was difficult to do that and
i knew that i had to build up my own
independent way of making a living and doing business and
that's what i that's what i did for example i
was a i was a game developer worked at a
really great studio designing video games um but one of
the things that bothered me so much about game development
is that even though i loved game development uh there
are many things that bother me but i'm just gonna
focus on this one narrow thing which is that how
unhealthy game development is the crunch the overtime the the
the kind of garbage food that they eat for example
every uh every thursday we would have like this game
night and they would deliver all this pizza to the
office and you'd play games i mean this probably sounds
so obnoxious to some of you who wish you got
that at your work yeah but like i mean um
so we everybody in the office would be eating pizza
there was no healthy food all there was like a
pantry in the office that was stocked with the most
unhealthiest unhealthiest of foods snacks and snicker bars and all
sorts of [ __ ] sodas and everybody was just
consuming this stuff and then working overtime and just killing
themselves making this game and i mean um that's also
the epitome of a lack of holism because many of
these those people i mean i left i left within
a year because i couldn't tolerate that but many of
those people they will get cancer they will get autoimmune
disease they will get all sorts of other problems they
will burn out all sorts of other stuff is going
to happen to them and they don't see that because
they're just myopically focused on developing the next game and
then when you bring this up to the boss what
does he tell you like i brought up the idea
of crunch like can we do something about not doing
crunch he tells you something like well it's just the
industry standard that's what that's what we do that's how
we make games without this we couldn't make a game
it's just part of the culture you see it's so
part of the culture that nobody even cares to consider
it wrong or to change it and now i'm not
arguing that it's difficult to change that it is very
difficult to change that but it's a very unholistic way
of doing business and that's just only one element there
are many other critiques i could have of the game
industry so i won't i won't go into that here
of course um the next point is closely associated to
business is marketing marketing as it is done right now
is extremely unhealthy extremely toxic it ignores societal well-being it
ignores the psychological ecosystem of human minds that it infects
and corrupts with the mind viruses that it feeds i
mean i personally i think that one of the greatest
scandals of the last 50 years is the toxic effect
that marketing has had on human minds and this is
a scandal that nobody even talks about or even thinks
about or understands at all how significant this is you're
being brainwashed constantly by ads all over the internet on
tv in the movies anywhere you go driving down the
road and it's infecting you and you're it's shaping your
desires and your tastes and your aversions and fears and
your whole worldview is being shaped by this as you're
growing up you know since you're a baby it's been
shaping you and it's only getting worse now that our
kids you know the the new generation of zoomers they
are you know using computers even earlier watching tv even
earlier and all this sort of stuff and they're all
i mean like their whole world view and paradigm is
being is being corrupted by the marketing system and these
marketers they don't give a [ __ ] they act
as though nothing is wrong it's like leo what's wrong
with me pitching my you know my my latest soft
drink you know what's wrong with me advertising fast food
on tv what's wrong with me advertising cigarettes what's wrong
with me advertising erection medication well what's wrong is that
all of that combined together leads to that situation we
talked about in episode one where you know you [
__ ] in the pool everybody else shits in the
pool soon enough we're all swimming in a pool of
[ __ ] and that's exactly what's happening but it's
see it's it's so it's so subtle because uh marketing
is not a tangible thing when there's a war going
on and children are being bombed well that's very visceral
we see that at the immigration you know centers when
children are being locked up in cages we see that
we feel that it's a material thing we react to
it if there's a holocaust we react to that you
know uh very emotionally and so forth but when our
minds are being fed every day by this by this
advertising it's hard to even point your finger at what
the problem is you don't see it you're like a
fish and water and of course the advertisers and marketers
themselves are part of this ecosystem so they're not immune
it's not like they're sitting above the system you know
[ __ ] down below they're swimming in the same
pool as all of us are and so their children
are also getting infected no matter how much money you
make through your marketing schemes if you have children well
your children are going to go grow up watching tv
and looking at the same ads that you helped create
and then they're going to get infected by that and
then of course whatever ads you create somebody else is
going to create even more toxic ones to out-compete you
and then your children will watch those that's going to
corrupt their their minds and their entire relationship to life
see so especially when we're talking about the health of
society as a whole we need to be extremely holistic
to take all of these factors into account and to
find the proper balances how about in geopolitics a lack
of holism in geopolitics leads to something like the iraq
war not the first one but the second one so
with bush and cheney bumbling their way into the middle
east thinking that they would be greeted with with roses
and bouquets of flowers and uh and that they would
be able to establish a democracy there it just shows
a complete lack of holistic understanding of all the subtle
complex moving parts of the region the the developmental level
and the consciousness of the region how they would react
how many lives would be lost how much money would
be spent and ultimately for what what did it accomplish
whereas if if we had a president like al gore
maybe who's a more holistic thinker than somebody like bush
or cheney then you would avoid that situation because he
would have looked at that situation he would have said
i mean maybe there's a reason to go in there
but also if we look at all the factors it's
going to be a quagmire it's not worth it and
there are many examples like this in geopolitics most of
geopolitics is deeply unholistic and that's why we get war
in a sense that that's what war is war is
just a lack of holism because if you holistically understood
the situation as as the ultimate supreme leader as the
commander-in-chief if you understood the situation holistically you wouldn't go
to war because you would see how ugly war is
and you would look for other ways uh especially when
you're not being directly attacked like i understand you know
if there was a direct attack then you'd have to
defend yourself but 911 was not a direct attack it
was just a terrorist attack it was not a it
was not a it was not a state attack on
america and it wasn't even done by that part of
the by that country so it i mean there's so
many problems with the iraq war okay we'll we'll move
on uh let's move on to some problems in science
so within science we have a deep problem i've talked
about many times times in the past where science ignores
metaphysics and epistemology and dismiss these as unnecessary to the
work of science this is extremely ignorant and extremely unholistic
the scientist sort of assumes that oh well we can
just keep doing science as we've always been doing it
we don't need to question our deepest assumptions the epistemology
the metaphysics that's not going to change the way that
i do science but of course it will because the
way that you do science the scientific method itself hinges
upon an implicit metaphysics and epistemology that you have which
for most scientists today is materialism but this materialism is
just taken as the default position it's not even taken
as a metaphysics or an epistemology it's just taken as
truth of course it isn't it's actually falsehood but the
way our education system trains scientists they don't know any
better and when you try to retrain them and open
their minds they say metaphysics epistemology is a waste of
my time well with that attitude you're going to keep
doing your materialistic reduction of science and you're going to
keep getting confused as to why your science isn't progressing
and why certain problems can't be resolved for example the
mind body problem is easily resolved we've resolved it those
of us who've gone beyond materialism we've resolved it but
to academic scientists the mind body problem is still very
very mysterious and very thorny and they keep waiting for
when will we resolve this problem well you can't resolve
this problem through science you can only resolve it through
metaphysics and epistemology and spirituality speaking of which is another
problem that science has is that science ignores consciousness and
spirituality dismissing these things as unscientific and unworthy of scientific
study or unexplainable by science of course that's untrue you
can have perfect understanding of what consciousness is um but
but most scientists are clueless to that because they're not
holistic enough they think that science is one thing and
spirituality is another thing they think that matter is one
thing and consciousness is something else doesn't occur to them
that matter and conscious could actually be the same thing
another problem in science is that many of the best
epistemic lessons and metaphysical lessons that were discovered 100 years
ago in quantum mechanics science understands some of these but
they're not generalized out to other domains enough stuff like
entanglement subject object duality superposition and many other weird aspects
of quantum mechanics most scientists when you tell them but
let's generalize this out to other aspects of life like
to the macro domains they say no no no that's
not that's not real science that's not you're not you're
not being strict enough you're being some hippie uh you
know dippy uh deepak chopra person who's just bullshitting stuff
and uh and using science to try to rationalize the
spirituality or whatever but that's not strict science but you
see that is actually the bigger mistake is to take
that approach because yes there were very narrow specific discoveries
within quantum mechanics but that does not mean it doesn't
generalize to other domains but the scientist doesn't have enough
holistic understanding to see how a generalization could happen or
why it would even be important they just try to
like stick stick to the strict science they tend to
be very conservative these scientists but actually in being so
conservative they fail to generalize it out and draw connections
and lessons with other aspects and domains of life which
would be very important and illuminating another example would be
from mathematics a similar problem is google's and completeness theorem
which i've talked about in my older episode called the
metaphysical implications of google's incompleteness theorem mathematicians understand the theorem
they understand the implications it has for mathematics and maybe
logic formal logic but then when you try to generalize
it out beyond that to other domains which i did
in that episode that whole episode was me generalizing out
to other domains implications from googles and compliance theorem when
you try to do that with a mathematician or a
scientist they will not even want to listen to you
because their rebuttal will be that no no no google's
the completed serum only applies to certain very specific narrowly
defined logical systems and anything beyond that like human language
other stuff it doesn't apply to that i've read entire
books of mathematicians arguing this but this is horseshit because
the problem is that if you want to be very
narrow about its implications you can be but that doesn't
mean that just because you want to be narrow about
them that they themselves are not further generalizable they are
uh which if you want to know more about that
go check out that episode um in fact after google
came tarsky and tarski developed more general theorems than even
google that have even more broader applications and many for
example logicians and mathematicians and scientists when they dismiss what
i have to say about google's complaints theorem and its
generalizations they they just leave out tarsky for example as
though he doesn't even exist and you can generalize it
out even beyond tarsky but the thing is that the
more you generalize it out now the more disconnected it
becomes with formal logic and verbal mathematics and formal science
and that's right that's the whole point but the problem
is that these mathematicians and scientists and logicians they are
so locked into the little bubble that they don't care
about anything beyond their formalized logic or their formalized subdomain
and of course when that's your attitude then you won't
be able to draw the interconnections and the you won't
be able to generalize it out further to other domains
so it takes someone like me to come along and
who has a very holistic you know understanding of things
or at least a desire to to understand things holistically
who's not loyal to a logic or to science or
to mathematics or to anything only someone with that kind
of attitude can actually be able to generalize it out
the problem though is that when you do that the
people in their little established bubbles they don't accept you
and they think you're nuts i'll leave it to you
to decide who's right on that topic me or them
the next point is psychology psychology is deeply unholistic reductionistic
and dysfunctional in its current state because it ignores spirituality
and nonduality it also ignores philosophy it ignores the importance
of metaphysical and epistemic and existential considerations when treating patients
that's why therapists doing talk therapy psychoanalysis this sort of
they tend to have very poor results with curing patients
and the reason that is because their patients usually have
a deeper problem at the spiritual existential level at the
epistemic metaphysical level and most psychologists are not trained for
that stuff in fact they might consider those things to
be nonsense and not genuine science not real medicine and
so as a result the therapist the psychiatrist psychologist he
ends up having an understanding of human psychology and human
behavior at a very surface level because you cannot understand
human behavior without deep spiritual work yourself personally because all
human behavior stems from ego and ego is not just
a psychological thing it's a deeply existential metaphysical thing so
you can't cure someone with a serious psychological issue unless
you're able to understand human psychology to to its bone
and you can't understand human psychology to its bone unless
you understand the ego and you can't understand the ego
unless you do spiritual work so if you're a psychologist
or a therapist or psychiatrist who's not doing spiritual work
you're uh you're basically a hack you're negligent at your
work and your patients suffer for it some of them
kill themselves because you weren't able to help them see
and of course you yourself are are psychologically sick because
you can't be psychologically healthy without understanding those things so
yeah and university doesn't teach these things the university only
teaches a very narrow version of psychology that ignores all
these other factors in fact speaking of psychology about 70
years ago there was a famous psychologist whose name was
skinner he developed the skinner box maybe you heard of
him and his his whole attitude and world view towards
psychology was called behaviorism his idea was that the internal
moods and feelings and attitudes and beliefs of living beings
humans and animals didn't matter at all we can just
treat the animal or the human as a black box
there's some inputs and there's some outputs the inputs are
the stimuli like you you shock an animal with a
cattle prod you know electrocute the animal and then there's
some sort of response the animal screams the animal runs
away the animal you know opens its eyes sticks his
tongue out whatever and so he said his whole approach
to science and psychology was that we don't care about
anything that's going on on the inside we don't care
about consciousness none of that stuff we don't care about
how it feels all we care about is inputs and
outputs and all that science and psychology is as a
field is the measuring of inputs and outputs such that
like you can give a piece of cheese to a
rat that's the input and then the rat uh you
know eats it and then it uh you know it
jumps up and down and that's the output and that's
literally all that reality is that's all that science is
uh well by by today of course the the absurdity
of this gross reductionism is very obvious even to many
scientists and psycho and academics but even though the absurdity
of that reductionism is so obvious it's so limited it's
so extremely limited this sort of reductionism is still happening
all throughout academia and all throughout science in more subtle
ways a similar sort of reductionism was attempted within the
field of logic and mathematics during the early 1900s and
this movement was called logicism it was spearheaded by uh
gauntlet fergue and people like bertrand russell uh alfred north
whitehead and hilbert uh and and others you know it
was called like hilbert's project hilbert's project was to take
all of mathematics and to formalize it into a simple
algorithm such that every single mathematical truth and proof could
be could be just churned out by a by a
calculator that was the project it was the idea that
mathematics is nothing more than uh the logic behind it
and the shuffling of symbols logical symbols in a formalized
sort of way they tried to reduce all of mathematical
truth to that and they utterly failed miserably failed and
then it took them about 30 30 years or so
to ultimately realize that this isn't utterly impossible and it
was actually goods incompleteness serum that that finally put the
nail in the coffin of that also russell's russell's paradox
was also central to that so uh got lefrega right
this whole wrote this whole book about how he was
able to boil all of mathematics down to logic he
wrote this book he was very proud he was just
about to publish it um he has some like brilliant
proofs in there for for his logic it was all
perfect you know he's reduced it all down reductionism and
then uh right before he publishes it um bertrand russell
um sends him a letter uh a short letter that
that contains russell's paradox i won't go into it here
it's kind of technical you can go read about it
on wikipedia but uh yeah he just he he gave
this to to god lafrey russell's paradox and then when
fragi read this his his whole life's work just collapsed
instantly he spent his whole life developing the system it
all collapsed simply because he didn't consider the paradoxical nature
of consciousness and a symbolic understanding there was a similar
movement around that time called the vienna school uh and
it was called logical positivism it was this idea that
all of science can also just simply be boiled down
to simple statements about true or false statements about the
nature of reality like is the sky blue true or
false is the sun hot true or false is the
snow white true or false and that that's all that
science was that's all that reality was that's all that
truth was um and of course it took them i
don't know 30 or so years to realize that that
doesn't work either and so today logical positivism of course
is of course dismissed by serious academics and scientists because
of because it's so ridiculously reductionistic and and ultimately self-contradictory
and false but but at some point some of the
greatest philosophers in the world believed in this see so
what does all this have to do with holism well
i'm talking about the history of western intellectual tradition and
how deeply reductionistic it used to be and how badly
that failed because reductionism fails that's the whole problem of
reductionism it keeps failing and the reason he keeps failing
is because reality is a unity if it's a unity
you can only understand it as a whole not as
bits and pieces and even though i'm saying these things
and serious scientists and academics and philosophers might understand everything
i'm saying here this is some technical stuff um most
people most laymen don't know any of these problems uh
but uh but they they still don't understand the depth
of the problem what i'm saying is that these problems
still persist within modern science this is not some sort
of ancient stuff of idiots of the past century this
is go all going on still today within science another
example of which is how science ignores psychedelics treating it
as though it's an unscientific thing as though psychedelics cannot
be used to do much better science and i don't
just mean that science is not interested in studying psychedelics
there are more and more researchers and chemists and even
psychologists who are studying psychedelics scientifically but they're still doing
it from a distance they're not doing it personally uh
the real breakthrough will be when serious scientists start taking
psychedelics themselves and using that to see the limitations of
science now that will be true holism right there but
we're a long way from that within technology we have
a problem in the technology field a lot of ethics
are ignored a lot of technologies are just invented for
the sake of inventing them for business purposes so technology
and business are closely related but then the actual ethics
of the technology are not taken seriously enough because that
would require more holism than these people are trained to
practice or care to know or is convenient for business
to see it's much harder to do business holistically than
unholistically you can make a lot more money unholistically uh
another examples is einstein's relativity so einstein first developed the
theory of special relativity which was a very narrow application
of relativity to uh i believe it was just velocity
in the same sort of direction so if you have
like on one plane you have one train moving this
way and another train moving this way at this in
the same direction at the at different velocities then you
could calculate the relativistic differences and so forth but that
was just a very special case after einstein developed that
he wasn't fully happy einstein said to himself something like
well yes it's great it's a great breakthrough for this
narrow case but i mean all of reality is much
bigger than this narrow case what about cases when things
are moving at different angles what about cases when there's
also acceleration because in his special relativity i believe acceleration
was assumed to be zero we were just dealing with
velocities but then there's accelerations what about rotational forces what
about the orbiting you know of of planets and you
know the complex stuff of which our universe is actually
made what about that so he had an intuition that
actually relativity needs to apply to those things as well
but he didn't know how to do it uh he
didn't know the mathematics and so forth and so it
took him some number of years five or ten years
to figure that out have some breakthroughs and then he
came out with his general relativity which is the theory
that he's now best known for that became his sort
of life's work and general relativity expanded that out so
this is what i mean by generalizing out it generalized
that narrow discovery to something much larger which is all
moving objects and in general relativity is where einstein came
up with this idea of space-time and that really gravity
was just the mass exerting a distortion within space-time and
you know four-dimensional space blah blah blah complex stuff so
um so he generalized it out but see we can't
stop there really if einstein was truly holistic in his
thinking he would say wait a minute why can't we
generalize relativity even more why is it only applying to
physics what if we apply relativity the concept of relativity
to everything in the universe including the human mind including
science including religion including different cultures including the actual physical
existence of objects including the physical existence of the entire
universe what if all of that was relative and this
would be what i call absolute relativity which is what
awakening is so see if he was a little bit
wiser and more holistic he would he would have awoken
but he didn't because he was still stuck within the
little domain of of physics and he had to break
through that but he didn't because he considered himself a
physicist and so that's that but see today if i
try to teach scientists absolute relativity they're going to look
at me like i'm crazy because they're going to say
well leo absolute relativity you're talking about all these things
like science and religion this is not within the domain
of the little work that i do that's right i'm
talking about the entire [ __ ] universe so of
course it's it's way beyond the little work that you
do in your little cubicle in your university in your
little you know department whatever department you're a part of
even if you're a philosopher it's way beyond your philosophy
department even if you're in the religious studies department it's
way beyond your religious studies department because we're talking about
the entire universe so much for that if you want
to understand more about relativity and how that works check
out my very important episode called understanding relativism part one
i'm also still planning to release part two hang in
there for that one okay how about education education is
so ridiculously unholistic today and this is also creating all
sorts of social problems perhaps this is the biggest source
of our social problems is our shitty education system so
look at all the stuff education ignores education ignores personal
development emotional intelligence love epistemology metaphysics spirituality nutrition health by
and large education does not teach these things you can
go through 12 years 20 years of education through our
you know all the way through university and you could
not learn anything about these things leading you to believe
that these things don't even exist or that if they
do exist they're unimportant because otherwise they would have taught
me right i have a very deep critique about the
education system and i also have a giant list of
how to reform the education system that's going to be
a long separate episode about how to reform education system
and all of its problems so i i won't be
labor that point here there's there's just so much to
say about how deeply fundamentally flawed our education system is
really what our education system should be focused on is
everything that i teach with actualize.org now you might say
leo you're just being self-biased here aren't you i mean
how convenient of you to say that our education system
should just be what you teach but uh you have
to understand how i came here i came here because
i had a very holistic attitude towards life and i
was researching all this stuff and i wanted to know
you know what's the deepest most important lessons that you
can learn in life and through that actualize that org
spawned rather organically um and so and also i didn't
like invent these things i mean these things have existed
long before me mankind has been teaching this stuff for
10 000 years it's just that they're not incorporated properly
into our education system so it actually truly is the
case that our education system should be teaching you everything
that i'm teaching really if the education system was properly
designed i would be out of a job but of
course the other way you can see that is that
this is the education system this is the new education
system i am building the new education system that's what
actualize already is it's the education system that there should
be but there isn't because of all the systemic gridlock
and problems and red tape that exists within our education
system see i wouldn't be able to teach these things
within the education system you might say leo why don't
you just become a uh high school professor uh or
high school teacher or why don't you become a university
professor and i thought about that when i was younger
i actually wanted to be a professor of philosophy at
a major university and then i realized that i can't
because the system won't let me teach the things that
i really want to teach and therefore i knew i
had to carve my own path and so that's what
i did and so here we are and so even
though of course actualize.org the trade-off is that actualized.org doesn't
have the same reach it can't reach hundreds of millions
of people uh the way that our education system can
but uh but the but the upside is that we
can really talk about advanced things to those people who
really care about them and then what's going to happen
is that over the next 100 years our current education
system is going to incorporate it's going to realize it's
errors and it's going to start to incorporate all the
stuff that i've been teaching and of course it's not
just me there's many people who teach advanced stuff like
what i'm teaching so i'm not i'm not saying this
egotistically as though like my my work is the only
work it's like you know there's a lot of there's
a lot of work to pull from and in fact
my work pulls from hundreds of other people's work which
you can see if you read some of the books
on my book list but anyways so this is a
lack of holism within education scientific studies in general i
often see people quoting scientific studies as though they're the
truth the problem with scientific studies is that they're extremely
narrow and they're unholistic in the way they design these
studies therefore they give you very narrow results and when
they give you these narrow results these results can be
so narrow they're so easily recontextualizable in the future by
other data and other studies that it's almost worthless to
actually base any kind of actions or behaviors on them
which is why a lot of these nutritional studies and
so forth they're so flimsy people tout them as they're
like oh this study came out that says that coffee
makes you live longer or red wine makes you live
longer or something like that or saturated fats are good
for you or bad for you or whatever it is
and i just look at these and i say you
can't you why are you taking any of these studies
seriously they're so limited in their scope when what you're
talking about is this holistic highly complex human organism and
you have this very narrow study about red wine or
coffee or carbs or whatever it tells you virtually nothing
in fact it's misinforming you it's filling your mind with
all sorts of simplistic reductionistic delusions that will actually end
up harming your health more than it'll probably help you
all right so that's the collective problems now let's talk
about the individual problems stuff that you face so individual
problems stemming from lack of holism includes stuff like living
a hedonistic lifestyle eating junk food for example when you're
eating that junk food are you holistically thinking about how
this affects your longevity how this affects your health how
this contributes to your ability to do your work to
fulfill your life purpose to be able to love to
be able to have sex to be able to raise
children no you're just you're just picking out on some
pizza same thing with when you're not exercising how about
staying at a job that pays very well but it
doesn't satisfy you and you keep staying at it and
staying at and staying and procrastinating leaving and you just
keep staying at it for 10 years you waste 10
20 years of your life and then by that point
you're too uh jaded to even bother to make a
change see if you were holistic in your thinking you
would realize that yeah this job pays a lot but
the fact that it doesn't satisfy me and doesn't align
with my life purpose at my highest values this is
the bigger problem this is what needs to really be
addressed and no amount of money is worth that so
let me leave even though i'm going to take a
temporary um you know hit to my salary it's going
to be challenging it's going to be difficult to leave
and find a new job or to find start a
business or whatever but it's going to ultimately be more
satisfying in the end and that's what matters the most
see most people don't think this way about their work
how about crunching at work and leading a an alcohol
a workaholic lifestyle a lot of people do this they
work themselves to death until or until they get a
disease or they crunch at work until they burn out
and they have to quit or they're so tired they
can't do good work anymore see crunching and being a
workaholic seems nice at first if you're only thinking in
a short term in terms of the next year or
two but if you're thinking in terms of your career
and your business and your productive output over your entire
lifetime these things are laughably stupid and yet so many
people do them because they're not thinking holistically right they're
not considering how their work connects with their relationships and
their marriage with their sex life with their health with
their children with their relationships with their friends with their
family all these things are interconnected and you need all
those things to be in balance to have a happy
life but when you just focus on the work you
might think that it'll do something for you but it's
probably going to make you more miserable than the opposite
how about the example of avoiding going to the doctor
have you ever done this you might think you have
some disease or some ailment or something on your whatever
growing on you and then you're like gosh i should
probably go to the doctor but i don't want to
because if i go i'm afraid of what he's going
to say is it cancer is it a you know
is it something nasty is it something expensive this is
going to cost me ten thousand dollars i don't have
insurance whatever and so you don't go to the doctor
and you keep procrastinating for years not going to the
doctor well that's obviously very unholistic and stupid of you
it would be much better to just go and get
it get it over with because you know just by
not going to the doctor that thing's not going to
go away by itself you're just sticking your head in
the sand how about this example starting a project a
work project but then losing track of the ultimate goal
of what the project is about this is actually extremely
common and it happens even to very smart and conscious
people you can get so wrapped up in a project
especially if your project is going to take multiple years
to to complete that your original intentions behind the project
they were probably noble and pure they slowly get corrupted
by the pragmatics of the work that you're doing you
know the daily grind to the point where you forget
even why you began this kind of work in the
first place and then your goal just becomes something like
rather than some lofty goal you know to create some
beautiful work of art to influence people in a positive
way your goal becomes something much lower in base or
something like you know just to pay the bills or
just to keep people employed or just to keep the
company running or just to finish the project or just
to keep doing the same stuff that we've been doing
you know with actualized.org i constantly have to look back
you know what were my original intentions for starting this
stuff because it's easy for me to just get lost
in the grind of pumping out more videos every week
that takes up the majority of my like mental real
estate uh but then i have to wonder like wait
a minute should i even be making videos at all
maybe there's some higher form of doing my work than
videos maybe i should write a book maybe i should
do workshops or retreats maybe i should just go live
in a cave and meditate maybe that's really my work
and so i have to think back to like why
am i doing this right what's the ultimate goal what
is this serving in in in the grand scheme of
things of my life what is how is this serving
me releasing these videos i mean sure it gets me
some money it gives me some you know some pleasure
to release this stuff and get feedback from you guys
and so forth there's a certain satisfaction to doing work
but ultimately i did not get into this work only
for the satisfaction of doing work or for the money
or even for the you know the positive comments or
stuff i got into it because i wanted to have
a very specific impact on the world and then i
have to wonder like but is actually really having that
impact or is there a better way to have that
impact maybe there's a better way in which case i
have to just maybe quit actualize every goal together shut
it down because maybe there's a better way to do
it but see that requires a very large holism to
be able to do that it's very easy to get
stuck in one thing another example is being cheap when
hiring employees see if you lack holism and you try
to hire the cheapest employees you might end up hiring
also the worst least innovative most uh unskilled employees and
then that actually ends up hurting your business might even
actually lead to the bankruptcy of your business so maybe
it would have been better to to pay more but
then also to get more but that requires a long-term
sort of holistic understanding of how business works how about
lying in relationships that's a great example a lot of
people rely on relationships thinking that well if i can
just get away with this lie what's the big deal
the problem is you get away with it the next
time you also want to get away with the next
one and the next one and where does it stop
and then your relationship is built upon lies and then
of course see if you're not thinking holistically you can
think that you can get away with that but if
you think holistically you realize that you know if i
want a quality loving relationship which is probably what i
want then it has to be built on honesty as
soon as there's going to be too many lies between
us that relationship is as good as gone it's dead
and you're never going to bring it back but an
unholistic person is not thinking about the relationship holistically uh
most people are thinking about their relationships just flying by
the sea of their pants just navigating using their pleasures
and their aversions they don't actually think in sort of
meta way about the relationship itself and how to sustain
the health of the relationship see and then people wonder
why does so many people get divorced and why uh
why are most relationships so toxic and unhealthy well because
to have a healthy relationship you'd have to look at
it holistically not just from your selfish personal needs not
just from what causes you pleasure not just from what
causes you to feel love but holistically the entire relationship
you don't just look at your own needs or your
partner's needs but you have to almost like as though
there's a third entity that is a third whole law
that's even larger and more important than either you or
her or him whatever it is uh there's there's a
larger sort of third which is the relationship itself and
how do you maintain the health of that thing as
a coordinated dance between the two of these hold ons
that you and she or whatever is and see that's
a very different attitude towards relationship much more holistic and
notice by the way how much selflessness that would require
to approach relationships that way rather than report approaching relationships
the way most of us do which is just like
what am i gonna get what kind of sex am
i getting at what kind of love am i gonna
get and if i'm not getting it then i'm pissed
off and i'm gonna fight with you speaking of relationships
and sexuality and dating pickup the entire pickup community perhaps
his biggest problem is that it's fundamentally ridiculously unholistic it's
all about the male perspective as though the female perspective
isn't even important and of course because of this even
though many of these pickup people can get laid it's
effective for getting laid but when it comes to actually
having deep fulfilling relationships with women these pickup guys are
are so far away from that being able to do
that and in fact pickup makes you makes it even
worse because it it trains you with this very very
unholistic deeply self-biased attitude towards sex dating and relationships i've
talked about that to some degree in my rant against
pickup episode check that out uh how about this example
of staying married for the sake of children sometimes i
hear adults do this um but see the problem is
that if you really don't get along with your wife
or husband staying married to them just for the sake
of the kids to sort of keep up appearances um
this is going to backfire on you you're not thinking
holistically holistically speaking i mean you too if you can't
get along and you plan to live for the next
20 years together anyways for the sake of the kids
i mean there's going to be so many fights uh
so much demonization and judgment and hatred and toxicity build
up it's all gonna flow to your kids and then
your kids will get programmed with that for the rest
of their life and they'll be traumatized by that you're
not gonna be able to hide this from the kids
maybe it would be better for you to separate you
two to separate but then at least the kids won't
have to watch you fighting all the time with each
other that might actually be healthier in the most holistic
sense i mean i don't know you have to you
have to figure out the details for yourself i'm not
telling you what to do i'm just proposing this as
an example how about ripping off your customers if you're
doing business it might seem in the short term that
ripping off your customers is good gives you money but
in the long term in the long term your customers
will probably catch on they will get resentful and then
you won't have many customers and your business will fail
another example of lack of holism is dismissing the importance
of theory some people take this attitude of like ah
theory is all [ __ ] is philosophy armchair stuff
not important let's just get down to work let's be
very practical sounds good in theory but in practice what
happens is that when you ignore theory your practice is
very limited because theory shows you new ways to practice
theory allows you to introspect deeply about your practice and
to fine-tune it theory might tell you that your entire
practice is useless you should be doing some other totally
different practice see how do you know which practice you
should be doing how do you know the practice you're
doing is is the best one well only through theory
can you figure that out see so the division between
theory and practices is a deeply problematic and unholistic duality
i have an older episode called theory versus practice or
something along those lines search for it which is actually
one of my most important episodes very underrated go check
that out because this is so many people are confused
about this duality between theory and practice and they're both
important they're both very important but they have to be
balanced very delicately loans and credit that's a super unholistic
um economical idea both at the individual level also at
the collective level and perhaps lastly the most problematic lack
of holism is not doing spiritual work if you think
you're just going to skate by in life without doing
any spiritual work or any existential considerations and you think
that you're just gonna live a good life well i
got news for you you won't you're gonna suffer very
deeply for this and in the end as you get
older you're gonna have to start to face your death
as you age and as you face your death you're
gonna you're gonna experience the worst suffering because by not
doing the spiritual work you haven't really realized what death
is you haven't come to terms with it you're still
living in your ego and those last few years or
even decade or so of your life are going to
be some of the most miserable years so maybe it's
not so wise to not do spiritual work so holistic
thinking can be applied at the individual level and also
at the collective level both are important and in fact
you should notice that this duality between the individual level
and the collective level is itself a sort of brokenness
fragmentation within consciousness so if you approach reality as though
these two things are separate and as though one is
important but the other one is not that can only
lead to disease and brokenness and evil you should think
of the individual and the collective as two strands of
that you know double helix dna molecule you need both
strands that are intimately intertwined and perfectly balanced with each
other to create the dna strand that's that's in a
sensible society is society is not just society it also
isn't the the individuals that make it up and the
individuals are not just individuals they're also the society upon
which they rely without which they couldn't live so i
would like you to contemplate for yourself contemplate how many
problems in the world are the result of unholistic thinking
and then also contemplate how many of your personal problems
or the problems of people you you know are the
result of unholistic thinking and that should get you a
good idea of why it's so important uh beware of
teachings and endeavors or projects which are not holistic for
example success-based materialistic self-help teachings or business of that same
nature or western medicine or physics or mathematics or philosophical
schools or religions or even spiritual schools cults and political
ideologies all of these things are deeply unholistic and if
you buy into any one of these things too much
and you take it as the ultimate truth it's going
to lead to problems brokenness disease and suffering and ultimately
evil now i was driving my car just the other
day i had this whole episode planned out already and
i was just thinking like what is the essence of
what i'm trying to say here why is it that
a lack of holism is so problematic and the thing
that popped into my mind sort of as a eureka
moment is that really what i'm trying to say here
is that a lack of holism equals paradigm lock if
you don't know what paradigm lock is sort of a
termite coined you can find more about that by seeing
my episode called how paradigms work but paradigm locks just
means you're locked into a paradigm whether it's the scientific
materialistic paradigm or the religious christian or muslim paradigm or
the buddhist paradigm or i mean there's many paradigms the
capitalist socialist paradigm whatever so you see your mind subscribes
to this worldview or paradigm and this paradigm sort of
forms the periphery of your mind and what reality is
for you and one of the most powerful ways to
keep you within a paradigm is by limiting your holistic
thinking because if you think too holistically eventually you'll realize
that the paradigm is just a little bubble that you're
trapped in and you can break out of it for
example if you're a fundamentalist christian almost everything within fundamentalist
christianity is designed to keep you within the bubble like
if you start asking too many questions they'll they'll you
know reprimand you if you start behaving in ways that
don't correspond to the pair of them they'll reprimand you
if you start reading certain books that they don't like
they'll reprimand you they'll excommunicate you or whatever all to
kind of force you to stay within a little paradigm
and they're sort of taboo stuff everything that's taboo is
really the stuff that's considered false or evil basically to
keep you in the paradigm the paradigm creates this notion
of evil and of course evil is anything self-servingly because
all these paradigms are very selfish evil is defined as
anything which would break you out of the paradigm so
taking psychedelics is evil because it would break out of
the paradigm or you know doing meditation is evil from
a fundamentalist christian perspective because it breaks you out of
the paradigm studying too much science is evil maybe going
to university is too evil because those are elitists they're
trying to brainwash either marxists and communists whatever reading karl
marx's works das capital and whatever um that's evil why
because it might start to get you to question the
whole christian paradigm and so but this is not just
christianity this is true for islam buddhism it's true for
science as well and so to break out of these
paradigms your most powerful tool is holism because holism gets
you to recognize that well wait a minute i'm a
christian i'm in this bubble but there's also a muslim
who's probably also in this bubble there's a christian army
sorry an atheist who's also in this bubble and so
wait a minute these are all three different bubbles is
there something beyond that how do i integrate all of
these bubbles into a single understanding and when you do
that you break out of yours and you don't jump
into any others you go higher you sort of create
a higher bubble that incorporates all those three and then
once you're you live in that for a while for
a few decades then you realize wait a minute other
people are doing the same thing as i am they're
kind of going meta on all their paradigms but then
they do it in different ways so wait a minute
who's right me or them and then you realize wait
a minute i have to go even higher and you
have to create even higher bubble and so this continues
and in this way you end up breaking out of
all the paradigms and you end up jail breaking your
mind i've talked in the past about this idea of
jail breaking the mind i talked about it especially in
my episode called what is actualized.org sort of the intro
to what we're doing here with this work jail breaking
the mind is what we're doing and to jail break
the mind you need to be infinitely holistic that's how
the mind jails you is by getting you comfortable in
a less than a infinitely holistic way of thinking about
reality another point i wanted to make here is about
corruption you know a lot of people complain about corruption
government and so forth but they don't really understand how
deep the problem of corruption goes it's not just some
elitist washington fat cats who are corrupt and it's not
just you know bill gates and other ceos and jeff
bezos who are corrupt uh corruption really is a lack
of holistic intelligence that's truly what what corruption is at
its essence i don't have time here to go into
more depth on corruption but i have a whole deep
episode about corruption so this ties in with that go
check that out it's called how corruption works it's a
very important episode one of my best also sort of
underrated make sure you watch that because corruption is much
more sneaky than you think it is so here's the
catch-22 of holism you ready thinking holistically thinking holistically requires
appreciating the value of holism because if you don't appreciate
the value of holism why would you think holistically but
to see the value of holism and appreciate it requires
that you're seeing holistically that's the catch-22 so it's difficult
it's difficult for me to convince someone to think holistically
when he doesn't see the value in it which is
why we're spending the bulk of this series talking about
all the problems and the value of it so you
can really grok at a deep level how problematic it
is to not be infinitely holistic in your understanding of
reality it directly leads to suffering for you and for
all of mankind see but if you insist on being
dense and not thinking holistically there's nothing i can do
to convince you otherwise for example you might you might
pose the objection to me like but leo haven't a
bunch of people become rich and wealthy and powerful without
thinking holistically so why can't i just live my life
that way i mean it seems like you're you're trying
to set me on this course of the holistic life
but then there's this other course which is the unholistic
life why wouldn't i choose that when i can get
billions of dollars in hot girls and fancy cars and
a bunch of gold and whatever else a yacht buy
myself a yacht a private jet why wouldn't i do
that well of course you could but can you see
that even being attracted to that way of living the
sort of opulent luxury lifestyle even to be attracted to
that can you see how that already demonstrates a lack
of holistic understanding because if you truly had a little
bit of a holistic understanding you would see that that
lifestyle even though you're going to get money and girls
and yachts and whatever else jewelry um can you see
how none of that that's just going to be a
hedonic treadmill you're going to be running in you know
in place thinking you're getting somewhere but it's not really
going to satisfy you you're still going to be deeply
dissatisfied with your life in fact maybe even more so
because once you achieve those things there's not gonna be
any higher to go once you get a yacht and
a private jet and you've you know you've banged a
hundred hot girls and you've got all the jewelry what's
next where do you go from that more of the
same thing can you see how that's not going to
satisfy you you might even get suicidal from that so
the sooner you realize that the faster you can just
nix this entire path because this path leads you straight
to hell this is a path to hell it also
creates a lot of evil in the world to get
your billions and millions to bang 100 hot girls and
to have your yacht a lot of suffering needs to
be caused to others there's a lot of collateral damage
that comes with that so it would be wise of
you to realize that this path the holistic path is
actually going to lead to more fulfillment but that assumes
you have some wisdom in you if you don't have
wisdom i i can't i don't know what to say
to show you the value of this path the the
ultimate see if the ultimate end goal of this path
is hell what do you think the ultimate end path
endpoint of this path is here it's um it might
seem like i'm being uh sort of like i'm exaggerating
but it literally is what you think it is it's
the opposite of hell but it's not easy to get
there the holistic path is a difficult path which is
why most people don't take it but it's also deeply
rewarding and it's not flimsy and shallow like this path
there's real depth and meaning to this path here many
aspects of life and reality cannot be understood without significant
holism for example understanding the dynamics between men and women
sexually within you know relationships this cannot be understood unless
you're very holistic understanding conflict and war like for example
do you want to understand why war happens or why
conflict happens between people between nations you can't understand that
without deep holism understanding trauma and evil and corruption also
cannot happen without epolism understanding how to create a healthy
society can't happen without holism and these are just a
few of the examples there's a lot more so if
you really want to understand things and you value understanding
for its own sake the way that i do personally
i guess that that's that's the biggest reason that i
personally subscribe so much to an attitude of holism infinite
holism is because my highest values that i want to
understand as much as possible that's my biggest payoff in
life it's not money it's not releasing videos it's not
my work it's just pure understanding my own it's kind
of selfish just purely understanding things and so i realized
that i can't understand everything that i want to understand
unless i'm totally holistic about it and so that means
i got to be holistic so here we are all
right let's formally sort of define what are the components
of holistic thinking so when we say holistic thinking what
do i really mean because it's sort of a it's
a very uh vague word very vague term so first
of all it means taking all levels of being into
account the higher and the lower that you you care
about the ants you care about the stars and you
care about everything in between and you take all those
into account it also secondly means taking responsibility for everything
it's a radical responsibility taking and that's why it's so
challenging for example a lot of people simply get stuck
and don't develop further in their consciousness because they just
don't want to handle the responsibility you know it's much
easier to just you know when you're sipping your coke
can you just throw it out the window that's so
much easier than actually taking responsibility for the fact that
this coke can is gonna like actually create some litter
and maybe harm some animals or whatever um then then
you gotta like you gotta figure out what to do
with this cocan you gotta save it put it in
a bag take it out to a trash can when
you stop you gotta stop your car that's much less
convenient and most people simply don't want the inconvenience of
taking this much responsibility but that's what holistic thinking demands
uh thirdly it's uh awareness of your effect on the
whole so are you aware of how you affect the
corporation you work in the family that you're a part
of the relationship that your intimate relationship that you're part
of of the country that you're part of of the
globe that your country is a part of as a
living being within the entire universe uh are you aware
of the effect that your food has on society or
on poor people in another country are you aware of
how the work that you do might influence other people
you know are you aware of the toilet paper that
you consume how that has an effect on the rain
forest cutting down trees like all those need to be
taken into account another aspect is internalizing externalities externalities are
those things outside of your scope of survival concern that
don't concern you and so um to be a holistic
thinking you start to integrate those externalities like when you're
driving your car usually you might not consider how the
pollution from your car or the co2 emissions from your
car are affecting to you know global warming or to
cancer rates and babies or whatever you usually don't care
about that but but when you become a holistic thinker
you internalize that externality this carbon or this this pollution
you internalize it and then the consequence of internalizing it
in your mind is that next time when you go
to buy a car you might think twice about the
kind of car you want to buy maybe you're going
to look for a more fuel efficient car maybe you'll
buy an electric car maybe you'll use a bike instead
of a car see so it's not just the theory
theory then you know percolates into practice another component is
that holistic thinking accounts for systemic emergent properties you realize
that new things are emerging within reality so for example
as all of the nations on the planet are getting
together more integrated using internet literally we're wiring the globe
i actually posted a while back on my blog a
time lapse video of how you know cables are being
laid fiber optic cable is being laid through all the
oceans of the world interconnecting every city together into a
giant internet you know almost like a hive mind as
this is happening you got to realize that new things
will emerge reality is not just atoms and molecules and
humans and nations new stuff is going to keep emerging
as we keep evolving and you have to keep your
eye open for that it's very easy a lot of
times to sort of dismiss the the new emergent stuff
like maybe we could almost start to see that there
is a an emerging hive mind of mankind which is
coming online right now thanks to the internet and all
this sort of stuff and and i'm not just saying
that we have a bunch of interconnected computer computers and
i'm not just saying that we have a bunch of
humans talking to each other i'm saying no a totally
new we might almost say consciousness is emerging perhaps out
of the combination of all those things in the same
way that you your consciousness is an emergent we might
say of all the different cells and organs of the
body but those individual cells and organs don't know that
you are conscious we might say well we'll consider that
possibility now with mankind as a whole pretty cool huh
another component is that holistic thinking accounts for backfiring mechanisms
and the counter-intuitive counter-intuitiveness and non-linearity of reality what do
i mean by this as i talked about in my
intro to systems thinking which you should go check out
is related to this topic systems tend to complex systems
that are non-linear tend to backfire a lot of times
you make a change and the result is the opposite
of what you want and so therefore they're very counter-intuitive
so to be a holistic thinker you always got to
be keeping your eye out for this non uh for
this counter-intuitiveness and also what i call inversions a system
or a dynamic can easily invert on itself and go
full circle check out my episode called thing the theme
of things going full circle where we talk a lot
about this with many examples there's a lot of examples
that keep recurring where things go full circle and they
they boomerang and then this leads to very surprising counterintuitive
results and so you need to always be looking out
for that another aspect of holistic thinking is it sees
how the part fits into the hole also it values
not just the whole but also the parts you got
to value the whole and the parts otherwise there's problems
it also holistic thinking also sees how all dualities must
always ultimately reunite and i've talked about that at great
length in my episode called understanding duality especially part three
where i unify all these different dualities together and so
you got to be able to see how that keeps
happening for example when someone tells you well there's individual
problems or reflective problems and they're separate you as a
holistic thinker got to be able to see that no
wait a minute they can't be separate they're deeply intertwined
like i said and ultimately they must unite and ultimately
the difference between the individual and the collective there can't
be a difference that difference is a relative difference in
the absolute since there is no difference likewise when someone
says well there's men and there's women and men are
better than women when someone sells tells you that you
should as a wholesaler be able to zoom out of
that and say wait a minute men and women that's
just a duality they must unite together and there must
not be any difference between men and women at all
at the absolute level only at the relative yada yada
so forth holistic thinking requires a long time horizon that's
an important feature you can't just be thinking one year
ahead you got to be thinking decades ahead maybe even
100 years ahead maybe even ahead of your own death
to be really holistic like with climate change i mean
climate change is already happening we're seeing the effects of
it some people are suffering from it but the worst
parts of it aren't here and maybe the worst parts
won't even be here within your lifetime so you might
just say well okay then [ __ ] it then
who cares about the environment and and global warming doesn't
it doesn't matter because i'll be dead by then well
then you're not thinking holistically and that's the level of
development and consciousness that you're at holistic thinking requires you
consider relevance priority context and balance these are very important
you always have to be asking yourself as a whole
thinking is this thing relevant how relevant is it is
this the highest priority what do we really care about
here is this thing important what is the context of
this thing that i'm being told that i'm doing and
how do i balance things out and holistic thinking requires
considering the greatest good for all without selfish needs for
yourself so what is the greatest good of all that's
what you want to be aligning your mind and your
life to now it's important to note that it's not
enough to just be a holistic thinker you must also
perhaps even more importantly be a holistic carer carer you
must care about holism not just think it so here's
my question to you do you genuinely care about the
whole if you don't how can you ever be holistic
are you willing to be selfless for the sake of
the whole see the problem is that most people are
so wrapped up in their personal struggle just to survive
just to pay the bills just to hold their little
toxic relationship together and their minds are so biased just
fulfilling their basic needs and avoiding immense suffering that they
don't have the mental capacity or resources to care about
anything else but themselves and their own survival if that's
you i'm not blaming you or judging you i understand
that some people just have those situations in fact most
people do and i've been there myself and i still
have some of that in me as well you know
we're all surviving in some degree or another but but
if you're so wrapped up in survival that you don't
have the mental space or the emotional resources to genuinely
care about something larger than you then how can you
can't be holistic so if you're like that and you
want to become holistic the highest leverage thing you can
do is to solve your survival challenges solve them permanently
solve them in a healthy way such that you're not
repeating the cycle of just surviving see the problem is
that people when they try to solve their survival challenges
most of them the way they solve them is they
solve them in very unsustainable ways such that next year
they have to do it all over again and then
next year they have to do it all over again
so they're stuck for the rest of their life just
sort of treading water just to stay afloat well if
that's you you will never be holistic and you will
never reach the higher stages of life you've got to
find some permanent solutions to that so that you have
some free room and space and time to think about
something larger than yourself now that does not mean that
i'm giving you an excuse to be a selfish [
__ ] and to never think about something larger than
yourself you can start thinking about larger stuff today even
if you're stuck in some job that you hate or
you can't pay your bills you can still think about
this stuff i mean just try to see what you
can get away with what your ego will let you
go get away with but realistically your ego won't let
you get away with too much thinking about others and
improving society and so forth until you take care of
your basic needs take care of your money needs take
care of your food needs take care of your shelter
needs take care of your sexual needs in healthy ways
sustainable ways such that then you can move on to
something larger now i want to give you an example
here of different degrees of holism because it's important to
see that there's degrees of it so for example let's
take politics in a certain philosophical sense we might ask
ourselves what is politics really about what's going on like
if we if we totally zoom out of all the
crazy political rivalry that's going on in america or in
the world what's really going on well someone who's a
very low level of holism might say something like well
politics is about fighting off those evil other guys like
if i'm a republican i'll say politics is really about
defeating the democrats if i'm a democrat i might say
politics is all about defeating the republicans or if i'm
a muslim i might say paul politics is all about
spreading islam and defeating the christians or whatever or the
secular synfidels so this kind of is like the lowest
level of of understanding what politics is really about um
the next higher level of holism would be something like
well politics is really about money power fame sex and
domination i mean that's what all these politicians are doing
it's just different factions vying for for who gets the
most money the most power the most fame the most
sex the most nomination there's some truth to that every
level of this degrees of holism has some truth to
it but it's not a very high level of truth
there's a there's more distortion than truth in that but
then we go up one more level and say well
wait a minute what's what's it even more about what's
the what's something even higher that we can say that
politics is about well it's about creating a better society
you might say a fairer society it's about reducing suffering
i mean isn't that really what society is about ultimately
we got together because we wanted to survive collectively rather
than individually because it was easier and and now what
we're doing every year is we're just we're thinking up
ideas of how to improve society to make it better
fairer less corrupt less oppressive you know we got rid
of the kings and dictators so that we can have
a fair society and we've got to keep doing that
because there's still inequities and they're still suffering that's created
in the system okay now we're getting better that's a
slightly slightly more proper understanding of what society or what
politics is really about but can we go even higher
than that yes we can so if you zoom out
even higher you can ask yourself so what is it
above what's above that well and this is where you
got where you got to do some consciousness work and
you gotta have some spiritual breakthroughs you can realize that
really what politics is about it's about elevating consciousness the
consciousness of mankind and it's about increasing collective love it's
about helping every individual in society to be able to
be more conscious and more loving and as a result
all of that feeds into society as a whole making
it more conscious and more loving now that's pretty deep
see look at how far we've come from thinking of
politics as just you know fighting off the evil other
versus now talking about how to unite mankind and consciousness
and love this is a game changer and look the
majority of our politicians and business people and the people
who vote have no idea that this is what politics
is about the kind of news media that you watch
all the partisan tribalism you see on on everywhere on
social media and traditional media it doesn't give you any
sense that what politics is really about is about consciousness
and love but that is what it's about can you
see how important it is to understand that and can
you see why our politics is so [ __ ]
up precisely because virtually nobody understands this think of how
profoundly this would impact your personal politics and how you
participate in politics and if you got elected how you
would govern if you came to it from the understanding
that politics is all about elevating conscience and love versus
someone who got elected believing that politics is about defeating
and killing the republicans or the democrats but there's even
one level higher so what's the highest level the highest
level of what politics is really about it's about the
universe becoming ever more self-conscious self-aware and interconnected with itself
and that ultimately leads to infinite love that is the
the true and proper context and frame for understanding what
politics is the problem is that to understand this highest
frame you would need to have a ridiculous awakening a
ridiculous spiritual awakening probably multiple to realize this and of
course nobody has hardly anybody has and so how do
you even teach this to people see it's not enough
to take some democrat and republican sit them down in
a room and then tell them that hey you know
what politics is all about the universe becoming self-aware and
interconnected and infinite love it's about god creating itself that's
what the universe is i mean that's what politics is
all about they would look at you like like a
donkey would look at you if you were trying to
teach them some calculus it can't land they don't have
the reference experiences and their their level of cognitive development
is nowhere near capable of of understanding this and they're
too selfish and too self-biased to even care about this
they'll look at you and they'll say well yeah but
so what how do i feed my kids how do
i how do i kill those nazis or how do
i how do i how do i kill those progressives
that's those are their immediate concerns because that's the level
that they're at a similar story goes for science you
might ask the question of what is science really about
at the lowest level you might say science is about
manipulating reality like if someone is really selfish the only
reason they care about science is because science can help
them to manipulate something like if science can help me
to build a bomb that i can throw at my
enemies great that's the lowest level what about a higher
level well you might say something like science is about
measuring things now it's a little less selfish it's not
about bombing somebody or what science can do for me
it's more about like we can do measurements we can
figure out some aspects of reality then there's the higher
level which is science is really about understanding nature and
all of its different phenomena it's about understanding lightning and
rain and volcanoes and stars and planets and humans and
everything well it's a little more profound it's a little
better perspective on what science is you see that's better
than just using science to manipulate and build bonds but
is there higher you could say science is about expanding
our understanding of physical universe you could also say science
is about under expanding our understanding of life and consciousness
that's a little bit higher because when you think of
science as just the study of the physical universe that
already is a very limited definition of science when you
include consciousness and life into it that's a little bit
deeper that's a little bit less materialistic and then the
highest level is when you realize that science is the
universe becoming conscious of itself as god and love and
that science is identical to spirituality science is god exploring
itself because it's curious about itself because it's in love
with itself and so um now very few scientists see
this big picture they're somewhere lower down the ladder but
see when you put it this way this gives a
very deep grounding for science and many scientists sort of
intuit this even richard dawkins for example you know he
talks about some of the spiritual aspects of science in
the sense that you know you look up at the
stars and you wonder it makes you wonder and there's
this feeling of awe and reference yeah of course but
but do you understand why that is because you're god's
looking at yourself you're god experiencing its own creation that's
where the awe and wonder comes from the awe and
wonder is the awe and wonder of yourself as god
of infinite consciousness and of course when you love nature
and you love the stars or whatever what are you
doing you're loving yourself but of course scientists don't understand
that so anyways these are just two examples of the
different levels and tiers of holism and of course this
now apply this to any field for example if you're
going to be making movies you can you can make
movies from different levels of holism if you're making video
games if you're making music if you're writing if you're
whatever if you're making love you can do it at
different levels of holism all right now let's talk about
how to develop holistic thinking so first of all ask
higher quality questions i've stressed this a lot in the
past i have a whole episode called the power of
asking questions it's a very important episode sort of underrated
too go check that out i also have other episodes
about contemplation how to ask questions using journals and not
and i have an episode called the 64 most fascinating
questions that you can ever ask check all those out
so learning how to ask powerful questions higher quality questions
is crucial you can expand your holistic understanding through our
holistic thinking through psychedelics awakening god realization spirituality spiritual practice
psychedelics are especially ridiculously powerful nothing will increase your holism
more than psychedelics also developing your intuition is important because
intuition is a holistic faculty of your mind i have
an episode about intuition and i'll have more episodes in
the future about how to develop your intuition more another
way to develop it is don't settle for one-dimensional linear
reductionistic dualistic answers a lot of times when you're asking
questions in school at work or anyone you converse with
they'll oftentimes give you very one-dimensional linear reductionistic dualistic answers
don't be satisfied with those keep questioning keep wanting higher
answers that will push you to explore new perspectives read
books study stuff and then expand your holistic understanding uh
speaking of which another aspect is study many perspectives you
want as many perspectives as possible because that will just
expand your holism and also it'll expand your appreciation for
diversity of perspectives don't get stuck in a single perspective
also very importantly deconstruct the materialist and mechanical paradigm that's
straight jacketing your holistic thinking ability study systems thinking check
out my episode intro to systems thinking also start to
consider externalities and collateral damage that's very important read holistic
thinkers spiral dynamics stage yellow and above people people like
ken wilbur first off capra david baume einstein buckminster fuller
and many many others you can find many of those
on my book list and then there's still many beyond
that you can find them on youtube and elsewhere step
outside of your survival concerns we've already addressed that to
some degree another way is to study your own self
biases which i discuss in my episode called self bias
and also my other episode called introspection you can use
introspection to do that develop a long time horizon look
for top down and bottom up and also sideways causal
forces eliminate judging and criticizing as much as possible nothing
will hurt your holistic thinking ability more than judging judging
and criticizing and lastly adopt can wilbur's attitude of everyone
is right can wilbur sort of popularized this idea the
the the driving force behind his work of integral theory
and integrating all this understanding he has some brilliant work
is that he sort of started off looking at the
world seeing that there's all these different people with all
these different ideas and perspectives and paradigms and worldviews religious
ones secular ones and everything in between and how do
we know who's right and he had an intuition that
told him everyone must be right in partial ways of
course in different degrees so we're not saying that the
nazi is as right as the civil rights leader but
we're saying that there's value in every perspective something you
can learn from every perspective and that even in a
certain sense the nazi is right in a certain twisted
way and it's valuable for you to study what that
is and how that works and through this paradigm you
can integrate stuff together and that is the most holistic
way to approach this epistemic problem of a sort of
an infinite multiplicity of perspectives that all disagree with each
other all right now here are some questions to help
you think holistically these are very powerful questions you can
ask in in many situations in business in relationships and
your personal life write some of these down and start
using them so firstly how are x and y interconnected
x and y can be any two things how are
they interconnected for example how is my consumption of food
interconnected with the health of the planet or how is
my doing my marketing interconnected with the mental health of
my children and at first the connection might not be
obvious but as you think about ask this question it'll
interconnect another question is what is the big picture here
this one helps you to zoom out and to see
the hole rather than getting lost in the details another
good question is what is the larger context of this
sometimes you hear something you have a teacher tells you
something or you hear something in a video somewhere like
a little snippet or something and you get so wrapped
up in that you don't see the larger context what
was what was that teacher or what is this book
really trying to say what is this statement really trying
to say see the larger context another question is what
is the ultimate point of all this and by all
this i mean whatever you're working on like you might
be in a project sitting in a in a meeting
with a bunch of people you guys have been talking
for an hour and then you stand up and say
wait a minute guys we're bickering back and forth talking
about all sorts of bunch of [ __ ] what
is the ultimate point of this meeting what are we
trying to do or you might even say what is
the ultimate point of our business why are we even
here this clarifies a lot of things another question is
why am i doing this at all it's a great
one a lot of people don't ask this question like
you might be in a in a toxic relationship and
at some point you just ask yourself why am i
doing this at all or you might be in some
dead end job and you just want well ask yourself
why am i doing this at all or maybe your
boss or your business is is you know manufacturing some
poison pill and you might just ask yourself why am
i doing this at all another good question is how
is this a part of something larger whatever you're doing
how is it a part of something larger and what
is that larger thing and a related question is how
does this part serve the larger hole and you might
discover that it doesn't in which case you're in trouble
you got to change what you're doing also how is
this part of a duality so you might be thinking
about sexuality from the male perspective and you get so
wrapped up in that because you're male let's say you
forget the other half of the story and then you
might ask yourself well how is this part of a
duality and then you realize oh yeah women have their
own reproductive concerns and so forth and they might be
different and the two interconnect somehow and you might ask
yourself further how will this duality collapse and unite how
will this thing circle back around on itself how will
this invert how will this boomerang another question to ask
is what is best for the health of the whole
what is the hot what is the highest good for
the whole for example it would be nice if some
of our top ceos ask this question more like i
would i would like to ask i would like to
have like the ceo of exxon mobil asked this question
what is best for the health of the whole and
by whole i don't mean his company and by whole
i don't mean his shareholders another question is how should
the parts be rebalanced for the good of the whole
that's another question i want some of our business leaders
to ask another question is which parts are out of
balance leeching selflessly from the hole another question is how
is this fragmented so enter any situation a company a
classroom a book that you're reading a relationship that you're
in and you can ask yourself how is this fragmented
and how can it be unified and healed another question
is how am i drawing the boundary of the system
because you see a lot of unholism comes from the
fact that we draw our boundaries too narrowly and too
selfishly to serve our own interests leaving a lot outside
the boundary of our concern and so in any situation
you go into you can ask you know who is
drawing the boundary how are they drawing the boundary why
are they drawing the boundary the way they are of
course the answer is that they're selfish they're drawing the
boundary to their selfish interests but then you can ask
the further question of well how can i redraw the
boundary to expand the boundary you can also ask how
am i involved in the situation you can ask as
of any topic like when it comes to the destruction
of the rain forest you can ask yourself how am
i involved in the situation because usually we say well
the rain forest i don't live in the rain forest
so i'm not involved or like how am i involved
in overfishing i don't fish for sturgeon i don't eat
caviar so i'm not involved with the killing of the
sturgeon and their extinction but you are in some way
you are i guarantee it but you have to sit
down and think about it and this question will help
you to do that because a lot of times what
the ego loves to do is to avoid responsibility for
all sorts of things and to say well that's not
my problem i didn't do it directly yeah but the
whole thing is that reality is not always direct it's
a lot of times indirect we're not just talking about
the direct here the indirect is sometimes as important as
the direct another question is how would god see this
situation what would jesus do in other words how would
god see the situation so for example if god was
managing exxonmobil how would he manage it but for this
to work you have to understand what god is so
let me quickly tell you just a loose idea so
at least you can start to use this question so
god's thinking about a thing is unbiased selfless unattached fearless
benevolent all-loving all-understanding non-judgmental self-accepting and seeking exquisite balance for
the good of all that's the ultimate highest holism that's
what god is that's god consciousness so this is this
is the this is the kind of thinking that led
to the creation of the entire universe that's why it
works so well without hitch so now apply that perspective
to any situation you're in that's very powerful extremely powerful
is so powerful because this is the power that created
the entire universe so just don't dismiss this question and
lastly how can i better serve the greatest whole if
you just align your life with that question you're going
to ace life not easy to do but anyways so
those are some of the questions for you now uh
we're starting to get close to the to the end
let me wrap up here with a few warnings so
warning number one is that remember studying the whole in
order to manipulate it for personal gain is not holism
for [ __ ] sake you might say like oh
okay leo taught me holism and now what i'm going
to do is i'm going to go and study the
stock market or the crypto market or the business market
i'm going to study the hell out of it and
then i'm going to find a loophole that i can
exploit and then i'm going to get rich and that's
holism no that's not holism that's devilry that's evil see
you're exploiting a system for your personal benefit that's everything
that i don't that i teach against right see this
is the problem with someone like trump so so uh
you know sometimes people say trump is a brilliant systems
thinker because he can uh you know he knows how
to manipulate the media and he knows how to get
his base riled up and voting for him he knows
how to get them activated and motivated and all this
he's a genius yeah he's a genius devil that's what
he is but he's not thinking holistically about anything and
he's not thinking systemically because if you were truly holistic
you would realize that to use your understanding of holism
for the purpose of manipulating the whole for your personal
selfish gain is extremely unholistic and unhealthy and toxic and
cancerous and evil that is the definition of evil you
can't separate holism from selflessness they're utterly entangled now here's
one more warning which is a little tricky watch out
this is a trap that many of you will fall
into so far the way that i've been presenting this
holism idea is as though we have reductionism on this
side and holism on this side and that reductionism is
bad holism is good so adopt holism throw away reductionism
judge it and condemn it and now just be holistic
and only think about holes and that's it this is
holism as the polar opposite of reductionism if you think
this way you're actually not being truly holistic because there's
really two versions of holism see if you can grasp
this it's a little bit subtle but also it's pretty
easy to understand so let's define the following distinction make
this distinction in your mind there is holism with a
lowercase h and there's holism with an uppercase h what's
the difference the difference is that the little h holism
is the polar opposite of reductionism creating a new duality
which of course is unholistic so it's when you put
it's when you act and try to be holistic but
you're still not fully holistic because you have created duality
between you and reductionism you haven't really you've drawn your
boundary that still excludes some stuff whereas true holism with
you know absolute holism with an ab capital h we'll
call that absolute holism absolute holism is so holistic that
it even incorporates reductionism into it and it incorporates and
integrates the unholistic people and things that's going on everywhere
so when you're operating under the lower case age holism
you will see unholistic people everywhere and you will judge
them and demonize them and criticize them and hate them
and that's not very holistic if you're practicing uppercase h
absolute holism you will see all those and you realize
ah those are just people with low consciousness who don't
know any better they haven't learned about holism and maybe
some of them can be redeemed and in the end
all those people are just action aspects of myself god
as the whole universe and all of it is just
love and when you take that approach can you see
that that is the highest holism your holism is so
high that it even integrates evil huh the lower case
h holism still thinks that there is a good which
is holism and then there is a bad which is
the opposite of holism but that's can you see how
that's limited if your goal was to truly be holistic
actually not as an ideology or anything like that you
would have to incorporate all of the evil and all
the stuff you don't like and all the unholistic stuff
you can't just say well i'm gonna be holistic and
[ __ ] everybody else they can do whatever they
want and if they're unholistic then they're bad and they're
wrong and they're evil if you say that you're not
truly being holistic so be careful making that mistake being
holistic in an absolute sense is one of the most
difficult things you can do because you can see how
threatening it is to the ego you have to surrender
so much to be able to accept all that evil
and all that lack of holism in the world because
you know what when you just because you decide to
be holistic does not mean people are going to start
to be nice to you you might be holistic but
people will try to rob you scam you hurt you
attack you maybe even kill you enslave you exploit you
and you have to be so holistic that you realize
oh yeah all of that is just an aspect of
myself of the universe is just different manifestations of love
at various densities and if you could do that then
you would truly be holistic can you see now the
ultimate form of holism isn't thinking at all we've been
talking about thinking here a lot but there's only so
far you can go with thinking the ultimate form of
holism is pure infinite consciousness holism is actually a function
of consciousness your state of consciousness determines how holistic you
are more than anything that you think it's still important
to increase your thinking ability but uh once you've done
that and you're ready for more then you gotta go
trans thinking trans-rational you cannot think your way to the
highest holism which is why maybe some of the stuff
i'm saying here sounds kind of kooky new agey and
not rational or maybe it doesn't make practical sense to
you like when i tell you that all the you
know evil people are out there who are exploiting you
they are just expressions of love you probably don't many
of you probably don't uh understand why i say that
that's because to understand that you have to go beyond
just thinking about it to actual infinite consciousness change your
state so the changing of your state of consciousness is
actually the highest level you can pull to become more
holistic which is why i said psychedelics are one of
the best ways to do it because psychedelics are the
most effective way hands down of radically altering your state
of consciousness but there are other ways it's not just
psychedelics but yeah that's one of the most remarkable things
about about psychedelics is just how holistic they feel when
you take them right i mean if you've taken psychedelics
you know what i'm talking about it feels so holistic
even if you've just done them recreationally like you took
some mdma at a at a nightclub at a rave
at a music festival um maybe you didn't really realize
much but probably the one thing you did realize is
uh is the holism of it all that's very powerful
keep doing more of that although i don't recommend doing
a lot of mdma it's not very healthy for you
there's healthier psychedelics so in conclusion a fragmented mind creates
a fragmented world to heal the world we must unify
our minds if we don't unify our minds there's no
way the world can heal i hope that's obvious to
you and then the only question is do you want
to heal the world do you want to take responsibility
for that or are you just going to say that's
not my problem i don't care every problem has both
holistic and unholistic solutions so here you have to be
careful because a lot of times you face a problem
in your life personally or collectively and you're looking for
a solution but sometimes you're so desperate you just want
a solution you'll take any solution and you'll forget that
there are different kinds of solutions there's not just one
solution there are unholistic solutions and holistic solutions and so
you have to be very careful here not to get
suckered into unholistic solutions for example if you're broke and
you got to pay your bills an unholistic solution might
be go to go rob a bank or another unholistic
solution might be to go you know take a course
on wall street day trading and become a wall street
day trader and to think that well oh this will
solve my problems no you're just kicking the can down
the road your problems will keep multiplying chances are you'll
lose all your money anyways whatever little you have left
and you'll be even broker than you are right now
that's the reality of unholistic solutions or maybe you're feeling
uh heartbroken after a intimate relationship collapsed of yours so
you go you know you're looking for a solution to
your misery and you go and you shoot up some
heroin well that would be a very unholistic solution a
holistic solution for example in the case of you know
if you're broke you might get serious about starting a
business and you might start researching that not a get-rich-quick
scheme but a serious actual business where you generate value
and work hard at it that would be a holistic
solution if you're feeling bad after a you know a
big breakup rather than splurging on a bucket of ice
cream or some heroin you a more holistic solution might
be something like you take a week off you do
a solo retreat maybe treat yourself a little bit maybe
maybe you can even afford to buy a plane ticket
to hawaii just go there and just kind of bask
in your misery while you're walking around the beach and
looking at beautiful stuff and just you know contemplate why
your relationship went wrong and what you're going to do
next time and and just kind of make it a
little bit meditative like that that might be a holistic
way to go about that and what you should know
is that if you encounter a problem in your life
that you feel is impossible to solve most likely it's
because simply because your approach to that problem was not
holistic enough and this is a beautiful thing if you
realize this because this gives can give you so much
optimism and hope in your life like if you have
a health problem if you have a business problem if
a financial problem if you have a drug addiction problem
alcohol problem overeating problem problem getting laid getting a date
a problem meditating a problem with depression or your emotions
a problem with your insecurity and low self-esteem and you've
been trying to solve that problem the problem is that
you've been trying to solve it within a certain narrow
paradigm an unholistic approach you've been taking so if you
really want to solve that problem you gotta ask yourself
sort of a meta question here it's like hmm you
know goddammit i've been trying to build this business for
the last five years i keep failing and failing and
failing i'm still stuck in wage slavery i don't know
what to do is it just the universe is my
am i cursed is this just am i is this
just how it's supposed to be no ask the meta
question how is my thinking not sufficiently holistic enough to
crack this problem that's powerful and then you might realize
something like wait a minute yeah i've been trying to
work hard at this business but i've been working hard
but i didn't study how business works enough maybe i
got to go buy books or maybe what i really
need you know i read a bunch of books already
and they didn't work maybe what i really need is
i need to find a mentor face to face he
can point out my problems to me so maybe you
go find a mentor or maybe you say like um
the reason my business wasn't working was because the business
i was working on i wasn't fully passionate about i
didn't care about it as much therefore i wasn't motivated
enough and then maybe you go take my life purpose
course and then you find your life purpose and then
maybe that helps you whatever whatever or maybe you know
i've been trying to build this business but i was
too focused on building the product but i wasn't focused
enough on marketing maybe i could go study marketing so
you go study marketing and that will be the key
that unlocks that that problem very powerful so can you
see that division fragmentation and reductionism is not bad it's
only bad in the relative sense because if you're truly
holistic nothing is bad everything is good and everything you
think is bad is just a bias that you have
that you need to let go of see good is
equivalent to holism so if you want the highest good
seek the highest holism and you'll find it and lastly
just remember this he or she who is most holistic
wins the game of life all right that's it i'm
done here i'm very exhausted um that was challenging to
do because i feel light-headed from this fast but anyways
we got through it so there's proof for you that
the brain can even work with when it's running low
on glucose and i think this this episode is actually
pretty good maybe even one of my clear ones in
a certain sense i have i have very good mental
clarity and i'm very calm and grounded from this fast
but also like i feel very weak and lethargic and
just like almost like i'm about to faint at any
moment so it's this very odd place to be um
and it's not particularly pleasant i'm looking forward to get
some food in another week but okay this is it
i'm done here please click that like button for me
come check out actualize.org that's my website you'll find my
blog with a bunch of videos i will post about
my fast on the blog soon you can check that
out it'll be a valuable video for many of you
um actually quite important i post i post a lot
of important stuff on my blog exclusive stuff you can
only find it there it's free i don't charge you
anything for it i could i could charge you hundreds
of dollars for it i print out for free so
don't be stupid and don't ignore that and what else
is there the book list the life purpose course the
forum come ask questions on the forum i answer so
much stuff on the forum um other people there answer
and provide good good answers as well participate join a
community that helps you to stick with this actualization journey
and the last thing is that i have a book
recommendation for you but it's only for those of you
who have purchased the book list so if you purchase
the book list which is very cheap and affordable um
go into the book list and look for a book
use the search function control f search for david baume
on that book list i think i have two books
by david bowman one of them is called implicator not
that one there's another one find that one and read
it and study it deeply because it's all about this
problem of a lack of holistic thinking and why holistic
thinking is so important that book it's a it's a
killer book in combination with this entire holistic thinking episode
and if you haven't bought my book list and you
haven't started reading the books on my book list you're
really missing out and in fact this is what i'll
end on is that look my videos are pretty deep
and long and it makes you think that oh well
i've watched so many of leo's deep videos and long
videos that surely this is enough theory surely i don't
need to read any books you do and i don't
care how many other youtubers you watch or how many
podcasts you listen to none of that is a substitute
for reading books there's something you get from books that
you can't get from any audio or visual source you
must read these books there's detail in there that will
interconnect many of the concepts and really my videos are
just half of the equation the other half of the
equation is to read all the books on my book
list so to really start to do this self-actualizing stuff
this business seriously you got to watch a lot of
my videos you also got to watch a lot of
other videos that are not mine that are talking about
other stuff that i don't talk about and you got
to read at least 100 books at least 100 books
make the goal over the next five years to read
100 books from my book list this is one of
the best things you'll ever do in your life it's
one of the best investments in your life it's not
expensive it'll cost you virtually nothing other than your time
and effort yes it will take a bit of time
quite a bit of time but but man this is
gonna this is gonna help you understand so much stuff
there's just there's just so much detail to these topics
that we're talking about that you can't i can't possibly
deliver it all to you as much as i try
even through these long ass two three hour videos and
these multiple episodes series it just can't happen so go
read the [ __ ] books and then stay tuned
for more you
