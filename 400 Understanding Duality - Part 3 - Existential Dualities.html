            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/D4izvIGPsXQ' target='_blank'>Understanding Duality - Part 3 - Existential Dualities</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Subjective vs Objective Duality</b>: Leo emphasizes that everything is actually a subjective experience, including what we consider objective - evidence, physical objects, and the universe. He refers to the discoveries of quantum mechanics, which blur the lines between subject and object, noting that our measurement of an object affects the object itself. As we explore personal development and spirituality, we begin to perceive objects and people as both subjects and objects simultaneously, understanding that the universe is one subject.
</li><li><b>Esoteric vs Exoteric Duality</b>: Leo distinguishes exoteric religion, a materialistic and externalized version of spirituality traditionally understood by most people, from the esoteric version which is internal and focuses on the realization of divinity within oneself. He calls for recognizing the interconnectedness of these two perspectives and understanding that exoteric practices are founded on esoteric principles. 
</li><li><b>Metaphysics vs Epistemology Duality</b>: Leo outlines the intimate connection between metaphysics (the study of the nature of reality, focusing on 'being') and epistemology (the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion). He asserts that metaphysics, or the study of 'being', is more fundamental and explains that the pursuit of knowledge is deeply related to understanding 'being'. This means that the distinction between knowing and being gets transcended, leading to the realization of 'Being' with a capital B.
</li><li><b>Understanding of dualities</b>: Leo Gura continues his discussion on understanding various dualities such as metaphysics and epistemology, chaos and order, destruction and creation, love and hate, and alone and together. 
</li><li><b>Metaphysics vs. Epistemology</b>: Gura highlights the interconnection between 'knowing' and 'being', stating that one becomes what they know. This includes understanding metaphysical concepts and its interconnectedness with epistemology, marking the transcendental rule of metaphysics.
</li><li><b>Chaos vs. Order</b>: He indicates the symbiotic relationship between chaos and order, where one cannot exist without the other. In fact, he introduces the concept of Chaos Theory, which hypothesizes an underlaying order within chaotic systems, disrupting the general notion of chaos being associated with randomness.
</li><li><b>Destruction vs. Creation</b>: Similarly, Gura opines that creation and destruction are intertwined, asserting that to create something new, something old has often to be destroyed.
</li><li><b>Love vs. Hate</b>: Gura redefines love as an absolute concept, explaining that even acts of hate happen out of pure love. He suggests that becoming aware of ones capability to love unconditionally, even things they profoundly dislike or hate, aligns them towards this absolute concept of love.
</li><li><b>Alone vs. Together</b>: According to Gura, consciousness of oneself as the entire universe or 'God' resolves the duality between being alone and being together. This understanding redefines the concept of singularity into unity, leading to a realization that any form of hatred towards others is actually self-loathing.
</li><li><b>Realization of being "alone"</b>: Leo Gura explains the realization of Absolute aloneness. For instance, every person we interact with in realityfamily, friends, foes is an extension of us, just like characters in our dreams. This concept can be uncomfortable, implying the idea that we are alone no matter how closely we associate with others, there's an underlying feeling of being alone. However, understanding and accepting this can be a beautiful realization that we are God experiencing itself.
</li><li><b>Need for maximum diversity in the universe</b>: Leo discusses that the universe is designed to experience maximum diversity or infinite diversity. This is based on the idea that as God, we desire to experience every possibility of ourselvesleading to the vast diversity in life forms. This understanding opens the possibility for absolute loveaccepting, tolerating and appreciating the infinite diversity that exists.
</li><li><b>The duality of "dumb" versus "intelligent"</b>: While intelligence is generally elevated and being 'dumb' is stigmatized, Leo argues that intelligence is omnipresent and intrinsic to every part of the universe. It's not limited to the human brain or ability to perform logical reasoning. Everything in the universe, even things considered 'dumb', is part of an infinitely intelligent design.
</li><li><b>Interconnection of freedom and limitation</b>: Freedom and limitation are viewed as opposing forces. However, Leo suggests that maximum freedom implies the freedom to create limitations. For example, if individuals have the freedom to do anything, that freedom can be used to enforce limitations.
</li><li><b>Absolute Freedom vs. Limitation</b>: Absolute freedom, if given to all, can lead to chaos and exploitation by the most powerful individuals. The power to do anything includes the power to limit oneself, so ultimate freedom also encompasses absolute limitation. This concept is central to understanding the structure of existence or "God" as a state of infinite freedom. This freedom allows for the natural diversity seen in different life forms, each with its own limitations. Any form experienced, even if endowed with multiple capabilities, will always have limitations.
</li><li><b>Part vs. Whole</b>: Everything in the universe is a "whole", which is simultaneously a part and a whole. An example could be a carbon atom, which, while being a part of a molecule, is also a whole in itself. This principle applies to everything from atoms, molecules, organisms, and even the entire universe. In a state of non-duality, you realize that all there exists is one complete entity or universe, and there isn't an opposite reality. You transcend the concept of "part" and "whole" and experience complete "wholeness".
</li><li><b>One vs. Many</b>: The distinction between "one" and "many" is a human construct, and everything can be subdivided an infinite number of times. Whether an entity is perceived as one or as many depends on the observer. In reality, "oneness" and "multiplicity" are the same, signifying an infinite number of "manynesses". Transcending the duality of "one" and "many" leads to realization of "oneness".
</li><li><b>Mundane vs. Divine</b>: Mundane and divine are not opposites. Mystical or meditative experiences often help individuals realize the divinity within themselves and their surroundings. However, these experiences of divinity can be ephemeral, and one may return to perceiving the world from a mundane perspective. The ultimate goal, however, is to sustain awareness of everything as divine.
</li><li><b>Divinity Perception</b>: The distinction between mundane and divine becomes blurred upon realizing that everything around us is radiating with divinity, which highlights the importance of spiritual consciousness in viewing divinity.
</li><li><b>Imminent vs Transcendent God</b>: God is both a part of the world and beyond it. This concept draws from non-dual nature implying that God doesn't separate itself from creation, it exists within every creation.
</li><li><b>Holiness Misconceptions</b>: People often misconstrue 'holiness' as something opposite of 'unholiness', failing to realize that holiness is an absolute encompassing everything.
</li><li><b>Conscious vs Unconscious</b>: The concept of conscious and unconscious can be misleading as the reality is a field of infinite consciousness without any opposite, thereby rendering the term unconsciousness as an abstract illusion.
</li><li><b>Knowing vs Not Knowing</b>: Epistemology and metaphysics collapse together upon realization, highlighting that it is impossible to truly know anything due to the vast inherent mystery of reality.
</li><li><b>Meaningless vs Meaningful</b>: The realization of absolute meaninglessness allows for freedom to consciously create personal meaning as all meanings are self-fabricated. This paradox underscores the importance of acknowledging the subjective nature of meaning in life.
</li><li><b>Existential duality of life vs death</b>: Leo speaks about the intimate connection between life and death, asserting that in order to live, you have to kill. Even unintentional forms of killing, such as walking over ants, contribute to an individual's life. The dualistic war between life and death is constantly being waged inside the bodies of all living beings.
</li><li><b>Concept of mortality vs immortality</b>: Leo suggests that by transcending this duality, one can attain immortality. He emphasizes that death is merely an idea, and one's true nature cannot die, as it is connected with the entire universe and thus exists eternally.
</li><li><b>Real vs Unreal Duality</b>: The conventional understanding of real vs. unreal, reality vs fantasy, dreams vs waking life, and hallucination vs reality is refuted. Instead, Leo claims that there's no distinction between these dualities. Furthermore, he insists that our perceived realities are essentially 'hallucinations' or appearances without any substantial existence. 
</li><li><b>On Video games being likened with reality</b>: Leo suggests that with technological advancements, the line between a video game and reality is becoming blurred, to the point where characters in video games might not be able to distinguish if they're in a game or in actual reality. He asserts that this is possible not just because of the improving graphics but because there is no distinct difference between physical reality and the reality within a video game.
</li><li><b>On duality of being and non-being</b>: Though seemingly opposites, Leo enlightens that a transcendental approach could help unify this duality as well.
</li><li><b>Understanding that being is an absolute</b>: Leo Gura explains that even delusion or falsehood is being because to make a lie, it has to exist. Everything that happens or has ever happened is being. Being with a capital B is absolute and transcends the concepts of actuality and potentiality. 
</li><li><b>Actual versus potential or virtual</b>: Leo discusses that actual and potential are not opposites, but both are intrinsically part of the self. Everything potential becomes actual and everything actual was once potential. This encapsulates the infinite potential which God becomes, and this transformation is indiscernible from infinite actualization.
</li><li><b>Actual and Conceptual Distinction</b>: The video brings attention to the inherent indistinctiveness between the actual and the conceptual. All concepts are actual as no concept can exist without actuality.
</li><li><b>Self versus world and self versus other</b>: Leo comments on the distinction that we make between ourselves and the world, and between ourselves and other people, stating it as the most fundamental duality. He argues that our existence is predicated on these distinctions and that dissolving them would mean losing our sense of self, which can be terrifying.
</li><li><b>The collapse of duality between self and God</b>: Leo discusses the difference between God as a belief and God as an actual concept. He clarifies the connection between selflessness and the realization that the self is the entire universe. This absolute subjectivity or emptiness is the source of absolute love.
</li><li><b>Meditation versus life</b>: Leo suggests that with consistent practice, the line between formal meditation and daily life blurs until life itself becomes a constant meditation. You stop distinguishing between ordinary life and formal meditation practices, thereby granting yourself constant mindfulness.
</li><li><b>Existence versus non-existence</b>: Leo finishes by discussing the duality of existence and non-existence, explaining that existence, with a capital E, is absolute and transcends these two concepts. This realization culminates in understanding that we exist within the infinity of existence.
</li><li><b>Existence has no opposite</b>: Leo Gura explains that existence and non-existence are not opposites. Even when we say something does not exist, like Santa Claus or unicorns, they exist as concepts or ideas in our minds. Anything, even falsehood or delusion, comes under existence.
</li><li><b>Concept of truth</b>: The conventional understanding of true and false forms a duality. However, from a non-dual perspective, false does not exist. Absolute truth refers to everything that exists and coincides with God, love, selflessness, and everything. Non-existence of falsehood doesn't mean absence of it but understanding the illusory nature of what is deemed as false.
</li><li><b>Duality of duality and non-duality</b>: This statement highlights that while discussing non-duality, we inherently create a dualistic frame, but this is unavoidable due to the nature of language and thought. The transcendental absolute of non-duality cannot be communicated via language or thought, it needs to be realized personally. Importantly, the non-dual perspective should be applied without demonizing or rejecting duality.
</li><li><b>Relative vs absolute</b>: This duality highlights the importance of acknowledging both the relative and absolute aspects of truth. The absolute truth is the ultimate, but the relative truths from our everyday life experiences are also crucial to maintain a balance. 
</li><li><b>Division vs Unity</b>: Leo urges viewers to understand the true meaning of unity that embraces division rather than excluding it. Most people trying to unify often exclude those who want division, which contradicts the concept of true unity. 
</li><li><b>Existence and absolute truth</b>: These concepts stress the need for personal direct experience and exploration. Existence is eternal, and absolute truth, synonymous with consciousness or awareness, has no counterpart. By transcending conventional thinking, one realizes the absolute unity of all things, including duality and non-duality.
</li><li><b>Duality of sanity and insanity</b>: Leo discusses how the boundary between sanity and insanity is blurred and can easily be crossed. This realization can be terrifying, especially during psychedelic trips. He proposes that what society deems as sane, is often based on social constructs and conventions that are inherently unstable and subjective. He suggests that the idea of being sane is merely a way for individuals to navigate survival.
</li><li><b>Interconnection of matter and spirit</b>: He challenges the conventional distinction between matter and spirit, explaining that a deep understanding of spirituality reveals a unification of the two, where everything is spirit. He references developments in quantum mechanics that point towards unity in all matter at a subatomic level, and describes this unifying field as consciousness or spirit.
</li><li><b>Transcendence of form and formlessness</b>: Leo explores the duality between form and formlessness. He asserts that with deep awakening or enlightenment, one can realize that form and formlessness are identical. He further explains this concept with the Hindu mythology of Shiva and Shakti, where Shiva symbolizes formlessness and Shakti symbolizes energy or form. 
</li><li><b>Duality of zero and infinity</b>: Discussing the concepts of zero and infinity, he posits that these elements are not opposites but identical, as an infinity that is unbounded and formless is nothing or zero.
</li><li><b>Duality of limited and unlimited</b>: Similarly, he explores the duality of limited vs. unlimited and how the concept of an absolute infinity, or God, includes every finite possibility, transcending the perceived duality.
</li><li><b>Concept of Unlimited</b>: God, being unlimited, must include limitations because excluding limitation would make it limited itself. This is linked to the understanding of freedom and limitation.
</li><li><b>Enlightened vs Unenlightened</b>: People who are unenlightened perceive enlightenment as separate from unenlightenment. Upon enlightenment however, it is realized there is no difference between enlightenment and unenlightenment. Yet, it is advised for unenlightened individuals to maintain a distinction until they attain enlightenment.
</li><li><b>God, Atheism, and The Devil</b>: The concept of 'No God' and 'God', or atheism and theism can be transcended to realize God with a capital G, which is different from both atheistic and theistic conceptions of God. Similarly, the devil and God diverge when one realizes that the devil being part of God's creation, God and the devil are the same being. Understanding this removes the distinctions in these dualities.
</li><li><b>Temporal vs Eternal</b>: Understanding actual eternity, which exists outside of time or is infinite, can lead to the transcendence of the duality of temporal and eternal. Ordinary human consciousness is temporal and dualistic, but becoming conscious of absolute 'now' is to become conscious of eternity.
</li><li><b>Samsara and Nirvana, Heaven and Hell</b>: Similar to the above, the conceived difference between samsara (formed world) and Nirvana (the realm free of suffering), and heaven and hell can be transcended to understand that they are all ever-present. Recognizing that one's mind can create a hell within an ever-existing heaven due to the ego, can help understand this concept.
</li><li><b>Complexity of Non-duality</b>: Non-duality presents itself as a complex and nuanced subject that needs in-depth exploration for true understanding. It presents concepts that challenge traditional teaching and beliefs, including those of science and philosophy. Recognizing reality as made up of dualities rather than physical entities can aid in understanding non-duality. 
</li><li><b>Transcending Language and Thought</b>: Understanding non-duality requires grasping concepts that transcend language and thought, thus requiring serious effort and contemplation. This emphasizes the intricacy of non-duality.
</li><li><b>Understanding Dualistic Categories</b>: Dualistic categories are necessary tools for navigating life effectively, however, they should be seen as temporary and relative because any attempt to frame reality within them tends to be limiting. As reality is infinite, any formalization, mapping or modelling of it through finite constructs such as words, symbols, equations, or systems will always fall short. 
</li><li><b>Constant Misinterpretation of Nonduality</b>: Nonduality cannot be fully captured by speech or writing without leading to paradoxes and contradictions, because it is all-inclusive, infinite and unlimited. Any time non-duality is spoken or written about, it instantly becomes dualistic. A common mistake is to belief that reality is one particular way, but reality is everything and therefore, it cannot be pinned down to any one thing.
</li><li><b>Caution Against Absolute Truth</b>: Any claims that certain categories, teachings or systems represent the absolute truth should be viewed with caution. Rather, these are usually attempts to guide one towards a personal realization of absolute truth - which cannot be fully encapsulated within finite constructs. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Absolute Concepts</b>: Absolutes such as truth, existence, consciousness, love, and infinity, while essential in understanding reality, needs to be comprehended beyond mere words or ideas. They are multifaceted like a diamond, with each facet representing a partial aspect of the infinite whole.
</li><li><b>Need for Skillful Navigation of Dualities</b>: To comprehend reality, it is crucial to be skillful in creating, deconstructing and navigating categories without attaching oneself to them as absolute truths. This constant oscillation between forming and deforming realities enables an open-minded approach in understanding the infinite facets of the Absolute.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Misunderstanding Non-Duality</b>: Misunderstanding non-duality can lead to conflict and division, as individuals attempt to ground reality into some dualistic category such as physical or non-physical, body or mind, matter or energy. This tends to inhibit a comprehensive understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Moving Beyond Dualities</b>: The objective is not to reject all dualities, but to acknowledge them as existing within a broader, non-dual context. This involves embracing both sides of the duality and recognizing how each side complements and interacts with the other.
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Responsibility</b>: Being awakened to the truth of non-duality involves personal responsibility. It requires an active unifying of oneself, embracing all aspects of reality without judgement - including parts that may be disliked or marginalized. On this path, aspects of reality are not destroyed but integrated. 
</li><li><b>Recognition of Dualistic Limitations</b>: All thought and speech are inherently dualistic and therefore, have limitations. Therefore, any understanding of non-duality should be balanced with contemplative and meditative practices to go beyond these limitations. 
</li><li><b>Appreciation of Absolutes</b>: Absolutes such as truth, existence, consciousness, love, and infinity, can never be fully understood through relative human conceptualizations. However, their appreciation and consideration can lead to a broader, deeper understanding of reality as a whole. It's important to realize that conceptions about these absolutes are not the absolute themselves, but circumstantial approximations which only highlight a fraction of the complete picture. 
</li><li><b>Active Exploration of Dualities</b>: Exploring, accepting and integrating various dualities without attachment to any one side over the other is a key part of the non-dualistic experience. Through direct experience, one can appreciate how seemingly contradictory aspects can coexist and harmoniously interact in the grand picture of reality. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Contemplation and Meditation</b>: Understanding non-duality can be deeply enhanced through contemplation and meditation. These processes help transcend the dualistic nature of the mind and provide a direct experience of non-duality. It is also recommended to patiently contemplate on dualities during practices like meditation or even psychedelic trips in order to gain personal insights. 
</li><li><b>Reality as the Groundless Ground</b>: The understanding of reality being groundless reveals that all divisions must eventually collapse into emptiness, thereby returning to the source or the "groundless ground". This understanding goes beyond words, thoughts and symbols due to the absolute and infinite nature of reality, which defies complete formalization, categorization or simplification. 
</li><li><b>Caution Against Falling for Dualities</b>: People should ensure not to get fooled by rigid dualistic categories suggested by others, no matter their authority. It's necessary to be aware that these dualistic categories are creations that are relative, and not absolute. 
</li><li><b>Integration of Division and Unity</b>: True unity comes from the integration of all forms and opposites, accepting all aspects, including divisiveness, without hatred or judgement. Hence, unity doesn't mean erasing distinctions, rather acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things and celebrating their diversity. 
</li><li><b>The Scope of Personal Growth and Enlightenment</b>: The path to understanding dualities and non-dualism is likened to building a massive skyscraper. It requires dedication, time, and a strong foundation. Despite possible challenges and abstract concepts, a committed pursuit towards spiritual growth and enlightenment leads to a rewarding deeper wisdom.
</li><li><b>The Unity of Dualities</b>: Leo discusses the importance of unifying dualities, recommending people embrace all aspects of themselves, especially those that they might resist or hate. Unification doesn't remove distinctions and should be accomplished without destroying forms and opposites. The process of unification involves recognizing and integrating different dualities without favoring one side over the other. Taking responsibility for fragmentation of reality is key to achieving unification.
</li><li><b>The Mistake of Dogmatic Religion</b>: Dogmatic religious people, who blindly cling to their beliefs in the absolute, mistakenly turn truth into an absolute belief. This often leads to absolute behavior, authoritarianism and a fundamental inability to understand evil - which they ironically end up committing. Leo criticizes the dangers of such dogmatic thinking, prevalent in the majority (over 70%) of the global population, and encourages evolution out of these belief systems.
</li><li><b>Significance of Deconstructing Categories</b>: Leo encourages listeners to question and deconstruct categories they come across - such as masculinity versus femininity, or capitalism versus socialism - in order to understand their foundation and interconnectedness. This exercise can help in recognizing emotional attachments to dualities and potentially overcoming those. He warns of the dangers of sticking to lower stages of spiral dynamics such as stage blue, urging viewers to move beyond these stages for societal progress. 
</li><li><b>Practice of Contemplation and Meditation</b>: Leo discusses contemplation and meditation as effective methods for transcending duality. Direct, personal experience and exploration are necessary for truly understanding these concepts. Leo encourages dedication, patience and persistence in practicing these methods for spiritual growth and enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>View Both Sides of Duality during Psychedelic Trips</b>: During psychedelic trips, Leo suggests focusing on a different duality each time and contemplating it to aid in understanding and eventual unification. He emphasizes the need for first-hand experience in truly understanding these concepts. 
</li><li><b>Accepting Division and Embracing Evil</b>: The unification process includes accepting divisions and even embracing evil without hatred or judgement. However, this doesn't mean supporting harmful actions. It is important to maintain distinctions and understand the interconnectedness of all aspects - those that are liked and those that are disliked - as part of oneself. Leo asserts that the true nature of an individuals includes both poles of a duality - for example, masculine and feminine, or good and evil.
</li><li><b>Subjective Bias Towards Ideologies</b>: Leo Gura explores the subjective bias people have towards various ideological movements, such as Feminism, highlighting the importance of understanding the value these movements bring to society. From equal rights to combating primitive customs, individual perspectives can shift drastically when they consider the effects of these movements on loved ones or their own future incarnations. 
</li><li><b>Self-introspection and emotional attachment</b>: Leo suggests that one should introspect and identify any emotional attachment or clinginess they have towards a particular duality. Such an attachment represents one's ego and delusion, which needs to be acknowledged and worked through for healthy spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Limitations of thought</b>: Leo emphasizes that duality cannot be transcended through thought alone. Trying to ground all of reality into some form of duality is a common pitfall. Various techniques, including meditation, contemplation and psychedelics can be used as part of this transcendental process.
</li><li><b>Practical Use of Psychedelics in Understanding Duality</b>: For individuals who use psychedelics, contemplating various dualities before and during these experiences can deepen their understanding. This contemplation can provide an empirical roadmap for personal development and spiritual growth. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Verification</b>: Leo emphasizes that individuals should verify his teachings through their own experiences and experiments. His claims are not reliant on his authority, but on direct, personal experiences. 
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility in Non-Dual Understanding</b>: Leo encourages listeners to assume personal responsibility in their journey towards understanding non-dualism. It requires internal work and dedication to deepen one's understanding and experience.
</li><li><b>Non-Dual Understanding Takes Time and Effort</b>: Leo calls for patience and dedication in the process of understanding non-duality, comparing personal development and spirituality to building a massive skyscraper. It requires time, investment, effort, and a strong foundational understanding that cannot be gained instantly.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Emotional Attachments to Dualities</b>: Leo suggests introspecting to recognize emotional attachments to dualities and questioning the potential fundamental duality one may be clinging to. This understanding helps in the deconstruction of one's ego and further deepens one's spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Infinite Depths of Reality Understanding</b>: Leo finishes by reminding the listeners that these topics are complex and need deep contemplation before full understanding is reached. He encourages listeners to maintain their enthusiasm and dedication as the journey towards understanding these topics is long and requires considerable effort. However, it leads to immense personal growth and spiritual enlightenment.
