hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm going to tell you how to meditate I
want this to be a very foundational video that gets
you to actually practically start meditating in your life and
we're going to talk about here is why meditation is
important how to actually meditate the technique and at the
end we're going to cover some of the common pitfalls
and traps that people experience with meditation which prevents them
from building a consistent meditation habit which is so important
to actually get the benefits of meditation you can't get
the benefits of meditation by just meditating once or twice
you have to make this a habit so I'm going
to tell you a lot of important nuances you need
to understand to make this habit successfully because when I
try to meditate and make it a habit several years
ago I stumbled around and I try to make it
happen and I was always falling off track I did
a couple of 30 day challenge was meditation I was
able to stick through those 30-day challenges but in the
end it didn't stick and I wasn't seeing the benefits
right now though this is getting towards the end of
2014 and I've been meditating consistently for one hour every
day since the beginning of 2014 so I started in
very early January at the beginning of the new year
is kind of my new year's resolution and I meditate
for one hour every day and I did that consistently
without missing a single day this entire year so right
now I'm on day 250 probably something so I'm getting
into the 300s in a row and that's what you
want is you want that kind of very steady consistency
and now it's pretty easy for me even though 1
hours a big chunk of time it's pretty easy for
me to do this consistently because I built that habit
so let me share with you some of the important
stuff that I've learned through doing almost a year really
consistent meditation you know the Buddhists they have a way
of characterizing our mind and they put it this way
they say that you're my is like a crazy monkey
constantly running around always ad D always frantic always searching
for something new can't sit still worse than that it's
not just this crazy monkey but imagine this crazy monkey
and that you got it drunk totally shit-faced so your
mine is that it's a drunk crazy monkey and worse
than that not only is a drunk and is it
crazy it's totally out of control but imagine that monkey
being stung by a scorpion and now you have the
perfect metaphor for your brain the way that your mind
runs itself the way that it works without beginning to
do meditation without beginning to take a real close look
at the kind of thoughts and emotions and things that
are going on throughout your mind on a minute-to-minute basis
it's hard to even appreciate that this is what it
is is your mind is this crazy drunk stung monkey
the more you meditate the more you realize oh my
god that's the perfect description now what's your life going
to be like if you've got a crazy drunk stung
monkey running around and trying to manage it is that
going to be exceptional extraordinary successful fulfilling happy peaceful type
of life or is that going to be a frantic
neurotic chaotic overstressed overwhelmed making stupid decisions kind of life
it's going to be the second one right you don't
want that so the ultimate benefit of doing meditation is
to get this drunk crazy monkey in line get it
under control so that you take away the scorpion you
take away the drunkenness you take away the craziness and
now you've just got a plain relaxed monkey and the
more you meditate the more of these bad characteristics you
take away eventually what you reach is you reach the
state of really calm tranquility imagine this monkey on sedatives
that's kind of what you reach and it's a good
good state to reach but it takes some work to
get there let's talk about some of the other benefits
of meditation so the benefits of meditation really quickly one
very important aspect is mastering your emotions your emotions run
your life they determine how much you can accomplish in
your life they determine whether you sabotage your own results
so this is really big they also determine how you
feel if you're always emotional you're always up and down
and up and down you're having all these negative thoughts
and this is making you stressed and frantic throughout your
life so this is destroying the quality of your life
so meditation gets that under control meditation is really good
for eliminating stress meditation is really good for helping you
unhook from stimulation so nowadays it's very easy to get
hooked on addictions you can get hooked to television internet
pornography drugs food sex I mean you name it it's
out there you can get addicted on it what meditation
features you it it teaches you to unhook from that
stuff and not be frantic the way you would be
now but to be calm and peaceful and really be
happy just in the moment true happiness can really only
be attained by being very present and happy content you
might say with the present moment you might have noticed
that if you're always seeking stimulation what that does in
your life is it produces a roller-coaster ride up and
down you have some amazing sex then there's a crash
because you can't have sex forever you have some nice
drugs and there's a crash because you can't be on
drugs forever same thing with food with alcohol with Internet
with television so what you want to train your brain
to be happy with is just a very consistent level
of contentment just in the present moment with whatever's going
on and not necessarily even with Pleasant stuff this is
something that is really big that you get with meditation
the other thing that meditation is great for is building
up your willpower your prefrontal cortex literally there's been scientific
studies and evidence done that shows that by practicing meditation
even for just 10 or 20 minutes every day within
a few weeks in the brain scans that they do
they see the prefrontal cortex building new connections growing stronger
this will help you with your with your work this
will help you in your gym routines this will help
you with everything you're trying to do in your life
it's really a form of brain training it's the most
original old-school millennia-old form of brain training you don't need
to play games online to train your brain the best
way to train your brain is actually use your brain
the way you use it one of the ways is
through meditation so that's really good it also helps with
brain health more and more studies are showing that stuff
like Alzheimer's disease is actually a result of dis use
of your brain when you stop using your brain your
brain starts to atrophy when you're using your brain actively
all the time you're putting it under stress just like
a muscle when you're using it then it's growing and
it's developing another thing that's really great about meditation is
that increases your productivity and your creativity so if you're
a very productive person if you're a no-nonsense kind of
no whoo no hippie type of person you're very pragmatic
and hard-nosed and you just want straightforward results in your
life in your relationships you want results in your business
you want better finances and better money this stuff comes
from productivity and productivity comes from a clear thinking mind
that's able to focus so that's what you develop with
meditation you can also use meditation to become more creative
because creativity is something that comes from your subconscious mind
and creativity comes when you're able to calm yourself down
and be peaceful and be grounded then creative stuff tends
to bubble up when your mind is frantic all the
time it's very difficult to be creative so if you're
creative artistic type of person meditation will serve you very
well meditation is also the single best way to develop
and practice mindfulness and mindfulness this is just an awareness
and the ability to be an observer of yourself your
mood your emotions and also other people in life in
general it's the ability to look objectively at these situations
without being reactive to it emotionally it's the ability for
example when you're angry to look from the outside as
it were at the situation that you're in and the
emotion that you're feeling and the ability to just get
it without having to do anything about it the power
of mindfulness which I talk about in other videos and
I'm not going to go into too much detail here
because it's a very deep topic is that it just
literally can be used to melt away and dissolve negative
emotions and any kind of like frustrating situations in life
just by observing it with a lot of consciousness and
awareness without any form of judgement without any kind of
action taking just pure observation and awareness can be a
really powerful tool and it's hard to appreciate this until
you start to meditate and you start to develop these
powers you grow that mindfulness muscle and then you start
to see the results of that in your life and
it's very cool and lastly this is perhaps the most
amazing thing about enlightenment I mean about meditation is that
it can be used to attain enlightenment and that's again
a very advanced topic that I'm not going to go
into here but suffice it to say that through proper
use of meditation for long enough times what you can
do is you can literally melt away your sense of
ego your sense of separation from the world and you
can reach this very blissful peaceful state which is your
natural state which is obstructed by all the crazy monkey
chatter that's going on this is just the truth that
you are one with the world you are one with
everybody else and when you can attain this state then
the amazing thing about it is that you feel very
peaceful totally content totally fulfilled without needing anything else in
your life this is kind of the ultimate state that
you can shoot for with your personal development I'm doing
a lot of work on that personally I'm really excited
about sharing some further techniques about how to use your
meditation in order to actually attain enlightenment so I'll have
more videos on that to come soon so this is
why you want to meditate now let's talk about what
meditation is so let's give a definition for meditation it's
very simple it's basically just sitting down and quieting your
mind and just being aware of exactly what's happening in
the present moment that's how I would define meditation it's
the ability to just focus your mind on basically nothingness
just nothing in particular and not getting caught up in
thought stories because what's going on your head that all
the time you've got these stories that come up and
what can happen is that either you go along for
the ride with this story or you don't or you
just observe the story kind of carrying itself out and
fizzling and bubbling away and that's what thoughts are in
your mind thoughts are like clouds that move through the
atmosphere imagine your mind like the atmosphere and the thoughts
are like clouds and they just come through they're very
random they're very capricious one day they're this kind of
cloud the next day is a different kind of cloud
sometimes it got an interesting formation of clouds sometimes it's
pretty boring but sometimes what happens is that we get
triggered we get company's thoughts and we get carried away
just like carried away and we get taken miles and
miles off track by going along on these clouds and
what meditation is about is about just being totally still
and just watching these clouds kind of move through the
atmosphere without moving without judging them without thinking about them
just watching them so that's a definition of meditation there's
been a lot of scientific studies that have been done
especially in the last 50 years or so on meditation
they've done EEG scans and fMRI scans on meditating monks
and Buddhists and Yogi's they've also done Studies on just
regular ordinary Western meditators people who meditate for just 10
minutes every day what they found is that meditation has
enormous health benefits enormous benefits towards improving your life we've
already covered a lot of those benefits but don't just
think that this is some sort of like new-age type
of tradition or some sort of like fad type habit
meditations have been up for thousands of years and for
good reason because these benefits are very real and in
fact science just now is catching up to some of
the benefits that have been talked about in Eastern traditions
where meditation originated from for literally millennia so there's so
much scientific evidence you can read books that will teach
you and really convince you of some of this amazing
stuff there's a lot of different meditation techniques I'm going
to share something very simple with you today there's different
ones some of them have you focusing on a mantra
or an affirmation that you say to yourself some of
them have you do particular breathing exercises some of them
have you counting your breasts in a specific way some
of them just have you try to clear your mind
constantly so there's a lot of different stuff but actually
meditation is very very simple and I want to keep
things very simple here I'm going to cut a lot
of the fact is you don't need to spend a
lot of money on classes you don't need to spend
a lot of time reading books you don't need any
special equipment here's the technique I'm going to give you
and you can use this technique and you can literally
use this technique to get to the highest levels of
meditation that you can all you've got to do is
use it consistently so here it is step one is
you get a timer I like to take my smartphone
I have a timer on there and I set a
timer let's say for you the time is going to
be 20 minutes when you're starting off a meditation habit
a good time to shoot for is 20 minutes so
let's have you start with that 20 minutes on the
timer step 2 sit in some sort of quiet area
preferably alone by yourself sit in a comfortable position you
don't need to sit in a full lotus position that's
usually difficult you don't need even need to sit in
a half Lotus position you can just literally take a
chair and sit on it you can do it on
a couch you can do it on the side of
your bed don't lie down you need to sit up
and not just sit up but the more perfectly straight
and erect your spine is the better because one of
the things you'll encounter with meditation is sleepiness and one
of the best ways to correct sleepiness when you're meditating
is to keep your back very very straight I used
to think that this wasn't important until turn to falling
asleep a lot and then I discovered that actually the
angle of your spine matters very much the more you
tilt it even just a little bit the more sleeping
you tend to get so the more straight your spine
the better if you want start off meditating with some
sort of support for your back so let's say you're
sitting on a chair with the back that's fine eventually
it's probably best to sit in a way where nothing
is supporting your back just your muscles are doing it
so that will keep you the most alert so you're
going to sit like that and then you're just going
to close your eyes as you're sitting like that and
you're going to relax you're going to not do anything
special with your breath is going to kind of breathe
not to deliberately you're just gonna let your breath go
automatically nice and calm and steady your eyes are gonna
be closed and what you're going to do in your
mind is you're just going to try to clear your
mind of any particular thoughts and like I said before
you're going to try not to get caught up in
the thought stories so might look something like this you're
sitting there you're comfortable give yourself a minute just to
adjust scratch anything that needs scratching so that you're comfortable
sitting there and then you're going to try to sit
still and not move for those 20 minutes and what
immediately is going to happen is that for the first
5 or 10 seconds maybe your mind will be clear
but then some thought will come up some sort of
story and it'll try to grab you and kind of
take you with it as it goes so maybe I'm
sitting there and then the the first thing that comes
into my mind is oh shoot I got that email
I got to answer for a client of mine and
see when you get that thought you have a choice
you can either continue on that train of thought and
start thinking about it like okay so I need to
go I need to do a little bit of research
I need to I need to compile this report and
I got to send that to my client so you
can kind of get carried away with a story or
you can notice in your mind like oh wait a
minute that's just a thought I don't necessarily need to
go along for the ride let the thought go on
its own way but don't go with it and so
you just like that thought go and then as soon
as you let that go maybe a new thought comes
up the new thought tells you oh man I'm not
a groceries I gotta go to the grocery store and
oh man my gap my car is out of gas
I got to fuel up first again you can start
to go into a story mode about that you can
say oh I got to get Cass but what about
gas prices and that gas station near my house it's
closed so I got to go find a new gas
station so see you kind of get carried away or
you can just let it go and again just wait
for a new thought to come and so you continue
like this you just let thoughts come and go come
and go come and go without ever moving from where
you are not physically I mean in your head just
kind of be very still be the atmosphere don't be
the clouds let the clouds through you and so that's
it and your brain is going to get caught off
track you're not going to be able to do this
perfectly it's very difficult to do this perfectly so in
practice what you're gonna have to do is you're going
to get carried away by these thoughts sometimes you'll get
carried away a little bit and then you'll stop yourself
and your refocus sometimes you get carried away very very
far you might find yourself caught up in some sort
of thought story and you'll be caught up in it
for five minutes and for five minutes we'll be totally
unconscious of the fact that you're caught up in this
thought story but then five minutes later you're going to
go oh wait that's right I'm supposed to be meditating
where did I go I got lost in Fantasyland let
me bring myself back and center myself become the atmosphere
again and so you're going to keep doing this again
and again and again and again and that's basically what
meditation is you do that for 20 minutes or however
long you decide to do it for and you're done
at the end of the 20 minutes you get up
open your eyes and you're off to do whatever you
want to do throughout your day so that's a technique
very simple there's no there's no New Age nonsense here
there's no ritual there's no theory behind it there's no
gods to it there's no religion behind it there's no
principles there's no holy books it's just very very simple
you just sit and clear your mind even though this
is simple it's extremely difficult if you've never meditated before
then one of the things are going to discover is
just how shocking it is how difficult it is to
sit still for 20 minutes without thinking about anything and
without getting carried away into Fantasyland with your stories very
very difficult and you're going to tend to want to
get distracted with meditation a lot of different traditions from
the east have different rituals behind the way that they
meditate theories and philosophy and theology all of this stuff
is distraction I tend to finds distraction people make excuses
out why they don't meditate and they'll say stuff like
well I don't have the right pillow under my ass
I don't have the right mat I need to go
take a class how you gonna read this book but
the fact is that stuff is just a distraction meditation
is meant to be very simple it's meant to fundamentally
make you totally accepting of the present moment as you
are right now without needing anything it's like the most
simple activity that you can do it's the essence of
minimalism so don't let somebody confuse you into thinking that
you need more information more theory more equipment this kind
of stuff you don't need it in fact that stuff
will just distract you and notice your mind trying to
complicate meditation try to make it too complicated isn't how
to be complicated be very simple right what I find
is that whenever you're trying to complicate meditation that's you
trying to procrastinate from doing it and your mind is
very tricky and it will try to procrastinate this especially
at the beginning when you haven't built up a habit
yet just because it doesn't want to sit still your
mind is remember that drunk crazy stung monkey it wants
to be running around it doesn't want to be sitting
still the scariest thing you can do is force your
mind to sit still here's the trick at this point
let's actually talk about how to make a successful meditation
habit the trick is that this must be done daily
this 20 minutes every single day weekday weekend holidays birthdays
on Christmas on New Year's on Valentine's Day every single
day on vacation days it doesn't matter on your worst
days when you have a breakup when your business collapses
when you lose a hundred thousand dollars you still got
to do it when you're sitting sick in the hospital
you still got to do it that's the point if
you're not going to do meditation every single day of
your life there's not even any point in watching this
video and continuing any further don't even try it it's
pointless it won't get you anywhere meditation needs to be
done daily and not just for a month and not
just for a year but you need to make a
commitment to do it for the rest of your life
that's what I found is necessary because it's just like
going to the gym if you're only going to go
to the gym for a week why even go if
you're only gonna go for a month why even go
it makes no sense you're just going to waste a
lot of your time and get very frustrated and the
thing with meditation is that it takes work to start
to get the benefits of it yes you'll get a
little bit of the benefits even within just a few
weeks but the true benefits come months and years later
this is a subtle thing meditation it's not this like
big huge supercharging boost to your life at least when
you start to start to get that giant supercharging boost
that will take you months and years it's not going
to happen immediately so you need to prepare your mind
with those expectations otherwise I find that you're going to
fail here are some of the common doubts and pitfalls
that I see people having with meditation one is they
tell me Leo I can't focus I'm a DD I
mind can't focus no everyone's mind can focus there's nothing
wrong with your mind it's just that you haven't trained
it meditation will help train that so if you can't
focus that means you need to be meditating extra hard
it's not an excuse to is that people tell me
leo I keep trying to meditate but my mind isn't
calm in the middle of the meditation I can't calm
down again that's not something fundamental that's wrong with you
that's just how the mind works that's exactly why meditation
needs to be done that's kind of like telling me
about Leo I'm fast so I shouldn't be going to
the gym no if you're fat that means you're fat
because you haven't been going to the gym and you
need to go to the gym even more than the
regular person does same thing here your mind will learn
to calm down through the repetitive practice of meditation and
just because you can't always focus during a meditation session
doesn't mean you're doing it wrong this is where people
get caught up the most I think this is the
biggest failure point right here people think that well I
sat here for 20 minutes and even though I sat
through 20 minutes of it I just couldn't get my
mom my mind to be calm and peaceful they imagine
this this picture and they're in their head of a
Zen master sitting there with a perfectly mind for 20
minutes or whole hour and they think that that's meditation
and if they're not doing that then I'm not meditating
no meditation is the entire process not just the calm
part so when you start what's going to happen is
you're going to have little windows of calmness maybe five
seconds here and then five minutes you'll have another five
seconds and then maybe you'll hit ten seconds somewhere in
your twenty minute meditation session but don't expect you're going
to sit there for 20 whole minutes you might not
reach that state for a decade maybe with ten years
of meditation practice you'll be able to do 20 minutes
perfectly calm but right now you're not going to be
anywhere near that so don't set that expectation and don't
think that just because you're having five seconds of peace
here and five seconds of peace there but the rest
of it is all mental chatter that somehow you're failing
no that's a full 20 minute session as long as
you sit down and you try to focus you're meditating
even if your mind is going crazy especially if your
mind is going crazy that's where the muscle is being
trained right imagine that I I sent you to the
gym and I told you to go to the gym
you go to the gym for a couple of weeks
then you tell me oh man my muscles are so
sore I'm straining my muscles every time I'm doing a
bicep curl well yeah that's how it's supposed to be
and your muscles are sore for good reason because you're
working them out there training you're literally breaking down the
muscle tissue and those last couple of reps that you're
doing that are really tough those are actually building up
your muscles the most keep doing that your muscles will
get really big same thing with meditation so when your
mind is chattering away and it's having difficulty focusing and
you bring it back and you focus it that's when
you're getting the most benefit so you got to reframe
that and say man now I'm doing good that means
I'm doing it properly another expectation people have is that
meditation somehow going to be exciting and stimulating know if
you feel like meditation is boring at first that's totally
normal you're gonna have a wide range of feelings when
you're meditating sometime you're going to feel agitated frustrated stressed
bored sleepy tired anxious all of those are normal emotions
especially the one about being frustrated and agitated sometimes people
will do a 20 minute meditation session at the end
of it they'll actually get agitated not calm and they'll
tell themselves but what's the point I thought meditation was
supposed to make me calmer I must be doing it
wrong no you're doing it just right meditation doesn't always
make you calm that's the end state after many many
years of meditation initially in fact you're going to be
very agitated doing meditation that's okay that's remember you flexing
your muscle some people say well I don't see the
point of meditation why should I keep doing this and
I'll cover that at the very end of the video
and some people have this belief that I'm not a
good meditator somehow meditation just isn't right for me it
might work for other people but for me it doesn't
work no that's total nonsense meditation literally works for everybody
all human beings can meditate and everyone can become proficient
meditator you've just got to practice it consistently which is
what you're not doing here's the principle that I want
you to carry with you through the rest of your
life as you're meditating everything that happens in meditation as
long as you're sitting there and you're focusing and you're
trying to be mindful as long as you're doing that
everything else that happens is perfectly normal and natural and
it's good sleepiness tiredness feeling boring feeling anxious all that
stuff good you're doing it properly this is a really
huge principle to accept once you accept this principle you
can use it to reground yourself because you are going
to have days when you're meditating and it's going to
be just like ah like it's not working like I
must be doing something wrong you're going to start downing
yourself especially when something turbulent happens in your life one
of the most difficult times to meditate is when you
have a big breakup with your girlfriend or boyfriend man
it's meditating on that day or the next morning that's
like hell because your mind is all over the place
it's it's thinking all these negative thoughts but just sit
down you try to focus you do the best you
can and there's no way you can have a perfect
meditation session on that day you're going to have a
very rocky very turbulent very agitating meditation session but when
you finish that you tell yourself you know what i
sat here i did it i followed through on my
commitment and that's exactly what matters everything else is okay
don't judge yourself while you're meditating in fact try to
like turn off your logical mind don't be thinking too
much about the foster thinking don't be doing any meta-analysis
just sit and be peaceful it's kind of like you
try to find an off switch to your mind and
you're never ever going to find that off switch because
there is no off switch thoughts just come one thing
you're going to learn through meditation that you don't really
have as much control over your thoughts as you think
you do and that's fine because what you're going to
learn is just mindfulness you're going to observe the thoughts
and what that's going to do is not going to
shut them off it's just going to get you distance
and separation from them it's going to dis identify you
with them and you don't even realize how powerful that
is right now until you've actually experienced it I want
to set the expectation that the first two years of
meditation even if you do it consistently every single day
are going to be hell because your mind is not
good at bringing your focus back and back and back
from these wandering thoughts it's going to be difficult and
you have to tell yourself that that's normal it's not
going to be smooth sailing which brings us to the
final reason which is why should you meditate at all
when there's all these difficulties and frustration and agitation feeling
bored and tired and sleepy all this stuff - so
why are we meditating well we already talked about some
of the benefits but the reason that you failed if
you've tried in the past of setting up a successful
meditation practice it's because you lacked the vision of what
meditation can do for your life the reason that now
I'm very consistent with my meditation is because after lots
of research lots of trial and error I finally been
able to create a vision that I really bought into
like heart and soul convinced myself that meditation is something
I should do for the rest of my life here's
what I picture for myself I picture that through years
of meditation I'm going to develop really strong emotional control
I also picture to myself that I'm going to be
able to be happy no matter what the circumstances how
cool is that if something goes wrong in my life
I'm still gonna be happy if something goes great in
my life I'm still gonna be happy I'm gonna be
in control of my life I'm going to control my
emotions it's going to help me in my relationships it's
going to help me with overcoming any negative addictions or
habits that I have it's going to build like strong
mental willpower and I'll be able to apply in my
business I'm very business oriented I'm also going to be
able to apply this to be more productive I'm very
productivity oriented I'm also big on creativity I love being
creative in my work it's going to help me with
that I also realize that without meditation I'm never going
to actually attain fulfillment in life it's not going to
be possible because I'm just going to be chasing and
running around like that drunk monkey looking for sources of
stimulation well I want to unhook myself from all that
and I see myself five or ten years from now
being much more unhooked from stimulation than I am right
now and I can see that having huge repercussions positive
repercussions throughout my whole life and ultimately the thing that
has me really excited is the potential of using meditation
to attain enlightenment this sense of oneness with the whole
world the loss of ego the loss of all the
pettiness that we as human beings strive for every day
they need to protect yourself all the insecurities you have
all the negative emotions all that ultimately stems from ego
and I'll shoot more videos talking about that but for
me that's a really exciting prospect is to attain that
kind of state so that's how I was able to
convince myself you have to build a case in your
own mind you know pick and choose from this laundry
list of benefits whatever is most important to you latch
onto it and try to make this vision then go
and start with a 30 day meditation habit start with
just 30 days do a 30 day challenge and see
if you can last for 30 days straight every single
day like clockwork 20 minutes every single day and just
see how far you get and if you're still not
convinced that's fine try it more because the first time
I did my 30-day challenge I wasn't convinced and I
fell off track you get back on back on and
back on until eventually you see that this is something
that you really as a human being must do if
you want to attain fulfillment and happiness and full potential
in your own life this isn't just apply for hippies
but for every single human being and if you aren't
meditating and you're saying that well it's too difficult or
whatever excuse are coming up with in the end is
just because you're lazy and you're undisciplined and you you
don't want to become disciplined and it takes a lot
of practice to discipline your mind because your mind is
the most unruly part of you it's that drunken munkey
so bust through the laziness bust through the lack of
discipline start the habit and we'll talk when you become
a good consistent meditator and I'll shoot a lot of
cool videos that will help you to take that meditation
and channel it into even more advanced things with enlightenment
