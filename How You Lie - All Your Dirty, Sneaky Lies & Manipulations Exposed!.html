hey this is leo for asklized.org and in this episode
i'm going to be talking about how you are a
sneaky manipulative snake yes you are we're going to talk
about how you lie how you manipulate your self-agenda and
self-deception the concepts that we're going to be covering here
are going to be very foundational for all of your
self-actualization efforts as you go forward this is a very
very important episode and i should start off by giving
you a warning that some of the things you're going
to learn about yourself right now are going to be
quite disturbing these revelations may shock and disturb you rouse
you awake but it's very very good and the more
something disturbs you in personal development work the more benefit
you know that it has for you long term so
let's get going the bottom line the gist of what
i have to tell you is that you are a
snake that's what you are you're a sneaky manipulative snake
you're a liar you lie through your teeth all the
time and what's really bad about this is that you
lie to yourself about how much you lie and this
whole thing is so bad that you might think you
understand what i'm talking about right now but you don't
even know the tip of the iceberg yet you haven't
seen anything yet we need to go into some depth
you need to unravel the various layers of lies manipulations
and self-deception that are going on in your mind this
is one very huge theme that personally has just amazed
me this is a huge theme of life all of
life in any area of life where you're trying to
get results or success and when it comes to understanding
your mind is that the name of the game is
self-deception that's what's going on self-deception is going on in
a multitude of ways it's ingenious the degrees to which
your mind can deceive itself and it takes some effort
some real honest looking on your part to start to
notice the self-deception and this self-deception when it's happening in
all its multitude of ways it really blocks you up
and prevents you from getting the kind of results you
want in your life emotionally in relationships in business and
everywhere else there's no area of life that it doesn't
affect in a very impactful way so the bottom line
here is that you lie you manipulate and you self-deceive
and to help us to understand this i want to
introduce a concept called the self-agenda this is something i
learned from a peter ralston workshop the self-agenda really important
concept the self-agenda what you're doing in your whole life
is you're running based on self-agenda the self-agenda is basically
what you want and what promotes your health well-being and
your survival simple enough except you don't yet understand and
you're not conscious of yet just what self-agenda really means
because self-agenda is not just literally your survival and it's
not just literally your health it could also be your
unhealth or your lack of survival that's still part of
self-agenda fundamentally what self-agenda is about is it's about preserving
your image of yourself not just your body not just
literally your health but more to the point it's about
preserving your self-concept who you believe you are not who
you really are who you believe you are and most
people don't make this distinction between these two things but
the thing you think you are you i'm pointing at
you right now that entity that you think is sitting
there looking at me listening to me you think that's
the real you that's not the real you that's the
self-image that's the self-concept and it's that thing that's trying
to survive that's what the self-agenda is ultimately about protecting
that it's not about protecting the body it's not about
protecting you as a human being it's about protecting you
as an ego as an identity as this entity that
lives in your head so here's the first profound insight
that i want to share with you and it's this
is that truth you know how much we like to
pay lip service to loving truth and honoring truth and
living our life according to truth as though we really
value truth well here's the insight truth is not your
operating principle in life truth is not your operating principle
in life you don't live your life valuing truth that's
not what runs the show what do i mean by
operating principle i mean like the central driver of what
motivates you in life why are you doing the behaviors
and actions that you do why do you have the
thoughts you have why do you have the beliefs you
have we like to tell ourselves it's because well leo
they're true they're accurate i know they're not all accurate
but i do my best to find the truest ones
and so i'm living according to truth right i'm relatively
honest and relatively uh good human being no that's a
lie your chief operating principle is self-survival and self-survival here
means survival of the self-image not survival as you as
a body in fact you could shoot yourself in the
head because you're so depressed and that would be an
example of self-survival you would kill the body but you
actually are in a kind of weird twisted sense what
you're doing there is um you're kind of uh defending
your ideas defending your self-image now it sounds weird because
you're thinking like well leo if i kill myself then
my ideas of myself are gone but see it doesn't
feel that way from the inside it doesn't feel that
way from the inside when people die for their beliefs
when people do crazy things for their beliefs when people
feel guilty because of their beliefs and their worldview and
all this kind of stuff that's all them defending their
ego defending their world views that's what that is that's
self agenda that's self survival for you self-survival of course
probably means the survival of the body for most people
it does especially what it means for you is comfort
and security these are huge your self-concept needs comfort and
security it needs certainty you love your certainty you need
to be certain about everything and as soon as you're
not certain about something what happens your mind goes crazy
you can't stand it you need to go find a
solution you need to go find the certainty that you
want all of that really what that is this is
all that you're doing in life there's nothing really that
you're doing in life other than these two things comfort
and certainty that's all you seek comfort and certainty think
about how deep that is think about all the stuff
you do in life that you tell yourself well i
do all this noble stuff you know i'm in a
relationship i'm raising my children and i'm going to church
and i'm going to school and you know i'm going
to hang out with my friends and i go do
some charity work all this stuff that i do but
if you're really self-honest really self-honest and you take a
look at what is it you're actually doing with all
those things why are you doing them we're going to
discover is that oh [ __ ] if i'm not
lying to myself i'm not deceiving myself i have to
admit that i'm doing these things for comfort and for
certainty not out of love not out of concern for
others not out of the well-being and preservation of society
i don't try to go out there and you know
wage a political campaign because i want to improve society
that's not why you do that the reason you do
that is for your own personal self-survival to serve your
self-image that's why you do it which is why people
go and you know kill themselves slaughter millions of other
people in the name of religion or politics or some
ideology or whatever cause they're fighting for it's this right
there they're trying to defend their own comfort and security
and most importantly their self-concept they need to keep that
whole and integrated because as soon as it starts to
fracture literally your identity starts to melt away and that
frightens the [ __ ] out of you so you
scramble you go into action mode and you take action
to defend this self-image of yours low awareness serves your
self agenda it's not really good for the self agenda
for you to be too aware of your surroundings and
what's actually happening in life which is the whole problem
in life which is why we have all the problems
personally and socially is because we have low awareness low
consciousness this isn't an accident this is by design this
is how the mind is designed it has to be
this way because if you actually had high awareness this
would require high responsibility this would also require facing the
pain of facing all of the lies that you've been
living throughout your whole life all the crafty little lies
you've constructed all the manipulative ways in which you behave
and i'll give you a whole list of them so
you know exactly what i'm talking about in a few
minutes but all of this see to start to face
these lies that's real painful it's real painful because you
have a story part of your self-image includes the image
of you as not being a liar but being an
un a noble honest decent human being non-manipulative human being
an altruistic human being who really cares about his children
his wife and his family and and whatever whatever you
care about but see all of those things really those
are all deceptions the only thing you care about is
your self-image that's issue number one for you and as
soon as that self-image is ever threatened oh man everything
else gets thrown under the bus and how quickly it
happens is shocking but because it does happen so quickly
what happens is the mind can't handle it the mind
has to hide it sweep it under the rug so
low awareness is your natural state raising your awareness this
is painful challenging difficult and produces cognitive dissonance for you
it jostles the various notions you have about how reality
works and who you think you are it challenges your
identity literally your old self has to die for you
to raise awareness sufficiently high you can't keep your old
self your old self image and still have high awareness
it doesn't work what do you think is the best
way to hide a lie if you really wanted to
lie real good how would you do it if you
were like a system that wanted to be a really
good lying manipulating system well what it would do is
it would tell itself that it's not lying and this
is exactly how your system functions how you function as
a system this is called self-deception when you tell yourself
that you don't lie no leo i don't know what
you're talking about i'm not a liar i don't manipulate
people i don't know you maybe you're talking about my
neighbor or my mom or my dad uh or my
ex but you're not talking about me right oh this
is all about you it's all about you be really
careful when your mind starts to point fingers at everybody
else except yourself point the finger right at yourself here
as i'm talking because all this is applying straight to
you the best way to hide a lie is to
have zero awareness then you can lie with impunity you
can serve the self agenda without even knowing that you're
serving a self agenda which is exactly what you're doing
in life this is your whole life is the serving
of a self agenda without really knowing that you're serving
a self agenda unless you really studied up on this
stuff and you really done a lot of inner work
what i would suggest to you is that the human
mind is wired for self-deception why is this the case
there might be many reasons evolution plays into it survival
of the fittest plays into it and so forth uh
you know well-being of society to have a well-functioning society
this might be helpful but fundamentally this is most fundamentally
you have to be wired for self-deception because the self
is itself a lie i'm not just saying that some
piece of you is a lie i'm saying that all
of you is a lie your entire identity who you
believe you are as a biological organism is just a
complete fabrication of your mind and all the beliefs you
have about how life works and what reality is this
is a complete fabrication of your mind these are just
concepts in your mind now they don't feel like concepts
they feel like they're real they feel very solid they
feel like reality they don't feel like beliefs yes that's
exactly why low consciousness is required to hold a belief
and not recognize it as a belief requires low consciousness
you can't really effectively serve a self-agenda when you recognize
that it's [ __ ] evolution and survival of the
fittest can't really happen unless there's this core deception going
on inside the organism the organism has to tell itself
that it's special i'm special my life matters more than
every other life my well-being and my kids and my
family's well-being matters more than my neighbor's kids well-being my
wife or my husband is more important to me than
my neighbor's wife or husband this is a complete lie
we know it's a lie there's no reason why your
wife is any more important or special or valuable than
your neighbor's wife or your children there's no reason only
the self-image says so only the ego says so from
a selfish survival standpoint right because we want to spread
our genes and that makes sense from an evolutionary perspective
but notice that there's something else going on in life
besides survival of the fittest and evolution you might say
well leo that's how it's supposed to be wait a
minute there might be something else going on in life
besides that and that would be truth see one thing
you might have not considered before that i want you
to open your mind to is the possibility that your
self agenda in life and truth are two totally different
things see it might be the case that honoring and
serving truth actually damages one's chances of survival and reproduction
and vice versa to increase one's chances of survival and
reproduction one might be benefited by lying or living falsehood
because it gives you a reproductive or a survival advantage
and this presents an interesting dilemma for us as human
beings living our ordinary lives what do we honor do
we honor our survival and our reproduction or do we
honor truth which one do we honor when the two
come and start butting heads with each other when we
have to choose one at the cost of another it's
a good question some of us like to be noble
some of us have the self-image and the self-agenda of
being the noble righteous one it's like leo i'm a
champion of truth so of course i'm going to select
truth but see that's actually real hard to do in
practice you have no idea yet if you are fancing
yourself a champion of truth you have no idea yet
how difficult it is to live that the only way
you can live that is by lying to yourself a
lot or or by completely obliterating yourself image like completely
obliterating it to the point where you don't even see
yourself as a human being anymore you don't see yourself
as a biological entity anymore because as long as you
see yourself as a biological entity this human body standing
here right now talking to you as long as you
see yourself as that you got to defend that you
got to protect that and that is the that's the
that's the master that you serve truth is not the
master you serve your ass living and your ass reproducing
that's the master you really serve and then you have
a little thin veneer of telling yourself that you serve
truth but you don't really start to become more mindful
of how you lie and especially about how you lie
about your self-agenda and your manipulations of people and situations
you lie in fact so much and you've been lying
from almost as early as you can remember as a
little child at the age of three you already started
lying that it's like a fish growing up in water
the fish doesn't recognize it's in water anymore and that's
kind of where you're stuck so to help prop you
out of that i'm going to give you a lot
of examples of very subtle and sneaky ways in which
you lie but before i even do that let me
um connect all this kind of lofty up in the
air kind of philosophical discussion down to your practical life
what does this mean for you why should you care
well here you go here are some examples of the
problems that are created by lying these things make no
mistake the following list i'm going to read off are
conditions that are destroying your life which are created by
lying some of these might surprise you there's a lot
of them i'm gonna go pretty quick stress the chief
cause of all stress is lying anger the chief cause
of all anger is lying anxiety the chief cause of
all anxiety is lying cheating cheating on your spouse or
your girlfriend or your boyfriend lying abuse comes from lying
theft comes from lying neediness with other people in relationships
comes from lying codependency comes from lying back pain can
come from lying not all back pain but some of
it can skin rashes if you have eczema or some
other kind of skin condition like a skin rash those
are often caused by lying depression oh man depression is
just a hornet's nest of lies that's all it is
it's just lies upon lies upon lies overeating being fat
being overweight this is caused often by lying heart attacks
often caused by lying of course also by eating terrible
food but eating terrible food is often caused by more
lying panic attacks caused by lying feeling like a victim
in life like you have no power like everyone is
against you like no one is your friend like society
is against you like the whole world is [ __
] that's all lies bankruptcy is caused by lying hating
life if you hate life if you're not in love
with life that's because of lying headaches migraines not all
of them but good amount of them are caused by
lying fibromyalgia can be caused by lying drinking and drug
addictions are caused by lying in fact all addictions are
caused by various forms of lying chronic fatigue syndrome caused
by lying sexual dysfunctions like you can't get it up
in the bedroom or you don't have the hots anymore
for your girlfriend or boyfriend caused by lying suicide the
ultimate lie divorces caused by lying primarily loneliness caused by
a huge lie high blood pressure lying insomnia inability to
sleep caused by lying so see what happens is that
you're living your self-agenda and you might say to yourself
well you know what's wrong with self-survival and what's wrong
with defending me and my family am i reproducing my
genes and all that sounds pretty good well the problem
is that it gets so bad that it backfires on
itself and all your lies and your scheming manipulations and
all your snake behavior uh backfires on you in all
the ways that i just listed and many more this
is just a small list so now what i want
to do is i want to share another very profound
insight with you which is that most lying is not
obvious lying most lying is very very very subtle very
subtle remember that to lie effectively you got to be
subtle about it you got to lie to yourself about
it in fact ideally you don't even know that you're
doing it which is exactly what low consciousness is you
set the bar very low so that anything below the
bar uh you're not conscious of most lying is totally
unconscious you don't know how you're doing it i'm not
just talking about verbal straightforward like a verbal lie like
someone comes to you and asks you something like did
you have breakfast today and you lie to them and
you say no i didn't have breakfast today that would
be a very obvious black and white type of lie
you know you lied in that case you can't deny
that those are not the biggest problem the biggest problem
is all the sneaky [ __ ] you do all
the manipulative stuff you do and to help to get
you to see that i want to give you a
list of just a random assortment of examples this is
a tiny list but it'll start to get your mind
to register what i'm actually saying here here's a list
of lies saying that you're honest is the lie think
of yourself as being an honest person that's a lie
a fake smile when you're meeting someone you're greeting your
friends you don't feel like smiling but you smile anyways
that's a lie notice that a lie doesn't have to
be verbal a lie also doesn't have to involve other
people it could just be you by yourself another lie
is fake politeness another lie is eagerness to please you
really want to please somebody but the only reason you're
doing that is that they think well of you that's
a lie acting cool or stoic someone gives you some
bad news then you just kind of pretend like it
didn't really affect you that much even though it kind
of did on the inside it jostled you a little
bit but you know you just kind of play macho
that's a lie asking for things indirectly this is a
huge one this is a huge this is a whole
category of stuff notice how you do this when you
want something but you don't have the balls to just
go ask for it and instead you come up with
some kind of excuse like you bump into the person
or oh hey how you doing you know i didn't
i didn't know i was going to meet you here
or it's like oh by the way by the way
you know we were just talking but by the way
could i ask you for for this or oh let
me just let me just nudge that person and maybe
help remind him of what i need from him that
sort of stuff or the way that you indirectly ask
for sex in a relationship you don't just come up
and ask for sex it's like hey honey i just
want more sex no there's a there's a whole routine
there's a whole uh manipulative gauntlet that you run through
when you're asking for sex it might be a little
look that you give him a little pout a little
tease this or that so all those kind of ways
of asking for something indirectly be very mindful of how
you do those those are very unconscious labeling things in
people as evil being evil that person is evil that
person is the devil that's all lying anger most forms
of anger are lying because actually what anger turns out
to be is to be you being hurt but you're
not acknowledging that hurt so you lash out in anger
instead and you project onto other people playing stupid have
you ever done that you play stupid or you pretend
like you didn't hear something that you actually heard or
you pretend like you didn't see something you actually saw
that's a real sneaky one how about withholding important information
this one's real huge watch how you do this one
all the time it's like but no leo i'm i'm
honest i'm truthful they asked me for information and i
i told them exactly what the information is except what
you neglected to mention is that you rearranged and manipulated
the information to withhold the most important stuff you concocted
and constructed and presented the information such a way that
it doesn't really present the true picture of what that
person was asking for or asking about you just kind
of reported the raw facts but you did it in
a way where the raw facts distort the original meaning
i love this next one pretending that you're loving pretending
that you're compassionate pretending that you're selfless and pretending that
you're spiritual this this is a huge category of lies
right here man most spiritual people are not spiritual most
loving people are the most selfish people people that call
themselves compassionate and loving and altruistic these are some of
the most selfish [ __ ] in existence and the
spiritual people the religious people these are some of the
most hypocritical lying sons of bishops that exist these are
some of the biggest fattest snakes in the jungle you
know pretending like oh i'm spiritual nothing concerns me i
don't care about money i just love everybody i'm a
new age hippie this whole kind of act that people
play yeah right right moralizing when people preach to you
and tell you oh you shouldn't do this you shouldn't
do that those are some of the biggest liars out
there and when you do that yourself and you do
do it you might not be a preacher but you
still do it when you moralize your kids or your
children or your girlfriend or your boyfriend whoever you do
it to or even just inside internally to yourself when
you tell yourself well i should do this and i
have to do that and this must be done this
way and there's a whole procedure this and don't you
know don't do it the wrong way that's all moralizing
shoulds those are all lies i should go to the
gym i should be at this weight level i should
be at 10 body fat i should have this kind
of woman in my life and my kids should be
this way those are all lies false humidity false humility
another way that you lie it's like oh yeah i'm
not i'm not rich i'm not rich you tell your
friends or it's like oh no yeah i would i'm
not i'm not that smart i'm not that smart but
deep down inside you're like yeah i am rich yeah
i am i am smart false humility dissembling your true
motives when you actually want something and you're doing something
and then people are kind of curious about why are
you doing that but then you don't tell them your
real motives you give them some fake excuse or you
take one of your secondary or tertiary motives and you
throw that one out there instead of giving them your
true ultimate motive notice how much you do that with
people and especially in your intimate relationship speaking of which
lying inside of intimate relationships this is one of the
perhaps biggest categories of all the degrees of subtlety that
you utilize to manipulate your partner or your spouse are
incredible they're mind-boggling it's really a work of beauty that
you do so much of it and you're so completely
unaware of all of it that you do every little
tiny manipulative behavior every word you say you know exactly
what to say to push your partner's buttons to get
them to do exactly what you want so you don't
get into an argument or so you have to you
can avoid spending a day with her at the mall
or she can avoid watching you watch football on the
couch or whatever you guys are trying to avoid with
each other all the compromises that you have struck convenient
compromises how about lying about sex i love this one
our whole culture lies about sex this whole thing of
false modesty like oh i'm not a [ __ ]
oh leo don't call me a [ __ ] don't
call me a little [ __ ] i'm none of
these things i'm a good proper little girl yeah right
you're lying to yourself you're lying to yourself i don't
have that much sex i don't have unprotected sex i
don't have sex with with strangers i only have sex
with people that i love right right how about lying
in marketing and in sales if you're in a marketing
or sales position you lie through your teeth all the
time the ad copy that you write the newsletters you
send out the pricing structures that you create oh fifty
percent off for the next five days only only for

__ ] you guys are masters of that shameless shameless
[ __ ] snakes how about lying when you're in
a leadership position are you a boss are you a
manager are you a ceo are you someone that has
people following them well then you lie all the time
you like to withhold information how much secretive [ __
] do you withhold someone needs to get fired or
someone needs to get hired or you have some piece
of information about some new project all that [ __
] gets withheld you don't tell that to all your
people you only tell them on a need to know
basis only at the last minute when it doesn't burn
your ass that's when you tell them right perfect example
of what we mean by self-agenda and not serving truth
here's some more examples for you not admitting when you're
wrong you know you've made a mistake but then you
don't actually admit it even though you kind of know
you should but it's like ah well i'll come up
with some excuse for why i really was well i
wasn't that wrong leo i wasn't that wrong i mean
i was i was basically right i mean i was
right on the facts yeah a little bit of it
was uh it's okay it's okay i don't need to
admit that i was wrong they already know it anyways
they already know why should i say it they already
know it how about hiding your weaknesses and insecurities you're
a guy you go out with a girl on a
date you're acting all macho and confident everything's fine you've
got money you've got a nice car your life is

with my parents none of those exist everything's perfect i'm
sexy how about acting perfect when you actually aren't pretending
like you're perfect how about withholding emotions it's a huge
category of lies right here when you withhold emotions you
feel stuff you feel angry you feel sad you feel
hurt you feel depressed you feel fearful whatever you feel
but who do you tell you don't tell anybody about
this you don't share this with people even if they
ask you tell them all i'm doing how are you

really quite ready yet to take office that's not what
you really think you think that that guy's a [
__ ] [ __ ] but that's not what you
say oh no no he's yeah i can kind of
see i can kind of see how he's okay i
can kind of see how you guys might like him
yeah maybe it's like yeah oh i can kind of
see how those shoes fit for you yeah i can
kind of see it you know i wouldn't have selected
those but i can kind of see how they fit
for you when deep down you're like those are the
ugliest [ __ ] shoes i've ever seen it's like
oh yeah yeah honey i kind of like you know
i'm fine with your dog i'm fine with your dog
you know i don't love your dog i'm fine with
your dog but in reality it's like that [ __
] dog just pisses me off right notice how you
do that there's a whole game that you play inside
your mind a whole set of mental gymnastics that you
have to run through to to make that work how
about when you're snarky or sarcastic and you use that
to manipulate people that's all lies how about when you
use humor especially if you've got a charming personality you're
good with people you're a socializer type man you use
humor to you use humor to put people in their
place you use humor to be little people to humiliate
people to wage power wars with people you use humor
to disassemble your true motives you use humor to disarm
tense situations to mislead people to divert their attention from
the real issues that they're interested in yeah you're real
[ __ ] sneaky with your humor how about when
you scheme secretly scheme to get your share of the
pie first this is a good one and you know
you've done this like when uh when you know that
the company is gonna have some layoffs coming you guys
didn't have a good quarter this year you know some
people are gonna get fired so what do you do
already you're sitting there and you're you're scheming your mind
is already off to the races for how you're going
to make sure that you don't get fired five people
get fired well you're gonna do everything you can to
make sure those five people are not including you you
know and if it's drawn from accounting well [ __
] him i got to pay for my family my
family's got to survive in this bad economy and you
start skipping you start coming up with plans with ideas
a lot of them are usually nasty and petty how
about being nice in order to get validation from people
all you people pleasers out there do it all the
time just so that we like you so that we
approve of you that we love you you'll say [
__ ] anything you're a lying little [ __ ]
is what you are you sell yourself out for validation
how about pretending that you weren't hurt either emotionally hurt
or even physically hurt have you ever been like walking
through your house and then maybe your girlfriend is there
looking at you or something you're just kind of walking
walking walking and then you you stub your toe on
the uh the coffee table or some some shoe that's
that's laying there on the floor and that really [
__ ] hurt but it's like you want to play
it up a little macho right you want to pretend
like you didn't really feel it that much was like
ah don't worry honey it was nothing it was another
just a scratch just a scratch but inside you're like
you're bracing with your with your full intensity of your
body all your muscles are tense trying to just like
hold in that pain rather than just actually expressing the
hurt that you felt why are you living that lie
you see how this is a matter of your self-image
at play it all goes back to self-image your self-image
needs to survive even more than your physical body how
about the white lies that you tell children and kids
you have kids how many white lies do you tell
them you don't tell them what's really going on you
lie to them all the time you tell them so
much [ __ ] filling their minds with all your
[ __ ] so then they become liars because you're
teaching them by example they listen to all your [
__ ] then they'll [ __ ] their kids and
their kids will [ __ ] their kids how do
you think this whole cycle gets started starts from year
one how about when you say i love you when
you don't really feel it and you don't really mean
it just because someone else told you that they love
you but you don't have the balls to tell them
you don't love them so you just kind of oh
yeah i love you too honey about when you get
a new car some new clothes or something and you
want your friends to notice but you don't want to
tell them that hey guys look at me look at
no you don't want to do that that goes against
your self-image of being a humble person so instead what
you do is you you find some indirect way you
try to nudge them a little bit or you try
to like pull up hey guys you know what let's
go to the beach next weekend and oh we'll use
my car yeah we'll use my new car we'll we'll
just use my new car how about when you excuse
your own hypocrisy the biggest hypocrites are the ones that
don't admit they're hypocrites and usually you're completely blind to
your own hypocrisy the [ __ ] you do is
so hypocritical the [ __ ] you do versus the
[ __ ] you say there's like a an atlantic
ocean of difference between the two but in your mind
it's all it's all just kind of masked over and
glossed over and fudged over so that in your mind
you don't seem like a hypocrite at all but if
you look at a little closer then you do tons
of hypocritical [ __ ] that you lie to yourself
about how about holding in your stomach holding in your
belly maybe you're even doing it right now go ahead
just release release your belly right now you've probably developed
a chronic habit of just holding in your belly because
you want to shave a couple inches off your waist
how you look whether you're a man or a woman
you're trying to hide that gut of yours what do
you think that is that's a lie so i could
just keep going on and on for hours about this
list you know but i'm running low on time so
i hope that you start to see the subtlety that's
going on here right i went to all this length
so that you see the subtlety it's very very [
__ ] subtle very subtle not only is it subtle
but then you lie to yourself on top of that
plus your your awareness level your mindfulness level is so
freaking low that you just it just doesn't even register
on your radar screen so at this point you might
be thinking well lee okay so what's the solution what
do i do about this you want me to become
a saint is that what i should do leo just
be a perfect saint not lie to anyone no hold
up with your black and white thinking there's a there's
nuance here in this discussion there's nuance in every single
video that i shoot so stop your stupid black and
white thinking i want you to become very mindful mindful
mindful mindful of how you do this how you lie
how you manipulate how you self-deceive here's a profound another
profound insight for you is that truth alone is curative
and healing the truth alone heals you just noticing what's
true and what's false already starts to heal you you
don't even need to get other people involved yet in
fact i want to propose the following solution which is
that you should start telling the truth more especially when
there's a cost to yourself agenda involved with telling the
truth not just telling the truth when it's easy telling
the truth when it's hard and there's three levels of
telling the truth that i want to introduce to you
level one and they get harder and harder as you
go up the levels so level one is the easiest
although it's still going to be very difficult for you
simply tell the truth to yourself at the bare minimum
you have to be honest with yourself about your beliefs
your ideas and your behaviors and your manipulations so you
know what if you're gonna manipulate your boss or you're
gonna manipulate your wife fine but at least tell yourself
okay i'm manipulating my boss okay i'm manipulating my life
at least start there and as you're doing the manipulation
at least be mindful of it throughout the duration as
you're doing it might take you a couple days to
execute your manipulation okay fine but just stay mindful throughout
that process notice what you're doing and why you're doing
it what's really going on why are you manipulating her
or him to serve yourself agenda and notice what the
cost is the cost is truth you don't give a
[ __ ] about truth you don't give a [
__ ] about honesty you care about your self agenda
that's what you care about you care about your self
image you care about preserving your identity at all costs
that's the only thing you care about in life pretty
much the only thing you're almost incapable of caring about
anything else not unless you've done a lot of work
on yourself this kind of work that we're doing here
hundreds and thousands of hours of it is what i'm
talking about so that's level number one just start to
notice for yourself and that's that already is a huge
advance forward but there's also level number two level number
two is starting to communicate the facts of situations more
accurately and honestly so what are the facts you know
if your boss comes to you and asks you hey
are we going to meet next quarter's projections instead of
softening the blow and not telling him everything you give
him a couple of facts no give him all the
facts give him all the facts even if he's going
to fire you give him all the facts same thing
with relationships if you've been cheating on your boyfriend or
spouse or husband tell them that that's a fact tell
them the facts of what happened how many times did
you cheat don't just tell them i cheated tell them
i cheated five times with the following people give the
facts report the facts as they were or as they
are for you that can be quite challenging if you're
writing a sales copy if you're a salesperson or marketer
start writing sales copy that's actually factually true rather than
trying to manipulate and withhold certain information disclose all the
facts and start to notice the huge difference between writing
a communication designed to promote yourself agenda was just the
sale of products and earning you of money versus writing
a sales copy that actually reports the facts as they
are that actually tries to communicate truth that has a
totally different energy and vibration to it when you're actually
trying to report the truth same thing in your work
you know if you're an artist if you're a writer
whatever kind of work you do you can do your
work in a way where you're serving truth versus your
self agenda start practicing that and then level three of
uh communicating truth is actually communicating how you feel not
only do you report the facts but also how you
feel about the facts so for example your boss comes
to you and asks you about the quarterly reports not
only do you give him the facts and the facts
might look bad you give him the facts but let's
say you're also afraid and you're fearful and maybe you're
also angry at someone in the company but see all
these emotions you bottle up to all these emotions so
this third level is about communicating your actual emotions so
you actually tell them hey i'm afraid i'm afraid you're
going to fire me i'm afraid that uh or i'm
angry at that person in in accounting who didn't do
the right job to get the right numbers in or
whatever communicate your emotions or in this this one this
is the hardest thing you'll ever do if for example
you cheated on your spouse not only do you communicate
that you cheated on your spouse but now you communicate
your emotions about it as well so it's like i
had sex with sally not only did i have sex
with her but i loved it we had multiple orgasms
together we hung out we had fun we went shopping
later we had the best time of our lives because
that's honestly how you felt you might say i'm in
love with her this is something you would never ever
ever think of doing even in the most radical examples
what you would usually do is you'd say well yeah
honey i cheated i'm real sorry but see that too
is a lie because that's not how you really feel
how you really feels like yeah i cheated because you
were a [ __ ] and you were nagging me
all the time and i really love this girl so
you don't tell her that because that's [ __ ]
gonna destroy your your ego when you try to do
that this is not easy stuff to do and even
as i'm talking you should already be shaking in your
boots quivering with fear and dread about doing some of
these actions this [ __ ] is just like ah
it's like acid it's like pouring acid on your self-image
it just completely obliterates it also though it's extremely healthy
and it helps you to reduce all that [ __
] in your life depression loneliness sadness hating life anxiety
stress all that [ __ ] where do you think
all that [ __ ] comes from that comes from
you lying and sweeping under the rug all the dirt
for years and years and years until it festers and
then it destroys your life so yeah there's a cost
there's a consequence to uh to being truthful serving the
truth is not easy it's very emotionally challenging which is
why nobody does it because no one cares enough about
truth you might wonder well leo why should i care
about truth maybe i should just serve myself agenda and
that's it what's wrong with manipulating people lying to people
and all this well you know it's not a moral
problem i'm not telling you like you're going to be
a bad person or going to hell if you lie
that's not why you shouldn't lie it's an integrity problem
and integrity is something i'm going to cover in other
episodes it's too much to cover here but just in
a nutshell the problem here is that when you're out
of integrity with yourself when you lie to others and
you lie to yourself as well and you manipulate and
that becomes your default mode of communicating and interacting with
human beings then that starts to taint your whole life
like i said you know it toxifies your whole life
you're the one who's getting depressed you're the one who's
stressful you're the one who's in danger of having a
heart attack you're the one who's fat and overweight you're
the one who hates the world you're the one who's
angry and resentful all the time you're the one who's
passive aggressive so you're paying the cost of that so
i'm not telling you to do this in some altruistic
you know vain like oh well yeah just be honestly
that you're a nice noble person no uh it's because
your dishonesty has gotten so bad that it's backfiring on
you and it's um it's making your life miserable that's
why you want to be integrated because a disintegrated life
is very painful i will give you a warning though
is that if you do start doing level 2 and
level 3 of honest communication and you start telling the
facts and you do start you know spilling your emotions
then you have to have courage and you have to
accept the consequences that might come from that and there
might be some serious consequence maybe you'll get fired maybe
your wife will leave you maybe your children will hate
you now in most situations what the mind does is
it completely over exaggerates these consequences usually you won't get
fired usually your wife won't leave you and usually your
kids won't hate you in fact if you're truly honest
and you kind of wear your emotions and your heart
on your sleeve that's very refreshing for most people most
people appreciate that kind of honesty even if you did
something really bad you usually won't get fired for it
if you actually like go and honestly report the facts
and report how you feel about it usually you won't
get fired so play around with that test that out
let me give you some concrete exercises here these are
your action steps one is i want you to start
noticing yourself agenda in action notice the difference between self
agenda and truth which one are you honoring when you're
doing the stuff you do i also want you to
start noticing how much you lie be mindful of your
lies as you're lying especially the very subtle ones that
i talked about also start to notice how you suddenly
manipulate people you manipulate people everywhere and usually the closer
they are to you the more you manipulate them the
people you manipulate the most are your spouse your children
your parents and your family members you manipulate them the
most so just watch out for that and here's a
trick that i want you to use to remember because
you're going to fall back asleep you're going to fall
back to sleep real fast because none of the none
of this that i talked about is serving your self-image
at all here this is very dangerous very threatening so
here's how you keep yourself from falling asleep you get
a rubber band something colorful like this put it around
your wrist make sure it's not too tight so you
can wear it for a long time without it cutting
off circulation to your hand and you wear this for
a whole week i want you to put one of
these on wear them for a whole week throughout your
day sleep with it shower with it brush your teeth
with it and go to work with it have sex
with it on and every time your eye catches sight
of that color of that uh of this rubber band
then i want you to just remind yourself oh that's
right i'm supposed to be on the lookout for my
own manipulations and lies and self-agenda and this will help
you to stay on track and not fall asleep alright
