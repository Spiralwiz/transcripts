hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about how to forgive someone
all right let's talk about how to forgive someone how
do you go about forgiving people in this video what
I really want to do is I want to make
a important distinction that most people don't understand about forgiveness
and this distinction is the distinction between true forgiveness on
the one hand and half-hearted forgiveness on the other most
people they don't do true forgiveness they do have Hardy
forgiveness and the difference is very stark if you do
true forgiveness and you give the relationship a new clean
slate to work on up from if you don't do
that if you do have Hardy forgiveness and actually what
you're doing is you're toxifying the relationship even further so
we're gonna get into the details of that distinction and
we're also going to talk about how do you actually
go about and forgive someone and let it stick make
it stick within you and we'll talk about some of
the different situations in which you might want to forgive
people all right so let's crack into that the first
thing that we should probably talk about is the different
situations in which you might want to forgive someone so
these are things like cheating and lying abuse whether emotional
or physical or verbal hurtful remarks that people tell you
fits of anger and fighting that you have with people
just wrong behavior in general of any sort people wronged
you in some way and you feel like you're slided
you're offended harm was done to you and therefore forgiveness
is now required at least if you want to maintain
that relationship so in all these situations you might really
want to develop a good forgiveness ability because if you
do not know how to forgive people then that means
that your relationships are fragile because in a relationship if
you really want to maintain a relationship with somebody for
a long period of time maybe for the rest of
your life then invariably things will happen people will make
mistakes you'll make mistakes they'll make mistakes that's going to
happen so if you want to have some sort of
skill that will allow you to weather those mistakes whether
those storms in an important relationship of yours then forgiveness
is the tool that you can use to patch that
up so you can keep the relationships going otherwise your
relationships will end and that's probably not what you want
so these are the situations now what's this distinction between
half-hearted and true forgiveness true forgiveness is the following here's
kind of the definition of it forgiveness is letting go
and forgetting two components let go and forget see the
problem is that most people they just they just think
it's the one component let go they let go but
they don't forget and they keep pondering and ruminating about
the wrong that was done to them they keep keeping
that thing alive it's kind of like a scab you
have a scab on your arm a wound is healing
over now you've got a scab and you keep picking
at it all the time you keep picking at a
time it's going to fester and it's going to become
worse and worse and worse that's exactly what's happening if
you're doing this how hard it forgiveness thing if you're
doing a true forgiveness then you're letting the situation go
and you're deciding to move on from it you're creating
a clean slate you're not looking back into the past
you're not living and reliving those moments the past doesn't
stay with you the past only stays with you to
the extent that you're reliving it again and again and
again so it feels like the past is really stuck
and it feels like right now you need to forgive
someone but you just can't or maybe you forgave in
somebody a long time ago but you keep rehashing that
thing in your mind you haven't really forgiven them and
you keep rehashing it but that's an activity that you're
doing if you stop doing that then you would have
had true forgiveness see the problem is that when you
do a half-hard forgiveness it also becomes self righteous forgiveness
self righteous forgiveness what does that mean well that means
that you're proud of yourself for being this noble person
for forgiving another person and so now it's like you're
keeping score it's like you've got this little scorecard and
you're saying yep plus one for me I'm the noble
one in this relationship I'm unlike the good one there
the bad one and so when you do this you
elevate yourself you put yourself on a pedestal now you're
on this pedestal you've got this air of superiority and
you're holding the score scorecard over that person's head so
anytime that person does something else that might disturb you
or bother you you can always kind of like just
give them the look or give her the look and
kind of point at your scorecards mm-hmm remember this time
right here when I forgave you for all that for
all that stuff you've done see if you do that
what do you think that's doing in your relationship the
point of forgiveness is that you can set us a
clean slate and then move forward if you're doing the
self righteous thing where you're proud of yourself for doing
this forgiveness then actually you're doing is you're building up
this ego about it and it's creating more toxicity see
insides creating a sort of layer a layer that runs
and under your whole relationship of resentment this can look
at like this passive-aggressive thing that you're doing where you
forgiving that person but you've only really forgiven them in
name only inward inside you haven't really forgiven because you're
always thinking about it it's always coming back up for
you and in some sort of either major way or
some sort of more probably subtle ways you're holding it
against them and it's creating more and more dysfunction so
there is no clean slate that's being created it's not
what you want that's not the point of forgiveness you
have to forget the wrong forget the wrong that that
person did to you and that is something that's a
decision that you have to make it's a decision right
and it doesn't mean that you forgive everybody for everything
that's not what I'm saying here I'm not saying that
you become a doormat I'm not saying that if someone
let's say cheats on you in a nice long committed
relationship someone cheats on you and then you are upset
about it and now you feel like you have to
forgive them and that you have to tolerate that that's
not what I'm saying I'm saying that if somebody cheats
on you and you have a boundary that they really
craw and your values have really been damaged and you
don't feel like this is reparable then don't forget that
person you can enforce your boundary and break the relationship
off or do whatever you got to do but if
you feel like you can repair it if you feel
like there is still something valuable here that can be
salvaged if you feel like that person is honestly regretful
about their actions and if you feel like that person
can change and won't make the same mistakes in the
future and you feel like this relationship can still go
on and there's a lot of good that can come
from it then you can make a choice this is
a conscious choice that you make to forgive that person
now if you make that choice what's important here is
that it's not really a it's not really a pact
between you and them it's a pact between you and
you what you're telling yourself here is that okay this
relationship I see that there's good in it yes this
person did wrong I'm really unsatisfied about it but there's
still something good and I think that this can be
repaired and I'm willing to work through it okay so
I've gotten there now what I want to do is
I want to predict that person and I really want
to forgive him or her and that means that I
am making a promise to myself to let this go
right now and to never think about it again see
this is a promise you make between you and you
the other person has nothing to do with it because
really to forgive someone takes a lot of strength and
inner courage who's going to happen is that this letting
go part that's something you do right now but then
you also need to forget the forgetting part can be
difficult because your mind will just keep getting a hit
and you'll keep thinking and you'll keep visualizing about these
wrongs that were done to you you're going to be
living in the past so this will happen and what
you're gonna have to do is you have to summon
courage and fortitude to stay on track with your original
promise right you made a promise yourself that you're not
going to go there anymore so anytime this stuff comes
in into your mind just randomly you have to tell
yourself you know what I said no and you have
to say no that takes strength to do that if
you're not willing to do that and you just give
into every instance of this thing flashing in your mark
and your brain then what's going to happen is that
toxicity is going to develop and you create this revengeful
type of forgiveness revengeful right where you forgive someone but
you're still having angst about it you're still ruminating about
it you're kind of seething underneath and right now that
might work that my whole thing's over for a little
while but eventually is going to happen is that is
going to build and build and build and build it's
going to be like pressure in a pressure cooker and
then eventually that thing is going to burst so your
relationship will will go very sour and in the meantime
before your relationship completely explodes it's going to get tainted
slowly because on the inside you're going to be getting
tainted right you're going to be feeling passive-aggressive and you're
going to be feeling resentful and that negativity it's going
to creep into all sorts of different areas within your
relationship so that's something if you really want to avoid
that then you really want to do a true forgiveness
right and that just means like oh you have the
option to let it go right now the only question
is do you want to you have to decide whether
your boundary was really crossed in a way that's not
reparable or maybe someone really crossed your boundary in such
a way that you don't want to forgive them in
which case then don't I'm not saying that you have
to a lot of these ideas I'm bringing to you
from national Maltz as brilliant book psycho-cybernetics it's not really
a book about forgiveness but he has this one little
short segment in there just a couple of pages that
talking about forgiveness and very poignant ideas so this is
a quote that I'm taking for him here's what he
says is true forgiveness true forgiveness is when you realize
that you have no reason to hate or to judge
the other person in the first place you have no
season two hate or judge that person in the first
place now you might think that you do have reason
this to live this idea to live this quote you
have to summon something within yourself you have to be
Noble you have to be strong it to be courageous
this is kind of like a higher value that you're
living by and you can live by it if you
want to so this is an option for you if
you've been struggling with forgiveness and this is something that
you might want to think about really think about how
you want your relationships in the future to go how
you might want to be using forgiveness as a tool
to help you patch over problem areas in your relationships
whether you really want this or not and the next
point that I'm going to make probably the last about
forgiveness here is that really the problem with forgiveness and
having difficulty with it is all about being stuck in
the past I actually have another great video letting go
of the past you might want to check that out
where actually take you through a whole exercise to drop
the past it's pretty cool most people really like it
so I'm going to link that below you can check
that out but see for me personally I rarely have
problem with forgiveness because it's almost like I don't care
like if someone doesn't wrong to me it's hard for
me to hold a grudge against them like I just
tend to let it go because and this is it's
not because like I've got these special techniques or mindsets
that I'm running on myself no it's just because I'm
very future-oriented like I've got so many big plans for
my life I've got my life purpose that I'm that
I'm living I've got like big dreams and ambitions for
my business I've got big ideas for the kinds of
relationships I could be and the kinds of friends I
could have you know new people I could interact with
and just like everything I want to be doing with
my life that to look back into the past like
I don't have time for it I don't have the
energy for I don't have the desire for I mean
why if you're sitting there you're always ruminating about the
past so much and all these wrong things that this
person has done to you and how they keep screwing
up and all this stuff I mean honestly the only
reason you're doing that is because you don't have a
forward direction in your life you need to have forward
momentum when you have forward momentum a lot of this
little petty stuff just melts away but when you're just
like sitting you've got really no purpose to your life
you've got no motivation you've got no goals of your
own that you're out there accomplishing then your life's not
really about anything and when your life's not about anything
then you're sitting still and when you're sitting still you're
sinking it's literally like that you're sinking when you're sitting
still because your mind it will still churning no matter
what the question is is your mind going to turn
on like important problems that you're solving your business or
your career or in something else that you're doing in
your life positive things is your mind working to create
or is your mind just sitting idly and then what
it happens to happen is that your mind just starts
to ruminate and it starts to look inside it starts
to have all these sorts of negative thoughts all these
idle gossipy thoughts plots that are petty thoughts that are
not creating anything positive in the world and so if
you're having all those thoughts all the time it's going
to be very hard for you to honestly forgive somebody
it's going to be very hard for you to let
go of the past so the the core solution to
this I would say is start to develop a sense
of own purpose your own purpose in life a sense
of life purpose a sense of mission when you're out
and about doing that stuff then the pettiness will melt
away because people will do negative things to you people
won't still wronged you but you won't really care so
much you won't care so much and that's a beautiful
place to be because then it's very easy to forgive
honestly if someone wrongs me I forget it about the
next day I've got too many things to worry about
that's what I want for you that's where you got
to be right of course with a very big transgression
but that might be a little harder that's where you
employ the technique that I gave you earlier but in
general it's still gonna be easier for you to get
over that transgression even if it's very major if you've
got something else that you're creating in your life all
