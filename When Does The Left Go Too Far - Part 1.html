[Music] thank you [Music] where the left goes wrong this
will be a non-ideological look at the problems of the
left and especially Progressive politics I considered myself to be
extremely Progressive unfortunately however progressives rarely call out problems within
their own world view because they're too busy fighting with
the right with neoliberals with centrists with fascists with racists
and so on and even deeper than that it's not
just that they're so busy fighting it's that they don't
actually have enough perspective they don't have enough distance from
their own worldview they haven't self-reflected enough they're not honest
enough with themselves to see the problems that exist on
the left and within Progressive circles so that's what this
episode will be tackling it's very important I feel that
progressives call out problems on their own side because this
is how we can evolve to spiral Dynamic stage turquoise
or tier two politics which I've discussed before in my
uh spironamic series go check out my spiral Dynamics series
if you don't know what these colors like yellow and
orange and blue mean which I'll be using and also
check out my other episode series called conscious politics part
one two three four where I talk about this stuff
a lot now I've been pretty politically lately in the
last five years in my content in my videos and
that's because a lot of shenanigans have been going on
and a lot of people have been really badly misusing
ideology and group think in our culture and so part
of my work is to help correct that and I
get a lot of [ __ ] for criticizing the
right and the right especially in America deserves a lot
of criticism so it's right that I've been criticizing the
right however when I do that people accuse me of
bias and partisanship but of course I'm actually very unbiased
and very non-partisan and so in an effort to balance
things out now here we're going to be focusing on
the left of course the left has its problems this
is not something new to me this is not some
new Awakening I've had just recently I've always seen the
problems of the left but I especially see it more
now because I spent the last seven years or so
basically ever since Trump started running for office really deeply
studying both the left wing and the right wing um
in American politics and also that led me into studying
World politics so I've been studying this a lot now
and I have a lot of uh frankly criticisms and
things that I've observed as oversights on the left so
I've kind of gathered them all here together into this
one episode now it's been said that it's easy to
tell when the right wing goes too far but it's
harder to tell when the left wing goes too far
which actually makes left wing more dangerous and there is
some truth to the statement the dangers of the right
wing are pretty obvious although not obvious enough apparently for
like 40 or 50 of the population the dangers of
the right wing are not obvious which is why they
need to be talked about which is why I've talked
about them a lot in the past if the if
the dangers of the right wing were so obvious then
we wouldn't have Trump we wouldn't have Maga we wouldn't
have all these right-wing nationalist quasi-fascist racist homophobic and so
on political movements uh xenophobic anti-immigrant movements happening all around
the world it's not just in America All Around the
World in Europe and South America and elsewhere so clearly
it's not so obvious however for those of us who
are a little bit more developed and a little bit
more intelligent and to those of us who to whom
that is obvious you say okay yeah that's obvious but
what about you know the problems on the left surely
there must be problems on the left and of course
there are problems on the left but notice this as
well that if you think that the problems on the
right are more obvious than the problems on the left
why is that that's actually goes to to buttress the
point that I've been making for a long time is
that there's an asymmetry between the development levels of the
left and the right they're not equally developed the right
wing is less developed than the left wing now when
I say that again people think I'm being biased or
partisan because I I just favor the left no that's
not the reason if you do an objective analysis and
you do a study of the actual development stages of
the ego which we've looked at in the spirodynamics series
and also in my series called the nine stages of
ego development the Susan Cook reuter model go check out
that series of episodes as well this is all within
the realm of Developmental Psychology if you actually look at
developmental psychology what you'll see there is that the human
mind evolves and develops it develops through various kinds of
stages these stages are pretty consistent around the world they've
been very well researched and tracked and we can predict
where your mind is going to develop cognitively morally spiritually
in terms of how you view men and women how
you view morality and various kinds of political rights these
things do evolve in a in a very predictable manner
and you're not as original of a thinker as you
think you are most people when they're doing politics they're
just parroting ideas they're parroting ideas at the very level
of development that they happen to be at whatever stage
that is so the right wing especially in America tends
to be spiral Dynamic stage blue slash Orange and the
left wing in America tends to be spiral Dynamic stage
orange slash green and a little bit into yellow these
are generalizations this isn't always true of course you can
find left Wingers who are less developed than right Wingers
of course that's the case we're generalizing generally though that's
the case and of course all these stages have problems
so when I say that the left is more developed
than the right that doesn't necessarily mean that they're a
lot more developed uh and that doesn't mean that there
are no problems on the left no there's a lot
of problems with your standard neoliberal or Progressive who's roughly
in spiral Dynamic stage orange slash green if they're very
very Progressive they might be solid green but there's still
many problems with solid green which I've talked about in
my episode called about Dynamic stage green if you go
watch that episode you'll understand all of the problems with
sage green yeah there's problems with this with Stage green
there's problems with Stage orange there's problems with Stage blue
there's problems even with Stage yellow all these stages have
their limitations and so we just want to become aware
of them if you're on the left ask yourself this
when does the left go too far and if you
cannot think of some good points on this question that's
a clue to you that you're fooling yourself and that
you're lost in ideology so the rest of this episode
is me answering the question when does the left go
too far now I'm not going to be bashing the
right so much in this episode so those of you
who are lefties and progressives you might if this is
the only political episode of mine that you watch you're
going to come away thinking that oh my God Leo
is some crypto right winger why is he supporting the
right Wingers here I'm not supporting the right Wingers here
I have a very balanced perspective on the right and
the left and I am part of the left but
in this episode I'm only focusing on the problems of
the left I'm not going to be talking about any
of the good redeeming qualities of the left of which
there are many I'm not focusing on that at all
and I'm not going to be talking about any of
the obvious problems on the right all right so you
have to keep that in mind so this is this
episode might come off as it's very unbalanced that's by
Design because we're specifically answering the question when does the
left go too far that's the that's our challenge here
we're not looking at anything else if you want a
more broader perspective on my ideas about the right and
left go check out those other episodes of mine that
I've released and I'll be doing more in the future
that are more balanced all right so here are all
the problems with Progressive politics spiral Dynamics stage green basically
the first one is not taking immigration as a serious
legitimate issue progressives tend to treat immigration as though like
well if you're anti-immigration if you have any concerns about
immigration if you want to tighten up the Border in
your country then basically your at the very least you're
xenophobic and uh probably you're racist and you're fascist and
that that's all there is to it that's not the
case there are legitimate concerns about immigration policy in any
country how many immigrants should we let in what kind
of immigrants should we let in what kind of policy
should we have in terms of how do we screen
them what are the security threats this is not just
problems that xenophobic and racist people have because you can
always take it to the extreme if you completely open
the border of a country and you just let anybody
in willy-nilly this is going to create chaos and problems
for your country at some point now it may be
the case that America you know America is a large
country with over 300 million citizens we can probably take
in millions of uh of uh immigrants and foreigners many
of them from very poor countries very underdeveloped countries but
you have to admit if you're a progressive or a
liberal you have to admit that at some point this
is going to create problems and there's multiple levels of
problems this will create some progressives and socialist types tend
to fool themselves into thinking like well ideally we should
have open borders now this notion of open borders a
lot of right-wingers take it too far and the majority
of the left and even Progressive politicians nobody out there
is really advocating for open borders this would be like
the most extreme position on the far far far left
if you find some sort of marxist far left you
know college kids they might fancy themselves so Progressive that
they just want open borders everywhere well they're foolish they
don't understand that the borders are there for a reason
if you just let everybody in uh this is going
to create problems for you it will create infrastructure problems
they're not might might not be enough um you know
um immigration centers to process all the people there might
not be enough government facilities to process all the people
there might not be enough roads not enough Bridges not
enough pipelines not enough housing not enough schooling right so
all these problems the system will start to get strained
you have to admit this it's just a question of
when you know maybe you can take in a million
people but if you've taken 5 million people the system
will start to get stranded if you're taking 10 million
people the whole system will just collapse so there's that
uh that's one issue but there's more than just that
the other issue is that you have to understand that
the majority of citizens in any country are very nationalistic
they have a national identity they consider themselves to be
Americans or Mexicans or Russians or Jews or whatever and
that's their identity that's how they see themselves they also
have a certain culture that they see as their mother
culture they have a mother language they have a mother
religion and so on and so what happens is that
if you just allow one culture to get overwhelmed and
inundated by another culture another ethnic group this is not
just a matter of oh we don't like those smelly
foreigners xenophobia type of thing no there's there's actually there's
there's deeper problems here because there is going to be
a cultural dilution that goes on the culture of the
mother country into which the immigration is happening that culture
is going to get diluted and it's going to change
now you might say well Leo we should all be
Multicultural and it doesn't matter you know if American culture
shifts if a bunch of Spanish speaking people move in
here it doesn't matter what language we speak it doesn't
matter what religion we have it doesn't matter what skin
color people are you know it's racist to care about
those things you're not being subtle enough and you're not
being realistic enough about how nationalism actually works these things
actually do matter and it's not just nearly a matter
of racism or purely xenophobia firstly you have to understand
that virtually all human beings are xenophobic by our nature
From Evolution we had to be this way because we're
wired to be very tribal we have it in group
we have an out group and we by our nature
we tend to hate and demonize the out group and
be afraid of the out group now if you doubt
whether you're xenophobic or not it's very easy to prove
to yourself that you're xenophobic and uh and the way
that you prove that to yourself is just this little
thought experiment you know if some aliens beamed you aboard
a UFO you would be terrified why are you terrified
are you terrified because you're a racist no it's because
you're naturally afraid of the unknown when you don't know
some group of people that you're going to be spending
time with that's scary that's a legitimate fear that's not
just an irrational fear that oh you're a racist no
you don't know what these aliens are going to do
to you now you might say well Leo but but
you know uh well yeah that might be true with
aliens but that's not true with with Mexicans or that's
not true with Jews or that's not true with with
with black people actually you don't know that if you're
a very Cosmopolitan person who's traveled around the world and
tastes of different Cuisines and study different countries and been
around a different uh kinds of people with different kinds
of ethnicities then you're very comfortable being around people who
look different than you and have different languages than you
and eat different food than you and pray to a
different God than you you're comfortable but it took you
time to acclimate to that and you still might not
be totally comfortable you still will have cultural preferences you
might prefer one culture over another culture simply because not
because you're racist or xenophobic but simply because you have
your preferences we all have our preferences you have a
preference for what kind of Cuisine is your favorite you
have a preference for um what kind of languages you
want to speak and you have a preference for what
kind of religious philosophies you prefer versus other ones and
which customs of doing business or getting married you prefer
over other ones see and so do the majority of
the people in your community but the majority of the
people in your community you have to understand this what
progressives don't understand because they have a blind spot here
is that they are not as Multicultural and open as
you are they're not as experienced and they are legitimately
frightened by new religions new Cuisines new languages new customs
and different ways of living life it creates a culture
shock it makes them feel uncomfortable and at the very
least the only reason we should limit immigration is if
none of the other problems are legitimate if let's say
our infrastructure can handle an infinite number of immigrants what
you should take seriously though is that the majority of
the people and citizens of your community are not going
to tolerate this rapid change in culture very well this
is going to literally frighten them it's going to make
them very uncomfortable and you might say well Leo so
what those are racists and xenophobic people and that's their
problem again you're being naive it's not merely their problem
it's going to make they are going to make it
your problem you see because they're not going to just
sit by with all their fear and being uncomfortable with
this flood of immigrants and this rapid changing in culture
in their religion and in their language and so forth
and in their Customs they're not just going to sit
by and tolerate this this is going to piss them
off and they're going to go and they are going
to start fascist movements as a reaction and this is
not some sort of hypothetical concern this is a legitimate
very very practical concern that you should be concerned with
as a progressive so as a progressive even if you
feel very comfortable with immigration all this kind of stuff
you have to be very careful to understand that the
majority of the citizens in your community are not as
developed as you they're not as open-minded as you they're
not as Multicultural as you and therefore you know because
when we're talking about politics we're talking about what is
going to work for the majority of people not for
the most developed five percent or ten percent for the
majority of people and the majority of people you have
to just be honest with yourself they literally are racist
and xenophobic and they have pretty strong cultural preferences and
they're nationalistic and now there are problems with racism of
course and we should try to limit it and so
forth but also you have to be realistic about how
quickly you can change that and a lot of times
progressives are not realistic about this and when you start
to smear these people as racists and fascists and other
kinds of names like this this actually worsens the problem
because you're not really understanding the depth of what's going
on here it's not your just standard old school style
of racism although sometimes it is see this is another
problem here that I see with Progressive politics is when
it comes to racism this term is way overused and
really you should start thinking about the problems of racism
not as racism but more as ethnocentrism what's the difference
and you have to be careful here because it might
sound like well Leo you're it seems like you're whitewashing
these racist you know why don't we just call them
racists because they're racist rather than calling it ethnocentrism which
seems like a less dirty word but you see the
problem with the word racist is that it is such
a dirty word that nobody is going to admit to
themselves that they're racist you might say well Leo what's
the problem with that well the problem with that there's
there's look if our goal is to minimize racism we
need to construct a set of systems and a pathway
to get people who are racist towards being non-racists and
ironically by calling everybody a racist and not having any
leeway or sympathy uh for the place that they're at
it makes it impossible to then change them and um
get them to admit certain biases that they have which
otherwise they might admit but as soon as you call
them a racist that's it you shut down the whole
conversation so you end up in a counterproductive situation but
actually there's something deeper here which is that these days
now in the past racism was a lot more prevalent
these days I think the majority of people are not
strictly racist but they are deeply ethnocentric what's the difference
ethnocentric means that you're loyal and you have a deep
preference for the culture that you grew up in basically
that's what it means you have a preference also for
your ethnicity and it's not just that you have a
preference for your race per se or that you think
your race is superior to other races so technically the
way that I would Define racism is someone is a
racist if they think that their race is superior to
another race I actually think that's pretty rare the majority
of people don't believe that anymore now in the past
that used to be true but just because you don't
think your race is superior to other races that doesn't
mean that you're equally comfortable with all Races and also
not just races but the cultures that come with the
races you have to understand right so race and culture
and ethnicity these tend to be deeply connected you may
not be a racist strictly speaking but you may have
pretty strong preferences for what culture what customs what language
you're comfortable with what religion you're comfortable with and these
all tend to come together as a group you see
and so this is what a lot of progressives don't
understand about the Trump supporters and Maga and conservatives is
that most of these conservatives are not racists but they
are ethnocentric and they do have a strong preference for
their culture and they want to preserve and defend their
culture because they're in love with their culture they don't
want to see their culture diluted and they're threatened by
the idea of multiculturalism now you might say well Leo
but that's their problem you know that's because they're bigots
why don't we call them bigots they're just closed-minded to
different kinds of cultures and uh that's an ugly thing
and we should seek to change that at the political
level you might say that as a progressive but here
you have to really understand the depth of our problem
multiculturalism [Music] doesn't just come naturally this is something that
has to be developed it doesn't happen automatically open-mindedness does
not happen automatically in fact the majority of the citizens
in your country or Community are extremely close-minded that's what
we're dealing with here on a practical level and you
have to be sensitive to that and willing to accommodate
that you can't just dismiss that and think that everyone
should be as open-minded as you no actually they can't
be and the reason they can't be is because they
haven't had the life experience you've had they haven't had
the education opportunities that you've had it's no secret that
the majority of progressives and people who are very passionate
about stage green politics they come from universities many of
them from Elite universities but you know what the majority
of the citizens in your community do not have the
economic opportunities to even go to universities even the basic
ones never mind to Harvard and Yale and Stanford and
this kind of stuff the majority of Americans don't have
a college degree and even if they do it's a
sort of a a low-level college degree they probably didn't
get very good grades and they probably went to a
university to you know a small College a small University
not a big one that wasn't as ethnically diverse and
culturally diverse as something like a Stanford or a Harvard
and many of them didn't go at all you see
and so while you had the opportunities to go to
these diverse universities and to learn about different cultures and
maybe your parents were wealthy enough to send you to
travel around the world maybe you spent a summer in
Europe or in South America or in Asia but think
about what allowed you those opportunities it was only because
your parents had money and it was also only because
you were already open-minded enough probably because if your Cosmopolitan
and Multicultural probably your parents were as well and their
values rubbed off on you so when your dad suggested
that you spend a summer in Europe that was already
his multiculturalism influencing you but see that's not true for
the majority of the people in your community and so
their minds were not open to different cultures and so
they are literally afraid of different cultures they don't understand
Islam they don't understand Chinese culture they don't understand and
they're literally frightened by the Spanish language yeah that's how
basic this is and if you want to be a
good politician and you want to do the best for
your community really when we're talking about develop we're talking
about politics what are we talking about we're talking about
developing Our Community Helping everybody or as many people as
possible within our community to expand their Consciousness and to
grow and develop themselves right but you have to understand
that human beings can only grow at a certain pace
and the biggest mistake that progressives make is that they
assume that everybody in their Community is willing and able
to grow at the same Pace that they themselves have
grown at and it's precisely because the progressives have grown
faster and more than the majority of people in their
community that now they're out of touch and they don't
understand the challenges that the rest of people the more
simple-minded people the poorer people Progressive tend to underestimate the
challenges that those people have in developing a sense of
multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism and tolerance and open-mindedness what they further
underestimate is that literally they've done biological studies on this
is that conservatives are literally born with brains that are
wired in such a way that make them more closed-minded
and more fearful just as a baseline never mind what
kind of parents they have never mind if they grow
up in a Cosmopolitan City like New York or San
Francisco you know a city like that or whether they
grow up in a little town in the middle of
Alabama right never mind any of those factors just their
Baseline brain chemistry as such that they're more close-minded and
therefore they're more fearful of things that they haven't encountered
yet that they understand right so literally what I'm telling
you is that if you take a liberal or a
progressive with a very Progressive mind and you beam him
up into a UFO with some aliens he will be
less terrified now he'll still probably be terrified but he'll
be less terrified than if you take a conservative and
do the exact same thing just by the wiring of
the brain chemistry that's pretty amazing and to not take
that into account when you're doing politics is a gross
oversight and a lot of the misunderstanding between conservatives and
and liberals has to do with just this simple biological
fact but of course on top of this there's a
lot of cultural you know programming that goes into it
as well it very much matters whether you grow up
in in the countryside or whether you grew up in
San Francisco if you grew up in San Francisco you're
going to be way more Cosmopolitan and Multicultural and open-minded
than if you grew up in a small 500 person
town in Alabama and that's exactly why you see that
the way politics breaks down if you look you know
come election time when voting is happening when the votes
are being tabulated you see which parts of the country
are the red votes coming from and which are the
blue coming from and you can see that all the
blue votes are coming from large cities even in very
red States like Alabama if you take a look at
the biggest Cosmos Cosmopolitan city in Alabama those are going
to be a lot of blue votes and conversely if
you take a look at California which is like the
most Progressive State you might say if you take a
look at the votes that are coming from the rural
parts of California they're all red States I mean they're
all red votes so really this designation of red States
and blue States is a very poor way of looking
at it because it's not the state that determines whether
your votes are red or blue it's really Urban versus
rural and that's because when you live in an urban
environment you just by necessity are forced to confront people
from different ethnicities of different races different cultures from all
around the world speaking different languages eating different foods and
you're all living in close proximity to each other whereas
if you grew up in the middle of Alabama in
a 500 person town it's only going to be one
kind of person people like you for the most part
and when you grow up in that for 30 years
that's going to be like locked and cemented into your
mind of what is normal and then anything that you
encounter outside of that is going to seem scary and
uncomfortable and this is not something that you can just
fix about yourself it's not like somebody who grew up
for 30 years in in the middle of Alabama in
some rural part of town there can just um flip
some sort of switch because you tell him to you
know you tell him oh stop being racist and just
open your mind you multiculturalism and he says oh yeah
okay cool let me do that and then he goes
into his mind and flips the switch and now all
of a sudden he's just comfortable with with Chinese culture
and Mexican culture and Russian culture no he can't do
that that's not something he has conscious control over so
repeatedly calling him a racist and a bigot and a
xenophobe is not going to improve that situation that's not
actually going to help him to grow in fact that's
going to force him now to to become defensive because
he has to defend his own culture because he's loyal
to his own culture he loves his own culture because
he doesn't really have anything else he knows nothing else
so he's going to defend his God he's going to
defend his Christian ways he's going to defend his language
he's going to defend his customs and um his way
of doing business that's how humans are by default so
if you want to truly be a compassionate political actor
you have to have compassion for people's struggles with this
and that means you have to surrender calling them racists
that's a difficult pill to swallow for many progressives and
yet deep down you know that what I'm telling you
is correct and when you start to accept this this
is when you go beyond green politics into Stage yellow
and above so the next problem with Progressive politics is
with police especially recently we've had a lot of situations
where police brutality is blown way out of proportion to
the point where police as a whole are being demonized
by the left I watch a lot of left-wing commentators
on YouTube and the ease with which they will smear
and paint all police as pigs racists um fascists and
other sorts of labels like this is really troubling now
of course there is systematic racism within police of course
the police can be corrupt as can any institution in
fact as all institutions are to various degrees um of
course there is excessive brutality used by the police especially
here in America the problem though is that it gets
completely blown out of proportion because what you see you
know this the sort of like sensational video clips that
you see on YouTube or tick tock of police shooting
some black man here or some unarmed black woman there
or you know some mentally uh you know disabled person
here in this situation you know we've all seen these
clips they're tragic Clips uh of course Justice needs to
be handed out in these situations but you have to
distinguish this from smearing police as a whole policing is
a very difficult business it's a dangerous business as well
and the problem is that the police go out every
single day in this country and they serve thousands of
and even millions of arrest warrants and criminal cases they
chase down you know uh legitimate criminals and they stop
they stop all sorts of disputes and they do drug
busts and all sorts of stuff that they do right
they perverted preventive a lot of crime the problem is
that they get almost no credit for that and then
if they make one mistake and it gets caught on
videotape then people lose their minds and they start to
smear all of police as being this way but that's
not the case 99 of the time when the police
are doing their work they're doing a great job they're
professional they're responsible they save lives they help people save
their money from being stolen preventing property damage and crime
and all sorts of ugly ugly stuff but then one
percent of the time the police are corrupt you know
because you have you have hundreds of thousands of police
across the whole country of course some of them are
going to be corrupt and I'm not just saying it's
a few bad apples because people say oh Leo so
you're just making a few bad apples case here which
the conservatives make no I will also admit that there
are systemic problems within the police there are problems with
how the police are trained there are problems with perhaps
how the police are over militarized maybe they get too
many too many high powerful weapons there are problems within
certain police departments there are certain police departments around the
country which literally are racist but that doesn't mean all
of them are that just means we have to identify
those and fix those problems there are problems with how
police are trained that needs to also be identified and
changed but even admitting all those problems in 99 of
the cases the police are still doing a good job
now you might say well Leo but that's just it's
easy for you to say that because you're white and
you're affluent and you live in a good part of
the country in a good part of town therefore you
have not experienced the kind of you know bad police
brutality and unfairness that I might have experienced if you
let's say you're a minority and I'm willing to grant
you that that minorities are going to by definition experience
more unfairness if the police are majority White also poor
people are going to experience worse encounters with the police
than affluent people and that's unfair but also you have
to understand that there is actually the sort of affluence
thing there's actually reason for that because poor people are
going to commit more crime generally speaking than affluent people
just because they have more reason to now that's not
that's not going to translate the same you know based
on skin color um although historically the reason that black
people commit more crime is because they're less affluent not
so much because they're black but because they're less affluent
and why are they less affluent because they were black
and therefore enslaved therefore they have a lot less generational
wealth so there's some complicated Dynamics going on there and
some some sort of complicated correlations um but uh but
look I'll grant you that minorities have it worse in
terms of the police but that still doesn't mean that
the police are on the whole a bad thing so
one of the worst political moves that progressives have made
in the last five years or so is this this
slogan of defund the police abolish the police defund the
FBI abolish the FBI now conservatives are saying that but
they're saying that for different reasons in terms of FBI
um but um this is these are these are stupid
slogans these are stupid policies stupid ideas that make the
left wing seem like they're stupid and actually give fuel
to the right wing this empowers the right wing any
time progressives go too far and do ridiculous absurd stupid
things or try to defend stupid policy positions that empowers
the right you understand that think about that defund the
police this slogan I mean if I was into conspiracy
theories I would think that the right wing came up
with this slogan and fed it to the left wing
just to weaken the left wing so that the right
wing would win power I don't believe that actually but
like if I said if I was at a conspiracy
theories that would be a good one uh but of
course um progressives are stupid enough to have brought this
uh this damage onto themselves now moving on to the
next problem with Progressive politics is the demonization and failure
to properly understand the right this is we've already touched
on this problem but we're going to be re retouching
this problem as we go down this list of of
problems with progressives because um this is sort of like
a meta problem progressives are way too quick to call
people racists bigots transphobes homophobes islamophobes and fascists notice that
all these terms and labels sometimes they're appropriate but for
the most part these are actually what are called in
Psychology thought terminating cliches when you use one of these
labels to dismiss somebody you no longer have to assume
the burden of trying to understand where that person is
coming from when you call someone a racist or a
transphobe that shuts down dialogue but even worse than that
it shuts down your mind's capacity to understand the Nuance
in that person's point of view so for example I've
seen a lot of uh Progressive YouTubers calling Joe Rogan
a transphobe this is a big mistake big mistake and
when they do this again this feeds into empowering the
right now Joe Rogan has some very strong positions on
trans people in sports and that's because he comes from
Sports especially martial arts where the physical strength differences between
men and women are very significant so basically Joe Rogan's
position is something along the lines of that um you
know he doesn't hate trans people he doesn't want to
stop all trans people from being trans if that's what's
right for them but his position is that when it
comes to sports and especially when it comes to competitive
physical sports like let's say boxing or fighting um in
these cases if you take uh if you allow trans
people to participate in the sport especially if you allow
trans men to compete against normal women this is unfair
this creates biological imbalances hormonal you know uh there's a
hormonal Advantage there there's a structural Advantage just to your
your bone structure and all this kind of stuff from
comes from being born a biological man um that even
if you transition you're still going to have a huge
Advantage right so this is Joe Rogan's position this is
a legitimate position to have this does not make him
a transpho but a lot of times what I see
is that progressives are so eager just to call somebody
a transphobe who might have a slightly different view of
of trans issues and doesn't you know toe the Progressive
Party Line doesn't just buy into all the group think
automatically they just dismiss that person oh he's just a
trans vote no he's not a transphobe it's just that
you're stuck in group think and anything outside your group
think you have no explanation for and you don't want
to engage in that you don't want to take responsibility
for understanding that because maybe there's some good points there
that Joe Rogan is making but you don't want to
consider those so you just dismiss them as a trans
vote this was one example I only used Joe Rogan
here because he's like the most well-known guy but I
see this kind of problem happening over and over again
not just with the label transphogue but homophobe islamophobe fascist
racist bigot and other sorts of labels like this and
this is just a more General problem that stage green
does one of the characteristic problems of stage any stage
below stage yellow any tier one stage is that stage
green does not have a proper understanding of the stages
below it it does not have a proper understanding of
stage orange and of stage blue likewise stage orange does
not have a proper retaining of stage green and Stage
blue and likewise stage blue does not have a proper
understanding of sage orange and Stage green so the stages
are misunderstanding each other and in order to move to
Stage yellow tier two or above to really have a
conscious politics which is what we're trying to move towards
here which is the whole objective of this conversation to
get there we need the stages understanding each other fundamentally
progressives do not understand conservatives this is a true statement
they think they understand they think they're better than they
think they're more evolved they think they don't need to
understand because they're already more evolved this is a mistake
this is a huge mistake you need to understand the
conservative mind if you're a progressive and you need an
accurate understanding of the conservative mind and you should care
if you have an inaccurate understanding of the conservative mind
that's a huge point think about why what I'm telling
you is important I'm not going to give you the
answer I want you to think about that I'm just
telling you that it is the case that if you're
a progressive and you do not care about the accuracy
of your understanding of the conservative worldview that is going
to come back and hurt you it's going to hurt
you in many ways I want you to contemplate what
those ways are I'll just give you a couple of
pointers here it'll hurt you in two ways at least
one way it'll hurt you is it'll simply hurt you
in your ability to actually win elections because a lot
of people at least half the people in your country
are conservative if you don't accurately understand the world view
how are you going to win elections so this is
just a purely you know selfish reason to care about
why you should have an accurate understanding of your opponent's
worldview it's not like we're saying that conservatives are like
10 of the population if conservatives are only 10 of
the population maybe you wouldn't matter you know how accurately
you understood the worldview no conservatives are like at least
half of the population so it's pretty important don't you
think if you are not able to understand the world
view of half the world's population that's pretty important foreign
that should worry you and I guarantee you as a
progressive you do not have an accurate understanding of the
conservative world to you you tell yourself that you do
but you don't what you have is you have a
demonized straw man version of it which is not the
same thing now again you might say here oh but
Leo but but conservatives are even worse conservatives don't understand
the progressive worldview yes of course they don't of course
they don't of course they're even worse at this of
course conservatives demonize and straw man the progressive worldview but
we're not talking about that in this episode remember I
told you this is going to be an imbalanced episode
we're only talking about your problems as a progressive I
don't care about the conservatives problems here they have a
lot of problems even more than you but we're talking
about you see at some point you have to stop
pointing your finger at the conservatives and all of their
problems and you have to ask yourself but what about
my problems because ultimately you're responsible for you you can't
serve you can't um fix the conservatives problems for them
only they can solve their own problems and only you
can solve your problems as a progressive so in this
episode I don't care what the conservative problems are it
doesn't matter what matters if you're a progressive is your
problems your blind spots your weaknesses that's what we're working
on that's what it means to take responsibility and to
develop yourself one of the biggest problems we have in
politics is that everybody is pointing out somebody else's problems
but nobody is taking responsibility for solving their own internal
problems therefore how can we all develop and grow for
example if I'm trying to give advice to men about
how to improve their relations with women it's pointless to
me talking about the problems that women have now if
I'm talking to women about improving their relationships with men
then I'm going to be talking about women's problems and
if I'm talking to Men I'm gonna be talking about
men's problems because only the men can fix their problems
and only the women can fix their own problems you
see there's no point in me making an advice video
for men about being better with women and the whole
video is just me criticizing women that doesn't solve anything
you see so it's like that with politics too so
one reason you should care about misunderstanding the the right
is because um just for winning elections it'll help you
to win elections but the second reason is because look
you're gonna have to live with these people for the
rest of your life conservatives are not going anywhere you're
not going to kill half the country they're not going
anywhere and you're not going to brainwash them out of
their conservativism you're not gonna you're not gonna wake them
up out of it maybe you will with a few
people but for the most part the percentage of conservatives
to liberals left to right in this country is not
going to change throughout your entire lifetime it's going to
be the same percentage for the most part so you're
gonna have to you know live with these people work
with these people and ultimately you're gonna have to make
peace with these people because if you don't make peace
with these people in your own mind you're going to
be at war with them forever don't you think that's
a problem now see a rabid Progressive here would say
well Leo but I don't want to make peace with
them they need to be fought and defeated think a
little bit deeper about what you're actually saying do you
want peace in the world or not if you're a
progressive supposedly you're Pro piece yet the only version of
Pro piece that you're for is the piece that comes
after you exterminate half the population that's a problem I'm
not saying you're going to exterminate half the population but
think about how your worldview is working the only way
you will have peace of mind as a progressive is
if half the world is dead that's literally your position
I'm suggesting to you that's a problem I'm suggesting to
you that that is not How We Do conscious politics
and that there is a better way to go about
doing politics so think about that real hard and stop
using these thought terminating cliches stop calling people just in
a knee-jerk way calling them racists and bigots and homophobes
and transphobes actually engage with them stop calling people fascists
engage with them try to really understand their worldview this
will be really good for you now one objection that
a progressive could raise here is like well Leo but
if I want to open my mind to fascist ideas
and homophobic and transforming ideas isn't that like opening my
mind to the wrong things and that in this way
I'm going to somehow compromise with the Devil by opening
my mind to the Devil by trying to understand the
devil no that's incorrect understanding the devil fully is actually
how you defeat the Devil you cannot defeat the Devil
by demonizing the devil there's actually much deeper spiritual reasons
for why that's the case I won't go into that
here but you cannot defeat Evil by fighting evil that
has never worked and it will never work the only
way you can defeat evil is by loving it to
death which requires you understanding it to death which requires
opening your mind to it all right moving on to
the next point the next problem with Progressive politics is
excessive forms of what I call idiot compassion what is
idiot compassion idiot compassion is when you place compassion for
the suffering of others above everything else so one example
of this might be a sort of a naive pacifism
where you say like let's abolish the military entirely let's
disarm all our nuclear weapons let's disarm uh and destroy
all our guns and we're just going to live happily
all together with no weapons in the sort of utopia
you know because we don't want war you know war
is not very compassionate and violence is not very good
so therefore the solution to violence is just to eliminate
all the all the weapons this is sort of an
idiot companion this would be a policy that comes from
idiot compassion and progressives tend to be more prone to
errors of idiot compassion because they tend to have more
compassion than conservatives the problem with conservatives they don't have
enough compassion the problem with progressives they have too much
compassion they have so much compassion it makes them so
idealistic that they don't realize that life and survival are
brutal things and that sometimes by taking an overly compassionate
approach to some situation you actually make it worse not
better a classic example of this in your personal life
is for example when you're trying to break up with
your girlfriend or boyfriend if you're very compassionate you can
empathize with how much you're going to break this person's
heart by breaking up with them but you also know
deep down that this person is not right for you
so what do you do well out of compassion you
hold it off and hold it off and hold it
off for years you don't tell them that you're going
to break up with them because you don't want to
break their heart but of course the more years go
by where you don't tell them the worse it gets
and eventually it's going to break up anyways because you
already know they're not right for you you guys are
not compatible so you're just um you're delaying the inevitable
and out of compassion actually you're going to end up
breaking this person's heart even more because if you told
them right off the bat and did a clean break
with them yeah you would hurt their heart but they
would move on and you would move on and they
would be able to find a partner and you'd be
able to find a new partner and things would go
fine but when you start um you know that would
be like the honest sort of like the you know
you're taking the Band-Aid or you're just ripping the Band-Aid
off in one clean swipe but when you're slowly peeling
that Band-Aid out of compassion you know it actually makes
the total pain worse so I noticed that progressives tend
to fall into this problem idiot compassion we have to
understand is that good intentions and compassion are not enough
to fix many of the world's systemic problems this is
especially true when it comes to war progressives and have
sort of a blind spot when it comes to war
and violence because they just instinctively progressives don't like war
and violence and so we want to just do anything
possible to minimize it as quickly as possible but actually
sometimes War violence and conflict are necessary for a greater
good and that by delaying this war conflict you actually
out of compassion you're delaying it you're trying to avoid
it but actually you're going to cause more misery by
doing so okay the next point the next problem is
it's a big one it's this naive ideological obsession with
socialism and Marxism that we see amongst progressives this is
such a huge topic I could have a separate episode
just about this I've been observing a lot of debates
between capitalists Libertarians socialists communists tankies marxists I see a
lot of a lot of blind spots here and a
lot of the ways in which marxists argue they're talking
points are very problematic so I'm going to point some
of these out now that does not mean that I'm
pro-capitalist here um again this is going to be one-sided
I'm just criticizing the ways in which socialism and Marxism
are argued for by the left all right so the
first problem here is I see a lot of parroting
of socialists and Marsh's talking points parroting like people say
well you know in Marx in Das Capital you know
on this page here he said this and he said
that this is the definition of exploitation and this is
the definition of Labor and capital and like they just
use these Marxist definitions these are just talking points this
doesn't mean that they have anything um to do with
with reality or that it's going to lead to a
better Society first of all understand that the next problem
is some socialists and marxists go so far as to
advocate for full-on socialism and full-on Marxist Revolution even sometimes
through violence this is very dangerous and very problematic they
don't understand what they're you know advocating for or what
kind of consequences they could have again this is sort
of coming from like an idiot compassion because look any
reasonable person sees the evils of capitalism and the very
many problems and injustices that come with a capitalist system
however that does not mean that socialism and Marxism is
automatically going to be a better system and just because
you are compassionate for the poor and the exploited workers
under capitalism does not mean that that compassion and those
good intentions of yours will translate over into a better
system after a socialist Revolution you have to consider that
your socialist Revolution might actually lead to a worse system
after all is said and done even though it came
from very good intentions in fact we have a long
history the whole 20th century is a history of this
now I am not being as naive as many right
Wingers are that just because you know we had the
20th century and we've tried socialism and Marxism let's say
within within Russia within China South America and Cuba and
other places Venezuela and so forth that just because it
hasn't worked or there's been problems with it that now
we need to forget about socialism and that now socialism
is dead no there are good ideas within socialism there
are many valid critiques of capitalism within Marxism we can
acknowledge all that and yet still we can also understand
that staging a socialist or Marsh's Revolution can be extremely
problematic and that you can easily make things worse than
they are a lot of the problem is that to
get one of these social systems socialist systems in place
you're going to have to use authoritarian means to do
so at least historically that's how it's always gone down
now you might say Leo but but the socialism of
the 21st century will be implemented without any authoritarian means
oh yeah where has that ever worked I mean of
course your intentions are to implement socialism in the most
peaceful way possible but the reality is socialism especially when
you're trying to actually implement it through some kind of
revolution this is happening through deep ideology and groupthink the
only way you're going to Stage your Revolution is through
ideology and groupthink you're going to have to raise hordes
and masses of people to Stage your Revolution and as
you do that the people become stupider and stupider and
they commit all the evils that humans commit when they
are organized into a mob under some ideology doesn't even
matter what the ideology is just the fact that you
have millions of people organize under some ideology they're not
thinking independently for themselves this is going to create a
lot of evil even if the ideology is very good
and it's going to lead to all sorts of corruption
and abuses of power and authority so even though you
might be the leader of a peaceful socialist Revolution once
it actually gets going it's going to get out of
control see you're going to create a Frankenstein monster and
then this monster will eat you alive and then this
monster will become power hungry and it will go on
without you in authoritarian ways to try to survive because
we're talking about survival here we're talking about Collective systems
of survival see my episode called Collective ego which talks
all about this kind of stuff other problems I see
within this domain is also tankies tankies are basically socialists
or marxists who whitewash communism who actually believe that oh
you know Leo Soviet Soviet communism wasn't so bad and
Chinese communism wasn't so bad there's a lot of problems
with that I won't even get into that here um
you have to acknowledge to yourself if you're a Marxist
or a socialist that actually Marxism in socialism these are
dogmas this is groupthink you didn't develop these ideas on
your own you probably didn't even read these ideas from
Marx himself you probably got this mostly from hearsay and
group think in the University you went to or the
people you hung out with when you were young it's
a Dogma now there are some valid points within Marxism
but there's also a lot of Wrong Stuff within Marxism
I'll be explaining some of that here and in the
future I'll have an episode just purely about the problems
with socialism Marxism versus capitalism and to admit that there
are problems within Marxism does not mean that you have
to ignore all the problems with capitalism it's not an
either or so you're just because I'm criticizing socialism Marxism
here does not make me some sort of arch capitalist
libertarian neoliberal you have to be careful as you're listening
to me making these points I'm speaking from tier two
it's probably Dynamics tier two right I'm speaking from a
non-ideological place so whenever I'm criticizing capitalism or socialism or
progressivism or whatever um it's not because I'm defending it's
opposite and it's also not because I'm just some sort
of third way neoliberal you might say oh Leo well
Leo is just sitting here and he just wants to
split everything down the middle he doesn't want to be
too far right and he doesn't want to be too
far left so what is he he's just some neoliberal
Centrist some sort of like Bill Clinton type of person
right wrong that's actually a huge mistake that progressives make
which we'll get to further down the list this is
a huge point but a lot of times what progressives
do is in order to maintain their ideological position of
progressivism and to not have a challenge um what they
do is they will demonize anybody I mean obviously they
demonize anyone who's on the far right but they will
even demonize anyone who's even remotely giving the appearance of
being Centrist because you know progressives will demonize centrists as
well um and then that makes them just completely stuck
in their bubble of progressivism but what you have to
understand is that not only is there the far right
and the moderate right and then there's the centrism and
moderate left and then there's progressivism there's even something beyond
all of those categories which is tier two tier two
can smell like centrism but it's not you don't even
know what tier two is yet and many progressives are
so simple-minded and so so quick to demonize that not
only will they demonize tier 2. they will even deny
the um of course they will demonize centrism and they
will even deny the existence of moderate conservativism they will
say there's no such thing as a modern conservative all
conservatives are right-wing extremists and fascists just the moderate ones
are just pretending so see this gets extremely tricky um
we'll get to that point further down I want to
stay on the on the Marxism track for a bit
more here so Progressive socialists and marxists have a problem
admitting where socialism has truly failed where it's been truly
tried and truly failed so there's a sort of a
sleight of hand here sort of a new no true
Scotsman argument it's called Uh this kind of bit of
logic which says that well yeah I mean socialism has
been tried in the Soviet era and in Venezuela and
in in China it's been tried but that wasn't that
wasn't the real socialism the real socialism is the socialism
we're going to start in the 21st century that'll be
the real socialism that will work but the other ones
weren't real therefore they failed I'm not saying that you
can't have better forms of socialism I think you can
I think that socialism failed in the past but maybe
in the future it actually could work but you have
to be very honest with yourself about holding your own
feet to the fire and admitting when real socialism has
been tried and failed because you see the problem here
is that in being so idealistic about your socialism you
could be implementing and advocating for socialism but then when
it every time it fails you could fool yourself into
saying that oh well it failed because capitalism made it
fail not because of the inherent problems within socialism but
what if it's failing not because of capitalism but actually
because of the inherent problems within socialism how would you
know that you have to keep your mind open to
that possibility because it could be possible that socialism as
a system as a whole will never ever work anywhere
that is possible you want to keep your mind open
to that possibility now I'm not saying that's true necessarily
I'm saying it's possible I'm saying that these systems capitalism
socialism libertarian whatever it is these systems are so complicated
that no human being actually can predict whether they will
work or not it has to be tested and tried
and also what matters is not just your ideals of
it but how it works in practice right there's an
ideal of capitalism in theory and then there's what capitalism
looks like in practice likewise there's an ideal of what
Socialism or Marxism is in theory the Utopia of it
where it's all perfect and then there's how it actually
looks when selfish egotistical ignorant people implemented and you see
it doesn't really matter that Socialism or Marxism works great
in your mind's eye where egotistical people are not implementing
it because in the real world we're dealing with very
egotistical people even Progressive people are very egotistical closed-minded biased
selfish ignorant people and that's the best case scenario is
that those people will be implementing your socialist system but
in reality even lower kinds of people will be implementing
your system even lower than progressives stage Orange and blue
and even red so what's going to happen with your
Marxist Utopia when stage red gets a a hold of
it this is something that most socialists and marxists are
not prepared to answer for also you have to recognize
that it may be the case that Society right now
is not developed enough to sustain socialism have you considered
that possibility after all how would you know how would
you know that mankind right now is developed enough maybe
in three to five hundred years mankind will be developed
enough and selfless enough and conscious enough and compassionate enough
and objective enough to create and sustain a socialist system
but not today and if you take a look at
the percentages of spiral development and ego development stages red
blue orange green when you look at those percentages that'll
be very sobering for you because you'll realize that the
majority of mankind on this planet is stage blue and
lower not even stage orange yet most people in America
are stage blue or orange and they are just struggling
to get a handle on blue and orange they're struggling
it'll take them their whole lives just to master Orange
that's the reality of our situation the problem is that
progressives tend to overestimate the general level of development of
most human beings on the planet and their fellow citizens
and the reason that is is because when you are
one of the most developed groups in the world if
you grew up in a first world democracy in America
in a blue state in a big city like La
New York San Francisco Seattle and you went to a
good University and you had a bunch of liberal professors
and Friends and you traveled around the world and all
of this you did because you had the money to
do it understand this without money none of this would
have been possible for you you were so lucky to
be born into that ninety percent of the population in
this world will never experience that they are nowhere close
to experiencing that because they simply don't have the financial
resources to do it and the opportunity and they were
just born in the wrong place at the wrong time
so it's very easy to get your sense of the
world skewed by the fact that you grew up and
were educated in these stage green Progressive bubbles which are
the universities for the most part in these blue States
and blue cities uh but the majority of the citizens
on whom your government and economy must depend um are
not at that stage of development they have a very
different value set than you very different world view than
you they have different fears and concerns than you they
have a different culture than you they have different biases
and preferences than you progressives don't understand that it's going
to take the majority of mankind a couple hundred years
just to reach the point of where some wealthy you
know Berkeley students or UCLA student is at today that's
the reality of our situation here's another point about socialism
you have to admit to yourself as a socialist that
there's a great disparity in value between people's work the
majority of people are lazy uncreative and uninnovative in their
work and there is a correlation between value creation and
wealth wealthy people are not just wealthy because they stole
that money through some sort of exploitative capitalist system wealthy
people generally speaking are wealthy because they've generated more value
for the world but be careful here because I'm not
denying that there are inherent inequalities within capitalism and that
capitalism is not strictly meritocratic so it might be it
might sound like I'm just arguing for meritocracy here that's
not the case I fully recognize that in capitalism there's
a lot of um exploitation going on a lot of
abuse of power abuse of hierarchy and that some capitalists
become very very wealthy even though they are a net
negative to society or they do some sort of unethical
practices like they sell drugs or they sell weapons or
they do pollution or whatever that definitely goes on for
sure and it's definitely the case that under the capitalist
system we have right now workers are not being fairly
compensated they are being exploited in many cases when a
CEO of some giant Corporation is earning you know 50
million dollars a year in stock options but his secretary
isn't even able to afford you know health care for
her children that's a problem and that's not fair and
that needs to be addressed in the future and it
will be addressed in the future but that does not
mean that a simple socialist system will actually address this
problem because what I see is that a lot of
socialists tend to just assume that everybody tends to kind
of work about the same and they all deserve roughly
the same amount of compensation that's not the case um
there are some people who are born with extraordinary talents
and uh creative abilities or intelligence or whatever and also
not just born with but also how they're shaped by
their environment such that they become much greater value creators
than your typical employee in fact your typical employee is
actually quite lazy quite lazy quite dumb quite uninterested in
taking responsibility for doing business a lot of people rather
than taking on the burdens of Entrepreneurship which requires extraordinary
responsibility and that comes with stress emotional labor and stress
comes with being responsible for employing a hundred people and
making sure that you can meet all their paychecks come
Christmas time that takes an enormous amount of responsibility the
average worker does not want anything to do with this
kind of responsibility they just want to show up be
told what to do how to do it and then
receive a paycheck guaranteed there's a cost for that the
cost for that is that you don't earn very much
and the reason that is because you don't take on
the creative responsibilities that come with generating a lot of
value for the world uh socialist tend to fall into
this trap of thinking that well wealthy people are wealthy
people just because they've exploited a lot through the capitalist
system sometimes that's true but that's not always true you
have to admit as a socialist that a lot of
wealthy people genuinely create a million percent more value than
your average employee not because they work more hours see
that's too simplistic because if you take a simplistic calculation
of how many hours a CEO Works versus how many
hours an employee works you know like the Starbucks of
CEO does not work that many more hours than the
typical employee of uh you know the Barista at Starbucks
um maybe maybe let's say the CEO Works twice as
many hours the Barista Works 40 and he works 80.
okay well does that justify him earning a thousand times
more of course not but what we have to understand
is that it's not just about the hours you work
it's not even how about how hard you were it's
about how smart you work and different kinds of work
generates value in very different degrees see just because you
work let's say a hundred hours a week pouring coffee
as a barista you might work really hard and you
might please all your customers and you might pour every
cup of coffee perfectly and you might think well that
that justifies this Barista getting as much as the CEO
no it doesn't because in the end you're just pouring
[ __ ] coffee which has almost zero value to
anybody in the world you know Leah but coffee is
valuable yeah it's a little bit valuable but compared to
actually managing a company like Starbucks pouring cups of coffee
is worth nothing you have to understand that there is
such an enormous value discrepancy between managing a logistics chain
of a hundred thousand people around the entire world versus
pouring a few cups of coffee even pouring about what
is how many cups of coffee does a barista pour
per week a thousand let's say you might say that's
a lot of coffee yeah but it's it's nothing compared
to managing the the logistics chain of Starbucks for the
entire planet this is something that I see a lot
of marxists and socialists not understand and not really appreciate
because there's a sort of demonization of wealthy people CEOs
Executives capitalists and look a lot of these people are
scumbags I'll grant you that uh many of these top
tier CEOs and capitalists they're literally sociopaths and Psychopaths clinically
so um many of them are very greedy many of
them will exploit their workers and not give a [
__ ] about their workers but still percentage of them
that's not all of them that's still a minority of
them actually if you're honest the majority of the world's
top CEOs capitalists millionaires billionaires people who run giant businesses
in a very successful manner the majority of these people
are actually extremely responsible extremely diligent extremely hard working polite
kind they care about their employees they care about their
customers they care about not cheating and exploiting their customers
and their employees you know within within certain tolerances and
within certain bounds I'm not saying they're Saints and the
reason they have to be that way is because if
they weren't that way then they couldn't be as successful
as they are sometimes you can get a sociopath that
gets really high up and is able to you know
dominate people but especially these days the way that most
companies are run these days you can't be a sociopath
and successfully manage a company with 10 000 people in
it a lot of times that just won't fly you're
going to piss off way too many people and they're
going to kick you out the board of directors will
just fire you you know it's not like the CEO
is like a tyrant of a corporation most CEOs will
easily get fired by the board of directors or by
the stockholders if they act out or act like an
[ __ ] or create public relations nightmares for their
for you know for their companies or for the investors
so it's not like there's not accountability there is accountability
it's not perfect but you have to understand that the
reason that these sociopaths if a sociopath is able to
climb high up in the corporate hierarchy and is able
to amass a lot of power and wealth the reason
that is is actually because that sociopath is actually generating
an enormous amount of value for people you may not
like him personally you may think he's an [ __
] you may think he's a racist and a sexist
and uh and you know maybe he's even raped a
few people and you might be horrified by all this
but the reality is that if he's still in power
the reason he's still in power is because the investors
and even the employees the majority of them who are
working under him need him because he's generating so much
[ __ ] value for the whole organization you might
say well Leo this is kind of a sick way
to think about it you know surely if some employee
some some you know some some CEO raped a few
people he should be fired for that it doesn't matter
how many people he's helped how many customers he's helped
it doesn't matter how many products he sold how much
money he's made because just you know on moral principle
you know if he raped a couple of people then
he should be fired see this is where you have
to be very careful because that's your that's your sort
of idiot compassion kicking in right because you're not really
realistically looking at how survival works see in the progressives
mind if a guy raped a few people nothing can
ever redeem him in reality the way it works is
that if a guy raped a few people but on
the other hand let's say he employs 10 000 people
and he's able to provide them with paychecks every single
month consistently for decades that counterbalances any people he'll ever
be able to rape in his entire life you might
say well that's a very sick way to think about
things yeah but you know uh the way the world
works is it works on Survival not on your moral
principles and virtues and progressives have this problem with with
being way too moralistic and too idealistic about life and
the reason that is usually because their survival is secured
see when your survival is secured let's say your parents
pay for your education and they pay for your rent
and they bought you your car all this it's very
easy to be a socialist and an idealist under this
situation because you now actually have to [ __ ]
kill anybody for survival the majority of people in the
world have to kill others to survive survival is literally
life and death for them so for them they can't
be too moralistic about it when you're not able to
pay your bills when you don't have money this changes
the entire dynamic let's say nobody will give you a
job in this economy and nobody will pay your bills
except one guy this one entrepreneur you can work for
him and he will provide you with a consistent paycheck
and a great job but he's also a rapist and
you know it what do you do do you take
that job you might say no Leo I'm too moral
I would never take that job okay but what about
the millions of other people who are in poverty who
would benefit from having that job you say well they
shouldn't take it either okay but what if you have
children let's say you know there's a mother who has
a family of three young children who need Dental Care
Child Care Medical Care education school you know healthy food
all that can she take this job working for this
rapist you say no Leo she can't either okay well
then you're you're see out of idiot compassion you're making
her children suffer because her children now are going to
be poor they're not going to get the education and
they themselves being poor are going to turn to theft
and perhaps violence and perhaps rape so who's to say
what the net neg the net positive and that negative
are it's it's not so simple as you think you
see these are the realities of survival you have to
also admit as a socialist that self-made wealth is such
there is such a thing as self-made wealth it is
possible for you to just be extraordinarily creative and hardworking
and to create wealth basically out of nothing that does
not mean that capitalist systems don't exist and that a
lot of wealth is not generated through the exploitation of
various kinds of sneaky capitalist systems in reality that is
how the majority of the world's wealth is created is
through exploitation of various sorts of capitalistic systems that is
true however that's not exclusively true it is possible to
do capitalism in more conscious ways in ways that do
not exploit others exploitation is not inherent to capitalism this
is a big um point of contention between myself and
marxists is Marxist will say that no Leo exploitation the
way you know you don't understand the technical definition of
exploitation the way Marx defined it is that you know
capitalists have to exploit workers this is a this is
actually something that someone like a Richard wolf um a
professor of socialism talks about um actually he's wrong about
this so let's let's talk about this for a second
so there's something that socialists don't acknowledge is that socialists
don't acknowledge that making a profit of employees is not
exploitation it's absolutely necessary yes employers make profit off of
employees but if this didn't happen there couldn't be a
business there couldn't be a corporation the boss of a
corporation has to look out for the survival of the
corporation that's his number one priority a corporation cannot survive
without profit so the boss's number one priority is to
make sure that there's profit for the corporation because if
there's not profit for the corporation he can't pay his
employees and if he can't pay his employees he's failed
everybody everybody's worse off right so um so this Marxist
definition that any amount of profit made off employees like
no it can't work that way because you see corporations
are themselves entities that have to care about survival you
have to think of a corporation as a organism as
a living organism that is competing against other corporations it
needs to have some sort of buffer or profit margin
or basically a savings that savings is its Lifeline if
a corporation loses all of its savings and it's not
making a profit then it's dead and then of course
anyone who depends upon that Corporation to pay for child
care and so forth they're also dead you get this
and corporations are always competing with each other in a
global Marketplace it's actually very difficult to start a business
and to sustain that business for decade after decade after
decade most businesses go out of business because it's so
hard to survive as a corporation even even giant corporations
like General Motors or General Electric or you might even
take a corporation like Amazon you might think well Leo
Amazon you know Amazon is making so many billions of
dollars it's it's the best of its kind at what
it does you know online retail it's corner of the
market it's a monopoly effectively it has over 50 of
all internet sales and so forth and therefore and it's
making billions of dollars and therefore it has nothing to
worry about but the reality the reality this is just
the reality is that if the managers and Executives of
Amazon stopped worrying every single night about the survival of
Amazon after 20 to 50 years Amazon would die it
would be out-competed by somebody else that's the reality so
the executives and managers of Amazon are staying up late
every single night they're not able to sleep every single
night because they're so afraid of somebody stealing their business
that's the reality of a giant Corporation it's not so
easy these giant corporations go out of business all the
time they get sued for billions of dollars all the
time a recession could come along and could wipe out
entire businesses you know covet came lots of businesses were
killed by covid why because they didn't have enough reserves
they didn't have enough profit margins they weren't thinking far
enough ahead and then they had to get subsidies from
the government the entire airline industry was basically nearly not
knocked out and killed if not for government subsidies probably
all the airlines would be out of business by now
thanks to covet why is that because business is extremely
difficult remember business is not just business business is not
just making a bunch of money so you can drive
a Lamborghini business is about survival never forget that so
making profit off employees yeah that's absolutely necessary now Richard
Wolff could counter argue and say well but Leo companies
make way too much profit of off employees and here
I would agree that sometimes they do but who's to
say when they are making too much you see how
relative and subjective this is who's to say what's too
much of a profit that's not easy to say and
if the company should ever go out of business then
actually that's proof that they weren't making enough profit off
their employees and you know that's also possible one of
the things that Richard Wolff does not admit is this
is that a lot of companies they see because you
see when you're an employee at a company they they
your paycheck is guaranteed pretty much no matter whether the
project you're working on succeeds or doesn't you're going to
get your money but that's not the case for the
company as a whole it's very often the case that
a company will hire an employee the employee will work
on them on some project for five years the project
will fail the company will lose a bunch of money
but the employees still come out ahead with profit so
what is that worth to you that guarantee of a
paycheck that's worth something to the employee that justifies the
employer taking a profit off the top and even an
excessive profit off the top of your wage because the
reality is is that there's no guarantee like for example
when Elon Musk starts SpaceX to launch rockets he has
to pay I think his investment in SpaceX was like
a hundred million just to get it off the ground
for that first hundred million dollars they were not even
able to launch one successful rocket that's how much investment
it took just to create the first successful rocket and
you know if they can't launch even one successful rocket
that means they can't get a single client if they
can't get a single client the company is dead but
the employees who are working on those rockets for like
the first five or ten years before they launched the
first successful one those employees they all had to they
all had to get a guaranteed paycheck Elon Musk you
know whatever [ __ ] he is you know whatever
your opinions about him might be I don't have a
very high opinion of his political positions or you know
sometimes he's the troll online or something like that but
but here's one thing you can't fault Elon Musk for
is that all the employees who worked under him in
SpaceX they all got their paycheck and they were all
able to feed their children I'm I'm sure there were
some exceptions but for the most part like 99 of
his employees they got paid and they were able to
feed their children that's not a small thing that's a
huge thing don't take that for granted that's not guaranteed
it didn't have to happen that way he mismanaged that
company they would not have launched that first rocket and
uh they would have gone out of business they almost
went out of business they were so close to going
out of business that the last rocket they launched before
they launched the successful one if it failed that's it
that would have been the end and all of the
employees would have been fired and that's why nowadays Elon
Musk takes a huge profit off the top of all
of his employees wages is because he risked a hundred
million dollars of his own money to to gamble on
this working out and it just so happened that it
did but it easily might not have and in fact
most businesses who try to do this they fail and
they lose their money but when the business loses its
money the employees don't lose anything for the most part
they could lose their jobs but for the most part
they get their paychecks occasionally they don't get paid but
that's technically illegal so keep that in mind a lot
of the problem is that guys like Richard Wolff and
other markets and socialists they don't acknowledge that Capital itself
has enormous value capital investment takes serious risk and basically
it's not possible to create anything of deep value in
the world without a capital investment and you might say
well yeah Leo but that's just the capitalist system no
no no no the requirement of capital to create amazing
products is not a product of capitalism as a system
it's way more fundamental than that before there was capitalism
as a system Capital was still required to create great
things for example let's say we have uh two people
living in the forest uh one person is kind of
lazy and only works 20 hours a day the other
person is really ambitious and hardworking and works 80 hours
a day then you know 10 years goes by the
first person in those 10 years working 20 hours a
day kind of being lazy about it and not being
very intelligent either right because it's not just how hard
you work it's also how smart you work he's not
very smart so he works in a kind of a
piss-poor way and he's able to build a little Shack
for himself that's his capital that's all the value he
has that's his whole life savings his little Shack the
other guy who was working way harder and way smarter
managing a whole group of people he was able to
build like a whole you know castle for himself in
the same amount of time now the guy who built
a shack might look at the guy with the castle
and say well but that's not fair how come that
guy has a castle and I only have a shack
but in this case the situation is perfectly Fair there
was no capitalist system that prevented you from building a
castle you just didn't work as hard and as smart
as the other guy now here's a further point though
for the wrinkle let's say that that now both of
these guys want to start some new project some new
kind of like you know business venture we might say
to create something good for the world let's say they
want to build let's say they want to build um
a temple a religious Temple so people could come and
worship let's say they believe in the same God okay
can you see though that the guy with the castle
is in a much better position to build that Temple
than the guy with the shack because the guy with
the shack his Shack can only hold him and maybe
his his small family of wife and child that's all
his Shack can support whereas the guy with the whole
[ __ ] Castle he can support and pay for
the for the livelihoods of like uh you know a
hundred other people it's a lot easier to build a
temple with 100 people than it is with a wife
and a child in fact it's impossible to build a
temple with three people but it is with a hundred
so this guy who worked much harder he has more
Capital he's developed more Capital that he can actually use
to create new projects and that is extremely powerful and
valuable and the problem is that people like Richard wolf
will dismiss the value of that and yet in reality
to create new businesses new products new technologies you need
a buildup of capital and now of course the question
is where does that Capital come from I mean nowadays
most Capital does not come from you just working really
hard most Capital comes from getting loans from Banks so
in that sense that's correct but you have to understand
where did Capital originally come from all capital originally came
from Human labor someone had to build it someone had
to create it and people don't work at the same
rates and they don't work with the same intelligence some
people are way more productive than others therefore they generate
a lot more Capital also some people it's also a
question of how do you manage your Capital because look
if you have two people who are equally hard working
equally smart working let's say this guy builds a castle
and this guy builds a castle now they have equal
Capital they can go build the temple but let's say
this guy is a gambler and a drunk and he
wastes his capital on um you know on prostitutes and
Lamborghinis and other things and this guy is very responsible
and he saves all his capital in fact he makes
very wise Investments he makes investments into other kinds of
businesses you know because he's got a a Savvy business
mind he knows which kind of businesses are going to
be good and this guy here he doesn't he invests
in all the wrong businesses well you know 10 years
later what happens this guy is broke he has no
more capital and this guy has 10 times more Capital
than he started with that's not a mistake that's exactly
how it should be the problem with marxists and socialists
is that they tend to say they tend to like
treat this as some kind of mistake this inequality is
not a mistake the guy who's a gambler and a
drunk and makes all wrong Investments he should lose all
of his capital and there's a lot of value created
by using your Capital responsibly and if you actually try
to go do some investing yourself in the stock market
or in some businesses you'll notice how difficult it is
most investments in businesses they fail the way Venture capitalism
works is that you invest in a hundred businesses 95
percent of them fail five percent of them succeed and
you hope that those five that do succeed end up
making more money than all those 95 that went out
of business that's venture capital for you and knowing how
to pick the right businesses this is not easy knowing
how to make good Investments with your Capital very difficult
most people are piss-poor investors they will invest their money
into some stupid crap coin Bitcoin [ __ ] that
loses all its value it takes a lot of intelligence
to know how to invest resources allocate resources in the
right ways that actually generate jobs and Technology and success
for people not just for yourself but for others around
you see this is not just about personally making money
for yourself because when you make wise Investments this doesn't
just help you it helps Society it helps other people
get jobs it helps mothers to pay for their child's
health care so you need to appreciate that boss's executive
Executives capitalists and investors these are not just greedy evil
people they assume a lot of risk and responsibility as
leaders and it's way harder to do their jobs than
you think now are they sometimes corrupt yes do they
sometimes exploit their employees definitely do they sometimes do evil
things like pollute the environment and cause Wars and things
like this yes definitely and those all need to be
addressed um but still what I see is generally that
most marxists and socialists do not appreciate the difficulty of
being a great business leader and the kind of responsibility
that comes with that and therefore the kind of rewards
that are necessary you know to compensate people for that
still this is not a justification for earning excessive amounts
of profit we should think about maybe capping how much
you can earn or um you know adjusting our tax
system and so forth these are all fair game need
to be considered um but just like be careful under
your socialist Marxist system you just got to ask yourself
how are you going to determine who's earning how much
is there going to be some human that determines this
who gets to determine this if the Market's not determining
it because because you think the Market's unfair okay fine
so the market won't be determining the salaries who will
be who gets to determine what's a healthy um Fair
salary for a Starbucks barista versus a Starbucks CEO how
many times more should a Starbucks CEO earn than the
Starbucks Barista 10 times 100 times what are you going
to say is fair versus unfair and how are you
going to create a consensus of the around this across
the entire economy for every type of job how are
you going to get everybody to agree with you is
that even possible um I also notice a lot of
demonization just outright demonization and smearing of capitalism and capitalists
and people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Mark
Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and so forth um you have
to be careful about that and I'm not saying these
are good people some of these people could be scumbags
and [ __ ] and and whatnot but you have
to be careful about demonizing this stuff there's also a
failure to acknowledge that capitalism is the default way that
humans do business they might say technically capitalism hasn't existed
for very long it's only exists for a couple hundred
years you know the modern banking system is basically what
defines modern capitalism but actually cap there's something within capitalism
that's much more fundamental than that um which is again
if we go back to a simple kind of like
two people living in the forest which is a kind
of silly example because humans never lived in the forest
just in groups of two we've always lived in large
tribes um which ironically were very socialistic but anyways or
communistic but anyways um if you just kind of take
a look at a tribe of people or two tribes
of people of 100 people living near each other you
know let's say they're on friendly terms they trade with
each other which is basically capitalism you don't have modern
Banks and you don't have modern governments and you don't
have modern economic systems and so forth you might not
even have cash or coin yet but in this system
still the spirit of capitalism and Entrepreneurship still exists even
at this most fundamental level at the most fundamental level
when you're a caveman living in the forest um you
can be a very lazy stupid caveman that doesn't generate
a lot or you can be very entrepreneurial caveman where
you go out there you chop down trees you use
those trees to create Lumber you sell that or you
trade that Lumber to other fellow cavemen and help them
to build their their shelters and you build a big
shelter for yourself because you develop a better method for
cutting down this and processing this Lumber you develop a
better saw you pay somebody some other caveman to invent
a better saw for you so that you could saw
your wood better that you need to pay some other
caveman to invent some rope that you can use to
lash the wood together with then you can use those
to build a boat and you can paint some other
caveman to learn how to navigate on that boat and
travel up or Downstream and trade with other cavemen tribes
up or Downstream of you and you know trade them
for their you know you know uh supplies like metal
or chickens or seeds or whatever and then you can
do that and you can you can build a whole
[ __ ] Village one very industrious caveman can organize
and build a whole village in 20 years whereas another
caveman could just sit around Naval gazing and jerking off
and living in a [ __ ] cave those are
the beginnings of capitalism and once that very industrious creative
caveman entrepreneurial caveman starts this little village he can leverage
that Village in the capital he's built and also all
the people he's helped to uplift out of poverty let's
say he can leverage that to um go and build
other powerful technology whereas the guy living in a cave
jerking off all day and smoking weed he has no
capital and no resource should do anything with and this
situation is not unfair this is precisely how it should
be this is fairness this is perfectly Fair speaking of
demonization there's a lot of demonization of Corporations not seeing
that corporations actually do a lot of good now of
course there's the the evils of corporations are so obvious
that they almost don't need to be said but um
a lot of what's overlooked when you're demonizing corporations is
all the good that they do also progressives and liberals
tend to not see that corporations are like living organisms
and they actually do act like agents and like people
that doesn't mean that a corporation should have as much
like you know moral worth as a person I'm not
equating a corporation with a person but um a corporation
is also not just some abstract legal entity a corporation
is something way beyond that a corporation is like a
a hyper organism and it functions as such and if
you don't respect that you're not gonna have a good
understanding of how to manage these corporations also realize that
these corporations meet the survival needs of many employees working
under them and also they satisfy many customers with the
services that they need so for example you can sit
around all day and [ __ ] on companies like
Comcast Comcast one of those companies that people love to
[ __ ] on because you know they charge extra
hidden fees on their internet service and their internet service
might not be so reliable or whatever but the bottom
line is that you still do business with Comcast because
Comcast fundamentally still provides you with a really good service
Comcast you know with some exceptions for the most part
Comcast gives you a broadband internet connection that connects you
to all the favorite stuff you love on the internet
now you might hate Comcast because they charge you too
much and some hidden fees and they do some evil
stuff here and there but fundamentally you love the internet
service that Comcast gives you and if you had a
choice between Comcast and nothing you would you would pay
five times more than you're currently paying just to get
Comcast if there was no other alternative you would gladly
pay a thousand dollars a month for Comcast if there
was no other alternative that's the reality of it which
shows you how much value Comcast is adding to your
life even though they might be [ __ ] in
other ways so be careful jumping on this bandwagon of
groupthink that just demonizes corporations yes the reality of business
is that there's a lot of collateral damage that business
does in fact it's impossible to survive without creating a
trail of collateral damage this is true of every organism
and it's true of course of every business every business
causes pollution waste and other sort of externalities now we
need to have better methods and laws and regulations for
how to deal with these externalities however um you have
to be much more mature and adult about how these
externalities work the fact that there are always going to
be some degree of externalities you can't survive otherwise and
the way that you survive and the way that you
do business also causes externalities you have to realize that
it's not just the giant oil companies and the defense
contractors that have externalities you do too your business your
life for example if you're a YouTuber on YouTube making
videos and he went so well Lee I don't have
any externalities my business doesn't have any externalities yes it
does you know how many children get abused because of
the internet you're part of that whole ecosystem as a
YouTuber for example you create content for YouTube that content
attracts many people to YouTube and of course many children
and then these children they will get groomed abused sexually
financially and in many other ways through the internet and
it might have been your content that attracted those people
there in the first place maybe you didn't personally abuse
these children but you lured them in you were part
of the ecosystem but see you don't take any responsibility
for that the simple reality is it's very hard to
do any kind of business or invent any kind of
powerful new technology without some serious externalities as great as
the internet is as a technology there's a lot of
ugly stuff on the internet that's very very toxic and
harmful that's like an externality of the internet that's true
of almost every technology so as long as you want
to live in a society that creates new technologies all
the time and we are all addicted to new technology
new gadgets phones computers games all this kind of stuff
cars right all of this will come with externalities so
it's just a question of how to manage them don't
demonize businesses for externalities another important point that progressives and
liberals tend to make or to overlook is that they
don't acknowledge that there's no such thing as rights you
don't have a right to free health care you don't
have a right to Free Shelter you don't have a
right to food you don't have a right to exist
there is no right in the universe for existence let
alone for happiness now in certain more developed countries like
in the Scandinavian countries maybe in Canada and elsewhere um
they've been developing more of this sort of idea of
of you know right you have a right to Health
Care you have a right to shelter you have to
understand that these are we might call these virtual rights
or pseudo rights they're not really rights they're pseudo rights
they're invented and they can only exist as long as
our society is able to sustain it and pay for
it somehow a lot of progressives get too entitled uh
about things like free health care shelter food and so
forth that these should just be standard across the board
for everybody you know sort of the progressive Utopia is
this you know you're born and you're guaranteed health care
you're guaranteed shelter you're guaranteed food you're guarantee a stable
family you're guaranteed a good education and you're even guaranteed
University and that kind of like sets you up that
creates the Baseline everybody gets that everybody is on the
same equal field and then beyond that if if you
want to work a little bit harder or if you
want to excel a little bit more then you can
you know you can earn more but fundamentally we all
have that Baseline and that should that's like the just
that would be the just Society that's good I I
like that idea personally to me that sounds great but
you have to ask yourself what is it really going
to take to create that because that ain't guaranteed anywhere
in nature creating that required the struggle War genocide and
suffering and slavery of people for over ten thousand years
and we still have not reached a point where we
have created that consistently in any country that shows you
how difficult that is now maybe one day we can
create that and I think it's a it's a laudable
goal to work to create that but also I'm not
naive enough to think that we should already have that
or that we can create that in the next 50
years it might take a little bit more than that
it may it might take more patience in general what
I see is that progressives are not very patient when
it comes to this they act as though this should
already be in place it's like Leo America is the
richest country in the history of the world we should
already have this we can afford this Maybe how do
you know Maybe Maybe but maybe not it's not so
obvious I mean if you just do the pure math
can we technically afford it yes if we restructure our
entire Society and we equalize and redistribute resources in radical
ways yes we can afford it but what you're not
considering is that in the process of restructuring Society to
make all this affordable and work that in that process
you have to change society and business and culture and
regulations and Taxation in such radical ways that the majority
of people are going to be so upset by this
and so shocked and terrified by this that they're going
to revolt against you and kick you out of office
or even kill you because you're [ __ ] with
people's livelihoods here you're [ __ ] with their culture
you're [ __ ] with their norms and standards the
way they've been taught reality works and how things should
be distributed people have an innate sense of fairness you
know when you go to people and you start taxing
them in excessive ways or in sort of unequal ways
when one person in society is getting taxed ten percent
another person's side is getting taxed 90 this is going
to create tension animosity hostility you see now I'm not
saying that we can't change these things gradually over time
but that's gradually over time and progressives they generally don't
like this idea of anything gradual over time they want
everything to have been already done yesterday how about you
work towards socialism and your time Horizon is the next
300 years so you're a socialist but 300 years from
now we'll have socialism and we're working towards it slowly
how about that it's like no see no socialist accepts
that you want it done tomorrow but that assumes that
Society can change at that rate what if it can't
what if there is a maximum rate at which culture
can change and if you go beyond that rate you
actually end up creating a self-sabotaging situation because the human
mind needs to be reprogrammed when you're talking about changing
culture you're talking about reprogramming people's minds but changing someone's
mind is difficult it doesn't happen overnight it happens over
Generations generations of people have to die of natural causes
before their minds can change sufficiently enough to allow for
a new type of culture which that enables things like
trans rights gay rights women's rights feminism socialism environmentalism and
other sorts of things like this veganism for you vegans
the reality for most humans on this planet is that
they don't have the material luxury of being vegans the
reality for most humans is that they have to wake
up every morning and go to grind and work doing
manual labor which requires a lot of calories which you
simply can't get enough of from eating carrots and lettuce
and things like this that's not to say veganism is
bad it's again veganism has sort of a laudable goals
and ideals The Compassion the ethics of veganism all great
but the reality if you're just realistic is that most
humans are not materially wealthy enough to afford a vegan
diet because they wouldn't have enough calories but that's not
the only Factor the other factor is the cultural Factor
most human Cuisine is deeply cultural every part of the
world has its own favorite cuisines people have their own
you know recipes that have been passed down through generations
for the Thanksgiving Day turkey or for the way they
make sushi or for the the way they make their
you know their Peking duck in China or whatever every
culture has their own cuisines all of it has meat
in it because all of our ancestors had to survive
on meat basically um in one form or another well
you know with a few exceptions maybe in in parts
of India and so forth but for the most part
it's all meat eaters um and so there's a lot
of meat in these cultures and so when you talk
about you know transitioning the world to veganism for ethical
purposes and for environmental purposes do you realize that that
this this terrifies 90 of the population why is that
this is why on Fox news they actually run they
run fear-mongering campaigns about how the Democrats want to take
away your hamburgers and this terrifies people because you're talking
about changing their culture right people are used to doing
their fourth of July barbecue with the hamburgers and you
know in Texas they're used to doing their you know
their pork rib barbecue and uh you know those baby
back ribs and then um you know maybe in New
York they're used to Buffalo Wings and in China they're
used to peeking duck and so and so forth and
um and here you come along and you tell them
that they're all gonna eat um you know tofu burgers
this not only terrifies people it also pisses them off
and progressives are not very smart about they're not very
wise about this they don't appreciate this you have to
appreciate that culture requires evolution that's really what we're talking
about here we're talking about cultural evolution if socialism will
exist 300 years from now it will exist because culture
has evolved to that level so the question you should
be asking yourself is how does culture evolve what does
it take to evolve culture I have actually an episode
a really good episode that's all about this it's called
how societies evolve go watch that one it presents a
lot of interesting studies and facts about the evolution of
culture and evolution of human values and human psychology human
morality evolves did you know that most people don't know
that most progressives don't know this one of the mistakes
progressives make is they try to apply today's moral system
which is relatively High evolved two previous generations to which
it does not evolve nor should it evolve for example
when you are judging Thomas Jefferson or George Washington for
being slave owners you're using today's highly evolved moral system
which says that slavery is wrong and you're applying it
to 250 years ago where that system did not exist
it's funny I posted on my forum or on my
blog and my foreign basic guy posted I made a
post about the marvels of ancient Egyptian civilization I said
you know Asian Egyptian civilization is one of the most
remarkable achievements of mankind you know 10 it goes back
10 000 years it's incredible uh I posted this and
then somebody on the Forum um counter posted and kind
of was arguing with me and saying that you know
oh Leo why is Leo um cherishing this ancient Egyptian
civilization when you know weren't the pyramids built by slaves
which actually by the way um latest scientific research suggests
an historical research suggests that the pyramids actually were not
built by slaves but but let's say they were let's
say they were built by slaves um even then it's
like by today's Progressive standards uh I am not even
allowed to appreciate the Egyptian pyramids because they were built
by slave labor so like by today's Progressive standards like
we should destroy the pyramids because slaves built them and
that's you know Politically Incorrect and and awful it's this
kind of nonsense right it's when progressivism goes to this
level that it becomes nonsense you have to really appreciate
that the morality we have today especially the progressive stage
green value system which is where all your morals you
know Progressive morals are coming from this did not exist
50 years ago and before that it didn't exist we
had to invent it and the only way we could
invent It Is by going through all the lower stages
of the Spiral and we had to go through slavery
War genocide gas Chambers um uh nuclear Holocaust and and
torture and many other evil things had to happen to
get you to the point where now you could go
to UC Berkeley and um hang out with other people
smoking weed you know just chilling eating your your you
know your Edibles edible brownies uh tripping balls and stuff
and talking about philosophy and talking about gay rights and
talking about trans rights none of this [ __ ]
could exist 100 years ago appreciate that appreciate how difficult
it was to get to this point to develop all
this stuff another problem with Progressive politics is when progressives
act like deficits don't matter and that we can just
print money and spend money endlessly I've noticed this um
for example with uh you know Sam Cedar the majority
report I actually think Sam Cedar is one of the
most reasonable and wisest Progressive YouTube commentators he's a little
bit more older than other younger commentators he's like in
his 50s he's more mature he's got some very solid
political takes but one of the takes of his that
I like the least is his position where he says
that like oh deficit spending doesn't matter we can just
print money because in the end um you know running
a government his his sort of like positions that running
the government budget is not the same thing as running
your personal family budget because your personal family budget you
can't print more money but the government can print more
money and um you know supposedly there's some economic studies
you could cite that say that you know a little
bit of deficit spending is actually good for for government
and it's actually a net positive and so forth um
I I really don't agree with this I think this
is problematic taking this kind of attitude that because just
because the government can print money that that means that
we don't have to manage our finances very carefully I
think this is very problematic and I I think we're
seeing some of the consequences of that with inflation although
of course there's there's many factors with inflation right now
it's not just the fact that we're printing money um
but um in general what I don't like to see
Within Democrat and Progressive politics is there complete dismissal of
the idea that we need to be careful with our
finances as a as a government as a civilization I
think this is deeply problematic that whole philosophy and attitude
it's way too liberal uh I'm very sympathetic to being
very conservative with money um because I think if you
aren't it can lead into a lot of serious problems
and I think that in the future our economy and
even the dollar itself as a global Reserve currency will
suffer greatly for the flippant and overly liberal manner with
which we treat our finances the amount of debt that
we're racking up is atrocious and it's not Democrats who
are just responsible for this I mean Republicans and conservatives
are of course they're Hypocrites about this you know they're
happy to to go into crazy deficit spending when it
comes to Wars and when it comes to tax cuts
and so forth uh personally my preference is that we
need to have a balanced budget I would like to
see a government which has a balanced budget to the
point where we don't have to worry about ever going
bankrupt as a country or ever defaulting on our loans
these shouldn't even be concerns because even having these as
concerns and having the inflation as a concern even the
idea that maybe next year we're going to have 10
inflation or 20 inflation even that as a fear even
if it never comes about just having that as a
fear in people's minds is already going to um destabilize
the economy create needless worries and instability it's going to
cause people to um you know to not invest as
heavily into their businesses because you don't know what's going
to happen in the next 10 years what if the
dollar you know inflates by by 20 next year that's
a huge problem so uh I think there is there
is validity to fiscal conservativism now do conservatives misuse this
and use it in very kind of like hypocritical ways
yes they do a lot of times what conservatives will
do is they will just say you know in the
name of fiscal conservativism they just won't want to pass
any kind of helpful policies that had that that help
a broad swath of people they just refuse it all
you know all together in the name of like fiscal
conservativism but then when it comes to uh allocating funds
for their pet projects they're all for it that's hypocrisy
I think we need to be fiscally conservative across the
board and I don't really see you know conservatives used
to speak out speak up for that not anymore you
know George W bush and Donald Trump have have gone
into more deficit spending than ever if at least conservatives
could be relied upon to um to balance the budget
and to not waste money on stupid Wars and stupid
tax tax cuts and so forth there would be a
lot more sense in voting conservative but these days almost
no conservative can be relied upon to do that they
can't even do that that was like one of the
most redeeming qualities of a conservative is like yeah let's
say they're homophobic and they're racist and um they're not
very compassionate and they're [ __ ] and they're very
religious like okay we can look over all that as
long as they're fiscally conservative but it's like they're not
they're not fiscally conservative foreign I think Democrats would benefit
from being more fiscally conservative another thing that socialists need
to admit to themselves is that profit motive in the
private sector Spurs competition and innovation unlike government-run bureaucracies and
this is a very positive thing so even though profit
motive can be a toxic form of motivation it can
definitely go too far and become way too toxic like
it has on Wall Street for example uh still overall
it's a good thing to have profit motive it's better
than like being stuck in some government-run organization where there
is no profit motive and where ambitious people don't even
want to go to work there because you know ambitious
people do want to experience decent profits maybe not obscene
profits but decent profits like if I'm going to work
hard on my business I want to be able to
see a decent profit from that and I want to
be able to you know buy myself a decent house
if I'm going to work for 10 years to build
a great business and provide a lot of value to
people a lot of amazing content at the end of
those 10 years I want to be able to like
buy myself a decent house if I was working in
a government bureaucracy I couldn't expect that and that means
that the best most ambitious most Innovative and competitive people
don't go into government this is a problem we actually
want our government to be lean efficient and competitive and
innovative and so conservatives do have a legitimate point about
making sure that government doesn't get too bloated now conservatives
go way too overboard with that and they basically criticize
any kind of expansion of government that's a problem the
size of the government itself doesn't matter what matters is
is your government responsive effective efficient creative and high quality
it's the quality of the government that is important not
its size and to have a quality government you need
high quality people to want to enter into the government
how are you going to get high quality people to
get entered into the government when all the best rewards
for creativity and Innovation and ambition lie outside of government
you see so it would be nice if we could
somehow tune the government bureaucracies in such a way that
they would reflect better the reward incentives of business but
we have to be very careful about that because we
don't want to turn government into just people doing things
purely for profit that would also be a problem so
it's a very delicate Balancing Act to get that one
right but um profit motive is a good motivating factor
for organizing a society we want to create our society
such that people who rise towards the top of the
hierarchy if we're gonna have a hierarchy which we have
to some degree the people who are going to be
towards the top we want to make sure that those
are the most intelligent the most hard-working the most creative
people and they are well compensated but not to the
point where it becomes so outrageously corrupt that they can
use that profit to undermine the entire system which is
what we have now with all the money and lobbying
that goes on in politics another problem I see with
progressives is not acknowledging that democratically run corporations or co-ops
can be problematic and uncompetitive so people like Richard Wolff
who's a Marxist uh basically he talks about you know
democracy at the workplace why can't we have more democracy
at the workplace where the employees get to determine what
the next project is we're going to be working on
and where the employees determine how much money everybody gets
and they get to determine how much vacation we take
and they get to determine all these things democracy at
the workplace in general I like that idea that's a
good idea but you also have to wonder is a
corporation that is structured in this way going to be
as successful and competitive as the traditionally more hierarchical top-down
organizations and corporations immediately obvious to me that it will
be because like I said before if you assume that
the majority of your employees are really hard-working intelligent and
creative then yeah you can create a Cooperative structure with
a flat hierarchy and it can work well however I
think that's a false assumption I think the majority of
employees are actually deadbeats they don't work really hard they're
lazy they're not creative they're not interested in going to
work and being very passionate and ambitious they're just there
for a paycheck that's the majority of employees now I
ask you why should such employees get to have a
democratic say in the big picture vision and plans for
that Corporation what happens when you take those unintelligent lazy
unambitious employees and you ask them to help formulate the
vision for your company you might say that's going to
be a good thing because you know those employees that
they will ask for better benefits more pay they will
ask for more vacation time a four hour work week
or I mean a four day work week and and
this kind of stuff but you know what those employees
will end up shooting themselves in the foot because if
you create a corporation like that which gives a bunch
of vacation days and a four day work week and
it's not very ambitious it doesn't put a lot of
pressure on people to work and innovate hard what happens
is that that Co-op it'll be Democratic and great for
a while but eventually it'll get out competed by other
businesses which are much more bloodthirsty and harder working work
twice as hard twice as smart because they're run by
management who is very very ambitious rather than a bunch
of lazy employees who just want to go home and
smoke weed another problem with progressives is not acknowledging that
tax cuts are not equivalent to tax hikes so sometimes
you know progressives will frame things in such a way
that a tax cut like let's say a tax cut
you know let's take the Trump tax cuts Trump's tax
cuts created a huge deficit uh in the budget but
it's a little bit unfair to characterize that way because
tax cuts do give money back to you that you
yourself generated see there's an asymmetry between doing a tax
hike versus a tax cut because the tax hike is
taking money away from you that you generated whereas a
tax cut gives you that money back so these are
not quite symmetrical even though I do believe in a
progressive tax system I think progressives are a little bit
too sloppy about how they treat taxes that they treat
taxes in a way where you're not quite respecting the
fact that the money that you're taxing that this is
labor fundamentally you're basically taxing the labor of somebody and
um when you do that you have to have a
good justification for it and then when you do a
tax cut that's that should be easier to justify because
um you're just basically giving back the person the labor
that they that they did for that year it's a
small minor Point not a very big point but anyways
um here's another one when it comes to taxes uh
progressives had not acknowledged that tax hikes cause Capital flight
and your system must be competitive with neighboring systems because
you're not gonna have a monopoly on your system so
for example actually in the United States this is this
is a there's a great real life example of this
which is like um state income taxes every state in
the country 50 States has their own income tax rate
California is on the higher end and for example Nevada
where I live has zero income tax rate Texas Nevada
uh Washington's Florida they have zero state income tax uh
the problem is that a state like California or New
York if they have high taxes they're going to start
losing people companies and people are going to move out
of California in New York to those places where there's
zero taxes or very low taxes and that's been happening
lately um but likewise the same situation can happen with
your country for example if American taxes become way way
high then you're going to see a capital flight people
will be moving out of America to live other places
in the world companies will be started not in America
but other places in the world now I don't think
we're really at a serious risk of that right now
I think we could raise our corporate taxes significantly in
America and companies would still stay here and new companies
will still be founded here but there is a limit
and every time you can raise the taxes by another
10 you're going to be causing and incentivizing more and
more people to move abroad or move to a different
state or to start a company in a different place
and eventually that's gonna you know end up partying the
country so sometimes I see that progressives aren't um aren't
aren't sensitive to this topic but again it's all a
matter of degree I think we can still raise taxes
significantly and avoid this problem but you do have to
keep it in mind uh I think that progress I
mean conservatives have a legitimate point in wanting to keep
bureaucracy lean and efficient and to eliminate too much regulation
and too much red tape there is a legitimate function
to that now conservatives grossly abuse this and they are
just completely anti-regulation or they want to eliminate important regulations
there is an important function for regulation so I'm not
anti-regulation at all but we do need a mechanism for
reevaluating regulations periodically and eliminating those regulations which become um
outdated or unnecessary or just make business and Life to
cumbersome because that does eat into the economy and the
efficiency of starting new businesses and doing certain you know
Technologies and so forth but we still need a lot
of regulations on you know pollution on gas Emissions on
oil drilling we need a lot of regulations but also
we need a mechanism for removing regulations too um liberals
and leftists can falter on this issue of globalization in
fact this has been a real source of fuel for
the right wing recently in the last 10 years with
Trump and so forth is that the excessive globalization that
has ha that has happened in the last let's say
20 to 30 years especially in America has led to
a lot of Outsourcing of jobs and Manufacturing and factories
and so forth to the point where um a lot
of the middle class has been gutted and lost their
jobs and then this leads to a lot of destabilization
of society and resentment and honestly it leads to a
fuel and fodder for fascist movements which is what's been
happening with Maga so um globalization cannot be taken lightly
globalization is is a force that is happening you can't
stop it you can't put the toothpaste back in the
tube Outsourcing is going to happen on the other hand
there needs to also be an appreciation for the role
of nationalism national identity and sort of a protectionism protecting
national interests I think that liberals leftists progressives have been
somewhat a little bit too flippant and um negligent in
this area and um that's why Trump's message of America
First has been so appealing to many is because sometimes
what happens is that leftists kind of like take a
globalist perspective to the point where they stop putting their
country first and of course ultimately that's a good thing
you don't want to put your country first um you
want to put the whole globe first but if you
put the whole globe first ahead of your own country
what's going to happen is that the um the majority
of your people are nationalists the majority of your citizens
citizens are nationalistic they're not globalists and so what's going
to happen is that eventually they're going to get so
pissed off at you they're going to think that you're
betraying them and they're gonna um they're gonna turn on
you and kick you out of office and start a
nationalist government and they're going to basically go fascist on
you which is exactly what's been happening and part of
that is because there's been some excessive uh globalization happening
through the 90s and 2000s now of course some there
are progressives who are very Pro defending um you know
national interests like for example um Bernie Sanders you know
Bernie Sanders will talk about the excess of globalization he
will talk about the need to um create manufacturing jobs
at home and this kind of stuff and that's why
he's very appealing a lot of trump supporters actually appreciate
Bernie Sanders um because of that um but there are
leftists who also go too far with the globalization and
they fundamentally there's a failure to appreciate the role of
nationalism nationalism is seen as just a purely negative thing
actually nationalism is not a purely negative thing nationalism is
a necessary stage of development within civilization you have civilizations
start with just tribalism then they evolve into nationalism then
beyond nationalism it evolves to globalism and all those are
important stages they all need to be balanced out together
um if you have globalism at the expense of nationalism
this becomes a problem because in the end uh most
of the citizens in your country have a national identity
right and this national identity should not be taken for
granted has to be created nobody is born with a
national identity and in fact the majority of the national
identities that exist today they didn't exist a couple hundred
years ago most nations are very modern Nations America is
300 years old uh Italy is like 100 years old
Germany is like 100 or 200 years old these are
these are these countries you think these countries have existed
for thousands of years no um you know what we
see with Iraq for example just creating an Iraqi national
identity this has proven way more difficult than anybody thought
because in Iraq in the Middle East these people are
not involved enough to have an Iraqi identity what they
have is they have a Sunni or a Shiite Identity
or a Kurdish Identity or you know some local little
tribe that you've never even heard of they have very
tribal identities so the way human civilizations evolve is that
first you have Tribal identities then a lot of conflict
and evolution has to happen in order to unify all
those tribal identities into one national identity this usually requires
a lot of war and killing and raping and slavery
and genocide to create just to create a national identity
like an Iraqi identity then once you get the Iraqi
money going that's good but the problem with that is
that it can this nationalism can go overboard it can
turn into Nazism basically this is when nationalism goes too
far it turns into a sort of Nazism um but
that doesn't mean nationalism is bad it just needs to
be moderated then you evolve past nationalism and now you
develop a world perspective now you start to see yourself
not as an American or as an Iraqi or as
a German or as a Jew now you see yourself
as a global citizen as a human but just because
now you see yourself as a human that doesn't also
still mean that you're not an American or an Iraqi
you still are you still are a German you still
are a Jew too and you have Jewish interests or
you have Israeli interests or you have American interests so
balancing all this is very very tricky and uh as
a progressive you will tend to overlook the importance of
nationalism because you'll demonize it as just fascism or Nazism
that's not technically correct there's healthy and unhealthy forms of
nationalism another problem I see with progressives that they tend
to generally assume that they can mandate top-down solutions to
complex systemic problems which tends to backfire go see my
episode on systems thinking called intro to systems thinking where
I talk about the trickeries are dealing with complex systems
the challenge with government and politics is that most of
these systems are so [ __ ] complicated that nobody
knows the answers we literally do not know what our
economic system will be 100 years from now we do
not know what the best government system will be 100
years from now will it be Chinese the Chinese system
the American system uh the Middle Eastern system we don't
actually know the only way we learn this is by
actually going through an evolutionary trial and error process of
testing stuff out and seeing what works and what doesn't
work and a lot of times the things we think
will work end up backfiring which is exactly what happened
with Marxism and with socialism and communism in the 20th
century we thought that we could re-engineer our old complex
systems and economy into a Marxist soviet-style you know Communist
economy and what we saw is that a lot of
it backfired and it ended up being even worse than
capitalism foreign but I'll stress again tend to overestimate human
development and what we can realistically sustain there's also a
failure to understand why progressives lose elections I see this
common mistake amongst Progressive political commentators is that they tend
to they keep saying that you know the majority of
of the citizenry is Progressive because they agree with Progressive
policies for example if you go and you pull to
people and you ask them are you for or against
weed legalization they will say that they're for it are
you for or against uh taxing the rich they will
say they're for it are you for or against some
you know foreign war and they'll say we're against it
and so in this sense like you go down the
list and um you know are you for or against
free health care and they'll say they're they're for it
um this gives you a false perspective though because if
you pull that way purely on policy what you see
is that holy [ __ ] the majority of the
country is Progressive but that doesn't square with how elections
are run because the majority of the country seems Progressive
but then elections why why are there so few uh
progressives winning elections why didn't Bernie Sanders win the election
and then progressives will make up stories that like oh
well Bernie Sanders it was stolen from him no it
wasn't stolen from him the reason Bernie Sanders didn't win
an election his his nomination to you know to the
presidency and so forth is uh is simply because uh
progressives are in the minority but how can that be
if most people are for lead weed legalization free health
care and anti-war and um you know protaxing the rich
how come they're not progressives how come most people are
conservatives or moderates progressives don't understand this point because what
you have to understand about people's political identifications is that
it's not based on policy see you are a [
__ ] policy wonk I'm talking to you uh Kyle
Kolinski you're a policy wonk you think of politics in
terms of policy and most of us who follow politics
seriously and were progressives we are policy wonks and we
care about the policies we care about tax cuts we
care about getting money out of politics we care about
um you know stopping corruption and stopping lobbying we care
about legalization of certain drugs and these kinds of prison
reform and this kind of like we care about these
things ninety percent of people who go vote they don't
vote based on policy they vote based on their feelings
and who they identify with and they vote based on
their spiral stage of development and their moral stage of
development and their ego stage of development so it's very
simple a spiral Dynamic stage blue person is going to
go vote for the most spiral Dynamic stage blue politician
in a spiral Dynamic stage orange person is going to
go vote for the most spiral Dynamics looking stage orange
politician and it's by the name of stage green person
is going to go vote for a stage green politician
that's it it's as simple as that and your policies
don't matter so even though if you ask policy by
policy in a poll many people will support Progressive legislation
you're failing to appreciate the importance that culture plays in
how people vote so even though many people would say
that yeah we should legalize weed and we should tax
the rich when it comes to but who are you
going to vote for I'm a capitalist and I'm gonna
I I'm an American you know I'm a good old-fashioned
American and uh I want America first and so I
go and vote for Trump even though Trump is not
gonna do any of these things for me but Trump
says America First and he presents the image of loving
America and being a patriot and you know grilling burgers
on the fourth of July and eating my barbecue ribs
and driving my my pickup truck that's who I'm gonna
vote for I'm gonna vote for who I like who
represents my values not my policies and based on this
the progressives are losing the progressives are losing the culture
War because the progressives have some some outlandish and wacky
cultural ideas and basically the progressive ideas are like a
new culture that hasn't even materialized yet progressives are building
a new culture the culture that will exist 100 years
from now but people today are attached to today's culture
and to last Generations culture they don't care about what
culture will will be like 100 years from now they're
not that forward-thinking and progressives get this wrong because uh
progressives think that everybody is as Forward Thinking as they
are no people vote selfishly they're very myopic and they're
not thinking about where should human rights be 50 years
from now no they're just defending the culture they grew
up with it's just as simple as that people aren't
as smart as you think they are progressives don't appreciate
that most people are simply not educated or wealthy enough
to be stage green that's it it's just as simple
as that if you want to end racism and homophobia
and Fascism and transphobia the most reliable way to do
that is to shower people with a lot of money
make them economically successful and put them through education and
I don't mean indoctrination just educate them well give them
the opportunity to go to a nice four-year University and
get an engineering degree or whatever I don't mean some
gender studies degree I mean just an old old school
simple degree non-political educate them and give them the money
to educate themselves into want that kind of Education and
then you'll see that these people become stage green don't
Badger them about being racist and not being fascists and
call them names and stuff like that and argue and
debate with them fundamentally it's about meeting their material needs
meet people's material needs help them meet their material needs
and then they will naturally evolve in their morality and
in their culture they will become more Multicultural they will
become more Cosmopolitan they will become more open to globalism
they will become more open to gay rights and trans
rights progressives because they grew up relatively privileged you know
speaking of privilege yeah progressives love to talk about recognizing
Your Privilege but funnily enough progressives themselves don't appreciate the
privilege of growing up in a first world democracy in
an urban area with relative material wealth that allowed them
to become progressives this is a privilege for the majority
life is brutally difficult for many people living in the
countryside life is a lot harder it's a lot simpler
than it is for you living in an urban environment
where your food is taken care of your policing is
taken care of your fire department's taken care of all
this [ __ ] is taken care of in the
countryside you have to do more of these things yourself
it's a lot more challenging you gotta provide your own
security because there's no police around you got to be
able to put out your own fires because there's no
fire department around you got to be able to hunt
you got to be able to cook you got to
be able to just like live a simple life and
it's very challenging so a lot of progressives are out
of touch with blue collar workers and Rural people and
especially the way that the electoral system is structured in
America rural people even though there's less of them they
have more power just by the structure of our system
and that's why conservatives tend to win a lot more
elections in America than they really should because they are
outnumbered by Urban people but uh just yeah the structure
of the system is such that uh every rural person
has more of a vote than every Urban person now
maybe we've got to change that but that's the system
we have and also the cultural issues they care about
are supremely important you can't win over these rural people
through policies because see the progressive here would argue with
me now and say Leo but you know you say
we're out of touch with the blue collar people and
you say were for like globalization stuff like that but
no Leo you know like uh I'm a progressive populist
I want to help and you know as a socialist
I want to help these rural people I want to
help Blue Collar people you know I wanna I wanna
make sure that those those blue-collar people these rural people
who are working these you know manual labor jobs I
want to make sure they get paid better and that
they don't get exploited by capitalists and so forth so
Leo I'm on their side with my policies this is
where you're being stupid yeah you're on their side with
your policies but you're not on their side culturally and
that's what trumps everything it doesn't matter that your socialism
promises these rural blue-collar people that they're going to have
more negotiating power against their capitalist employer that doesn't matter
as long as culturally you're presenting the veneer and smell
of all the lgbtq sjw snowflake vegan hippie weed smoking
type of vibe people are voting for you based on
Vibe people are aligning with your politics based on Vibe
the vibe they get from you not what your policies
will technically do for them that's the irony of it
here you know people wonder somehow sometimes progressives Wonder like
how could these how could these rural um you know
blue-collar Mega people vote against their interests because Trump comes
into power and then he passes tax cuts for the
rich so don't they see that Trump is actually passing
policies against their own interests of course that's what Trump
is doing but these people cannot see it because they're
operating based on culture and vibe what they like about
Trump is not his policies they don't know what his
policies are they don't care they're too dumb to care
they just feel his vibe he presents them with that
old-schooled old-fashioned good old red blooded American vibe grilling burgers
on the 4th of July while shooting your gun that
kind of vibe whereas someone like an Elizabeth Warren or
a Bernie Sanders or whatever gives him the kind of
like Vibe of a pot smoking elitist nagging bitching um
uh you know Urban college professor Vibe talking down to
them that's it that's as far as this goes it
doesn't matter whether Elizabeth Warren is going to actually uh
pass some legislation it's going to earn them a little
bit more money past the minimum wage that'll help them
or something it doesn't [ __ ] matter they're voting
on vibe whether somebody likes you or not it's based
mostly on vibe and values alignment also what progressives fail
to appreciate is how much people fear change growth and
evolution like seriously sit down and really think about this
people are scared to death change growth and evolution and
that's why they resist and that's why they demonize and
straw man the other side look at our civilization I
don't just mean American government I mean look at the
human civilization the history of human civilization has been what
it's been the history of never-ending growth change and evolution
resisted all the way through it's like we've been pulling
a stubborn mule uphill and the mule doesn't want to
go but we're we're pulling him with all our might
it's like progressives are pulling this [ __ ] mule
uphill and this mule uh is kicking and screaming and
eating and Hauling and biting that has been the last
10 000 years of human evolution and that's exactly what's
happening today with progressives and with conservatives so really if
you want to help Society evolve and you want to
do conscious politics then you have to be a little
bit wiser about how to navigate and manage this mule
this mule is not a rational creature this mule does
not have a high IQ this mule is not [
__ ] care what promises you may come you could
tell the mule hey you know just follow me up
the hill and up the hill there's going to be
a a giant basket of carrots for you the mule
can't think that far but maybe if you take a
carrot and you wiggle in front of his face and
you let him bite a piece of it now the
mule can understand that that might be enough to get
the mule to take one step forward but then as
you move one step forward he gets scared and he
gets stubborn again and he takes two steps backward that's
what you're dealing with here that's what most people are
like they don't like change they don't like growth they
don't like Evolution they don't like development we're talking about
Social Development but Social Development requires individual development so when
you study your own challenges with your own individual development
notice how difficult it is for you for example to
change your poor watching habits or your junk food eating
habits or your drug taking habits or other kinds of
lazy bad habits your weed smoking habits that you have
um notice how difficult it is for you to evolve
beyond all that watching television being addicted to social media
flipping through the phone non-stop right so you're addicted to
all these things now for you to become a very
developed spiritual human being you'd have to give all that
up or learn to significantly moderate all that change your
relationship to all that change your relationship to sex to
food to drugs to money uh but notice how difficult
that is for you in your own life how difficult
it is for you to change your emotional system right
you're depressed you're anxious you're angry you have these emotional
problems how difficult it is for you to change that
very difficult you backslide you have ego backlashes you resist
you resist learning new information you exist you resist seeing
New Perspectives so all that is happening for you personally
but then you expect Society to just evolve rapidly towards
your ideal you know utopian fantasies of what Society should
be no because you have to get everybody in society
to come along with you for the ride to evolve
together and that is not so easy okay we're going
to take a pause here this episode has run on
way too long um I thought it would go faster
but apparently I have a lot to say so this
was going to be a one-part series but hey now
we're gonna have two parts so this is half I
still have a lot more information to to say so
I guess there's a lot a lot a lot more
wrong with the left than um well I knew all
this but I just didn't know how to uh how
long it would take to articulate it all so anyways
there's gonna be a part two so stick around next
week for part two where we will finish list this
list off and I'll give you a lot more examples
of what's wrong with the left uh clearly you can
see that there's a lot a lot of things wrong
with the left remember just because there's a lot of
stuff on this list does not mean that there's not
a lot of good stuff about the left there is
and also it does not mean that the list of
all the stuff wrong with the right is not bigger
than this list it actually is I could make a
four-part series about all the [ __ ] that's wrong
with the with the right but you know I've actually
already covered many of those topics in the past all
right that's it I'm done here stick around for part
two and um come check out actualize.org that's my website
down you can find the link on the website look
if you like my content and you are not following
my blog you're you're a [ __ ] fool you're
missing out on so much free content that I'm putting
out of my blog I put a lot of effort
and attention into my blog follow that a lot of
resources a lot of videos a lot of insights a
lot of interesting stuff uh some wacky zany kind of
off the off the wall kind of stuff lately um
I'm experimenting with how to express myself more freely and
more authentically so check out that you can also find
me on Instagram I have an Instagram account where I
also express myself very uh authentically maybe a little too
authentically in a raw manner check that out you might
be interested uh check out my book list check out
the life purpose course come to the actualized Forum join
a community of like-minded people we have some interesting discussions
there if you'd like you can support me on patreon.com
actualized and um that is that the final point I'll
end on is this I'm really disappointed with the quality
of our politics you might wonder Leo why are you
talking about politics it seems like it's not has nothing
to do with spirituality because fundamentally to me politics is
about understanding perspectives and that's my forte that's my bread
and butter and that's what all of my spirituality boils
down to is the ability to see radically New Perspectives
and to be very very open-minded so one of the
greatest gifts that I can teach you is how to
be radically open-minded and how to see completely New Perspectives
in ways that you didn't think was possible and so
one of my objectives with this episode in this series
is to help you to see progressivism in a new
light and also to help you to see conservativism in
a new light because progressives do not really see conservatives
they don't really understand the conservative worldview they're too close-minded
and vice versa and so that's just one example of
how we can use the power of epistemology and relativity
and uh um construct awareness right is to realize this
and then we're going to go beyond that way Beyond
politics and we're going to apply this to really deconstruct
all of reality that's what I'm most passionate about is
looking at reality in such radical ways that you can
see that something like physics itself imagine that physics Science
Biology Evolution history imagine that these are just perspectives that
you can see through and you can also see beyond
and then the question is what is beyond those perspectives
what is beyond the human perspective that's where things get
really interesting that's where we get into the Deep spirituality
that I teach but also I want you to see
how this and that are connected together make sure you
stay tuned for part two next week
