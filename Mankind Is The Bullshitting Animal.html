One of the deepest things that motivates me is high
level, big picture understanding. And at this point, I've spent
so much time studying various kinds of models of how
life works, how mankind works, how society works, how consciousness
works in all of this, that I have a lot
of different maps and models. And I've shared many of
those with you like spiral dynamics, for example. But sometimes
it just gets a little bit too complicated. And you
kind of get lost in the, in the weeds in
the minutiae of it in all the details. And sometimes
what we need is we can kind of zoom out,
and just have a nutshell encapsulation of what we're trying
to understand. And in this case, I was really trying
to crack this nut of what is mankind about as
a whole? What's really going on with mankind? How do
we explain what mankind is doing, what society is doing
what most of human life is about. And so I
sat down one day, on my living room floor, just
thinking about this. And then suddenly, it just popped into
my mind as if out of nowhere, a little epiphany.
And it was very profound and very illuminating, and very
explanatory. And what struck me about this insight was that
it was so simple, just like so simple, but its
explanatory power is enormous. And so I want to share
that insight with you here. But before I do, let
me just issue a little disclaimer here. I'm gonna use
the vulgar language. And I might go into a bit
of a rant. And don't get distracted by this. Because
what's being said here is not just a rant, it's
not just me venting, and being vulgar. Something very profound
and powerful is being said here, and actually, you're gonna
have to listen to it several times to fully understand
the profundity of this very simple insight. And the simple
insight is that mankind is basically full of shit. That's
what's really going on everywhere. And this pretty much explains
everything. But we need to elaborate. We need to expand

is full of shit. And all of human history is
full of shit. And you are full of shit. And
of course, I am full of shit. And of course,
anyone who insists that they are not full of shit
is especially full of shit. Now, that's some insight. That's
a profound insight is to see this to understand this.
And to understand how this game of bullshit is played.
This is a very sophisticated game. We're saying something very
precise here. We're not just bad mouthing people in general.
We're saying something very precise. And the trouble with this
game is the way that it's played is like this.
Everyone sees the bullshit of everyone else except the bullshit
that they themselves spin. And then they make exceptions and
excuses for their own bullshit. And it goes something like
this. Leo. Okay. I agree with you. You said a
lot of stuff that I agree with. I agree with
some of the things you said about religion, or some
of the things you said about business people, or about
the insurance industry or about stockbrokers. But Leo this thing
here, my thing, the thing that I like that thing
that's not full of shit. And what I want to
tell you is that thing right there is especially full
of shit. You see, this is how the bullshit game
is played. Everyone denies their own bullshit. In the same
way that it's hard to smell your own farts. And
then we all act surprised when we look around the
world and we see all this chaos, and all this
bullshit floating around out there. Well, why do you think
it's there? Where do you think it came from? It
came from people just like you denying that they're full
of shit. This is not just a mindless rant. This
is a deep explanation of all of human existence. All
of society, all of culture, all of business, all of
religion, all of spirituality, all of science, all of language.
Everything. Everything that Mannheim mankind has created is filled with
bullshit. Have you noticed this? I mean, like, you got
to notice that you got to see it. And it's
easy to see it in certain circumstances. Like, you probably
know that Wall Street's full of shit. You probably know
the doctors are full of shit. And the lawyers are
full of shit and this sort of stuff. But But
do you see like the ubiquity of this, do you
see the larger dynamic? So this should make you start
to think of like, well, why would this be the
case? Why would there be so much bullshit? And why
would it be so omnipresent? And that's because mankind is
the bullshitting animal. That's our forte. That's what we're the
best at out of all the species were the ones
who figured out how to bullshit each other. And upon
this, all of human society is built. The human mind
itself is a bullshit machine. And that's because the ego
is full of shit fundamentally, existentially. And anything that the
ego comes into contact with gets corrupted and turned into
bullshit. And if you notice, corruption is not just something
that happens within politics. Corruption is omnipresent. There is not
a single domain of human endeavor, which is not tainted
with corruption and bullshit. And that's fundamentally what corruption is,
is its egos bullshit in whatever domain. And in fact,
the more important the domain, the greater the amount of
bullshit you will find in that domain. This is like
a general principle of how humans operate. Now, why would
that be the case? Well, maybe there's a correlation and
deep connection between importance and bullshit. And in fact, there
is, because what does importance mean? Really, importance isn't some
absolute standard. A thing or a domain is important, only
to the extent that it serves your survival. That's really
what the word importance means. That means it's important to
your living. If it doesn't affect your life, it ain't
important, by definition. See, and of course, that means that
importance is a relative notion. Because what's important to you
might not be what's important to me, because what helps
me live my life might actually hurt you living yours,
and vice versa. So, the reason we bullshit so much
is because fundamentally, what we're all concerned about is our
own survival. And we will bullshit our way through any
situation, which is fundamental and integral to our survival, the
more impact it has on my survival, the more likely
I am to bullshit about it. Precisely because if I
don't, I have too much to lose. See, this is
the egos game, this is all that the ego cares
about is survival. Survival in all the different ways that
survival happens, that doesn't just mean having a shelter, and
having food and water, it means everything. It means sex,
it means reproduction. It means status. It means celebrity, it
means fame. It means money. It means all of that
all of that is just a function of your survival.
That's why you pursue any of that stuff. That's why
that stuff has any importance to you if it does.
Every human institution is a house of cards glued together
with bullshit. And if you were to stop bullshitting, this
house of cards would collapse. And that would tangibly affect
your survival. Now, it's important you don't misunderstand what I'm
saying here. Very easy to misinterpret what I'm saying here.
I am not saying that you should be cynical and
nihilistic and disillusioned with life. It might sound that way.
Because you hear this and you say, Oh, well, Leo.
So yeah, so I mean, I guess you're right, I
guess everyone is full of shit. And so what am
I going to do about it? I guess I'm I
got nothing to do, but just to be sitting around
and being depressed about it for the rest of my
life. No, that's not what's being said here. All we're
saying here is we're just making an accurate assessment of
mankind's condition. We're not trying to judge it. We're not
trying to say if it's good or bad, we're just
making an accurate observational statement. Mankind is full of shit.
And if you disagree with me, or even if you
want to tend to agree with me, and just to
believe me, because this sounds appealing to you. Actually, what
I would encourage you is I would encourage you to
actually empirically validate this, in your own experience. Don't just
believe what I'm saying. Go out there and check. Check
if what I'm saying is true. Is it true that
courtrooms are full of shit? Go look, is it true
that celebrities are full of shit? Go look, is it
true that scientists are foolish? Go look, go investigate. You
see, this is this is an empirical inquiry. This is
not just a rant. This is not just some philosophy
that I came up with because it sounded interesting to
me. This is something that comes from carefully observing how
people and how institutions work. And it's an important to
see how and why this idea that mankind is full
of shit, how its true in in all of its
details and all the different domains where it applies. Because
we don't want to just paint stuff with a broad
brush, we need to really sit down and double check.
And that's what I did when I came up with
this list as I sat down and I double checked
and asked myself, is it true that advertising is full
of shit? Yes, okay, then it belongs on this list.
Is it true that doctors are full of shit? Absolutely,
than it belongs on this list. And so that's something
I encourage you to do with this list. Listen to
it again. And really think about what's being said here,
don't just nod your head and agree, as if something
minor was being something very major as being said, here.
Right. So appreciate what's being said. Also, don't make the
mistake of thinking that what I'm saying is that everyone
is equally full of shit. I did not say that.
There is a whole spectrum, many degrees of bullshitty that
mankind is capable of some folks are relatively decent on
this scale. And some folks are really terrible. So again,
it would be a big mistake to say that well,
Leo fine, everyone is just full of shit. The problem
is that when you say everyone is just full of
equally full of shit, then you can't really do anything
with that insight. See, it's too crude. It's too simplistic
to black and white. What you need to do is
you need to become a good student of appraising bullshit
in others, and of course in yourself. We'll get to
that in a minute. But a good steward of appraising
bullshit and various degrees of bullshit, because very rarely will
you find a person who is completely free of bullshit.
But you still have to operate in this environment. It
does no good to just be depressed and sit at
home and whine and complain how everyone is full of
shit that does you no good. What you need to
do is you need to develop a very discriminating sort
of radar for, for bullshit. And this will serve you
very well in life, if you're able to do this.
And that means recognizing that not everyone is equally foolish.
Some people are a lot more foolish than others. Also,
don't make this mistake. Don't think that everything I've said
somehow means that you cannot attain truth, goodness, or that
development is hopeless. And that the pursuit of truth and
goodness is hopeless. Not at all. In fact, to pursue
truth, goodness and development. You have to start here, you
have to start by honestly appraising the situation that you
find yourself in, and that mankind finds itself in. And
so that's what we're doing. The number one skill that
you need to be successful in human society is the
ability to create, tolerate and deny bullshit. The people most
full of shit, don't know that they're full of shit.
And this is something that I call aggressive ignorance. It's
not just that people are ignorant. They're aggressively ignorant. They
double down on their ignorance. They're arrogant about their ignorance.
They flaunt their ignorance as if it's the ultimate highest
truth. This is a tool of the devil, of course.
And the way that the devil preserves falsehood, and selfishness,
and ignorance is by being bold about it, the devil
is not meek, the devil will just come out there
and deliver a bold faced lie to you, as if
it were the highest truth without an ounce of regret
or guilt or remorse or second thought or doubt. And
then the devil will defend that ignorant position with aggression
with passion. In fact, the higher the ignorance usually, the
more the aggression, the more the passion because it's a
compensation mechanism. See, in fact, that's what aggressiveness is about.
It's about falsehood, and it's about ignorance. We as a
species These are collectively drowning in our own bullshit. Have
you noticed this? What does this mean? This means that
all of our so called problems, war and genocide and
abuse and drug addiction and problems in the education systems
problems and the political system problems with government problems with
environment, pollution, and all what is all this where Where's
all this coming from? This is us, collectively drowning in
our own bullshit, all of it is coming from bullshit.
Fundamentally, of course, the details can vary as to how
this bullshit gets manifested, you know, the bullshit gets manifested
in the pharmaceutical industry in one way, in the legal
system, and another way, in politics and some other way
in relationships, and another way in family life and another
way, but you got to look past the individual differences
and see the commonalities, right, because we're looking for big,
big picture patterns here, about how the human mind works
and how, as a result, society works. The quality of
your life is going to be inversely proportional to the
degree to which you are full of shit. Which means
that if you want to improve the quality of your
life significantly, then you need to start to take bullshit
very seriously. And of course, here, what we're talking about
is your own bullshit. And so the more you let
go of, the more you uncover and surrender your own
bullshit, the higher quality your life will get. That's a
very general principle of human psychology, and of happiness. So
you might say, this is a law of happiness. And
the reason that most people are so unhappy, so sad,
so depressed and miserable and frustrated, and all this is
because their life is based on a big pile of
bullshit. It's not grounded, and I think true. And so
they're spinning their wheels in this bullshit, and are not
able to get any kind of traction in their life,
and they're stuck. And they're drowning in it. And it's
smelly. But of course, because everyone has become so good
at denying their own bullshit, that they don't even realize
that this is their fundamental problem. Because they've become blind
to their own bullshit. They can't smell it, they can't
see it. They think the problem is out there somewhere
in the world. So is there anyone who's not full
of shit? Actually, there is your cat, your dog. If
you go outside and look at the birds, the ants
crawling on the ground, the trees. Look at them. They're
not full of shit at all. They go about living
their life doing their thing without bullshitting. So really, it's
mankind who is the bullshitting animal. And also, when you
look at these animals, other animals, and plants and so
forth, you start to see that, you know, somehow they're
surviving without being full of shit. Maybe I can take
some lessons from them. Because at least we know, you
know, if my cat can do it, if my dog
can do it, then then maybe I can do it
to maybe I can work towards it. And that's what
I'm telling you. I'm not saying that you're doomed to
be always full of shit forever. That would be a
very hopeless message. Actually, I'm delivering a positive message here.
You're not doomed to be full of shit, so long
as you're honest about how much you bullshit. And then
you decide to actually work to overcome that, then you
can seriously improve your situation. Now, I don't know if
you'll ever be entirely free of bullshit, but you can
certainly make great progress. And the more you do, the
better your life will become. So you might wonder at
this point, well, Lee Okay, so, but what do I
do with this? It seems very abstract and philosophical. Actually,
not at all. Really, what we're saying here is that
you need to become a lot more vigilant about your
own bullshit. Sit down and investigate just how full of
shit you are. And how you point your finger at
everyone else except yourself. How you are in denial about
your own bullshitting in all the different facets of your
life you see you bullshit everywhere you bullshit in your
family, you bullshit in your relationships, you bullshit about sex,
you bullshit about food, you bullshit about your career. Every
year you bullshit about politics and government and gender identity
and I mean you bullshit about everything. So there's a
lot there to uncover. Don't think that you're just going
to sit down and in five minutes, you're going to
figure out all the bullshit that you've concocted your whole
life. These bullshitting habits are deeply ingrained in you. You
see, from a very early age, almost from the point
where you were conscious. As a toddler. You started bullshitting.
And the reason you did is because it was important
to your survival. And those habits, those bullshitting habits have
become ingrained now, inside your brain and in your mind.
Such that now anytime some situation comes up at work
or in your relationship or with your family or whatever,
you've just got a knee jerk reaction, bullshit response already
queued up. See, so we got to become conscious of
those first, then we got to start to unwire them
to change them. And that can be tricky, because again,
remember, what we said from the beginning is that this
affects your survival. That's why you bullshit. So of course,
you're not going to want to give up your bullshitting
habits. Because certain of those habits, for example, pay your
mortgage certain of those habits, get you your girlfriend or
your boyfriend and maintain that certain of your habits. maintain
all of your friendships, your bullshitting habits, and so forth,
right. So for a lot of people whose entire life
is built on bullshit, when we start to excavate some
of this bullshit and let it go. It's a real
problem with letting it go. Because then you say to
yourself, well, billy-o, I can't let this go. If I
let go of this, my whole life will collapse. Or
this giant, important facet of my life looks like like
my career will collapse. I won't know how to feed
myself and my my children. And that's right, it's a
serious problem. I'm not saying this is a light, easy
fix. It could take you years, for example, to extricate
yourself from the bullshit corner that you've painted yourself in
with your career, or with your family or with your
wife and your husband or your children or whatever else.
See, and you're going to be in denial about it,
the more it aids your survival, the more in denial
you're going to be. It's not going to seem like
bullshit to you. It's going to seem like the truth,
it's going to seem good, it's going to seem important
can seem like reality, it's going to seem like a
fact, it's going to seem like it couldn't be any
other way. Like it can't be changed. Like Leo, I
can't change this, this part of my life. What are
you talking about? That's where the work needs to happen.
So, towards that end, I have a little exercise for
you several questions, go ahead and write these down. Because
you're gonna be working with these over the next week.
And beyond that, these are powerful questions that you're going
to contemplate and journal about. Using some pen and paper.
First question is, how am I full of shit? And
if you want you can break that one down. To
be more specific about the different categories of your life
like how am I full of shit in my spirituality?
How am I full of shit when it comes to
science? How am I full of shit when it comes
to politics? How am I full of shit when it
comes to family? How am I full of shit when
it comes to sexuality? How am I full of shit
when it comes to emotions? How am I full of
shit when it comes to health and nutrition and et
cetera? Another powerful question is How am I a hypocrite?
Hypocrisy is directly linked to bullshitters and make no mistake
about it you are a hypocrite. Everyone is a hypocrite
in fact anyone who denies that they're a hypocrite is
being a hypocrite. Third question for you is how do
I make excuses for my bullshit? Because everyone who bullshit
makes excuses for their bullshit, so that to them their
bullshit doesn't seem like bullshit. Another powerful question is whose
bullshit do I complain about to distract from looking at
my own bullshit? This is fundamentally why people bitch and
moan, complain, Judge criticize and demonize others. This is why
the reason is, is because if they weren't busy doing
that They would have to contend and become aware of
their own bullshit, which is difficult, painful and unpleasant. So
instead, what people do is they go find a YouTube
channel, that bitches and moans about their favorite enemy, and
then they watch that. And that takes up all of
their time, so that they never have to self reflect.
And the last question for you here is, how am
I in denial about my own bullshit. Those are powerful
questions, use those for the rest of your life. Don't
just do this exercise once. And by the way, you
know, the first time you sit down and do this,
you might sit down for a whole hour and just
come up with list after list page after page after
page of bullshit, and all of your excuses. And even
when you get done with doing all of that, you
still have only scratched the surface. Right? Because the deepest
bullshit that you do in your life sits very deep.
It happens at a subconscious level, at an automatic habitual
level, you don't even know that you do it yet.
It might take you five years to realize, Oh my
God, that thing Leah was talking about five years ago,
oh, it only now clicks three, five years later. That
that's what's going on in my relationship here. And that's
why my relationship sucks, or that's why I can't attract
women, or that's why I keep getting into relationships with
abusive men over and over again, is my bullshit. But
I didn't know it was bullshit until you know, five
years later, after a lot of introspection. So keep, keep
applying these questions. These are evergreen questions that will work
for the rest of your life in many different domains.
So don't think of this as just a one time
exercise. There cannot be health, happiness, decency or effective governance,
without truthfulness, honesty and authenticity. The majority of human history,
culture, business and governance has been the manufacture packaging and
distribution of bullshit. And also, very importantly, the denial and
suppression of anti bullshit. So what is anti bullshit? Anti
bullshit, you might call what we're doing here this episode,
we're calling out the bullshit, we're trying to shed light
on the bullshit. So that very process, of course, must
be denied, rejected, suppressed, and avoided at all costs, in
order to maintain the bullshit status quo. See, and that's
why you see a lot of people who leave comments
under my various kinds of episodes, you know, the more
advanced the episode, the more controversial the insight. The more
bullshit there is around it. The deeper the Insight is,
the closer it is to truth. Therefore, of course, the
devil needs to heap more and more bullshit on top
of that, to mask the truth. So of course, then
people get very defensive about various kinds of things that
I say about enlightenment or God or about spirituality or
about metaphysics or about consciousness or about intelligence or about
emotions or any of this kind of stuff. Right? Because
only one of two things is going to happen when
you when you listen to someone telling you a deep,
profound truth about yourself and about life. You'll either hear
it and start to agree with it or start to
say, oh, yeah, this is a, this is an important
insight. And it rings true. Or you're gonna deny it.
And when you deny it, you're gonna have to deny
it with aggressive ignorance. See, because why the aggressiveness because
you have to convince yourself that the truth that was
just spoken to you isn't really the truth. So when
you get aggressive about something that I say when you
get triggered by get emotional about you leave little comment,
nasty snarky comment or something like this. All that is,
is that's just you convincing yourself, it's not about me,
it's not about convincing me convincing other people. It's always
about convincing you. That's what you're always doing. When you
think you're convincing other people of your position. What you're
really doing is you're actually just convincing yourself The reason
you want to convince other people of your position of
your truth and your ideology of your religion of your
scientific principles of evolution of, of logic of reason of
of any of whatever. Is because the more people agree
with you, the more people you can persuade to agree
with your bullshit, the less you will feel like your
bullshit is bullshit, and the more you will feel like
it's reality. See, this is fundamentally why all religious people
be compassionate for the most part. I mean, not not
all religious people but but many religious people become very
passionate about proselytizing their religion, preaching it, converting others becoming
missionaries. And this is one of the, one of the
highest ideals of many religions, whether it's, you know, Christian
missionaries, evangelicals, Catholics, Mormons. Even certain Buddhist traditions, the Hari
Krishna has various kinds of cults and so forth. One
of their highest ideals is to be a missionary and
to proselytize the the gospel to somebody else. Why? It's
just a defense mechanism, it's just projection. You see, it's
a smokescreen against having to admit that what you've got
is you've got a big steaming pile of shit. Of
course, this is true in politics very obviously, as well.
The reason people get so animated about politics and want
to convince others want to debate others and win debates,
decimate people in debates eviscerate people in debates, so So
and So eviscerates this person, such and such a liberal
eviscerates that conservative this conservative viscera is that liberal, all
this what is all this that you see going on
on YouTube and in the media. This is all just
people creating some smokescreens for their own bullshit. They're really
always just trying to convince themselves. Because you know what,
when you've got the real solid truth, you have no
need to preach it to anyone. It's a very sort
of stable, solid thing that actually makes you detached and
dispassionate, in a sense, in a good way. The only
solution to this bullshit problem is personal direct experience, independent
contemplation, lots of diverse research, looking and exploring, looking at
and exploring many diverse perspectives, and personal investigation into all
of the most important aspects of reality and of life,
if something is important to you, whether it's in your
career, or with your family, or about your health, and
nutrition, are about sexuality are about metaphysics and philosophy and
spirituality and religion, if something is truly important to you,
then you owe it to yourself to do a deep
personal investigation, to contemplate about this subject as independently as
possible, free from the influences of other people, and the
various kinds of groupthink and social dynamics. If politics is
important to you, then you're going to study history, you're
going to study human psychology, and not just buy into
some ideology that somebody is spewing in some video. See,
because it's only through personal independent investigation, that you will
be able to weed through the bullshit. If you are
too lazy to do personal investigation, then what you will
end up with his bullshit bullshit is the default condition,
you'd have to work really hard. And you're gonna have
to you have to be very discriminating and careful in
your study of life, to be able to come out
of this thing. Not, you know, chest deep and bullshit.
Because you're so much of it. And it's been fed
to you from the very beginning, starting with your family,
but then, you know, in school and college and at
your job and everywhere else. So what's the point of
calling everything bullshit? The point is simply to get you
to really understand the importance of personal investigation of independent
questioning. You see, most people, they don't really question anything.
They just take stuff for granted. They just take the
distinctions and categories that their teachers give them for granted,
or that their politicians or their political leaders give them
or that the news gives them right. You just sort
of buy into the narrative, whatever the narrative tends to
be the prevailing narrative of your culture, you just buy
into it, you don't question it. And in fact, of
course, what many of these schools of thought try to
teach you is not to question religion teaches you not
to question. But of course not just religion, politics, culture,
language, and even science and rationality. Really, they don't encourage
you to question. There's a false fake front that scientifically
minded people and rationally minded people like to put up
as though they are the ones who have assumed the
positions of the ones who are independent thinkers and who
question everything for themselves. This is almost never the case.
It's complete bullshit. It's just an additional layer of meta
bullshit. The scientifically minded people and rationally minded people, the
skeptically minded people are the ones who are the most
full of shit, sometimes even more so than the religious
people. See, so the reason we're talking about this in
such great length and detail with such emphasis, is because
I really want you to understand the importance of personal
investigation, personal questioning. And that's what actualize that org is
fundamentally about. This is not an ideology here. We are
laying down principles for self experimentation, and personal investigation of
reality. With the expectation that if we personally investigate things,
this will be highly worthwhile, because it'll allow us to
sort through a lot of bullshit. And really, what other
options do you have? When you find yourself in this
situation that we're in this House of Cards cemented with
shit, then your only option is either to buy into
it and just to go along with it? Or to
start to question because it's only through questioning that you
sort the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. Only
through exploring lots and lots and lots of diverse perspectives.
Will you be able to successfully navigate this maze, which
is why I always emphasize exploring, and integrating many diverse
perspectives and not getting stuck in any one. Because that's
how bullshit gets made. Alright, that's it for me, I'm
out of here. Please remember to click that like button
if you liked the video, and come check out actualized.
org. That's my website. On there, you will find various
kinds of exclusive resources. I've been posting a lot of
good material on my blog lately, various kinds of exclusive
videos, documentaries and miscellaneous insights that I can't really share
the other videos. Come check out the actualized forum, where
you can talk with people about this stuff like minded
people, check out the life purpose course check out my
book list. The book list gives you a lot of
great book ideas that you won't find almost anywhere else
for starting to sort the wheat from the chaff. And
stay with me as we explore more diverse perspectives going
forward. I really want to warn you not to get
stuck on any one perspective. Sometimes people think that well,
but surely, Leo yoga, that must be the ultimate or
Zen that must be the ultimate, or spiraled out dynamics,
that must be the ultimate, they get a good perspective,
you know, some of these perspectives, of course, are much
better than others, not all perspectives are equal. And the
perspectives that I tend to present tend to be the
highest quality ones, but even then, it's still only one
perspective. And you want to be careful, because if you're
just gonna buy in full bore into Zen, or into
yoga, or into spiral dynamics, I'm warning you, you're gonna
make mistakes, you're gonna get caught up in bullshit. Because
that's what a perspective in a sense is, right? A
perspective is coming from some kind of like origin point.
That's what what it means to be a perspective is
to look at something from one point and not another
point, which is fundamentally partial, incomplete. And not absolute. It's
relative relative to that point of view. And, of course,
it's tainted by ego, because usually, the point of view
you're looking at is someone's ego, either an individual Eagle,
ego or collective ego, which has a hidden agenda. It
has survival needs that he's trying to satisfy. So this
perspective is, is built from the very beginning to satisfy
the very basic survival needs of this point, that the
perspective is coming from. See. So the way that we
ensure that we don't And delude ourselves in this work
is by continually opening ourselves up to new and diverse
perspectives. And the with the idea being that by looking
at hundreds of perspectives and cross referencing all of them,
we get rid of the blind spots, because every perspective
has some value to it. But usually not total value.
Usually it's just, it's gonna give you a lopsided view
of life. So you want to look from that perspective,
but you want it you want to take the good
stuff, leave the bad stuff, and then do the same
with a bunch of other perspectives. And then what you
get it you get a sort of a meta perspective.
And this is how we ensure that we don't delude
ourselves in this work. People sometimes ask me, like, Leo,
how do you know psychedelics are true? How do you
know that meditation is true? How do you know your
enlightened insights are true? Because I cross referenced literally hundreds
of perspectives, hundreds of sources, from other people that that
I respect and that are credible. But then also with
my own direct experiences, and it's through this massive cross
referencing project that then we can develop some semblance of,
of truthfulness. And even then, it's not guaranteed that you
won't make mistakes, right? You always have to be vigilant
against your own bullshit against your own biases against your
own self deception mechanisms. But, you know, this is my
overarching, like meta strategy for how I run actualize that
org and for how I gather all of my insights
and knowledge, and how I how I make sure that
I don't delude myself, I take this very seriously. Some
people, they watch my content, and they see me mouthing
off or ranting about this topic or that topic. And
I think, Oh, well, Leo is just one of these
people who just buys into something just buys into spirituality
just buys into enlightened just buys into non duality just
buys into secular. No, no, no, no, no, you don't
understand what goes on behind the scenes. How much i
i doubt everything, double, triple, quadruple down everything cross reference
everything, check every angle, you know, come back years later,
and just rethink about, am I wrong about this? Am
I wrong about that? What could I be missing there?
You know, that's what the process looks like behind the
scenes, you don't really see it so much happening in
the material that I teach. Because here I'm just presenting,
you know, insights. In a limited amount of time, there's
no real purpose for me to start to doubt myself
here on camera. But you better believe that I doubt
everything I'm the greatest out of there is, there's nobody
who doubts more than me. Believe it or not. And
that's how you got to approach life too. Right? You
got to be so skeptical that you understand that no
one perspective is going to solve this epistemic bind that
we're in, including skepticism itself. So you can be skeptical
at times. But then over time, you have to say,
Wait a minute. I've been skeptical for the last two
years, why don't I stop being skeptical for for the
next year? And why don't I do the opposite and
see where I get and then I'll compare my perspectives.
I'll look at how, how much progress I got when
I was skeptical how much I got when I wasn't
skeptical, right? Because even skepticism is still one perspective. It's
one method. It's one lens through which to look at
the world. And so is rationality. So a science, which
is why you can't take them too seriously. You can't
take any one perspective too seriously. But to do this
to succeed, and in this endeavor, you have to be
extremely flexible, extremely open minded, and very good at dealing
with contradictions, apparent paradoxes and simply confusion and not knowing
what this means is you're gonna have a bunch of
different perspectives, a bunch of different lenses and models and
maps and, and, and explanations and they won't all fit
together perfectly. But that actually shows you the complexity of
this thing that we're exploring called life, called the universe,
right? So it's a complicated thing. It's not easy to
explain, there's no one simple explanation for everything and what
I gave you here, this lens of, of bullshit that
I gave you, the lens of looking at everything as
though it was bullshit, that's just one lens. Right? So
again, don't get attached to it. Don't get hooked on
it. Don't now go around for the rest of your
life saying that everything is bullshit. It's one perspective. And
next time, I'll give you some more perspective, and maybe
it'll be the opposite perspective of this. And you got
to be able to, to deal with that to reconcile
that in your mind. Right, like people sometimes criticize me
for giving contradictory advice or giving contradictory information. That's just
because what we're covering is recovering a very, very wide
territory, from a very big picture level perspective, which very
few people actually do attempt to do. Therefore, they can
get away with very consistent explanations, you see, it's very
easy to come up with a consistent explanation of something,
when you're covering a little subdomain that that's this small,
not when you're explaining all of reality as a whole
in all the different domains of reality how they all
interconnect, if you want to explain all that, so you're
gonna have very messy explanations. And not only that, but
you're gonna have different explanations, entirely different maps. It's for
like, you can have one map of the United States,
which will be a topographical map, it'll show you various
like elevation in the terrain, another map is not going
to have that information, it's going to be a map
of, let's say, the different water, water levels in the
in the earth, that's going to be able to kind
of map and then a third kind of map might
show you where the power grids are, across the US.
And then a fourth map will show you where the
like where the trees and forests are. And that will
be giving you an additional layer of information, he got
all these layers, and you got to be able to
like sift through these maps and use different maps for
different purposes, right. So if you're going to dig a
well, you need the water map. And if you're going
to like go hiking through a forest, you need the
forest map and so forth. And so that's kind of
what we're doing. It's a little bit messy. But that's
just the nature of the beast. Don't fall for simplistic
explanations. But then again, sometimes we can distill something down
to just a little nugget, like mankind is full of
shit. And that's powerful. It's so simple, it's powerful, so
memorable. You can remember that for the rest of your
life. You can use that that can help you in
business that can help you in relationships that can help
you with your own emotions and understanding your own victim
mentality and how that's foolish shit and, and so on.
I see But again, just don't get hooked on it
and stick around and we'll explore more perspectives to come.
