            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PFfZ1vTYCMg' target='_blank'>Self Discipline vs Freedom - How To Create More Freedom In Your Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Lack of understanding between discipline and freedom</b>: Leo elaborates that people often misconstrue discipline with rigidity and lack of freedom. He clarifies that discipline is not about following strict rules or leading a boring life, but it's about aligning one's actions with desired outcomes for personal development.
</li><li><b>Misguided quests for freedom</b>: Understanding that people tend to seek immediate gratification, Leo argues that such actions lead to a looping cycle of dissatisfaction. This approach can trap individuals in a cycle of desiring more immediate joy without ever achieving lasting fulfillment or freedom. 
</li><li><b>Importance of shift in perspective</b>: Leo illustrates that the current societal understanding of freedom is flawed. He proposes that individuals are not free when they succumb to immediate desires or take shortcuts. He argues that people are not masters of themselves when they succumb to these tendencies, but are, in fact, slaves to their desires. 
</li><li><b>Proposal for strategic approach</b>: In the pursuit of true happiness, fulfillment, and peace of mind, Leo advocates for a strategic and disciplined approach to life. He emphasizes a more deliberate pursuit of one's goals that requires patience, consistency, and discipline, arguing that this strategic approach leads to genuine, lasting freedom.  
</li><li><b>Value of discipline and rituals</b>: Leo references a quote from Lao Tzu about the necessity of discipline and ritual. He argues that people ought to reframe their understanding of discipline not as a restriction to freedom, but as a vehicle that channels one's emotions and life energies towards enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of lack of discipline</b>: Leo provides an example, using weight loss and gym attendance, to detail the negative consequences of lacking self-discipline. He illustrates how, without discipline, individuals are entrapped by the very desires they seek to fulfill, creating a constant cycle of dissatisfaction and failure, thereby restricting their freedom. 
</li><li><b>Discipline as a key to freedom</b>: In closing, Leo emphasizes the importance of discipline in personal growth and overcoming desires, framing self-discipline as not a restriction, but a facilitator of freedom.
</li><li><b>Self-Discipline and Creation</b>: Leo argues that being controlled by desires without discipline inhibits individuals from creating lives they desire. Avoiding pain and seeking immediate gratification can hinder the realization of meaningful dreams, whether they are relationships, businesses, or health goals. Self-discipline is recommended not as a harsh, self-critical approach but a gentle yet consistent one.
</li><li><b>Results of Discipline</b>: Leo notes that increased discipline and deliberate habit-forming lead to the sensation of greater freedom and fulfillment. The process of building one's own value through self-discipline can provide a sense of liberation, characterized as investing in oneself over time. This can provide more choice in various areas of life, including career and relationships, that might otherwise feel limited or stagnant without putting in the necessary emotional work and discipline. 
</li><li><b>Options and Freedom</b>: Leo suggests that true freedom is about creating options for oneself. This requires not just work, but emotional investment, discipline, and self-improvement. Many situations do not offer options by default, such as nine-to-five jobs or relationships. However, with self-discipline and effort, one can create more options, whether it's starting a business or attracting a desirable partner. 
</li><li><b>The False Idea of 'Slavery'</b>: According to Leo, people often perceive themselves as slaves to external circumstances such as their job, health, or relationships. However, it is suggested that this 'slavery' stems from to one's desires, emotions, moods, neurotic thoughts, and poor habits. Hence, rather than being a slave to external circumstances, people are essentially slaves to themselves. 
</li><li><b>Freedom Through Discipline</b>: Leo concludes by emphasizing that discipline is necessary to create options, which subsequently leads to freedom. The quote from Michael Beckwith elaborates on the themes discussed, mentioning the power of self-discipline in overcoming temporary emotions and reasoning to achieve freedom. It also suggests a connection between love for something, willingness to practice, and resultant freedom through discipline. 
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Self-Discipline</b>: Encouraging viewers to ponder over these ideas, Leo acknowledges the gradual process of developing discipline and recommends a support system or guidance for consistency. Signing up for their newsletter is suggested as a means to access regular content aiming to foster self-mastery, discipline, and more freedom.
