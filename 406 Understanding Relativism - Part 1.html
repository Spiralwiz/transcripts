            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/UyBETFn5KXk' target='_blank'>Understanding Relativism - Part 1</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo Gura's Discussion of Relativism</b>: Leo Gura delves into the complex philosophical concept of relativism, emphasizing that it extends far beyond physics and involves various types of relativity such as social, cultural, moral, ethical and epistemic. He highlights that understanding this topic is not a simple task and that it can be easy to misconstrue relativism based on one's established worldviews. 
</li><li><b>Definition of Relativism</b>: As defined by several reputable sources, relativism refers to the understanding that knowledge, truth, and morality are relative to culture, society, and historical context. In other words, varying frameworks, paradigms, and assessment criteria shape truths, influencing differing conventions, worldviews, and perspectives. This means that no universal criteria or abstract ideal can definitively establish the truth.
</li><li><b>Types of Relativism</b>: Gura covers different kinds of relativism including social and cultural, which accounts for varying customs and laws across different societies, and moral and ethical, which acknowledges varying moral standards across different eras. Epistemic relativism considers the different ways of knowing the world, such as through science, religion, or mysticism. He also touches on ontological and physical relativism, which questions the notion of one objective physical world existing the same for everyone. 
</li><li><b>Relativism VS Absolutism</b>: Gura distinguishes between relativism and absolutism. While relativism suggests that everything being known, understood, and believed about the world is absolutely relative, absolutism proposes a hard, external, and objective physical reality, with a set of facts that are true for everyone. Despite these contradictory views, it is essential to leave room for the consideration of absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Complexities and Objections to Relativism</b>: Understanding relativism can be complex due to the potential objections and misunderstandings. Hence, Gura encourages viewers to keep an open mind, think critically, and hold onto their objections until the end of the discussion, where he attempts to address those objections. 
</li><li><b>Relativity in Cultural, Moral, Epistemic, and Ontological Aspects</b>: Gura highlights that the idea of relativity comes into play in diverse aspects of life such as social culture, morality, epistemology, and ontology. It presents the understanding that values, truths, norms, experiences, judgements, and even reality are dependent on several underlying variables or paradigms, including people's beliefs, languages, and cultures. 
</li><li><b>Individual Understanding of the World and Relativity</b>: As Gura explains, the individual understanding of the world is influenced by our neurology, psychology, DNA, ancestry, and culture. Changing beliefs occurs by comparing perspectives and putting them together like a puzzle, which ultimately reflects the reality experienced within an individual's timeframe of existence. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Understanding Relativity for Personal Development</b>: Gura emphasizes that gaining a proper understanding of relativism is critical for personal development, as it allows individuals to ponder on reality on a deeper level. This idea even extends to areas such as history, societal values, and the concept of light speed, further cementing the significance of relativity in our understanding of the world. 
</li><li><b>Relativity VS Absolute Truth</b>: Despite the detailed exploration of relativity, Gura highlights the potential for absolute truth, albeit distinct from the idea of absolutism. He acknowledges the difficulty in articulating and comprehending such a concept, thereby encouraging listeners to experience the truth for themselves. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org and Encouragement of Critical Thinking</b>: Finally, Gura promotes his website, Actualized.org and calls for critical thinking, contemplation, and questioning of personal beliefs when exploring advanced concepts. Despite welcoming debunking and being open to proven wrong, he underlines the importance of avoiding cynicism and skepticism, and instead, taking his ideas seriously to seek personal truth.
</li><li><b>Concept of Relativity</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that relativism extends deep into our perspectives and interpretations. Every understanding or knowledge is relative compared to other things. For instance, the size of an elephant is considered large only when compared to a smaller being like a mouse. The example of a triangle adding up to 180 degrees is only relatively true if we consider the geometry on a flat plane. In other instances, such as doing geometry on a curved surface, this norm doesn't hold. Gura further explains that something as classic as a glass half full or half empty is relative, as both mean the same yet elicit different perspectives and emotions based on one's interpretations.
</li><li><b>Relativity in Science</b>: Contrary to popular belief, Gura argues that science is not absolutely true. Rather, it is relative to the times. For example, the science we view as accurate in the 21st century may be seen as erroneous centuries from now. Science advances slowly, and while it contributes significantly to our understanding of the world, it doesn't hold a monopoly on truth. Other methods can also provide insights about the world, sometimes even more profoundly than science. 
</li><li><b>Cultural and Individual Taste Relativity</b>: Gura cites an example of people having different opinions about the same food at a restaurant to illustrate relativity influenced by individual tastes and perceptions. To thoroughly understand relativism, he encourages viewers to keep an open mind and not dismiss other points of view too quickly. Doing so can lead to a biased perspective and hinder understanding of the full picture of reality. 
</li><li><b>Historical Highlights on Relativism</b>: Individuals' belief or understanding of reality is also subject to relativism. For example, the Eiffel Tower's length is not fixed, and it changes based on one's frame of reference, velocity, and relative position to the tower, a concept identified as relativity in Einstein's theory of general relativity. However, recognizing relativity doesn't mean scientists can't agree on facts. Despite differences, consensus can be reached when scientists share similar states of consciousness, DNA, brains, education, and culture. 
</li><li><b>Relativity and Facts</b>: Facts' interpretation is also relative, influenced by things like our neurology, psychology, DNA, ancestry, culture, and more. One can be factually wrong, which signifies that something previously believed no longer holds true due to gains in knowledge or deeper exploration of reality. In this context, the idea of being "factually wrong" is also relative, leading to broader understanding and insights about human perceptions and reality. 
</li><li><b>Relativity of Good and Evil and Light's Speed</b>: Good and evil are relative based on what aids or hinders one's survival, resulting in conflicting notions throughout history. Even scientific constants like the speed of light may not be absolute and vary depending on factors like space-time fluctuations, illustrating the application of relativism in varied aspects of existence. 
</li><li><b>Necessity of Experiencing the Absolute</b>: Gura ends the section by stressing the importance of experiencing the 'Absolute,' which is beyond all relativity and grounds human experience. Becoming directly conscious of the 'Absolute', while possible, is complex, requiring deep critical thinking and self-exploration. He insists that understanding relativism is instrumental in comprehending reality and personal development.
</li><li><b>Anaximander's Concept of Relativity</b>: Anaximander, an ancient Greek philosopher, formulated a key concept of relativity roughly 2,500 years ago. He proposed a solution to the paradox of a spherical Earth appearing to remain stationary in empty space. Anaximander suggested that the Earth could sit unsupported in this void because it was being pulled equally in all directions. This effectively means the Earth is essentially "falling" in all directions at once and therefore appears to remain in one position. This realization required Anaximander to recognize that the concepts of up and down were relative, implying objects do not inherently fall downward, but this perception is relative to one's position on Earth.
</li><li><b>Opposition to Relativistic Discoveries</b>: Throughout history, highly innovative relativistic concepts have often been initially opposed by mainstream society. Examples include Copernicus' heliocentric theory, proposed during a period when the church, orthodoxy, and many scientists clung to a geocentric worldview. Similarly, the discovery of the Americas disrupted the largely monolithic European perspective, revealing the existence of continents inhabiting different kinds of human beings with varied cultures, languages, and religions, challenging their understanding and introducing them to an unsettling degree of relativity.
</li><li><b>Difficulty in Perceiving Relativity</b>: A significant challenge humans face in understanding relativity stems from being fundamentally enmeshed in the very thing they are investigating. For example, standing on the Earth contributes to difficulty in perceiving its movement. Similarly, having a staunch moral or cultural stance can make it challenging to recognize its relative nature.
</li><li><b>Impact of New Discoveries on Perception of Reality</b>: Major discoveries, such as the discovery of the Americas, greatly impacted people's sense of reality by revealing vastly different cultures, languages, religions, and life practices. Such revelations can be highly unsettling but are essential in expanding the global understanding of human diversity and relativity. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to Cultural Relativism</b>: Following the discovery of new cultures, there has been resistance to accepting the relativity of these different cultures and their practices. History reveals attempts to 'civilize' or convert new cultures to existing predominant beliefs, reflecting a refusal to acknowledge the relativity of one's own culture and beliefs. Despite this, the gradual acknowledgment and acceptance of cultural diversity is integral to understanding the concept of relativity.
</li><li><b>Understanding the implications of relativism</b>: Leo Gura explains how a relativistic perspective rather than an absolutist one encourages open-mindedness, helping us understand reality more accurately. For instance, as globalisation and travel became prevalent, it allowed people to experience different cultures and religions. This diversity greatly impacted their survival strategies, lifestyle, and most importantly, their understanding of reality. Leo emphasises that this process, though complex, is essential for a comprehensive understanding of varying perspectives.
</li><li><b>Illustration of cultural and time relativism through historical events</b>: Leo uses historical events to further establish the concept of relativism. He talks about the excruciating journey of Magellan and his crew around the Earth, where they mistakenly lost track of one day due to the lack of understanding of relativity in time based on geographical locations. This led to the establishment of time zones and Greenwich Mean Time, making "noon" a relative concept based on a person's position on Earth. 
</li><li><b>Cultural and religious relativity</b>: Experiencing different cultures and religions made people question the veracity of their deeply ingrained beliefs and customs, serving as a clear representation of cultural and religious relativity. The introduction of experiences that are starkly different from one's own invokes a sense of "culture shock," promoting the realization that cultural norms and religious beliefs are relative and can differ greatly from one region to another.
</li><li><b>US Constitution and religious pluralism</b>: The implementation of religious pluralism in the US Constitution, according to Leo, was a radical and revolutionary achievement. It allowed for freedom of religion and defied the absolutistic belief system of the time, paving the way for a more relativistic society. This development was not easily accepted, however, as many people, especially conservatives and right-wingers, were repelled by the notion of accepting more than one religion as valid. 
</li><li><b>Transitioning from absolutism to relativism</b>: This segment underscores the importance of transitioning from an absolutist perspective to a relativist one for comprehensive cognitive development. There is an emphasis on understanding that religious beliefs, similar to every other aspect of reality, are not absolute but relative, differing based on individual perspectives and cultural norms. This realization is a crucial paradigm shift in cognitive development. 
</li><li><b>Advancement of relativism through geometry</b>: The shift from Spile dynamics to Euclidean geometry also marked a significant advancement in understanding the concept of relativity. The principles of Euclidean geometry provide another perspective on relative understanding, adding another dimension to the intricacies of relativism.
</li><li><b>Exploration of non-Euclidean geometry</b>: Leo highlights the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry in the 19th century by mathematicians like Carl Gauss, which revealed that Euclidean geometry was only viable on a flat plane. The existence of new geometries that worked on curved or multi-dimensional surfaces triggered major scientific and philosophical revolutions.
</li><li><b>Quantum mechanics and its relativistic implications</b>: Leo discusses the evolution of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, emphasizing its relativistic aspect. Quantum mechanics revealed that there is no distinction between the measuring instrument and the object being measured, proving that observation is entangled with the state of the thing being observed and introducing "entanglement" into scientific discourse.
</li><li><b>Critique of contemporary understanding of quantum mechanics</b>: Leo argues that many scientists today fail to accept or understand the epistemic and metaphysical implications of quantum mechanics, despite acknowledging its relativistic truths. He challenges the common belief that particles exist separately from measurement apparatus, highlighting that this perspective has been refuted for over a century.
</li><li><b>Relativism and personal development</b>: Leo connects the understanding of relativity directly to personal development. He proposes that an individual's inability to embrace a relativistic viewpoint confines them to a narrow, materialistic worldview. This limits self-discovery and mars the pursuit of personal developmental goals.
</li><li><b>Introduction of Quinn's ontological relativism and Willard Klein's perspective</b>: Quinn's ontological relativism suggests that communication and comprehension among individuals from different cultures or species could be challenging due to the inextricable relationship between language, worldview, and ontology. Willard Klein expanded this idea, explaining the difficulty in understanding another's ontology without fully assuming their perspective and identity.
</li><li><b>The relativization of logic</b>: Alongside the evolution of quantum mechanics and relativity theory, discoveries in logic also took place, demonstrating that there were infinitely many types of logic beyond Aristotelian logic. This helped to break down the belief that there was one absolute logic. 
</li><li><b>Summary of the complexity of understanding relativity</b>: Leo cautions against oversimplifying relativity, stating that it is an intricate concept that cannot be adequately understood from a brief introduction. A more profound understanding requires critical thinking and prolonged study. He emphasizes that relativistic insights are vital for personal development, as they can help debunk the usual absolutist worldview, thereby broadening one's perspective on reality. 
</li><li><b>Potential pitfalls of relativistic thinking</b>: Leo warns against the risks of conflating ideas or accepting flawed arguments because they align with a relativistic worldview. Correct interpretation of relativism does not imply that all perspectives are valid or that all opinions constitute facts. It is essential to respect the validity of different perspectives while also recognizing that certain factual inaccuracies can be objectively identified and corrected.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Ontological Relativism</b>: Ontological relativism is demonstrated by the example of two beings, human and alien, observing the same entity yet having different interpretations about it. For instance, a human sees a cat as a four-legged creature, while an alien might regard it as a kinetic process of fur moving through space. This notion emphasizes that definitions of things are influenced by individual perspectives, metaphysical ideas, and cultural norms.
</li><li><b>Thomas Kuhn's Paradigm Theory</b>: The 20th-century scientist Thomas Kuhn introduced the concept of paradigms in science, explaining that science develops through evolving paradigms or worldviews. Each paradigm provides a different method and perspective for understanding the world, making scientific progress a complex, messy, and relativistic process. Kuhn also introduced the concept of incommensurability, which states two worldviews can never be fully reconciled.
</li><li><b>Influence of Post-Modernism and Post-Structuralism</b>: The second half of the 20th century saw extensive development in relativism through post-modernism and post-structuralism. These philosophies led to the acknowledgement of relativism in various aspects of life, such as gender, sexuality, language, etc., disrupting conventional societal norms and structures.
</li><li><b>Role of Academics in Propagating Relativism</b>: Since the interconnectedness and globalization of the world became apparent in the 20th century, academics have played a significant role in promoting relativism. Social sciences, humanities, and universities, being at the forefront of human knowledge and understanding, contributed heavily towards debunking absolutism and embracing relativistic interpretations.
</li><li><b>Significance of Relativism in Understanding Diversity</b>: Relativism is crucial to explaining the diverse range of perspectives, cultures, social norms, epistemic schemes, ontologies, and paradigms seen across human history and around the world.
</li><li><b>Eastern Cultural Stance on Relativism</b>: Contrary to West's historical absolutism, Eastern philosophy has embraced the concept of relativity for thousands of years. A foundational aspect of this philosophy is the Jain concept of 'Anekantavada' or 'no one perspective-ism' - communicating the idea that no single standpoint can describe existence or absolute truth fully, reflecting the multi-sided nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Anekantavada and Mahavira</b>: An old enlightened sage, Mahavira, is said to have established the Jainism principles and introduced the idea of Anekantavada which states that a single statement cannot fully define existence or absolute truth. He stated that religious truths are complex, having multiple perspectives, and cannot be fully expressed through language, which is merely a means of expressing truth. Anekantavada believes that reality is multi-faceted and understanding the whole requires understanding these various perspectives.
</li><li><b>Anekantavada's View of a Cooking Pot</b>: Anekantavada views an ordinary object like a cooking pot from different perspectives stating - from certain points of view, the pot exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist, is inexpressible, both exists and is inexpressible, both does not exist and is inexpressible, and all at once exists, does not exist, and is inexpressible. This forms the basis of the relativistic nature of Anekantavada, which, according to Mahavira, underlies our understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Being Part-Right, Part-Wrong, and Incomplete</b>: The discussions and debates between individuals each possess part of the truth but are also part wrong and incomplete due to differing perspectives. Like the parable of the blind men and the elephant, these perspectives form various aspects of truth but are never the complete truth, the absolute reality.
</li><li><b>Importance of a Frame of Reference</b>: Debates and conflict arise due to different frames of reference. Facets of a debate are only part of the complete reality under discussion. Multiple correct points of view can co-exist, reflecting different aspects of absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Difficulty of Expressing the Entirety of Reality</b>: The metaphor of five blind people each describing an elephant from their immediate interactions with a different part of it presents the difficulty of expressing the entire reality in a discussion.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Relativity of Truth and Reality</b>: The relativity of truth and reality is critical for navigating the world without undue disagreement and conflict. An understanding of Anekantavada aids in appreciating the many viewpoints that contribute to the understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Example of Relativity in Right and Wrong</b>: An example of the relative nature of reality is the context-specific morality around slavery where ancient Roman norms considered it acceptable, but it is wrong in 21st-century norms because of the suffering and harm inflicted onto enslaved individuals. This underscores the relativistic nature of human perspectives, beliefs, and feelings. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Recognizing Relativism</b>: Leo Gura suggests viewers should learn to recognize the relativistic nature of reality, acknowledging its complexity, and be open enough to see its various facets. This capacity will pave the way for a more profound, accurate understanding of their surroundings and principles that rule human interactions.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Suffering and Relativity</b>: Leo Gura argues that suffering isn't universally 'wrong.' The perception of suffering as negative might be accurate relative to an individual who dislikes experiencing pain. However, one can imagine a scenario where someone welcomes suffering. He suggests that there "is no truth of the matter of whether it is wrong to sell people as slaves independently of one's frame of reference." This assertion might be stark and even disturbing, but he maintains that it is an important point in the understanding of relativity as it pertains to reality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Establishing Frame of Reference</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to establish a frame of reference in discussions and debates. Instead of accepting statements at face value, like "this is true" or "this is rational," one should question, 'relative to what?' Placing beliefs, judgments, and statements within a particular context will often dissolve perceived absolutes and solicit deeper understanding. It's through understanding these relative frameworks that one can navigate through reality more effectively. 
</li><li><b>Relativity does not Equate Equivalence</b>: Leo Gura explains that stating something is not better than the other, like science is not better than witchcraft, does not mean they are equivalent or equally suitable for all situations. Each has its unique pros and cons, and their effectiveness or suitability varies depending on the context or the goal at hand.
</li><li><b>Relativism and Reality</b>: Leo argues that reality reflects our subjective perspectives. The judgment of what is real depends on the specific frame of reference in question. For instance, our general waking reality seems real compared to our dream states, but other higher states of consciousness (like those achievable with psychedelic experiences) might expose that ordinary consciousness is just an elaborate form of dream.
</li><li><b>Relativity in Evaluating Cultural Factors</b>: Leo Gura highlights our evaluations of cultural factors, like the favorable religion in a specific region, are influenced by relativistic factors. Political environment, family ties, and friendships might influence someone to align with the predominant religion even if another religion offers more personally desirable outcomes.
</li><li><b>Relativism does not Make Reality Arbitrary</b>: Leo also explains that acknowledging that everything is relative doesn't mean thinking things into existence or the elimination of the concept of being factually wrong. Relativism accounts for the various viewpoints that can exist. It does not validate all viewpoints as entirely accurate or factual.
</li><li><b>Relativity in Judgement and Perceptions</b>: Leo emphasizes that our judgments and perceptions are affected by our subjective standpoint. Judgments of good and evil, for example, are colored by what aids or hinders survival. Additionally, commonly accepted facts like the speed of light being constant could also be factored in the frame of relativity.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Relativism</b>: Leo discusses various aspects of relativism and asserts that reality holds multiple perspectives. He provides the example of Adolf Hitler and asserts that Hitler's moral status, "good" or "bad," is undefined due to differing human perspectives, is subjective, and is ultimately a moot point as it is beyond current descriptive language. 
</li><li><b>Relativity in Various Aspects of Life</b>: Leo explains that everything ranging from physical objects, dualities, birth, cultural and personal factors, belief systems, aesthetics, opinions, religion, perception, language, scientific knowledge to even life, and death are relative. These are all seen differently based on diverse perspectives, paradigms, times, and cultures. He asserts that the common denominator in all these examples is the subjective human consciousness that gives each aspect its form.
</li><li><b>Objections to Relativism</b>: Addressing common objections to relativism, Leo emphasizes that relativism is not a simplistic concept and should not be misunderstood as a way to deny reality or materialize imaginations. He provides the example of physical ailments and describes how personal identification with physical bodies makes the experience of diseases like cancer depend on one's subjective perspective. Similarly, Leo asserts that even the validity of scientific knowledge relies heavily on the era, cultural understanding, and subjective human points of view it is carried out in. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion on Relativism</b>: Reiterating the significance of relativism, Leo encourages viewers to acknowledge the subjective nature of their individual realities. He emphasizes the multiplicity within realities and the influence of the human perception on such multiplicities. He encourages a shift in individual perspectives to allow a deeper understanding of the absolute being, beyond everyday human experiences and what is traditionally recognized as facts.
</li><li><b>Relativity in science</b>: Leo Gura highlights that science is relative in numerous ways. It changes and evolves according to the era in which it is being practiced. Scientific understanding and methods that are deemed legitimate and valid in the current period could be viewed as outdated or even erroneous in the future.
</li><li><b>Fluidity and evolution of scientific understanding</b>: What is accepted as 'science' is not static; it evolves with the progression of our understanding of reality. For instance, techniques currently viewed as non-scientific, like spiritual meditational practices, may be embraced as valid scientific methods in the future. Thus, the conception of 'science' is based on cultural and societal norms that change over time.
</li><li><b>Difference in scientific interpretation</b>: Scientists do not always agree on data interpretation. Given various paradigms and perspectives, they often perceive and process the same set of data differently, leading to debates and lack of consensus. Therefore, scientific data is not always universally shared or agreed upon.
</li><li><b>Effects of shared characteristics on scientific agreement</b>: When scientists share common characteristics like similar DNA, educational background, culture, and perceptual systems, they are more likely to agree on the same set of data. Significant divergence in these factors, as would be the case when comparing human scientists with hypothetical alien scientists, could lead to fundamentally different understandings of the same data.
</li><li><b>Nature of absolute truth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that despite the relativity in human perception, there exists an 'absolute truth' or 'being,' which is fundamentally different from subjective data or facts. However, this absolute truth cannot be fully communicated or understood through ordinary human perception, language, or concepts. It demands a complete nullification of self, socio-cultural paradigms, and perceptual systems.
</li><li><b>Can people be 'factually' wrong?</b>: The idea of being 'factually wrong' does exist within relativism. What it means to be 'factually wrong' is relative; it signifies that one's current knowledge contradicts previously held beliefs. This discrepancy occurs due to an exploration of one's psyche and new perspectives realized over time. However, the concept of 'fact' itself is relative, emanating from human neurology, psychology, and shared culture.
</li><li><b>Does relativism make erroneous beliefs, like Earth being flat, true?</b>: Leo Gura dismisses the assumption that relativism validates all perspectives, regardless of their alignment with reality. Just because worldviews are relative does not mean that an erroneous belief, such as the Earth being flat, becomes factual under the lens of relativism. It only highlights the relativistic nature of perspectives, not their correspondence with objective reality.
</li><li><b>Relativity of Perspectives</b>: Leo highlights that perspectives on reality, such as viewing Earth as flat or round, are relative based on an individual's experiences and projections. This is highlighted using examples like viewing a person we dislike as uglier than they are due to the colouring of our perceptions by our personal feelings. He emphasizes that interpretations of reality happen within an individual's consciousness and are therefore relative.
</li><li><b>Relativity of History</b>: Leo explains that history is subjective and shaped by perspective. The way we view history is shaped by our worldview, focusing on progress, power dynamics, technological advancement, or biological evolution. The 'true' history is complex and multifaceted, from which we select and highlight elements to support our understanding.
</li><li><b>Good and Evil are Relative</b>: Leo stresses that concepts of good and evil are relative, largely dependent on perspectives of what aids or hinders survival. Different individuals, based on their survival strategies, will therefore have varying notions of good and evil.
</li><li><b>Building a Society with Relative Values</b>: Leo addresses the concern that a society cannot flourish if all values are relative. While acknowledging the difficulties brought upon by disagreements, he points out that shared human needs and commonality provide grounds for consensus, cooperation, and society building. 
</li><li><b>Relativity of the Speed of Light</b>: Answering the question regarding Einstein's assertion that the speed of light is constant, Leo points out that even this apparent constancy is relative, factoring in conditions like the medium it's in, or the history of the universe.
</li><li><b>Subjectivity of Reality Post-Death</b>: Postulating on the state of reality after an individual's death, Leo argues that the concept of the continuation of Earth's existence is only valid as long as one is alive. Therefore, once an individual dies, from their personal perspective, the Earth ceases to exist demonstrating the relativism of perceived reality.
</li><li><b>Relative Interpretations of 'Fact'</b>: Additionally, Leo emphasizes that what is accepted as a 'fact' is influenced by our neurology, psychology, DNA, ancestry, and culture, highlighting the role of individual perspective and interpretation. Due to this, changing beliefs or understanding of facts involves comparing perspectives and aligning them together like a puzzle.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Objections to Relativism</b>: Leo Gura addresses various objections to relativism, including the notion that enlightenment might be relative. Gura argues, however, that enlightenment is the one absolute - it is an awakening to the thing which gets us out of relativity. The contradictions in discussing the absolute using language, which is by nature dualistic and relative, are not oversights but are acknowledged by Gura and viewers are encouraged to be aware of them too. 
</li><li><b>Epistemic, Moral, and Ontological of Relativity</b>: He points out that all of his teachings, including language and concepts, are relative. He emphasizes that none of his teachings can capture all of reality and asserts that there is an absolute reality that exists beyond the teachings and relative points, which cannot be explicated in any way and can only be known by experiencing it. A key part of relativism is understanding that even though there is the absolute, nothing we say here is the absolute - that's still relative. Some things are more useful in some circumstances than others and that depends on one's goals. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Relativity for Personal Development</b>: As an important guide to understanding reality and growing personally, Gura sees understanding relativity as vital. To better understand relativity, he proposes approaching it from the perspective of truth rather than attacking it as false. He also notes that emotional reactions to relativism are usually based on personal survival instincts and worldviews and thus should be carefully examined and questioned.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Teaching and Beliefs about Relativity</b>: He also emphasizes that it is not a matter of taking his statements at face value, but rather to think and contemplate them. He acknowledges the potential for him to be wrong, pointing out that serious contemplation of his teachings would reveal this, if it were so. Emotional reactions should be viewed as growth opportunities.
