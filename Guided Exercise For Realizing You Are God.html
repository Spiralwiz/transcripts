This episode is going to be a guided spiritual practice
a Inquiry into the Nature of what you are, as
God. This episode is a little bit different than my
usual episodes, which are very conceptual and theoretical and abstract.
And here, we're going to get very hands on and
practical, this episode requires your participation. So if you're driving
in a car or listening to me while doing the
dishes, or cooking something, you don't need to stop. And
you need to come back and do this with your
full attention and concentration. So here's where the rubber meets
the road. Here's where things get very real, and practical.
Now, I gotta warn you that if you go through
this exercise, you may experience some shifts in your consciousness,
it may even lead to a mystical experience. For some
of you, it may even lead to some existential crisis
for some of you. So watch out, if you're mentally
unstable, then stop when it gets too deep for you.
But that's the nature of spiritual work. What we're trying
to do is we're trying to deconstruct your mind, and
I'm gonna help you to actually guide you through the
deconstruction of your mind and your reality. Are you interested
in that? Are you interested in seeing what results after
your entire mind and reality is deconstructed? What remains? Then
let's get going. You see, one of the problems with
my work, and if you are a fan of my
work is that it's very conceptual. It's very abstract. It's
very theoretical. And I enjoy playing with abstractions and concepts.
And that's part of the limitations of just language and
teaching. But the problem with that is that you can
easily get lost to these abstractions. And then you veer
off into some sort of conceptual understanding of spirituality. Without
grounding it in any kind of actual practice. So here
is how you do the actual practice. One of the
most important things I can teach you is the difference
between spirituality at purely a conceptual level where it is
for the majority of mankind, at the level of beliefs
and ideas, and theories, versus actual spirituality, what it really
means to do spirituality, that's one of the biggest things
you're going to learn from this episode, if you actually
participate. And it's not enough for you to think about
what I'm talking about, you must participate. So let's get
started. Where do we begin? Well, I want to help
you to realize that you are God. That's our ultimate
objective here. And I'm gonna try to guide you towards
that. But as I guide, you understand that the things
I'm talking about really cannot be understood from your current
level of consciousness. So we're pushing you, we're really pushing
you beyond what your current state of consciousness is going
to allow. So don't be disappointed if you're not going
to fully get everything that I'm saying here. You probably
won't. It's gonna require years of practice for you to
get some of the stuff that I'm saying here, but
maybe you'll be lucky. And you'll be able to get
a little bit of a kind of a glimpse into
something here or there. And, more importantly, than actually getting
the full realization even if you don't get the full
realization is still valuable because it's going to show you
what you need to do to ultimately reach the full
realization at some point in your life. So you are
God. The problem is when I say that you don't
understand what I mean, because you don't have a reference
experience for the word God. So let's begin by simply
having you bring to mind what you think I mean,
when I say God. What does that word mean for
you? bring to mind any beliefs or images, or stories
that you have about that? And then when I further
say that you are God, bring to mind what you
think I mean by that. What are you imagining I
mean, when I say that so you got that whatever
images, you have just kind of put that to the
side and your mind, just remember, remember what that is,
we'll we'll come back to that in a second. Now,
what I want you to do is I want you
to ground yourself completely in present experience. So when I
say experience, what am I saying? Nothing complicated. Take a
look at your hands, put them out in front of
you like this, and just take a look at them.
And just become aware of this room that you're in
wherever you are. Look around you. Notice that experience is
happening. Everything here, the hands, the room, your body, feelings
and thoughts that you might be having the sounds you're
hearing my voice. This is all experience. So just focus
your attention on experience. Notice that you are aware that
you are conscious. So here we'll be using the words
attention, awareness and consciousness, interchangeably, they all mean the same
thing for our purposes here. Notice that you are conscious
right now. That's real for you. Your consciousness right now
is more real than anything else. There is nothing more
real for you than your consciousness. There is nothing more
real than your experience. So now, take out your hands
like this, and put them in front of you maybe
a foot or two in front. And just look at
your hand and become fully conscious that this hand is
real, and it exists right now right here. And now
I want you to bring to mind your ideas about
God. At the same time as you're looking at this
and bring to mind your ideas of of what you
think God is what you've been told, what you hear
me say about it, what you've heard some Zen master
say about it, what you've heard Jesus say about it,
or whatever. Bring those ideas to mind. And now I
want you to notice the difference between those ideas of
God, and this hand. Become conscious of that difference. And
now recognize that this hand is what I mean when
I say God, not any of those ideas you have.
So now keep looking at your hand. And now make
a shift in your mind that what I'm actually talking
about what I'm talking about you as being God, I'm
not talking about some sort of airy fairy metaphysical ideas
out there somewhere. Some kind of fantasy, some kind of
Christian, Judeo Christian version of God, what I'm talking about
is the actual physical conscious experience that you're having right
now. Which, of course, is not limited to your hand,
but it includes your arm. It includes your clothing, the
clothing that you're wearing over your body. It includes the
physical objects in this room, it includes the entire room.
So there's nothing special about the hand that makes it
God, rather the entire bubble of experience right here that
you are experiencing, no matter what it is. This is
what we mean by God. So throw away all of
your ideas about God. You don't need them anymore. Because
you've got the actual thing right here. It would be
sort of like you're sitting on a horse and then
you're having fantasies about horses, and you're wondering what our
horses do. And so you're sitting on a horse and
you're thinking about horses very deeply, you're closing your eyes,
and you're imagining horses, and you're trying to think what
is a horse, what is a horse, but meanwhile, you're
sitting on a horse. So the mistake is to close
your eyes and get lost in the ideas of horses,
rather than looking down at the horse that you're sitting
on. That's the thing that that matters. When you've got
the actual horse right underneath you, you don't need the
ideas of horses, you don't need people's stories about horses,
you don't need their opinions about horses, you don't need
to go to an encyclopedia, to read about what a
horse is. You just look down, and you pet the
horse. That's what the horse is. Likewise here with God.
You don't need some gurus ideas about God, you've got
God right here. It's just a matter of recognizing something
that you're not presently recognizing. So you might be wondering,
now, of course, well, Leo, if, if my hands are
gone, and this is just God isn't. I mean, so
what's the big deal? Nothing has changed. It's just a
word game. It sounds like you're just playing semantics here.
Well, of course, we're not just playing semantics, something very
profound is being said beyond mere semantics and word games,
the difficulty is guiding you into realizing that difference. So
how we do that is, we need to strip all
of the conceptual baggage that you have constructed, to make
sense of and to explain this present experience that's happening
right now. What's happening right now is God, the problem
is that you're not fully recognizing what it is for
what it is, because you've created so many stories, since
childhood, about what is really happening in this present moment,
these stories are so powerful, so compelling, and so lodged
in your mind at the subconscious level that you can't
even imagine the constructive power they have right now, upon
your sense of reality. So in a sense, we have
to deconstruct those stories and explanations, to create an empty
room for you to then be able to realize the
significance of what God is. So here's how we do
that. So focus your attention, and awareness on this present
bubble of experience that you have this room that you're
in. Now, when you disrupt stripping away all of the
conceptual background structure that you've constructed to explain what this
experience is, because you think you know what this experience
is. For example, let's start by removing the earth from
the equation. So you think that you're sitting here and
that this experience is happening on planet Earth? It isn't.
I want you to recognize that the idea of planet
Earth is an idea. It's a story. It's a conceptual
background, that you are placing underneath this present experience in
order to ground it and to explain it away. Now,
this is going to be difficult for some people to
swallow this. You're going to have a lot of excuses.
You're gonna want to tell me but Leo, what are
you talking about? You're losing your mind here. I mean,
of course, this is earth, where else would I be
if not on Earth? Recognize that that is more concepts
and more stories. So see, what you do is you
create a story, and then you create another story underneath
that story. And then another story to excuse that story
and to justify that story. And so you have layers
upon layers of stories, backing up stories, which creates a
sense of reality. And so, the difficulty here is removing
all the layers of story And of course, as we
tried to do that your mind will try to construct
new stories, to replace the old stories or to justify
why the old stories should remain intact. Because your mind
doesn't want to remove all the stories, because then it
would be lost. That would be a deconstruction of your
mind, you might even start to feel like you're losing
your mind when we remove all the stories. But just
go with me here, this is an experiment, have some
courage to test this out and see what happens. I'm
not telling you to believe me, just do it, do
it. Right now, remove your idea of planet Earth. pretend
as though Planet Earth doesn't exist, and you've never heard
about it. So you see, we're taking a little bit
away from this present experience. Now this present experience becomes
a little bit more mysterious, you see, because now where
is it happening, this present experience this bubble. But we
need to take more away. Let's take away the entire
physical universe as well, not just the earth. So notice
that this present experience for you, it's not just a
bubble of experience floating in a void for you. It's
couched inside of various scientific schemes such as Planet Earth.
And the entire cosmos and universe as science knows it,
which you you have a image in your mind of
the Big Bang, it happened 14 billion years ago. And
then there was Star Dust, and there were molecules floating
out in space. And then they congealed and created stars
and Planet Earth was formed. And that is orbiting around
the sun and, and this this whole thing. So I
want you to forget all of that. Notice that it's
just a story. pretend as though you've never even heard
this story before. If you can successfully do that, you'll
notice that this experience becomes a little bit more mysterious
than it used to be. Because you don't have an
explanation for why it's here, or what it even is.
Now, I want you to strip away any ideas you
have from science, any scientific explanations you have for this
experience, which will include molecules, atoms, maybe some sort of
quantum mechanical stuff that you are using to explain away
what's happening here. So when you're looking at your hand,
for example, and I asked you, what is your hand
made out of? You're gonna say his manner molecules and
atoms. I want you to notice that this is more
story and ideas, concepts. This is not actually what you're
seeing. In this hand, you are not seeing any molecules
or atoms in this hand, you're not seeing any quantum
mechanics in this hand. You might say, well, the hands
matter of energy, or matter, but you're not seeing any
energy or matter in this hand. These are ideas, abstractions,
and concepts. Fully ground yourself in the raw experience of
the hand. So the colors of the hand is really
what the hand is made out of. Not molecules and
atoms. This is from your direct experience, you don't need
to believe me here. This is not another story. Right?
Color is what you see, shape is what you see.
That's what your hand is literally made out of. Please
become conscious of that right now. And realize that atoms
and molecules and quantum mechanics and energy and matter is
something you're projecting onto. overlaying on top of the colors
and the shapes of which the hand is actually made.
So throw that away. Get as close and direct to
your experience as possible, with no intermediary interpretations, overlays or
projections. just strictly what's here is all that we care
about. We want to remove everything that isn't strictly here
right now. So if you're successful in doing this, once
again, this entire experience and your hand becomes more mysterious,
even more mysterious than it was. Because now, you don't
have a ready made explanation for what the colors and
shapes are and where they came from, what is sourcing,
the colors and the shapes. But of course, we're not
done yet. Now we need to remove other scientific models
and imagery that you have in your mind in order
to really fully get you into the present moment and
into your direct experience. So now here comes a very
radical step, are you ready for this? As you're looking
at your hand, I want you to remove the notion
of biology, strip your experience of any biological notions, that
this is a biological part of a biological organism, of
an animal, of an ape of a humanoid. Recognize that
that too, is just concepts and stories and models. And
that that is not actually, strictly speaking, in the direct
experience, there is no direct experience of you being human.
as outrageous as that sounds, that is the case, please
notice this, you don't need to believe me, just notice
it. It is the case that there is no humaneness
here. There is no biology happening here. There is no
chemistry happening here. And there is no physics happening here.
Now, take the story you have in your mind that
you've been told by science, that this hand, and that
all of us experience here is just a byproduct of
neurons in a physical human brain. Recognize that that too
is just a story and a projection and an overlay.
Pure concepts, you do not actually find any brain. In
your direct experience, there is no brain and there is
no neurons. So throw all that away. And now look
at your hand. And you should start to notice if
you've been doing all this, that your hand is getting
more and more mysterious. What is it doing here? Because
we've stripped away all the explanations for why the hand
is here, or what is sourcing the hand, how it's
being created. So there's a sort of emptiness that's, that's
being generated. Now, you don't really know what the hand
is. Notice if there is a subtle image in your
mind that the hand is part of a human body.
And that what you are as a human and that
the hand is just a part of the human body.
And the human body is just this living thing made
out of cells. Take that whole narrative and throw it
away. pretend as though you've never even heard about it.
Because it's not present in your direct experience. That's a
conceptual overlay. Take the idea that you are a human
body and that there is a human body sitting here
and throw that away. There is not a human body
sitting here, you do not find that in your direct
experience. What you see is a hand this hand is
actually severed from this hand. There is no you don't
see a connection between this hand and this hand. There
are two separate things. And this whole idea you have
of a body, you don't actually see a body you
see pieces of things. You see some clothing here you
see some different colors. That's what you actually see. You
don't see that full sort of human body the way
you imagine it. You don't even see the back of
your head. Notice that the skull that you imagine you
have. This is just concepts. You don't actually see any
skull. So throw all that away now we're getting in
a little bit more crazy. Now I'm going to ask
you to do something really crazy. Are you ready for
this? So while you're looking at this hand, I want
you to take the idea that you were born as
a biological entity. So this this idea, you have in
your mind that the way that you got here, like,
if I ask you, how did you get to this
present moment, you in your mind will say, Well, I
came to the, to this moment from yesterday. And I
came to yesterday from the day before, and I came
to that from last year, and I came to that
year from the year before. And ultimately, you get all
the way back, you rewind the clock, until you get
to your birth. And you say, Well, I came out
of my mother. And that's how I got here. And
where did she come from, she came out of her
mother. And my father came out of his mother, and
so on going back, and back and back, millions of
years. So, take all of that. Recognize that that's just
story and concept, and overlay, and throw all that away.
So I'm asking you to literally throw away the idea
of your birth. That's a big ask. You're probably going
to have excuses for why you shouldn't throw that away,
or why it would be insane to throw that away.
Because it's real. These things I'm asking you to throw
away to you, all these things feel real. So it's
like asking you to throw away reality. So you're not
going to want to do it. But if you're wise,
do it anyways, and see what happens. It's this is
an experiment treat, treat this as an experiment to see
what happens. So, so now, throw away your birth. Such
that now, if I asked you, where did this experience
come from? Notice that if you followed all the steps
up to this point, you are not allowed to say
that well, this is these colors and sounds. This is
just the perceptions of a biological, ape like organism that
was born from a mother on planet Earth, inside of
the Milky Way galaxy in the universe that came out
from a big bang. You can no longer say that,
because we got rid of all those stories and ideas
and projections. So now when I asked you, where did
this experience come from? What do you say? If you
did this process correctly, you should be left speechless. You
don't know where it came from? You literally do not
know. It's a complete mystery. So now what I want
you to do is just to sit and bask in
the not knowing while you're looking at your hands. And
I want you to to experience the profundity of what's
happening right now. Cuz usually, we go through our lives
and we're not experiencing how profound existence is or consciousness
is because we we already have already made set up
stories that explains it all the way and makes it
feel mundane and unremarkable. But now, for the first time
in your life, I want you to really train your
consciousness on the fact that this moment exists. And it's
completely mysterious, completely unknown, because we removed all the stories.
And yet, here it is. It exists. But what is
it that you're looking at when you're looking at this
hand try to just become conscious of the astounding fact
that anything exists at all. Doesn't matter whether it's a
hand or a table or a car. Just keep looking
at this hand and now become fully conscious of the
astounding fact that there is anything at all in existence
and that you're looking at it right now. How amazing
is that? You don't know where this hand came from.
You don't know what it is? Because you were removed
the idea of atoms, molecules Energy matter, and you've removed
the idea of biology. So you've removed cells from the
equation. You don't see any cells here, you see, colors
and shapes, there's no cells, notice that. And you've even
stripped away the idea that you were born, that this
hand came out of some woman, at some point, as
part of a biological organism. So stripped out away from
your experience, I also now want you to strip away
the idea that this hand is alive. Because that's also
an idea. You don't have a direct experience, actually, of
life, or a living thing here. This hand is not
alive, that's a projection, throw that away. And now we
need to throw away the whole background of human history.
So in history class, you were taught where humans came
from, you were taught that, for example, if you're American,
then your ancestors probably came from England. And then the
English ancestors, you know, they came from, maybe from from
Rome, or from from Germany, from the European continent. And
then those came ultimately from Africa, they teach you, and
then those, whatever, you know, those came from monkeys, and
those monkeys came from, from mammals. And then those mammals
came from dinosaurs and reptiles, or fish or whatever. And
you have this whole lineage. You have a whole history
of like there was, you know, the American Revolution. Then
before that there was the, the French Revolution. And before
that there was all sorts of stuff you learn from
European history, you know, there was the Roman Empire, before
that there was the Egyptian empire and kingdom. And before
that, there was other stuff, there was Mesopotamia, and there's
Babylon, whatever ideas you have. So take all that and
realize that none of that is present in your direct
experience. All that is just stories and projections, throw all
that away. And now here's the next really big step,
rather challenging. Now, I want you to throw away the
idea of time. So you think, traditionally, you think that
this hand is however old you are, you think you're
20 years old, 30 years old, 40 years old, 60
years old, doesn't matter. You think this hand is a
certain number of years old, throw that away. But not
just that, there's more to time than just years. Now,
I want you to become conscious of the fact that
you're actually holding time and imagining time in your awareness
right now, you are actually imagining that time is flowing.
As I'm speaking, you think time is occurring. Now, of
course, I am speaking and stuff is moving. But that
is not the same thing as time. So this is
a little bit of a subtle distinction where you have
to, you have to recognize that time is a is
an overlay that you are projecting upon this present experience.
So the present experience is happening, stuff is moving. But
it's actually not happening through time. There are no seconds,
minutes, hours, years, days, months, weeks, throw all that away.
That's just a projection. You don't experience any of that
actually, you don't experience seconds flying by. You don't experience
minutes or hours or days. And you furthermore don't experience
a direction to time. You might think that Well, time
is moving from right to left, or however you conceive
of it is moving in a certain direction. There's a
timeline. As years pass, or seconds past time moves this
way and doesn't move the other way. Throw that away.
That whole thing is just a projection. There is no
direction here. Motion is happening but it has no direction.
So now you're sitting here looking at this experience, and
specifically now at your hand. And now, things have become
really mysterious. You don't know what this head is made
out of, you don't know where it came from. You
don't know why it's here. You don't know what it's
a part of. You don't know what its function is.
And now look at this hand and look at it
as though it does not exist within time. Literally, try
to see that this hand is timeless. And now take
your consciousness and shift it away from the hand and
put it on to consciousness itself. So take consciousness and
put it on the fact that you're conscious itself. And
start to wonder what is consciousness and remove any projections
you have about consciousness, because remember, in the past are
used to explain consciousness is just something that biological organisms
have biological organisms are born with consciousness which is produced
by the brain. But we removed all those. So now
just become conscious of the mystery of consciousness. Where did
it come from? What is it doing? What is it
made out of? It's not out of atoms, or molecules,
or cells or neurons, it's now happening in the brain.
It's not happening to a biological creature, an ape who
is walking on planet Earth, because we threw all that
away consciousness, just consciousness, the mystery of consciousness and become
conscious now that consciousness is all that there is. This
is not a belief, this is literally your direct experience.
There is nothing but consciousness in your direct experience. Now
consciousness can shift and you can focus on different aspects
of itself, you can focus your consciousness on the hand,
you can focus it on itself, consciousness focused on consciousness.
You could focus it on various physical objects, maybe there's
a chair in your room, maybe there's a couch, maybe
there's the floor or the wall, the ceiling, the lights,
a cat, a dog in the room, you could focus
your consciousness on those things. But no matter where you
focus your consciousness, it's always consciousness. So now I want
you to shift your consciousness from itself out into the
room. Look at that lamp, look at that couch, look
at that wall, look at that ceiling. Look at that
cat, look at that dog, whatever's around you. And notice
as you're looking at any of these objects, that they
are literally made out of consciousness. The same as your
hand you're conscious of the dog, you're conscious of the
couch, you're conscious of the lamp. Just like your hand
just like yourself. And now expand your consciousness to occupy
the entire room, like a bubble of consciousness. And notice
that this entire bubble is what you are, you are
this bubble of consciousness. You are not the body inside
of the bubble. You are the whole bubble of which
the body is just one part of all the other
parts. And this, how do you know that you are
the whole bubble? Well look, you can move your head
and the bubble moves with your head. Every object moves
with the bubble. No matter where you look. It's just
a bubble. You are the entire bubble and now as
you're conscious of the entire bubble start to wonder where
did this bubble come from? What is this bubble Where
is this bubble? And notice if your mind brings up
any kind of the old stories that we were supposed
to throw away, because it probably will, you'll probably say,
Oh, well, this bubble is just inside of a brain,
which is just part of a human body, which is
just a creature who's walking on top of the Earth,
which is spinning around the Sun, which is part of
the Milky Way Galaxy, which is part of the universe,
which is came from the Big Bang, 14 billion years
ago. throw all that away. None of that is part
of your direct experience of this bubble. So one thing
I want you to take away from this exercise is
that even though scientifically minded people love to tout science
as this hard, objective, purely factual, activity, and that spirituality
is the opposite of that spirituality is just airy fairy
belief systems and fairy tales, and wishful thinking, and soft
thinking, which is not grounded any kind of reality. And
it's just pure philosophy and pure mental masturbation, talking about
God and such things, and spirits. And now, I want
you to flip that completely around. To realize that spirituality
is what we are doing here. Spirituality is the most
tangible, the most practical, the most hard of activities that
you can do as a human being when you're doing
it correctly, as we're doing it here now. And then
actually, it's science, which is pure abstraction, pure conjecture, pure
story, pure projection, pure overlay, pure assumption, and pure wishful
thinking. It's pure imagination, fantasy, utter fantasy, atoms, molecules, apes,
biology, evolution, throw all of it away. It's pure fantasy.
What's real is consciousness and nothing but consciousness. Even minutes,
and seconds, and hours, are fantasy. So you're sitting here
as his bubble, you stripped away all of the concepts
from this bubble. Now, just take a moment and allow
yourself to sit here in peaceful meditation. There's nothing you
need to do. There's nothing you need to think. There's
nothing you need to explain. There's nothing you need to
imagine. Just sit with raw, direct experience, and consciousness of
the entire room that you're in. If your mind imagines
things, and projections, scientific stories, History, Biology, whatever, personal memories
from the past, recognize that all of those are just
ideas that are arising within consciousness. Don't give them any
import. Don't give them any significance. Don't believe them. Believe
direct experience. Notice that all of those ideas are pure
fantasy. And now you're ready to perhaps get a taste
of what God is. So now, looking at your hands
again, and being very careful to make sure that all
of that fantasy has been stripped away. You should be
sitting in a totally rather empty experience. It should feel
kind of hollow, you're sitting here. You're conscious of stuff.
There's colors or sounds, but none of it has any
explanation anymore because we've stripped all the background explanation away
from everything. And if there are still explanations that you
have that I didn't guide you to this strip away,
throw them all away yourself. So what do I mean
when I say that you are God? God is an
infinitely conscious, singular being that exists mysteriously for its own
sake, and nobody else. It doesn't exist in space, or
time. And it's not made out of anything. Not matter,
not energy, not anything. It's completely groundless and unknown. And
yet, it is conscious. And it exists. And it is
a sentient being. There's one thing we forgot to strip
away. For you to make sense of what I just
said, we need to strip away of course, this one's
difficult. Are you ready for this? We need to strip
away the fantasy of other beings. Your entire life, you've
imagined that you are one biological being amongst millions of
others. Now, as you sit here, and you're fully conscious
strictly of what is actually present, in your experience, you
can perhaps become conscious that all other beings, humans, animals,
and so forth, are of course, just pure fantasy and
projection. Have you ever experienced any other beings? No, only
you, you are the only being that you've ever experienced.
So I want you to throw away the idea of
other beings as though they never even existed. I want
you to throw away the idea of other bubbles similar
to yours that exists somewhere else in the universe. throw
that all away. I want you to throw away the
idea that there are other planets on which they are
live other beings, living life independently of you out, you
throw all that away. I want you to throw away
the idea that there are other rooms in your house.
throw all that away. That's fantasy. There is nothing in
the universe, but this right now. This is not a
belief. This is not a philosophy. Just notice and become
conscious that that is literally what is the case. For
you. I am merely telling you what is the case
for you. Have you done that good. Now you're sitting
here, all alone. You're conscious. You can become conscious of
you. As this sentient being that is sitting here. You
can move your hands. You can say things. You can
feel things. But you have no idea what any of
these things are. Because we stripped away all the explanations
and stories and projections. And now I'm telling you that
as you're looking at your hands, you're looking at God.
God is the universe, being conscious of itself experiencing itself
as sentient and intelligent, and feeling, seeing hearing and whatever
else you're doing. That's what reality is. Reality is a
bubble of sentience. But you might still wonder why do
you call it God? Why would this be called God?
Well, it's not human. It's not biological. It's not an
ape. It's not a hominid. It's not a Homo Sapien.
It's not matter. It's not energy. It's not atoms. It's
not cells. It's not neurons. It's not brains. So what
is it it's just consciousness. Pure consciousness. But now you
ask, well, what is consciousness? What consciousness can't be divined
defined, because it has no ground. Consciousness is not anything.
It's nothing. Consciousness is not made out of building blocks.
Like atoms. Consciousness is an infinite field, a singular infinite
field, which morphs and changes and takes on various properties,
colors, sounds, smells, feelings, thoughts. It's a sentient field. One
of the most crucial things you have to understand here
is that this field is not human. You are not
human. Think back to where the idea came from, that
you are human. At one point, somebody indoctrinated you with
this idea, and you just believed it like a sucker.
There is, in fact, no evidence that you are human.
But again, why do we call it God? We call
it God because it's eternal. It's divine. How is this
experience here divine? Well, to see it as divine and
eternal, you need to strip away all of the humaneness
from it, you need to strip away all of the
biology from it. All of the chemistry, all of the
physics, strip all that away, if you succeed in doing
that, and then you also need to strip away time,
strip away remember the idea of time. If you fully
succeed in doing that, this experience will literally turn into
absolute absolute being not biological, not physical, not material, not
in time and space. But eternity. So, for this to
you, for you to really get this, you need to
now strip away again, because this is so difficult to
do, strip away once again, the idea that you were
born experienced this present moment as though it's existed, by
itself independent of any prior moments that you might be
imagining. Because again, prior moments are fantasy. There are no
prior moments, there was no birth, there is no history
to the universe. This is it. This bottle right now,
is it. And if you can succeed in stripping all
that away, you will recognize that this here is eternal
eternity. Outside of time and space. This moment, is timeless.
It's been happening for forever. Every single moment exists for
ever, it has existed forever. You are not a human
who was born on a rock, circling the sun in
some Galaxy somewhere. You are an infinite sentient being who
has been conscious for ever. You have been sitting here
imagining this room and all other people and galaxies and
stars and planets and animals and objects and your parents
and your birth and human history and human civilization. You've
been imagining this for ever without beginning or end, and
you will keep being here for forever. Because you're also,
of course, imagining your death in the same way that
you're imagining your birth. And now, look at your hand
and see your hand for the first time for what
it really is. Your hand is not a finite, biological,
physical object, your hand is matter of pure infinite consciousness,
look at your hand, recognize that this hand, you could
zoom into it forever. And you would see more structure
and more structure and more structure, like a fractal of
infinite consciousness. This hand has no scale, it has no
dimension, it has no inches or meters, it is not
happening within time. This is the universe's hands. Move your
hands. And as you do so recognize that you are
moving your fingers with the full power of the entire
universe. This is the entire universe, the universe is not
made of stars and planets and things. This is the
whole universe, you are the whole universe. These hands have
existed forever. Now move your hands with complete recognition of
these hands as being the hands of God. Look at
the beauty and profundity and intelligence of the design of
your hands. The intelligence with which they move the perfection
of these hands. These hands are infinite. And now for
the final move, take your consciousness and turn it completely
inwards as though you're kind of looking inside of your
skull. At the very heart of who you feel you
are. Looking at your own face, as it were, of
course, there's no face. What do you see? What are
you conscious of, there's no face here. What you're conscious
of is pure consciousness itself. There is like a empty,
white, transparent void. Right where your face you used to
imagine was, there is a pure, just a pure field
of consciousness right here. This consciousness if you focus it
on it more and more and more and more kind
of turn your gaze inward as you're looking inside of
your skull, and just hold your consciousness there. And recognize
that what you're looking at is you're looking at the
very heart of what you are, which is pure, infinite
empty consciousness, this void inside your skull goes on forever,
it's infinitely deep. That's what you are pure, empty infinite
consciousness. And in that void is arising this entire bubble
including these hands including the sounds and the feelings in
your body and the thoughts in your mind. And so
you are this infinite eternal void, which is literally imagining
and dreaming up the entire material world around itself, including
these hands, including thoughts and ideas and projections. And out
of this you are constructing a life. And then you
are creating layers of stories including physics, chemistry, biology, history,
cosmology, astrophysics. You're creating ideas such as that there are
atoms and there are planets and there are stars and
there are galaxies and that you were born that you're
going to die that there are other people. And you're
you're you're imagining all of this and it's materializing around
you as this infinite void that you are And although
right now, you may not be fully conscious of it,
because your state of consciousness is not sufficiently high to
allow you to see this, actually, you are willfully generating
all of this stuff. You are generating every single one
of these fantasies, and you are even generating, for example,
the shape and structure of your hands and how they
move, you are imagining this with your consciousness, even though
your ego doesn't have control over it per se within
your current state. And so here you are the universe
just sitting here. You can't go anywhere. Because you're absolutely
inevitable. You have to exist precisely as you exist right
now. And if you existed as something else, you would
exist that way, not this way. And it would have
to be that way, rather than this way. But you
have to exist in some way. So this is the
way in which you exist right now. And this what
you're experiencing is absolute truth. bring to mind any ideas
you have, when I say the word truth? What is
truth? What do you think is the ultimate truth? bring
to mind any ideas? Now, compare that with actual truth.
Everything you're conscious of right now, in every moment, that
is actual Absolute Truth, and any of your ideas, throw
them away. That's not truth. That's fantasy. Everything that's ever
happening, anything you're actually experiencing anything you're conscious of, that's
absolute truth. It's very important that you strip away the
projection that this here, this is just a veil of
perceptions, and that there's some deeper reality behind the colors
behind the sounds behind the feelings as though this bubble
here like Leo, this bubble. These are just perceptions. It's
just perceptions, perceptions could be an illusion, they could be
wrong. No, perceptions could not be an illusion, they could
not be wrong. That is the illusion. The illusion is
that perceptions could be wrong or are an illusion. per
se, perception is absolute truth. That's it. And there's nothing
beyond perceptions. And remember, perceptions are not occurring to a
biological organism to a human. Perceptions are actually God. Perceptions
are actually the cosmos, being conscious of itself. Reality is
such a thing, that it is fully, absolutely conscious of
itself. And whatever it's conscious of is precisely exactly what
exists. Nothing more, nothing less. What you're conscious of right
now, is all that exists. You are the entire universe.
You are conscious right now of the entire universe. Now
you say but Leo, what about the planet Mars? I'm
not conscious of what's happening on the planet Mars. There
is nothing to the planet Mars, other than your fantasy
of there being a planet Mars, and there being something
on the planet Mars for you to become conscious of.
That's what the planet Mars is. The planet Mars is
not a place that you go to and become conscious
of stuff. The planet Mars is a fantasy that you're
imagining right now. And you're saying well, Leo, but I'm
not experiencing what other humans are experiencing. So, I can't
possibly be the whole universe. You are the whole universe
fantasizing, that there are others, besides You, who are experiencing
something other than you but Leo, this is complete solipsism.
Again, you are projecting something you heard other humans say.
And you are imagining, but there is this philosophy called
solipsism, which has some bad connotations to it. And it's
somehow negative and horrible. And you are projecting that onto
the present moment. That's actually what you're doing. I want
you to understand that spirituality is absolutely nothing but you
being conscious, fully conscious of exactly what you're doing. As
you're doing the more you do spirituality, the more conscious
you become, of how you fantasize things into existence such
that you stop being fooled by your own fantasies. This
is it. Reality is an illusion of consciousness. And that's
what God is. God is the universe dreaming itself into
existence through imagination. And what is God made out of
it's made out of nothing. And now for the final
ultimate move. I want you to look around this room,
look at your hands, feel any emotions in your body?
Notice any thoughts that are coming up just taking the
entire moment. And as you're sitting here, I want you
to recognize in one fell swoop that this entire moment
these hands are absolutely nothing. Strip away every possible projection
and fantasy until you even strip away the idea that
something is happening here. That this is something it's not
something it's nothing. Or you could recognize that something and
nothing are indistinguishable and therefore identical. And that actually, as
you're sitting here, all that is happening is nothing. Even
though it looks like something your mind is going to
want to come up with excuses. And to reject what
is being said here, even though what's being said is
patently obvious, because it's occurring directly in your experience. Your
mind is so used to fantasy that it's going to
want to try to jump into fantasy mode and come
up with fantasies in order to challenge what's absolutely true
and obvious. Because your mind probably doesn't like this. Your
mind might be scared of this. It might think that
this is bad or evil. You might not like the
idea that you're all alone, and that others don't exist,
or are fantasies in your mind. You might not like
the idea that you are God. You might not like
the idea that there is no history. You might not
like the idea that there's no universe but just sit
here, sit in the emptiness. sit and enjoy the emptiness
of what you are. Recognize that you don't need. You
don't need a bunch of fantasies. The fantasies that you
used to cling to are not necessary anymore. You don't
need science. You don't need religion. You don't need history.
You don't need psychology, you don't need biology. You don't
need a life history. You don't need a personal story.
You don't need your memories. You don't need your parents,
you don't need your friends, you don't need anybody. Because
you're God. Why would God need anybody? God is complete.
God is absolute. God is everything. God imagines everything. And
when you fully accept this and embrace this, which you
might struggle to do for a while, but when you
fully embrace this, and surrender to it, and accept yourself
as God, there is no problems. You don't need anything.
Because you're complete. This moment is perfect. Just stop imagining
other things. If you remove all your fantasies, this moment
will be perfect. And you will sit here happily in
peace forever you will be sitting here forever, because you
have been sitting here forever imagining all sorts of things.
And of course, the final thing to realize is that
God is love and that you are love. What is
love has to do with it well love is just
the complete acceptance of who and what you are, and
the embracing of everything that exists as your own self.
After all, if you recognize that this is all that
exists, and all that exists is you this entire bubble
is you and you are creating this entire bubble. This
is what you are the then what point is there
in resisting it. What point is there in hating it.
There's no point. Once you accept it and embrace it,
then you see the magic of it. The magic of
the fact that it exists at all that anything exists
at all. And you love it. When you take your
consciousness and you turn it inwards here into your skull
area, and you notice that what exists here is not
a skull or a face, but actually pure, empty infinity.
infinite consciousness. If you keep zooming into that, you'll also
recognize that that empty infinity is also love. It's pure
infinite love. It's pure unity. And when you look at
your hands, you recognize that your hands are absolute truth.
They are the truth. They are the hands of God,
they are timeless, they are eternal. They are forever even
though they are aging and at the same time they
are made out of love because all of consciousness is
just made out of love. And what is love, love
is nothing. Love has no substance to love is just
infinite empty consciousness which is fully unified with itself fully
accepts itself as what it is without needing or wanting
to be anything but what it is because it's completely
in love with itself and then you realize that everything
is perfect. Reality is perfect. Reality cannot be made better,
because it's already eternal. Infinite, beautiful and perfect. And then
you just sit here. And you just bask in that.
You stop, you're fantasizing, you stop thinking, and you just
sit silently. In what we call meditation, you just sit.
But really what you're meditating upon is the fact that
you are God. conscious of itself, totally loving itself totally
accepting itself, just being what it is. Because it can't
be otherwise. You can't be anything other than what you
are. Absolute Truth, absolute love, absolute consciousness, infinity. And so
you sit here in your room for the next hour,
and you just enjoy it. Recognizing that you have solved
the entire riddle of the universe. And having solved it,
having unraveled the entire illusion, there's nothing more to do.
There's nowhere to go. There's nothing to get. There's nothing
to pursue or to aspire to. Because existence is all
there is. And you are it, you are existence. So
you just sit and you bask in the joy of
existing. And that is true spirituality. Everything else is bullshit.
It's just the simple. That's all of spirituality. Now, of
course, your state of consciousness can change. So right now
your state of consciousness is not very high. Even if
you went through this exercise, it might have elevated your
consciousness a little bit, but your baseline state of consciousness
still very low, there's a lot more you could become
conscious of. For example, you could become omniscient. You could
become conscious of crazy things that you can't even imagine
right now. But no matter what state of consciousness you're
in, it doesn't ultimately matter. Because every state is equally
God. It's just that some states allow you to see
more of God and some states allow you to see
less of God. But all states are God. And it
really doesn't matter what state you're in, per se, although,
of course, it also does matter. Because the higher states
allow you to fully feel and recognize what I've been
talking about here. Because to be honest, even if you
went carefully through all of this exercise, which I hope
you did, the majority of you will still not have
actually fully fully understood or even partially understood. Become directly
conscious of what I was talking about here. You got
a little bit of a push towards the right direction
here. We've corrected many misconceptions you might have had, this
is all good stuff. Very important. But did you fully
realize yourself as God? Probably not? Maybe a few of
you did. If you did, it would knock you to
the floor. Right here, this is not, this is not
a realization you're going to overlook. If you're sitting there
thinking like Well, yeah, maybe I did well, but I'm
not sure you didn't. That means you didn't. When you
fully realize yourself as god, you're gonna be fucking sure
you're gonna be real fucking sure. There's nothing more sure
of that you'll ever be in your life. So if
you didn't have the full God realization yet, don't worry.
This is a process right? Don't expect to get this
in one day. This might take you some number of
years to get if you really want to understand what
I was communicating here. I highly recommend that you try
this guided exercise on a psychedelic responsibly, carefully without getting
yourself into trouble or hurting yourself. But if you take
a psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms or DMT, or something
like that, and you go through this exercise, you may
not even need to go through this exercise, you might
just get it just by taking enough psychedelic, but, but
if you take the psychedelic, and you go through this
exercise, that will maximize your chances of getting it. Now,
that doesn't mean you won't lose it, you might get
it, then you might lose it, you might get it
again, you might lose it again. But still, even if
you get it and lose it, it's still better than
never having gotten it at all. So, in this work,
you kind of do the best you can you take
whatever you can get. Whatever mystical experiences you can get,
you take them, and then you keep doing the practices.
And over the years, you become better and better. And
you remove all the fantasies and you become more understanding
of what true spirituality is about. And you deconstruct more
and more of your stories of science and religion and
New Age ideas, and all this, you deconstruct all that.
And then eventually, you're just left in this pure sort
of Zen state of God consciousness. And then you're happy,
you're satisfied. And then you understand everything. You understand that
everything is not understandable. That's the nature of God. It's
a mystery to its own self. Because it's infinite. The
nature of infinity is that infinity is mysterious, even to
itself. Because it keeps going and going and going forever.
So it can never fully reach its own end or
limit, because it has none. And that's it. See, very
different from what you thought spirituality is, isn't it? Very
different. Because when you're reading books about spirituality, your head
gets filled with so many fantasies and ideas of what
it actually is. And it turns out that it's not
that at all. The map is not the territory. So
what you really learned if you did this lesson here
is you learn the lesson of the map is not
the territory. What I was pointing you towards here is
the territory. Keep focusing your consciousness on the territory carefully,
avoiding getting lost in the maps. Even though the maps
are important and necessary. They ultimately become an obstacle. Eventually
you want to throw away all the maps and just
bask in the territory itself. And then that is the
ultimate form of meditation is just you existing as the
territory as God as the universe as love as consciousness
as absolute truth, as nothingness as everything and just being
content with that. Alright, I'm done here. Please click that
