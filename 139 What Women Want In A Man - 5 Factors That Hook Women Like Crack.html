            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/JoRlb6xcymA' target='_blank'>What Women Want In A Man - 5 Factors That Hook Women Like Crack</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding what women want in a man</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of men understanding the desires, needs, and the psychology of women. It helps to attract them and maintain the relationship. Making an effort to understand women deeply and comprehensively, without relying on women's own explanations, yields more fruitful results.
</li><li><b>Women's psychology and wants</b>: Women are usually not interested in deeply analyzing their feelings, desires, or mechanics of love Â– these aspects often happen spontaneously and naturally to them. Primarily, they desire deep emotional intimacy in a relationship. They are more emotionally-focused and socially driven compared to men.
</li><li><b>Women's strength in relationship-building</b>: Biological evidence shows that women's brains are wired more towards relationship building and verbal skills compared to male brains, which are more wired towards logical analysis. Women tend to be more caring, spontaneous, nurturing, and free-flowing in relationships.
</li><li><b>Desired qualities in a man</b>: Women look for multiple qualities in a man including good looks, security, social status, loyalty, confidence, humor, a sense of detachment, edginess, adventure, and deep intimate sex. However, not all these qualities are deal-breakers; women may settle for something less than everything.
</li><li><b>The importance of confidence in a man</b>: Confidence is a highly valued quality in a man. A lack of confidence may make him less attractive to women.
</li><li><b>Dating and relationship market</b>: The dating and relationship market is like an auction system where people shop around for the mate that would maximize the survival of their offspring. Both men and women have their own list of desired qualities in a potential partner and are usually willing to settle with less than everything they ideally want.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about what women want</b>: Some points on the list of what women want are not as important as they are portrayed in the media, such as good looks, security, and social status. It is crucial to understand the core principles of what women truly want by interacting with them and observing their behaviors. 
</li><li><b>The ideal situation for attracting a woman</b>: Leo highlights the importance of personal development in attracting a woman. Confidence, humor, detachment from outcome, adventure, and intimate and passionate sex are key points. He discourages relying heavily on traditionally valued traits such as good looks, financial security, or social status. Personal development enriches the quality of dating as it helps to build these crucial traits.
</li><li><b>Understanding the core principles of what women want in a man</b>: Practical interactions and dating multiple women can help discover what women really want in a man. Certain qualities such as looks, security, social status, and loyalty are often considered important, but they are not absolute deal-breakers. 
</li><li><b>Looks, Security, Social Status, and Loyalty</b>: Many people believe that women prioritize good looks, financial security, high social status, and loyalty in a man. However, these are not the most important characteristics to women. People without high social status or wealth can still be successful with women, and one's physical appearance isn't as significant as often believed.
</li><li><b>Deal breakers for women in men</b>: Factors such as confidence, humor, detachment, and edginess are the most important for women. Confidence is vital, women are unlikely to date men with less confidence than themselves. Humor is essential as they seek emotional stimulation. Detachment does not refer to indifference but implies having a life purpose outside of the woman to avoid neediness. 
</li><li><b>The importance of avoiding neediness</b>: Being needy is a big turn-off for women. Men are advised to be confident in their lives without relying on women for happiness, which demonstrates the ability to maintain and prioritize a life outside of the relationship.
</li><li><b>Appreciation for edgy men</b>: Women appreciate men who are adventurous, different, and a bit dangerous. This could mean being an artist or musician, essentially someone who infuses her life with emotions and excitement.
</li><li><b>The significance of intimate, dirty sex</b>: Women value passionate and intimate sex, though society may pressure them to suppress their desires. If this aspect is fulfilled, other parts of the relationship as per looks, financial security, and social status can be overlooked.
</li><li><b>Understanding what women want in a man</b>: Leo emphasizes that important qualities in a man that are deal-breakers for women include confidence, humor, detachment, edginess, adventurousness, and the ability to engage in intimate dirty sex. 
</li><li><b>The less important factors for women</b>: While good looks, financial security, social status, and loyalty can be attractive to women, these are not as essential as the core qualities already listed. Men often build their lives to achieve these less important factors thinking it will get them their dream girl, while in reality, these factors do not provide the emotional stimulation that women desire. 
</li><li><b>Women seek emotional stimulation</b>: Women in particular seek a lot of emotional stimulation which they find within qualities like confidence, humor, adventurousness, and sexual intimacy. Factors such as financial security and social status often lack emotional stimulation for women.
</li><li><b>Personal growth for men</b>: To attract high-quality women, it is crucial for men to work on personal development and improve upon important qualities such as confidence, humor, and adventurousness.
</li><li><b>The importance of the full package</b>: There is a need for balance. While it's crucial to focus on the most important factors, ideally a man should try to improve in all areas to some extent. This will greatly improve the chances of attracting a high-quality woman. 
</li><li><b>Attracting a woman based on the right factors</b>: Attracting a woman using factors that are not as important to women can prove to be a risky strategy. Men should focus on attracting women based on factors that are essential to women - mainly their ability to stimulate women emotionally.
</li><li><b>The ultimate ideal for a woman</b>: According to Leo, a woman's ideal man is someone who is desirable to many women but chooses to give up all other options for her. This makes her feel unique and special. 
</li><li><b>Leo's personal strategy</b>: Leo concludes by recommending men to try and improve themselves in every possible way. He believes this is the key to improving one's dating quality. He also reminds viewers to stay focused on their personal development goals, as it's very easy to get distracted.
