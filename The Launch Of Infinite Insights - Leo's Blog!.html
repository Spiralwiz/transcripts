hey this is Leo for actualised org and today I'm
excited to announce the launch of actualized org insights what
this is is basically my blog where I post quick
little snippets of insights that I have throughout the week
these are less formal than my standard weekly episodes and
videos they are not in a video format they're specifically
in a text format so that they're quick to write
and also because the text format allows me to do
some things that I can't quite do this video so
that's out now you can go check it out it's
at actualized org slash insight and there's going to be
a link down below and you can also find it
a link to it on the actualized org home page
so this is of course in addition to the weekly
episodes that I do with videos so those will still
keep coming out and that's fine but see there's a
difference the reason that I had this idea for the
insights blog is because I have a ton of insights
that I'm not able to share with you which frustrates
me because I'm reading I'm researching and meditating I'm doing
all sorts of stuff throughout my week and I'm having
all these interesting and profound insights about life and about
philosophy and epistemology and spirituality and personal development and life
purpose and so forth but a lot of these insights
are just like little ones that don't warrant a giant
video and I only get to shoot 52 videos a
year so I have to be pretty selective about my
topics and also in the videos I have to be
pretty methodical to explain everything because that's kind of my
style I like to explain stuff in depth so videos
tend to be a pretty big time commitment and pretty
big energy investment for me but then there's all these
other miscellaneous insights and I of course keep notes on
those but then I wanted to like share them with
people so I'm tired of sitting on a big backlog
of notes so what I'm doing is I'm going to
be posting a lot of my notes on this blog
and you can take those and use them for your
own inquiry and for your own development so there are
some benefits to having this blog because first of all
it's in a text form which means that I can
post pictures there I can post links and stuff that
are a little bit harder to do with video and
also I get to practice writing and the writing format
is giving me more flexibility to express myself because I
get to not just kind of come up here and
talk my mouth off but I actually get to be
a little bit more precise with wording in the language
that I use which can be good and also the
blog posts are designed to be very short and sort
of half-baked they're not as comprehensive as the videos their
purpose is to just be me throwing out their seeds
of thought for you you could take those seeds and
run with them and just see what happens and that
might be better for some of you who are a
little bit more onion seeit like intermediate or advanced stages
of this work and you don't need all the methodical
explanations but you still want the motivation and you still
want those nuggets of wisdom that you can use then
you can make them your own and then you can
go and apply them and think about them philosophize about
them so that's what's going to be on this blog
also I'm going to be more Liberty to be philosophical
and speculative on this blog because when I'm shooting these
regular weekly episodes I have to be pretty practical so
that people can follow along and they don't get confused
they don't get lost and so they also get benefits
from it so they don't think that personal development is
just a idle philosophy but in this blog I'm going
to be more philosophical there's gonna be more discussion about
epistemology or abstract topics from non-duality and spirituality and so
forth and of course some very practical things will be
there as well so I already have 15 posts up
there go ahead and check it out that's what you've
got for this week as far as content goes and
let me know what you think is it working for
you if so I'm going to keep doing it I'm
pretty excited about the possibilities because there's so many fascinating
aspects of personal development that I'm just not able to
share through the videos and I've been sort of silently
suffering for the last couple years holding a lot of
this information in because I love sharing it and so
I love now having the idea of having this outlet
where I can just post stuff on the fly yes
the idea is older more half-baked and sketchy but actually
I do that as a positive so this is some
exclusive content that you're not going to find anywhere but
on actualize org and going forward in the future I
have some other ideas about exclusive content non YouTube content
that you can find only on actualize that I'll be
releasing and putting out there so that you have reason
to come to the site and you know for those
people who are taking the work a little bit more
seriously it's just another another way to engage with personal
development that's it go check it out I deliberately didn't
put a comments section under the different posts because I
wanted them to be short concise and kind of concentrated
information without all the distraction of having discussions and people
criticizing and debating back and forth if you want to
do that then you can do that on actualised org
the forum or you can do that in the video
comments section all right so I'm excited about that go
check it out leave me your comments and I'll be
back next week with the regular weekly episodes you
