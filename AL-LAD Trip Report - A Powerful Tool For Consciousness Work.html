hey this is Leo for actualised org and this episode
is my al Ladd trip report an amazing new psychedelic
tool or consciousness work warning misusing psychedelics can be dangerous
and even lethal the legality of these substances vary by
country the information provided here is for educational purposes only
you agree to take 100% responsibility for any physical mental
or legal consequences which may result from applying this information
well I am continuing my psychedelic research my journey is
not over and what I have stumbled upon is an
amazing new tool that I want to share with you
it really is the perfect companion to five Meo DMT
which I've talked about in the past and I've raved
about well let me rave a little bit about Al
Ladd and I'm going to tell you about my experiences
with it and also some of the profound implications it
can have for you if you are really interested in
getting to the bottom of truth what reality is and
you are a serious student of consciousness work so why
do I say that al ad is the perfect companion
to 5mu well five Meo is extremely extremely fast-acting and
powerful this is both its strength and its weakness it's
strong and that'll take you straight to the absolute truth
of everything but also its weakness is that it's so
fast acting and it's so powerful that you're going to
be afraid to use it and you know it's sort
of like a nuclear weapon when you detonate a nuclear
weapon it has it does a lot of damage very
quickly but then how do you gather up the pieces
how do you then build up your everyday life around
that that's a tricky thing so you can experience something
amazing during a psychedelic trip but then when you come
back into everyday reality did it really change you that's
the important question and certainly fight Emil has the potential
to change you a lot but also what I was
looking for in my research is a smaller tool right
I don't always need a sledgehammer sometimes I need like
a precision screwdriver and that's what I found with al
lat it's longer much much longer than five Meo its
prolonged it's also very mellow and easy to handle and
yet it's still very profound and unlike mushrooms which I've
also experimented with the problem with mushrooms that they're very
twisted and sort of muddy and you have some amazing
insights there for sure you can I have them but
also they're so distorted that again it's really difficult to
put it into the context that we're interested in here
which is personal development and growing your consciousness right that's
really the most valuable tool that I could find is
what are the tools that can really help me to
change the quality of my consciousness in everyday life not
just during a couple hour trip now I'm going to
tell you a lot about my trip with a lot
of details and insights and so forth and then I'll
tell you some pointers for how you can use this
for yourself if you're interested in growing in consciousness but
first a few notes let me just be very clear
here that I'm talking about psychedelics in the context of
personal development and consciousness work I am really not interested
in drug use for pleasure or recreational reasons it doesn't
interest me at all pleasure does not interest me at
all I don't care about pleasure and I don't care
about having a fun time I do not use chemicals
or substances for those purposes I don't even drink coffee
or alcohol recreationally or maybe you drink coffee for performance
enhancement at work I don't do that okay because if
I'm going to be using a chemical substance I want
to make sure that I don't use it as a
crutch and that's what we come to brah with alcohol
with chronic use of marijuana with even with coffee even
with regular toffee you're using it as a crutch what
I'm talking about here something very different I'm talking about
a shamanic usage of these substances and this is something
I want to talk more about into the future because
there's something really deep that you find when you study
shamanism and you study various traditions from the past which
go back thousands and thousands and thousands of years that
human beings in every continent across the entire globe have
been doing this is they have been using psychoactive plants
to transform their understanding of reality and their consciousness and
to develop themselves to the highest levels and for example
the works of Carlos Castaneda are really marvelous here I've
been reading and going deeper into Carlos Castaneda is work
because I've been now experimenting with psychedelics myself so now
that puts his work into a different light and there's
a lot of lessons that you really learn from Don
Juan which is the character in Carlos caseinate his work
who is the teacher who teaches the wisdom of how
to use these plants and the philosophy he has behind
him right he has a serious intent he's not [
__ ] around he's not using these things as toys
this is serious stuff and it's not always pleasant stuff
it requires a genuine intention to want to grow your
consciousness see so I'll be talking a little bit about
that as I keep going here with my trip report
but really I should probably do a whole episode on
on shamanism at some point it's really interesting to study
so al-lat what I did on Monday afternoon is I
quickly did long lectures to get out of the way
because I knew that this experience would basically take up
my entire day and then what I did is I
sat down for an hour I meditated and then I
spent 20 minutes setting my intentions for the trip and
my intention for in this case I was very serious
about setting the intentions that I wanted to be growing
my consciousness in the specific way that I want to
be growing it it's a little bit difficult to articulate
but at this point when I set intentions when I
visualize when I do affirmations any of this kind of
stuff I'm pretty precise about what I want to get
I look at the things that I need I look
at the things that I know I need to develop
in myself the things that are weaknesses within me and
then those are the things where I set my intentions
before I go into the trip and this makes a
world of difference between people who are using these substances
to grow themselves in this shamanic sort of way versus
people who are just taking these substances and then watching
cartoon reruns or going out with their friends to a
club or doing something like this right it's a totally
different experience and in fact I'm shocked because I read
the trip reports of people who use these substances recreationally
and I'm shocked at the difference that I feel the
profound insights that I'm able to get and then the
shallow insights and the shallow results that they're able to
get even though we're taking the exact same substances how
can that be well the intention and why you're doing
it the reasons you're doing this are very important of
course your your level of development and your level of
emotional maturity and also your commitment to to metaphysical understanding
is very important I get a sense that a lot
of people who take psychedelics don't really have a deep
thirst for metaphysical understanding they just don't care about the
truth so of course what they experience ends up being
pretty weak or even if it's very strong they can't
make sense of it so anyways at 4 p.m. I
consumed orally 150 micrograms of al-lat on a half empty
stomach now al-abbas sounds kind of weird you probably haven't
heard of the psychedelic before what is al lat it's
an LSD analogue so it's similar to LSD but it
has some different characteristics firstly it has a shorter duration
it lasts for about eight to ten hours really the
peak of it lasts for six hours and it starts
to taper off after six hours into 8 and 10
hours even 12 hours but LSD tends to last even
longer so has a shorter duration it's supposed to be
more visual than LSD which is pretty interesting because if
you know anything about LSD that's that's reputed to be
a very vision psychedelics this is more visual it's also
less mind [ __ ] mind [ __ ] is
a term they use in psychedelic community basically to refer
to how seriously and how deeply will this take you
into like shattering your metaphysical foundations and understanding of what
reality is al add is supposed to really be a
party drug it's not supposed to get you any deep
spiritual connection with reality but you know I'm testing this
out and I just want to see what it's like
I wanted to find a lighter psychedelic something that's not
so heavy on the mind and actually two weeks prior
to taking this 150 microgram dose I tested out half
a dose I took 775 micrograms which is half a
dose and I had a great trip it was very
pleasant and very joyful and it did feel sore like
a party drug I was just testing it out and
the first test went successfully which is exactly how you
should consume new substances that you've never tried is you
try a very small dose it's not enough to you
know trip your balls out but it's enough to make
sure that you're comfortable and you don't scare yourself as
a large dose so here I'm doubling the dose to
basically what's called a common dose it's still not a
super high dose so I consume it at 4 p.m.
and then what I do is I have a new
ritual now with psychedelics because last the last mushroom trip
that I had was right after a break through five
mio trip and that mushroom trip was so horrifying and
so challenging it was such a deep mind [ __
] that it was really challenging for me to integrate
it to understand it and it really kind of put
me off of psychedelics for a while I almost had
to take a couple of months off because it was
just like I was I was taking them too frequently
I wasn't integrating enough so I slowed my pace down
and so my new process here is now after that
mushroom trip and some of the really heavy five mio
trips I actually get anxiety whenever I take a psychedelic
like my hands start to shake I'm nervous I have
these you know pre pre trip jitters and then as
soon as I take the substance I'm always in the
back little thing like did I do the right thing
here am I going to be in a world of
pain for the next eight to ten hours and so
that creates anxiety and of course this is a problem
with like a ton so psychedelics reflect all your thoughts
back in on themselves so if you're starting to feel
like oh [ __ ] I screwed something up like
you know I'm afraid now and I have all these
fears and all these negative thoughts running through my mind
that's going to create a self-fulfilling prophecy and you will
actually create the bad trip you're trying to avoid or
that you're afraid of so to combat this what I
discovered and I discover this with my girlfriend a couple
months back when she was trying some mushrooms is what
we did is we boosted her state because she started
getting afraid and I didn't want her to freak out
I want to have a pleasant experience there was only
just one gram of mushrooms so what we did is
I made her dance I just blasted on some fun
music some kind of Dancy type of pop music some
just you know cheap pop music basically and then we
just danced for a good 20 minutes and just got
our bodies moving and singing and dancing and doing silly
things like this just to build up our state and
then by the time you do that the substance starts
to come up and now you're trying to feel the
effects but that you know it usually takes about 30
minutes for a substance to start to really take effect
on you if you took it on our mostly empty
stomach and you don't want to spend those 30 minutes
just sitting there on your couch worrying with negative thoughts
you know 30 minutes of negative thoughts that will that
will put you in a bad position for once you
really start to feel the effects of the substance so
I did this by myself I just blasted some good
music and I just danced and danced and danced for
good 20 minutes and then after that I started to
ease into the experience and by about 45 minutes I
started to feel the effects it was really coming on
and I was getting into it and I shut off
the music and I just kind of crashed on my
couch in my living room I was in my living
room basically the whole time for the duration of this
trip and the thing that you start to feel with
a el-ad is this amazing body high your body just
starts to feel delicious it just feels so good to
be in your body you become so present and in
the moment with your body and you get these like
enhanced tactile sensations everything you touch just feels so delicious
and velvety and luxuriant and then you get this like
ecstasy kind of going through your body by ecstasy I
don't mean the drug ecstasy I mean that the emotion
of ecstasy but it's a mild form of body ecstasy
if you want true ecstasy you need a 5ml breakthrough
that will give you true ecstasy which is the actual
being one with God but here is just kind of
a mild body ecstasy and for me this is a
significant point because I've been struggling for the past like
five years of my life ride I just not been
feeling right in my body I've been kind of having
fatigue and cold hands and feet and and just like
feeling like I don't belong in my body just not
feeling fully comfortable and I've actually been going to doctors
and I've been getting some coaching on this to try
to figure out what the problem is maybe it's my
diet I've been changing my diet maybe it's some chemical
imbalance I've been getting some blood work and working on
that but still like nothing has been clicking for me
but when I take al Ladd the most amazing thing
is I start to feel like my body is finally
clicking and it's working and it's feeling the way it
should always feel of course I mean it feels a
lot better than it would normally feel but it also
shows me kind of a preview of what I could
work myself towards see personal development when you start to
get into the advanced stage of the personal development it's
not about what you can have what you can why
or how much money you can make thought about that
those things are shallow and they're really not fulfilling what
becomes fulfilling is how you can make yourself feel how
much vitality and energy can you have how can you
interact with other people in a free-flowing an effortless manner
how can you start to feel like your entire life
is this magical beautiful divine phenomenon that's what it becomes
about that's really what's amazing that's really what you want
out of life so the AL ad puts me in
touch with that especially physically in my body and I
start to get this incredible sense of presence and being
where I get whisked out of my logistical reality and
by logistical reality what I mean is that most of
my week and your week and in fact most of
my life and most of your life is logistical reality
your mind is always busy thinking two steps ahead like
what should I do tomorrow and what am I going
to do later today and what about that email I
have to send and you know what about paying my
electricity bill on time and and what about this problem
there what about answering this email and what about my
boss and what about my spouse and what about answering
that text message so you're in this logistical mode of
operating that's your entire consciousness is so absorbed in that
that you don't even know there's an alternative well you
take a L ad or maybe some others like a
deli and it really connects you with being with being
and this is a very simple thing but man is
it powerful it's worth way more than all the emails
and all the bills you pay and all the stuff
you do at work and all the other stupid stuff
you do throughout your day and throughout your week it's
worth way more than that and people sometimes asking you
Leo being use this word being what is being mean
describe it to me or tell me what you mean
it's really hard because this is something you need to
have a direct experience of which is why these psychedelics
to be very powerful tools because how is someone supposed
to explain being to you it's being you have to
be it to know it it's hard to explain it's
really hard to put into words I'll come back to
that in a minute so anyways I'm in this incredible
sense of presence and being and it also what's nice
about does it give you a preview of where you
should be going with your meditation practices because when you're
struggling and you're sitting there meditating for months on end
and you're struggling to calm your monkey down mind down
and then here all the sudden within a couple of
hours on the substance you are given a sort of
like the ideal of what you're shooting for and all
the time you're like oh yeah that's what I'm doing
all that meditation to reach that point right there and
I personally find that invaluable in shaping and catalyzing my
meditation practices once I'm out of the trip so anyways
I mean it's an incredible sense of presence and being
my thoughts dream does something very interesting with it it
becomes very very slow and steady and just kind of
forceful it gives you this sense of intellectual power because
my thought stream becomes like molasses whereas usually it's monkey
mind my mind is kind of all over the place
and the thought stream is sort of dispersed into a
million different directions here it's like a laser beam and
I can almost shine it or focus it on any
topic that I want to think about like I could
think about a relationship or I could think about some
topic I want to cover for actualize org or I
can think about reality or I could think about something
I learned from some book that I read and all
of a sudden the mind becomes this hyper connected a
super integrated super intuitive machine which just like interconnects all
the dots about that particular issue and you just like
see right through it it's the most remarkable phenomenon because
it's not like you're visually seeing something you're not seeing
unicorns and dancing monkeys and stuff it's not that kind
of psychedelic I'm sure maybe at higher doses you can
get there but here what I'm talking about is just
this sort of like the way the thought stream changes
it's how your consciousness sort of focuses in or dilates
in a very interesting way which you've probably never experienced
in your entire life until you've been on this kind
of substance before unless you've been and then then you
know what I'm talking about and this remarkable thing on
a I'll add that I notice is just this effortless
genius level of creativity comes over me especially early on
and trip just like everything creative becomes easy I'm just
like my mind is just filling with ideas the most
brilliant ideas ideas that would rival the most brilliant ideas
of mankind right and they just come to me you
really get the sense this feeling that creativity is not
a human capacity it's really a divine capacity it's like
though you you come in contact with the Fountainhead of
the muse that is fueling your creative work throughout everyday
life usually the bandwidth that you can handle in everyday
life if you're doing some creative like music art movies
writing anything like that your bandwidth is like this wide
and your muse tries to like put ideas in there
but there's only so much bandwidth really it's it's such
a bottleneck but with Al a deer just like it
which opens up monumentally orders of magnitude to the point
where you feel like a creative genius and if you
sit there with a notebook you can write pages and
pages and pages and pages of the most remarkable stuff
of course also it's sort of state dependent so when
you come back out of the trip and you look
at your notes they might not be as creative as
you originally thought because some of the stuff you realize
is so hard to put into symbolic form into verbal
word form that you really have to cultivate the consciousness
and not just write down the ideas so that's the
trick also when I feel is I feel a brain
fuzz so physically the sensation is almost like I have
a bit of a head cold like there's this kind
of fuzzy feeling to my entire skull and it feels
a little bit weird you might think it's kind of
uncomfortable but because you have this beautiful body high and
you're feeling ecstasy and warmth throughout your entire body and
your thoughts are doing these amazing beautiful things and you're
experiencing this sense of consciousness that you probably haven't experienced
since you were a child the head fuzz really is
not a not a big deterrent now al add is
supposed to be very visual what I've discovered so far
on these dosages which is a pretty pretty decent dose
here is that I get very little visuals almost no
visuals about as much as I would get on mushrooms
even probably less which surprised me because most people talk
about al add having more visuals than LSD but that's
not a problem because of all the other amazing stuff
that you experience here I do understand why people talk
about this as sort of a party drug because it's
very very mellow and smooth it comes up very smooth
there's no nausea there's no discomfort at least for me
I don't know how to for other people but I'm
just talking about what I experienced it's just like positivity
all the way if you were going to do a
psychedelic for your first time I would definitely recommend that
you do something that would give you a positive experience
rather than freak the hell out of you and this
looks like a pretty good candidate so I'm whisked out
of logistical reality I'm not seeing any crazy visuals but
my mind is just very very conscious and I'm very
connected with the beauty of being just everything becomes so
beautiful light becomes beautiful the plants in my living room
become beautiful to couch the carpet the most mundane things
become beautiful and creativity you really connect with the source
of creativity in this very beautiful fashion it almost feels
like you're being absorbed into the presence of the goddess
of creativity it's an amazing thing especially if you're someone
that's artistically minded and really values creativity as much as
I do and then what slowly starts to happen hour
to an hour three into my trip is that I
go deeper and deeper and deeper and really much deeper
than I thought that I would go on this trip
I was assuming this was just going to be more
or less just sort of a fun free going sort
of trip I wasn't really expecting some deep spiritual work
to happen here but what ended up happening for me
is that years of intellectual knowledge years of insights that
I talk with you about through all my videos really
got realized and made tangible in the flesh during the
next couple of hours and I have some mind-blowing insights
which I have had previously on various other trips and
also not on trips just through meditation and contemplation and
self inquiry but I got new perspectives and I felt
like I got a sense of completion with these insights
because I really saw them in I had enough time
to really be not just catch a glimpse of the
insight but really get like into the guts of it
and really understand it at deep level so here are
some of the insights that I had firstly is the
insight be of the beauty of being and just how
much I miss my connection with being in everyday life
and how important that is to me so the power
of that insight was that it is service to change
the values and the priorities of what I pursue in
everyday life talk about that more as we go on
also another important insight was the ineffability of being a
lot of my work is trying to communicate some of
the beautiful and profound truths the metaphysical existential truths that
are possible for you to become conscious of the most
advanced aspects of personal development I try to communicate that
with words with metaphors with clever phrasing I try to
get you to do the work the personal development work
to lay your foundation so that you can move to
it I try to program you with a vision for
that so that you have something to look forward to
in your work but the beauty and profundity that I
was experiencing here was so remarkable that I actually gave
up trying to verbalize it trying to symbolize it after
about an hour and a half into the trip I
just I realized this is so profound and so beautiful
I'm speechless I could spend the next couple of hours
trying to write it all down in meticulous detail on
a notepad and that would actually detract me from the
trip going deeper into the trip or I could just
surrender to it and enjoy it and then all that
I would have to tell you is you know what
experience it for yourself because if I spend a hundred
videos describing it to you and describing all these insights
to you it would not be anywhere near the power
of actually experiencing it that's what I call the ineffability
of being what that requires from you is to hear
my words and then to say okay this guy's trying
to talk about something that seems that's pretty profound and
pretty beautiful because he's pretty passionate about it and but
she's not describing it in a way that I can
really my mind can't latch on to it and that's
right your mind can't latch on to it but see
the important thing is that what most people do when
they hear that efficient all yeah that's beautiful that's nice
and they forget about it they go back into their
old routine will chew out an Uzi I say okay
I got to actually lay the foundation build the infrastructure
to work towards having that experience of being that's being
pointed out here see so that's something that's on you
I'm trying to share the vision with you but you
know what after a certain point the things that are
possible to become conscious of are so extraordinary in this
world that they cannot be described with words with symbols
with speech and that's what I experienced that's what you
need to experience because this experience when you experience it
will transform the entire trajectory of your future life everything
everything will change this is not a little hallucination this
is a lot deeper than that the next insight I
had and this was extraordinary I got a deep deep
deep understanding and appreciation of something called context context what
is context I became conscious of the fact that my
entire personal life my existence as a human being all
my models of reality of what we even think life
is that all of this is a construe option that
can only exist and feel real when it's taken out
of the larger context right so here's how I can
describe context right now you're sitting there and you actually
believe that you're a human being who has a personal
private life and that you've been living this life for
the last 20 or 30 years of your life let's
say from the point you were born you have a
personal story of stuff that's happened to you and that
feels like it's you that feels like reality that feels
unquestionable if I was to come to you and to
say hey you know what you never lived at all
you were never born this universe that you think you're
in what do you think you think you're on a
planet you think you're sitting on a planet in the
middle of empty dark space orbiting a Sun which is
part of a Milky Way galaxy which is part of
a larger galaxy cluster which is part of some universe
that came out of some Big Bang that entire that
whole thing is of story I'm serious that whole thing
is a story imagine for a second that all of
that is sort of context it's a sort of framework
and that everything else that you know about life everything
else that you ever hear from me or you read
in the book or you hear someone talking about or
you talk about on on TV or with or you
talk with your friends on about or you see on
TV that any new information you get will be put
into this context of I'm a human being I have
a life I was born into a family and I
live in a universe it's a physical universe and I'm
part of the human species living on this solid mass
of Earth rotating around the Sun and that that is
what reality is but actually that's a story and what
this psychedelic can do for you is it can reveal
to you that that's a story by showing you a
new context and the context the new context that you
will see is the context of nothingness so when you
experience nothingness cosmic nothingness you start to see that your
life and this entire reality that we consider the scientific
hard physical tangible reality the reality of science studies that
all of this is a very limited facet of reality
and it only makes sense when you forget about the
larger context this is such a crazy and mind-blowing thing
to realize that there's just almost no way that you're
going to realize this without without a deep conscious breakthrough
either with a psychedelic or some some really deep meditative
work you're not going to see this context this context
is consuming it's just all consuming the entire context for
your life is your life you actually think that you're
stuck in your life that there's a birth of death
to your life you actually believe that and as I'm
standing here I'll be honest I believe that too because
right now my level of consciousness is low I've fallen
out of the very deep level of consciousness that I
was at when I experienced some of these insights but
I do retain the understanding of what I saw and
now you might say well leo but what you saw
was just a hallucination just a chemical of coursing through
your brain no you see brain is a context you
actually have a story in your mind that says that
all of this reality is happening in your brain you
have a story that tells you you have a brain
you understand it that's a context and that you interpret
everything I say through that context unwittingly completely on window
you take all this for granted you don't even have
an inkling of a clue of what context really means
because you've actually never consciously exited the context and seeing
the larger perspective when you see the larger perspective it
puts in the proper context the little context that you
currently think and call reality and in this larger context
the brain it's not the primary thing Newton's laws they're
not the primary thing history humanity all the social structures
of humanity has constructed science all these things fly out
the window like they never even mattered like they're just
figments like they're just like something Airy and intangible like
I don't know like cotton candy okay like cotton candy
just melts when you stick your tongue on it so
going on with this this was starting to get to
the peak of my experience about three hours into it
I became deeply conscious that everything in reality is groundless
there is no ground for anything and it's a little
hard to describe to you what that means precisely how
would I describe it groundlessness every object is groundless you
might think like well but you know Leo aren't we
standing right now on the earth so that's sort of
a grounding no because where is the what is the
earth grounded upon you might say well it's sort of
grounded upon like the vacuum of empty space but what's
the vacuum of empty space ground upon what's a space
grounded upon space itself is a context time is a
context you see you actually believe that things are happening
in time and in space these things will be revealed
to you as empty contexts minor context there's a larger
context that we that's context of nothing you start to
see that everything is made of nothing that reality is
a collection of surfaces surface after surface after service after
surface but every surface ends ultimately in nothing and you
might say well Leo how do you know that the
amazing thing that becomes possible with these psychedelics is that
your mind literally taps into infinite perspective capacity you can
actually have a stream of thoughts that goes through to
infinity so it's an incense what you can do is
you can sort of logically think about a thing like
you can look at your hand and you can think
about and you can think like oh this is my
hand and it's made of cells and what are those
cells may have oh well like molecules and what are
those that are like atoms and one of those that
as all well some strings or something but you can
see through all of that you can see through all
the scientific paradigms that you have all those are sort
of melt away and your mind just looks through all
of it and it gets to the rock bottom of
what there is which is nothing you see that your
hand is made of nothing and you look around the
room and you see that the whole room is that
enough and then your your brain and yourself just sort
of spills out through your skull and there is no
more you anymore this was ego death so I experienced
this ego death I was very surprised that I was
able to experience ego death on such a relatively small
dose of sort of a party psychedelic but you have
to understand that I've had some breakthroughs with five Meo
which have shaped all my other psychedelic experiences that I
have from now on you have to also understand that
I've been metaphysically inquiring to the nature of reality for
a long a long time and now my intent is
very strong about this I really care about knowing what
reality is on an existential level not to manipulate it
but just for the sake of knowing it I actually
care about truth people that don't care about this well
they'll probably need a massive dose of psychedelics to experience
ego death and maybe not even then and even if
they do experience a when you understand what they're experiencing
they again they won't have a a deeper context to
put it in I've been studying this stuff for years
so when I see something in my psychedelic experience I
know exactly what that is I'm like oh yeah that's
there you go Devin right there that's nothing that's right
there that's infinity right there that's context that's some other
thing that I read about that's something else that's something
oh yeah of course that's what the Buddhists talk about
that's what the Hindus talk about that's what the shamans
talk about oh yeah that's what Carlos Castaneda was talking
about oh yeah that's what this happened this reduce all
interconnects like it's all very transparent it's amazing so anyways
I have this ego death and it's just sort of
like I spill out my sense of self spills out
from inside me as it were I mean there's nothing
inside me but it's just sort of it feels like
you're spilling out into the space in front of you
and you sort of become the space but the space
is hollow it's just surfaces right you can take one
object cut it in half there's just more surfaces cut
that in half more surfaces more services more services you
can keep cutting objects in half for to infinity and
all you'll get is just surfaces and in the end
the deep truth there is that the services are afloat
in a sea of nothingness this nothingness is the the
consciousness or the substance that makes up all of reality
reality is not made out of molecules it's made out
of nothingness that's the substance this nothingness is conscious and
aware it's what renders all of reality your brain is
not rendering reality your mind is not rendering reality your
body is not rendering reality that's just sort of a
limited illusion which quickly gets shattered once your context expands
and then a really amazing thing that I have stumbled
upon I this was just extraordinary was that I had
a realization that my my sense of reality God disrupted
so much that I realized four in a flash I
realized that there is no difference between an Enlightenment and
insanity and that what we call reality is just a
set of conventions if a set of convention is a
specific dilation of consciousness sort of like you have a
radio station and you can tune to different frequencies and
there might be a hundred different frequencies well what we
call reality the stuff that science studies the stuff you
learn about in physics and math class and then chemistry
and biology what that is that's one band on an
entire spectrum one band which is wise trying struggles with
consciousness work and science struggles to understand and make sense
of some of these spiritual truths because science is committed
to this one band it's a consensus reality it's not
a physical reality its consensus reality and let me describe
what I mean by insanity so here's the thing when
I had my deep sort of horrifying traumatizing mushroom trip
which happened after my big massive fight amel breakthrough the
reason the mushroom trip was so horrifying was because I
reached a point at the peak of that trip where
I realized that I felt like I was going insane
and totally losing all sense of reality like imagine for
a moment if you stopped believing that you're a human
being like for real you stopped believing your human being
you stopped believing that reality is real that it exists
you stopped believing in history you stopped believing you were
born you stopped believing that you came out of your
mother's vagina you stopped believing your parents you stopped believing
that you have a life you stopped believing in death
you stopped believing in physical science when that kind of
degree of mind-blowing that hits you your ego is going
to recoil in horror because it will feel like you've
gone insane because here's the fear it's good you're good
you're going to come up with this sort of doubt
where it seems like wait a minute have I completely
just lost all sense of reality I don't believe in
reality anymore I don't believe in reality more you laugh
at reality it becomes so insubstantial courses the problem for
you because you spent your whole life really buying into
reality so this is a this is very jarring for
your mind and your mind realizes wait a minute I'm
going insane I'm actually going insane this is not a
joke wait a minute like I am going insane and
when you're in these psychedelic experiences they tend to be
very forceful and you're so present in the moment that
you might believe that you're insane forever it might feel
to you like wait a minute now this is just
how it's going to be I'm gonna be insane it
feels like you can't even there's no common reference point
with with anyone in your life anymore you can't talk
to your parents anymore it's like nothing will make sense
imagine coming up to your parents and saying that reality
doesn't exist they don't exist and you don't exist and
that there's no death of course they would they would
think you're crazy but imagine if you actually believed that
that was real that might be scary to you because
you might care about how they perceive you and this
fear of insanity will probably push you back into consensus
reality and what you'll do and when I read a
lot of people in their strip reports what they experienced
that I think they reach the brink of insanity but
then they're not willing to actually accept it as truth
and they step back into consensus reality and that insanity
horrifies them because they actually think that if they go
past the edge that they will go insane now maybe
they will I don't know for me I don't go
insane but I have so during my first mushroom that
deep mushroom trip not it was my first it was
my first after five meal during a mushroom trip the
reason was so horrifying was because I hit that brink
of insanity and it horrified me so much that I
I fell back into consensus reality and because the mushrooms
are so goddamn twisted then I didn't know what it
was exactly I just knew some scary and saying [
__ ] and so I fell back and I resisted
it here on a el-ad my thoughts were clear and
I've grown in the last six months since that trip
I've grown a lot and I've worked through some of
my fears and basically what I did is I said
you know [ __ ] it if I'm going insane
I'm going insane and I surrender to the insanity and
I actually felt like I was insane and that that
was it that there was no coming back that no
one would ever understand me and I realized that that's
really what what enlightenment is is you you completely lose
all sense of reality what you would call conventional reality
with the average person on the street calls reality that's
it it's gone it's never coming back like it's that
[ __ ] deep is that mind shattering and of
course you can see why this terrifies you so much
sometimes people on the forum post questions like well I've
been self inquiring in self inquiry or meditating and sometimes
I have this deep existential terror that comes up yeah
of course of course because you're on a journey to
become insane now of course you're going to be insanely
functional which means you will be insane but you will
be fully functional after enlightenment in fact you'll be more
functional than the average person what you have to understand
is that insanity is also a social convention and insanity
is also a context a funny thing happens when you
become insane actually breakthrough insanity and go beyond and sanity
what I call Beyond insanity when you go beyond insanity
you realize that actually you kind of go on full
circle black stars into white light turns into black up
turns into down down turns into up left turns into
right and right turns into left so what the conventional
mind calls insanity turns into sanity and the conventional mind
which we call sanity becomes insanity and that's a pretty
cool insight to have I was really pleased that I
was able to break through that and to really get
a full understanding of this insanity issue because I sell
like I failed to have that insight during the mushroom
trip and here it actually clicked for me that was
amazing and then after that you know once you become
insane everything is fine it's not a problem you just
realize that you can't communicate this verbally to people that's
why we call it non symbolic non symbolic experience and
that's why everything actualized uttereth teaches you is really pathetic
all my words all my fancy insights all the labor
I go through to to record all these notes and
to to study all these books and then to come
up here and to explain all this stuff in hour-long
episodes I mean this is what's insanity really it's insanity
because this stuff is so shallow and so just like
it pales in comparison to non-symbolic experience of higher consciousness
you are a new reality you are a new universe
paradigms that you couldn't even imagine were shattered and it's
ineffable its wordless incredible the this is advanced personal developments
were set so I experienced that and then the last
deep insight that I had was I started to experience
tastes of the infinite sort of like I did on
five mal but not as strong and I remember I
was standing in my in my bathroom had to go
to be standing my bathroom and I just sort of
realize this entire room that I'm standing in is afloat
in a sea of nothingness it doesn't exist I don't
exist reality doesn't exist reality is not real and I
felt this weird it's hard to describe this weird feeling
of like I was standing inside of an Escher painting
MC Escher he paints those weird twisted uh sorta like
geometrical paintings of rooms that have like different dimensions being
depicted simultaneously like the room is being seen final taste
from different angles that's what I felt like that's what
it Finity sort of feels like to me it's almost
like I can see myself and the room and all
of reality from a multitude of angles simultaneously and it's
not a visual phenomenon so much as it's just consciousness
that your consciousness becomes aware of infinity and there are
various degrees of this so I had a taste of
that and it just like totally blew my mind I
loved it tasting infinity it's maddening for sure if you
are not a metaphysical junky it will freak the [
__ ] out of you probably and that's why some
people report some really horrific trips I think because they're
not ready for this stuff but if you love this
stuff if you're philosophically minded if you really want to
get to the truth of what life is what humanity
is what spirituality is what personal development is all about
what consciousness is what enlightenment is you'll love this stuff
it's amazing it's amazing and there's really nothing to be
afraid of so the amazing thing with psychedelics is that
you can work to any fears you have you have
bad trips that's stuff that needs to be purged that's
stuff that needs to be worked on that's not something
that's bad about psychedelics those are the psychedelics revealing in
you the impurities the spiritual impurities that you have I've
been working quite hard over the last six months on
many of my spiritual impurities with the help of psychedelics
of course vitae meal helped me a lot there made
me a lot more loving in in ways that would
be impossible without side amel and I can tell you
that definitely it has prepared me for this smooth trip
that I had here in the depth of this trip
if I gave this al ad to you to an
average person who doesn't meditate doesn't self inquire is an
interested in philosophy or metaphysics just study personal development doesn't
do any consciousness work has it worked for years on
his fears and anxieties has it worked on becoming more
loving doesn't understand what reality is about even in in
theory when learning practice doesn't understand notions of like unconditional
love and raising consciousness and so forth doesn't and has
never heard it off such things as contacts and paradigm
shifts and all these sorts of things what they would
do is they would take the substance they would go
watch some cartoons they would drink some beer they would
smoke some weed they would maybe have some fun or
maybe have some horrific memories come up from their childhood
or whatever if they were bad they would want to
run away from them they maybe might go driving with
their friends around the city and just have fun and
laugh and do all this kind of stupid [ __
] and then they would come back into ordinary reality
and they would think that they had a fun time
and it was just a cool thing that they did
with their friends over the weekend but that is a
totally different thing than what I experienced here just like
night and day night and day you have to realize
that the the psychedelic really is your mind reflecting in
on itself so the quality of mind that you bring
to it makes an enormous difference Norma's difference the placebo
effect the self fulfil prophecy effect is huge here so
really matters and that was my trip lasted for about
six to eight hours in full strikes Menace or quickly
tapered off after there and by about ten to twelve
hours I was back let me talk about some of
the lasting effects I had from this trip that was
some of the peak stuff that I experienced a lot
of that is difficult to bring back so even though
I'm talking about it here I'm not directly in contact
with that sort of consciousness right now as I'm standing
here in my everyday life but there have been some
important lasting effects firstly is that I really got a
deep meaningful understanding and I think I surrendered to the
notion that words and analysis is pointless it's really futile
when you're doing consciousness work I saw just how little
my words and my analysis and my logical understanding and
my my reading of all this stuff really is now
all that said it's still important because again it creates
the foundation once you have the foundation then it's very
easy to say oh yeah all the words and analysis
and all the book-reading all that is pointless but see
if I didn't have that my whole trip would have
probably gone in a very different direction so it's not
pointless in that sense it's pointless in the sense that
once you've climbed to the top of the building then
you can throw away the ladder in that sort of
sense and also in the sense that for me when
I'm finding my balance between theory and practice what this
trip communicated to me was that I don't need as
much Theory anymore I've got a lot of theory I've
got years of theory now what I need is I
need a lot more direct consciousness practice and that really
resonates with me in a powerful way because I knew
that already but I knew it on a theoretical level
and now what happened is that I knew it on
a practical level and that makes all the difference because
the practical level is where you get your that's where
your live transport I also have the deep realization that
I really have no desire for consensus reality I cross
that threshold of insanity and I made my peace with
it and now that I'm back I I feel lighter
I feel lighter in that I'm not taking reality as
seriously anymore and it feels like that's something that's kind
of that's soaked through into my everyday life I have
less need to please people I feel like I have
less need to to want to achieve stuff in this
consensus reality because I can see the illusion of it
and also how deeply on fulfilling consensus reality is compared
to being compared to higher consciousness states also other lasting
effect was I fell a deep shift in my core
values and what I felt was that I'm really starting
to get a thirst for deep consciousness work like this
is on a very practical and not just on a
theoretical intellectual sort of idealistic level but on a very
practical level it feels like this is my new purpose
my purpose is evolving and that my purpose is starting
to move away from a career centered purpose from revolving
around actualized org and really just getting to the existential
metaphysical nature of reality because it's just so goddamn fulfilling
and it's so amazing and then everything else just pales
in comparison to that and so one of the consequences
of this shift in my values and priorities is that
I'm working more now on that my life is changing
how I live why pursuing my goals are changing and
I'm cleaning a lot less to materialism I'm less concerned
about success business success earning money that sort of stuff
that's that's all falling by the wayside in a very
uh palpable way I've gotten a lot more serious about
my meditation practice and spending more time meditating and doing
it deeper and taking you more serious and really putting
my intent into it because now I'm becoming really passionate
about it because once you start to feel these effects
meditation it's no longer just you sitting on a couch
relaxing it's really something extraordinary every time you sit down
to meditate you have the possibility of actually changing all
of reality not just to relax and blossom Steve but
to change the very structure of reality that's an amazing
place to get to that makes me very excited makes
me very glad that I started to meditate 3 or
4 years ago whatever I did I can't remember anymore
also I felt a difference in my body energy I
always generally feel this chronic fatigue I don't feel comfortable
my by like I said before but something shifted in
me where I kind of got in touch with it
it's almost like the AL ad showed me how my
body is supposed to feel and now I sort of
carried over some of that and I even feel it
right now as I'm standing here so that's actually been
a very remarkable thing because that's something I've been struggling
with for a long time been going to doctors and
stuff so forth for that and it actually feels like
psychedelics could have potential to to cure chronic fatigue which
is an interesting Avenue for curing chronic fatigue that I
haven't seen discussed anywhere else we should not to say
that they will cure all chronic fatigue I'm not saying
that at all say that might be a possibility for
me because chronic fatigue tends to be a very complicated
and messy situation a lot of different causes that are
involved it I also saw as one of my takeaways
I saw just how much I am still caught in
monkey mind throughout the day and how much my monkey
mind prevents me from being and how much it puts
me into the logistical materialistic world and that that needs
to stop and I'm going to work really hard over
the next year to put that to an end because
that is a that's going to be a huge transformation
in the quality of my life and how I relate
to to everything in in this reality is when I
am able to tame that monkey mind for real and
I'm really motivated to work harder towards that one of
the traps I fall into because my work is very
conceptual I come up here I analyze stuff is that
I get caught in monkey mind very easily it's hard
to shut off the conceptual mind there's an addiction to
it and that was revealed to me I generally have
a very deep sense of peace now after the whole
experience because I feel like I sort of faced death
I've overcame it i sell-- I faced my fear of
insanity a lot of fears were sort of faced but
they weren't very fearful the trip overall was 99% positive
there was very little fear I never felt like I
was out of control with my mind or anything like
that I felt like everything just all the obstacles sort
of melted before me and you know maybe in other
trips it won't be that way I'm sure there will
be more fears that come up but for now I
felt like some fears were vanquished in a permanent manner
or at least reduced and I feel a lighter in
everyday life and also I feel like I'm more open
now to my life unfolding in a natural way and
going wherever it's going to go without needing to micromanage
it and to worry about the way I tend to
worry about it thinking about like oil in my future
you know next year I need to do this and
then I need to do this and get in relation
amazing get married and have kids and this and that
and all this planning all these logistics and when you
really get deeply in touch with being in with consciousness
you let that stuff go you just say you know
what it's more fun more interesting just to see where
life takes me and I think that's a very healthy
thing at least for me some of you need more
structure in your life I probably need less okay so
let's quickly talk about what are the lessons here for
you I talked about my lessons your lessons are that
psychedelics are a powerful tool when used properly extremely powerful
don't let people fool you don't let government propaganda and
other people's stupid trip reports written by [ __ ]
teenagers who don't know what they're doing who are using
these psychedelics while watching cartoons while they're stoned and drunk
don't let all those experiences tarnish these beautiful substances their
potential is extraordinary extraordinary one solid deep trip on one
of these substances is worth a hundred of my videos
I'm not kidding all this talking that I do it's
just not getting through to you that's one of my
deepest frustrations with this work is that the things that
I really know that have experienced I can never communicate
to you ever ever that's why I just wish I
could just like stick some LSD into your mouth because
it'll do a whole lot better job explaining things than
I ever had will some other lessons for you is
that a el-ad is an excellent newbie psychedelic I've been
looking for a while now for psychedelic that can be
used to introduce newbies this needs to be a mild
psychedelic that's mellow that's consistent that's easy to dose doesn't
have complicated instructions doesn't have complicated smoking methods and procedures
that people get wrong especially newbies which isn't traumatic and
doesn't have too big of a mindfuck well I think
laal lad is a really excellent in that regard also
al ed is excellent as a post five Meo breakthrough
companion psychedelic so after you've had your major fight Emil
breakthrough or maybe you have a breakthrough on some other
psychedelics like DMT or something else al that is beautiful
because it gives you a long time to sit there
and have sort of relive the peak experiences but not
have them be so strong but relive them in a
more sustainable way and actually integrate them deeper into your
life which matters a lot so I think that's a
very powerful combo that can be experimented with I don't
here's a don't underestimate party drugs people who use drugs
to party they don't know what they're missing just because
it's a party drug doesn't mean you can't have egodeath
on it doesn't mean you can't use it for very
deep spiritual work because clearly I was this was one
of my this was one of the trips that I
took that has got me the most just I felt
practical growth the five Emil trips were incredible and they
also got me practical growth but here I felt like
I integrated so much stuff because it was just the
right amount of power and lengths and mellowness so all
that stuff matters I would caution you not to use
these substances more than once a week give yourself plenty
of time for integration I really learned from this experience
that integration is so critical and then ideally if you're
going to be tripping on Saturday spend the entire next
day on Sunday just silently contemplating and meditating journaling and
integrating the experience don't be rushing back to work it's
not very good you're you're losing most of the growth
most of the growth happens when you come back down
to earth into this consensus reality and now you have
to live here and do all the ordinary stuff if
you want to transform this reality you need a bridge
the bridge is the integration period spend time on that
if you really care about using these substances for growth
not just for recreation or just to get your kicks
also another lesson for you here is that intentions are
extremely important why are you doing this what do you
want out of your trip and purifying yourself is very
important or you actually doing the hard work in your
everyday life to make your trips as powerful as possible
are you spending months in meditation journaling contemplating visualizing working
on yourself laying the infrastructure and all of that stuff
honing your intent in tendance it's not something like okay
I'm going to take a second out today so I'm
just going to have an intent for it to be
a nice trip that's not intent what I'm talking about
is that you spent a month before you take the
psychedelic you spent building the intent a deep desire for
for what for accessing some metaphysical truths are for healing
some aspect of yourself or for understanding something that shows
that you're doing this with a seriousness in the sort
of Carlos Castaneda donjuan vein if you have read the
Carlos Castaneda books which I recommend you read study them
very closely they're especially valuable to read if you're the
experimenting with psychedelics and you really care about using them
in a shamanistic sort of way because you can see
there that Don Juan guides Carlos Castaneda and tells him
all these important principles about how the psychedelics are used
to actually grow yourself to transform yourself see he has
a lot of rituals around how we used the psychedelics
they give themselves a lot of time before and after
the trip they talk about everything alright carlos lehder writes
everything down it's all analyzed it's connected with the other
theory and frameworks that they have so when you do
your psychedelic trips connected to the stuff that I talked
about connected to the stuff you've read in also spirituality
books that's where this stuff really gets juicy your results
will completely depend on the kind of seriousness and intent
that you put into this work you're going to get
what you give alright that's it kind of long but
there's a lot to cover here so Einstein please click
like button for me post your comments down below share
this episode with a friend and lastly come check out
actualize that world right here my website is a forum
their life purpose courses they're my recommended books list is
their my new blog is there I'm posting new stuff
on my blog go check it out it's got a
lot of spiritual and psychedelic related topics and I'm going
to keep pumping stuff out that's going to be very
eye-opening and very interesting stuff that I can't share with
my videos but sponsor the newsletter and just stick around
actualize that org make a commitment that this is not
just a video you watch this is your commitment to
self-actualize you have the vision to transform yourself you know
that it's possible you see people talking about it you
and to that there's something deeper for you in life
that there's something deeper to reality and that you're willing
to put your money where your mouth is and roll
up your sleeves and get to work and the most
important thing that you need to work on especially if
you resonated with this topic is your mindfulness ability build
your foundation for mindfulness because the future topics that I
talked about the advanced topics the stuff I've been talking
about here you're not gonna understand any of this without
a deep foundation of mindfulness start building and I have
a video called mindfulness meditation go search for it find
it wash it a couple of times start practicing it
this is the number one soft infrastructure that you can
build for the advanced work mindfulness practice mindfulness practice is
not some airy-fairy wofully new-age word it's a specific set
of techniques that actually develops your ability to have awareness
of your sensational field your feelings your emotions your sights
and sounds so you can deconstruct them all so you
can see what's happening in real time in a way
that you've never imagined possible this takes work this takes
years of practice start building it now and I'll see
you soon with more advanced topics you
