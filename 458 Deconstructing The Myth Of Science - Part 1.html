            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/QwyPdXtl0HU' target='_blank'>Deconstructing The Myth Of Science - Part 1</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Existential crisis and psychology of science</b>: The video states that deeply questioning science could potentially lead to an existential crisis and mental instability. This is because science constructs our entire worldview and identity. It requires extreme open-mindedness to deal with such insights, which if fully understood, could fundamentally challenge our entire sense of self and reality.
</li><li><b>Seeking truth</b>: This lecture does not aim to discredit science but emphasises questioning and understanding its limitations. Viewers are encouraged to validate the insights shared through contemplation, direct experiences, and careful attention to detail, rather than accepting them on the basis of faith or belief.
</li><li><b>Need to focus on limitations of science</b>: This video will focus on the limitations of science rather than its good parts. This is because the significant aspects and advantages of the scientific method and science in its entirety are typically overemphasised in our educational journey.
</li><li><b>Importance of patience and understanding</b>: Listeners are urged to be patient and resist snap judgements, as the information presented here is advanced, and there is a vast amount of material to cover. The presenter emphasises that fully grasping this material falls within the rare domain of advanced understanding that even professional scientists and academics might struggle with.
</li><li><b>The misconception of viewing science negatively</b>: The presenter denies hating or being against science. On the contrary, due to his love for science and deep interest in its purest form, he intends to highlight and correct the foundational mistakes, corruption, and dogma in science.
</li><li><b>The concept of heresy</b>: The presenter compares criticism of science to heresy in religion. Any attempt to critique or reform powerful institutions like the church or science often leads to the critic being labelled a heretic, dismissed, and excommunicated. This mechanism helps maintain the current, often corrupt, state of such institutions.
</li><li><b>Aim and structure of the lecture</b>: The presenter points out that the lecture is part one of a four-part series focusing on the epistemic and metaphysical foundations of science, its limits, and how science could move beyond its current state. Future parts of this series will respond to viewer's questions and objections. The presenter urges listeners to be patient and bear this in mind as they watch and form their initial responses to his deconstruction of the myth of science.
</li><li><b>Critiques of Science from Below and Above</b>: Leo Gura identifies two types of criticism of science: 'from below' and 'from above'. Criticism from below is commonly made by religious zealots or right-wing proponents who challenge science because it contradicts their existing ideological beliefs. Positive critiques 'from above' come from a higher level of cognitive development and can recognize the limitations and areas of science that require reevaluation or novel approaches. Gura indicates that these critiques should mainly embrace science's discoveries and methods but probing its imperfections.
</li><li><b>Science vs. Truth Alignment</b>: Gura presents the notion that science and truth may not always be aligned. In cases where science presents false or incorrect theories or conclusions, it deviates from the truth. Thus, it is essential to distinguish between the two and ensure your loyalty lies with the truth rather than blindly following scientific principles or theories.
</li><li><b>Science and Self-Actualization</b>: Science is integral to one's cognitive development and understanding of the world. It serves as the foundational operating system for our minds. However, if there is a divergence between truth and science, and science is foundational to our worldview, any errors or fallacies in science would inherently corrupt our perception and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Successful Science and Perception of Truth</b>: The idea that the success and advancements of science corroborate its alignment with truth can be deceptive. This perspective is framed by the numerous technological innovations attributed to science. However, this does not negate the importance of reevaluating the limitations and assumptions within the scientific method.
</li><li><b>The Success of Science</b>: The effectiveness of science can make it seem more deceiving and perilous than religion because it gives us a false sense that we've understood more of reality than we really have. Despite its numerous breakthroughs, there are still fundamental elements of reality that contemporary science fails to grasp.
</li><li><b>Doing Science vs Understanding Science</b>: The act of conducting scientific work and comprehending science as a system are two distinct facets. Effective scientific practice doesn't always equate to a comprehensive understanding of science as a system. Similar to using language and our bodies instinctively without fully understanding the principles behind their function, most scientists deploy their scientific expertise without fully grasping the nature of science.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Meta-Science</b>: Meta-Science, examining the philosophy and epistemology behind science, is critical for revolutionary scientific discoveries. Contrary to popular belief within the scientific community, meta-science is not a distraction, rather it provides scientists with a broader perspective to make sense outside their specific fields.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Scientists and Non-Scientists</b>: Science has two portrayals - cultural or layman understanding, which can be classified as a myth, and the understanding of professionals and academics, which is in-depth and nuanced. Critiques of science should address both perspectives since both contain their own misconceptions and biases.
</li><li><b>Notional Science vs Empirical Science</b>: When deconstructing science, the challenge is not disputing the empirical measurements but rather the interpretations, assumptions, methodology, and meta-science behind these measurements. Science goes beyond mere data collection and involves these other intricate aspects. 
</li><li><b>Existence of Epistemic Errors in Science</b>: Science isn't immune to epistemic errors, similar to religion. The critique here is to remind scientists that change, development, and acceptation of new paradigms form an inherent part of scientific progress. Any resistance to change becomes a form of hypocrisy undermining the spirit of science. 
</li><li><b>Understanding of Language and Body</b>: Analogous to being able to use language and bodies effectively without understanding the mechanisms behind them, scientists can conduct their research efficiently without really understanding the principles behind science. Preconceived notions and a lack of serious thought about the nature of science can limit the ability of scientists to make groundbreaking discoveries. 
</li><li><b>Science Infrastructure does not Equal Understanding</b>: Professional scientists or those who see people doing science often mistake doing science for the understanding of science. For instance, someone might expertly use language or their body without fully understanding the principles of the language or how their body functions respectively.
</li><li><b>Scientism myth and common misconceptions about science</b>: Leo Gura expounds on what he terms the "pop cultural myth of science", suggesting that modern culture broadly categorizes worldviews into two groups: scientific and rational versus religious and irrational. This binary perspective not only oversimplifies worldviews but also falsely elevates science as a pure, absolute path to truth devoid of biases or ideological trappings. Such a perspective impacts both laypeople and professional scientists, who may unknowingly internalize and perpetuate this myth. This inadvertently fosters a defensive stance towards science, similar to how religious adherents defend their beliefs. Gura identifies numerous misconceptions promoting this myth, including the notion that science equals truth because of its success and applicability, science comprises solely objective facts, science is immune from bias or the influence of the "ego", scientists understand what science truly is, reason and logic solely belong to science, there is a universal scientific method agreed upon by all scientists, among others. He emphasizes that these misconceptions are not only confirmed false but contribute to a pervasive misunderstanding of the complexities, limitations, and nature of scientific knowledge itself.
</li><li><b>Concept of Science</b>: Leo Gura argues that most people, scientists included, don't truly understand what science is. He implies that science is not an inherent knowledge but instead is a man-made system with roots in culture and human interpretation. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions and Corruptions within Science</b>: Leo contends that science can be corrupted by business or capitalism, and he calls out certain public figures, such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and Jordan Peterson, for perceiving themselves as scientists despite propagating misconceptions about science. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Science through Questioning</b>: He stresses the importance of questioning science to understand its nature and limitations. For example, while many people consider science valid because it has led to technologically advanced societies, Leo points out that successful manipulation of reality does not necessarily equate to truth.
</li><li><b>Inventing Science</b>:Leo discusses the hypothetical situation of a first human inventing science, arguing that it would involve decisions about what constitutes valid science and invalid science. However, he points out that using science or reason and logic to validate itself leads to circular reasoning, which is problematic.
</li><li><b>Science as a Subset of Knowledge Pursuit</b>: Leo emphasizes that science is part of a larger pursuit - the pursuit of knowledge. However, he notes the difficulty in defining and agreeing on what constitutes valid science, as everyone can have their own interpretation of the scientific method.
</li><li><b>Problems with Validation of the Scientific Method</b>: Gura disputes the idea that the scientific method has ever been validated, stating that it is impossible to do so. He argues that any assumptions about the validity of the scientific method are inherently flawed, as they beg the question  that is, they assume their own conclusion.
</li><li><b>The Science and Pursuit of Knowledge</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that the spirit of a true scientist is one that seeks to discover everything that's true about nature, without making arbitrary distinctions between what to investigate and what not to. The pursuit of knowledge isn't confined to particular objects or phenomena, and the potential areas to be studied are as vast as the universe itself. Therefore, science should not be narrowly defined, as this would restrict the full range of its potential and exclude areas of valid knowledge.
</li><li><b>Determining Valid Methods of Pursuing Knowledge</b>: Leo tackles the question of what constitutes valid ways of pursuing knowledge. He generates a list of different methods, such as meditation, shamanism, reading tea leaves, logical deductions, dreams, and direct experience, among others. He challenges the viewers to determine which techniques they consider valid for doing science. 
</li><li><b>Example of a Shaman</b>: Leo Gura uses the example of a shaman experimenting with different herbs and plants to discover their medicinal properties, and sharing this knowledge within their tribe. This example challenges the conventional definition of "scientist" and "science", suggesting that scientific investigation is not confined to strict academia but can extend to other ways of knowledge acquisition.
</li><li><b>Question of Validity and Universally Accepted Criteria</b>: The challenge lies in agreeing on universally accepted criteria to determine which methods constitute valid science. Differing individual and cultural perspectives can stymie reaching such a consensus.
</li><li><b>Challenging the Notion of an Objective, Monolithic Scientific Method</b>: Leo Gura argues against the widely accepted belief in a single, objective scientific method that leads to truth. He suggests that there's no tangible agreement on what constitutes science. 
</li><li><b>Science as a Belief System</b>: Comparing tribal trust in the shaman's knowledge to the general public's trust in the knowledge claimed by scientists, Leo Gura suggests that scientific understanding often relies on believing information without firsthand experience, turning science into a belief system.
</li><li><b>Critique on Understanding of Science</b>: Leo Gura points out that the understanding of science among laymen is often superficial and lacks comprehensive understanding with their knowledge often being based on facts inserted into a pre-existing complex matrix of understanding or sense-making, rather than the comprehensive understanding gained from immersive and hands-on experimentation.
</li><li><b>The Fusion of Beliefs and Facts in Science</b>: He emphasizes that the assimilation of empirical data into an existing web of religious or secular beliefs, myths, and sense-making systems shows how people, including professional scientists, conceptualize science. These beliefs contribute to the interpretation and eventual acceptance or rejection of scientific facts.
</li><li><b>Different Interpretations of Science and Its Facts</b>: There is a vast range of worldviews that different cultures, tribes, or societies can conceive from the same set of scientific facts. The interpretations of these facts and how they align with existing matrices of understanding often vary, leading to unique, often unverifiable and subjective worldviews.
</li><li><b>Dismissal of Certain Practices Without Testing</b>: Gura argues that certain practices like witchcraft may be prematurely dismissed as unscientific or invalid without rigorous investigation or firsthand experience. This is viewed as a problematic stance that promotes a deep-rooted methodological confirmation bias.
</li><li><b>Trial and Error in Validation of Scientific Methods</b>: The validation of various methods of acquiring knowledge is largely speculative and far from foolproof. Mistakes are common in the application of these methods. Most notably, Gura emphasizes that distinguishing truth from falsehood is non-trivial and non-obvious.
</li><li><b>The Misconception of Direct Experimentation</b>: The assumption that direct experimentation will yield more valid knowledge than speculative introspection is challenged by Gura. He suggests this assumption is biased and not necessarily correct, as actual validation might take significant resources and time.
</li><li><b>Unvalidated Scientific Practices</b>: Practices such as the use of a microscope or X-rays in scientific studies are commonly accepted methods. However, Gura suggests that accepting these as undisputedly valid without thorough validation could be problematic.
</li><li><b>An Example of Misconception</b>: A historical example relating to Aristotle, who wrongly believed that women had fewer teeth than men without ever verifying it, illustrates that the assumption that proof can be trivial or apparent is not always true; sometimes, understanding is only gained through progressive trials and validations.
</li><li><b>Galileo and the Telescope</b>: Leo Gura uses the example of Galileo sharing his discoveries about Jupiter's moons via telescope with his contemporaries. This was met with skepticism and denial because it contradicted the accepted model of the solar system. This demonstrates that the human mind can infinitely deny data that threatens its worldview by discrediting the method that yielded the data.
</li><li><b>Science and Interpretation of Data</b>: People's understanding of reality is constructed through the filter of their subjective minds. What is considered scientific is part of the ego mind's meaning-making system and is not necessarily objective. 
</li><li><b>Is History, Computer Programming, and Filmmaking Science?</b>: The question is raised about whether fields like history, computer programming, and filmmaking are considered science. While they contain facts and study various phenomena, they also involve speculation, storytelling, and are subject to biases. It raises the difficulty of categorically defining what is science.
</li><li><b>Debate on What Constitutes Science</b>: The belief in a singular, objective, monolithic scientific method that can clearly differentiate between various ways of studying reality is viewed as unrealistic. All ways of knowing nature are full of hidden, untested assumptions, demonstrating the relativistic nature of knowledge.
</li><li><b>Blending a Frog as a Scientific Method</b>: A hypothetical scenario of understanding a frog by blending it and studying its cells under a microscope demonstrates epistemic and metaphysical assumptions in the scientific method. The point is to highlight how choosing a method to understand something (in this case, the frog) is subject to the subjective biases of the scientist. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the Limitations of Scientific Method</b>: The idea of questioning the limitations of scientific method is introduced, arguing for a more holistic understanding that goes beyond purely physical or molecular interpretations. For example, learning about a frog's behavior, mating, and eating habits might provide insights that physical observations don't capture.
</li><li><b>Exploring Beyond Traditional Scientific Methods</b>: It's suggested that there can be a more comprehensive understanding of various phenomena by exploring beyond traditional scientific methods. However, this view can face resistance from those who rigidly adhere to certain methods due to their biases. 
</li><li><b>Denial of Alternative Methods of Understanding Reality</b>: There can be denial and rejection of alternative methods of understanding reality by those who have a firm belief in specific methodologies. This is reflective of the mind's ability to dismiss anything that doesn't agree with it, signifying a potential limitation of the scientific method.
</li><li><b>The scientific method and its limitations</b>: Leo Gura highlights that methods to conduct scientific research need to be varied and comprehensive enough to accommodate all domains of reality, which includes broadening the exploration to domains that may currently seem unconventional. The biggest challenge in this regard is that the method itself develops and evolves as we learn more about the universe, and different methods are required for different domains. To empirically validate the scientific method would, paradoxically, require a complete understanding of the universe &mdash; something which the method itself endeavors to achieve. This presents the circularity problem within science; a similar problem exists within religious beliefs, wherein texts are believed to the word of god and are taken as a priori truths because they are considered divinely created.
</li><li><b>Role of biases and dogmas in science</b>: Leo argues that like religious followers, scientists too can be a victim of blind faith &mdash; this time in the scientific method itself. This unwavering trust, however, has not been empirically validated, thus presenting another form of paradox. He contends that the materialist, realist, and objectivistic metaphysics held by modern science has not cleared the bar of empirical validation and yet it is held as true. This reveals the prevalence of biases and dogmas in science, which scientists are not willing to surrender due to their attachment to it.
</li><li><b>Open-mindedness in scientific investigation</b>: He emphasizes that open-mindedness, neutrality, and the willingness to revise or admit mistakes when they are discovered hold the key to conducting fruitful scientific investigation. However, contrary to popular belief, many scientists may not truly be open-minded or neutral, making them subtly akin to the religious orthodoxy they often criticize. As a case in point, the tendency to dismiss unconventional fields like witchcraft without first-hand experimentation or validation is a form of closed-mindedness rooted in dogmatism rather than empiricism.
</li><li><b>Conundrum of method validation</b>: The fundamental challenge is that we are trying to distinguish truth from falsehood while coming from a position of total ignorance. Unlike what may be popularly believed, the faith that scientists put in the scientific method is not the product of rigorous testing and validation; as such, it's not scientifically verified and therefore can be accurately termed as a form of blind faith. Much like in religion, this reliance on an unverified method can lead to circular reasoning, thus exposing an inherent problem within the practice of science itself. 
</li><li><b>Defense mechanism of the scientific community</b>: Unlike religious systems where the circularity and the acceptance of texts as given truths are obvious, in science it is more subtle and, therefore, more challenging to navigate. Defence mechanisms, such as labeling certain domains as pseudoscience without actually testing them, serve to keep the established norms unchallenged and maintain the status quo. However, to truly broaden the horizons of understanding, one must be prepared to challenge these norms and display a willingness to investigate the unknown.
</li><li><b>Circular Validation of the Scientific Method</b>: Leo Gura discusses the issue of circular validation in science, where the scientific method is used to validate the scientific method itself. This circular validation could double down on any mistakes in the method, creating a blind spot and barring any contradictory data from entering the method due to unconscious denial. This is an issue that cannot be resolved through science, but requires meta-science.
</li><li><b>Problem of Exclusivity in Science</b>: Leo compares the exclusiveness and closed-mindedness observed in religious individuals rejecting everything outside their religion to the dismissal by scientists of anything outside the narrow confines of science. This dismissal creates a problem as these confines of science have never been independently validated.
</li><li><b>Cannot Distinguish Between Science and Pseudoscience</b>: Leo makes the point that there's no clear line to distinguish science from pseudoscience and that even the confines of science itself haven't been validated. This leads to the conclusion that determining what is pseudoscience is an untested claim and results in begging the question.
</li><li><b>Scientific Reductionism is Inadequate</b>: Leo criticizes the attempt to turn science into a mechanical process that generates truth, highlighting the complexity of nature that can't be reduced to simple mechanical processes. This is a mindset of underestimating nature derived from a meta-scientific perspective. He further emphasizes that proper science requires self-awareness and self-reflection of the scientist's ego mind, as opposed to viewing science as an external process. The definition of rationality, believed to be a driver of science, is culturally defined and varies over time.
</li><li><b>Science is Not a Simple Process</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that science is not a simplistic process but a complex one involving trial and error, and exploration. It involves aspects of interpretation, theory, and assumption. The idea of truth is also subjective and relative, with nature and observations interpreted through human lenses.
</li><li><b>Science Involves Retroactive Justification and Trial-and-Error</b>: Scientists often have to retroactively justify their methods and discoveries. Major scientific advancements are a result of a complex, error-ridden process and not a simple logical progression. Scientists using trial and error to proceed further in their work indicates that the process of science isn't as systematically linear as it is often made out to be.
</li><li><b>Examination of Fundamental Principles in Science</b>: Drawing on quotes from Paul Feyrabend and Louis De Broglie, Gura underscores the importance of periodically scrutinizing the principles regarded as fundamental and necessary in science. These principles can often pose hindrances to scientific progress and form dogmatic misconceptions over time. This highlights the importance of keeping an open mind in scientific inquiries.
</li><li><b>Science as a Human Process</b>: Gura echoes a comment from Max Born about there being no philosophical high road in science marked with epistemological signposts. According to Born, science is akin to navigating through a jungle by trial and error, building our road as we proceed. This reinforces the notion of science as a deeply intuitive human process, rather than a simple mechanical one.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions regarding science's empirical vs theoretical nature</b>: Leo Gura points out that while science claims to be empirical, it is more heavily grounded in theory and interpretation. He states that an overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is theoretical, with only a small fraction being pure empirical fact. Labelling science as a compilation of raw facts fails to recognize its complexity, as it involves a lot of interpretation, speculation, and assumption. Even basic assertions within science, such as "lemons are yellow," are fraught with subjective interpretations due to the intricate interplay of language and metaphysics. 
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of objective facts</b>: Gura discusses how simple statements thought to be objective facts are actually subject to interpretation. For example, acknowledging that "the Earth is round" involves subjective abstractions that depend on your perspective or how "zoomed out" you are from the planet. When viewed up close, like while standing on its surface, the Earth might not seem round at all. Hence, even statements that are often accepted as objective scientific truths are deeply interwoven with human interpretations and views.
</li><li><b>Role of interpretation in science</b>: He explains that our understanding of science and nature lies very much in interpretation. Complex notions like evolution do not exist as objective facts in nature but are conceptual models created by humans to explain phenomena and as such, reflect a large degree of human interpretation and theory. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of fossil interpretation</b>: The skeletal representations of dinosaurs are highlighted as an example of scientific interpretation. Most dinosaur skeletons are incomplete and are representations of multiple specimens combined together. Additionally, realistic colours and features attributed to these dinosaurs are based on theory and assumption rather than empirical evidence. These examples highlight how science involves a high degree of guesswork, interpretation, and abstract notions that often contradict the myth of science as a compilation of raw, objective facts.
</li><li><b>Implications of subjective interpretation in science</b>: Gura uses the atomic model's simplification as an instance of how scientific understanding can often mislead. Despite vivid visualizations of atoms and molecules, modern quantum mechanics has debunked these simplistic notions. Hence, science is filled with theoretical models and conjectures that guide our understanding, even though they might not reflect the empirical reality. Scientific judgments are a result of complicated, subjective interpretations and abstractions rather than a clear-cut factual list.
</li><li><b>Under Determination Problem</b>: This problem relates to the issue of potential multiple interpretations for a single set of data. This acknowledges that different models can explain the same data set, thus making it a challenge to determine which one is the most accurate. This dilemma further underscores the significant role interpretation plays in scientific work. The under determination problem showcases the complexity of scientific knowledge and the challenge of defining concrete truths based on given data.
</li><li><b>Science is Deeply Theory-laden</b>: The models used in science to explain empirical data are theoretical and can be interchanged, with some being equal while others are not. These models give us a sense of reality but are not representative of truth. 
</li><li><b>Science is a Web of Interrelated Ideas</b>: In science, a large web of ideas points to one another and loosely connect to empirical data on the periphery. However, this data is interpreted in many ways and the interpretations can vary drastically, including secular, religious, new age or witchcraft views. 
</li><li><b>Scientific Statements are Tested as a Whole</b>: Individual scientific statements cannot be tested in isolation as interpretation is unavoidable in science. Also, methodological aspects like how to design experiments, which phenomena to study, and how to categorize data points are subjective and can drastically alter the outcome and understanding of the science involved.
</li><li><b>Science and Interpretations of Data</b>: The raw data means nothing unless interpreted. People dont get emotional about data, but rather interpretations and how they make sense of reality. Data points are often interpreted using a vast web of meaning, language, culture and various assumptions. These interpretations can explain the same data in multiple different ways.
</li><li><b>Interpretations are Biased Towards Survival Needs</b>: Human interpretations and emphasis on certain relationships or patterns in nature are biased towards survival needs. For example, object permanence, our assumption that objects exist even when not perceived, is an example of such a bias. Technically, strictly speaking, every time we turn our back to the moon, it is destroyed and recreated  but we conceive of the moon as a single, permanent object, an assumption that isn't necessarily empirically true.
</li><li><b>Science Represents a Man-made Fabric</b>: Science, as described by philosopher Willard Klein, is like a man-made fabric that affects experience only at the edges. It is misleading to discuss the empirical content of any single postulation in science because no particular statements are connected with any specific experiences except indirectly, impacting the entire scientific field.
</li><li><b>Criticism of the scientific method's exclusivity</b>: Leo Gura stresses that science should be about exploring uncharted territory and taking risks, not just reaffirming charted territory. He argues that significant scientific discoveries usually come from those with a "meta-scientific" mindset, capable of thinking beyond the confines of the established scientific method. This requires a holistic intelligence or intuition that science cannot fully explain.
</li><li><b>Limitations of relying exclusively on reason and logic for scientific understanding</b>: According to Gura, a common rationalist ideal is to develop a mechanical, proof-generating system to easily distinguish between truth and falsehood. However, he argues that the complexity and counter-intuitiveness of reality make it impossible to capture it with any simple, linear, or mechanical system. The greatest advancements in logic, science, and mathematics have been made through leaps in consciousness and intuition, not by mechanical methods.
</li><li><b>Einstein's view on the importance of meta-science</b>: Albert Einstein is highlighted as someone who attributed his breakthroughs to deep thinking about meta-scientific and epistemological issues. This allowed him to challenge established paradigms and make groundbreaking discoveries. He claimed that the majority of scientists are merely artisans or specialists, while true seekers of truth also explore the philosophical and meta-scientific aspects of their work. 
</li><li><b>Problems with arbitrary dismissal of alternative research methods</b>: There is a critique of the common dismissal of unconventional research methods, such as the use of psychedelics or the practice of witchcraft, as non-scientific or invalid. Gura argues that such dismissals often stem from cultural biases and unwillingness to personally test these methods. He emphasizes that separating truth from falsehood is highly difficult and often comes with substantial costs and risks. 
</li><li><b>Final thoughts on the lecture</b>: Gura concludes the session by encouraging the audience to contribute their thoughts, questions, and objections. He also prompts the audience to visit his website for exclusive content and books that deal with the deep topics of epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of science.
