[Music] this is a more personal meta episode that's going
to go into the behind the scenes of this work
that i do so feel free to skip it if
you're part of my core like hardcore fan base then
this episode is for you and for those of you
who are just new and want to consume just practical
advice type of content watch some other video of mine
all right so this is going to go a little
bit into like my thought process of how i'm going
to be evolving my teachings going forward and where things
are headed so half the point of this episode is
just to inform you my core audience of that where
we're going and how i'm thinking about evolving my teachings
and the other half of this episode is to clarify
just for myself my own aims and intentions and to
draw a line in the sand for myself as far
as what my standards are for what i'll be teaching
going forward so it's time that my teachings significantly mature
that's the conclusion i've come to i've been reflecting a
lot on my role as a teacher and how i
can best serve my life purpose over the last year
i've been you know looking at almost 10 years of
work there's been a lot of growth and evolution that
maybe some of you guys have noticed if you compare
my my earliest videos with my current ones you know
quite a lot of um stuff has changed for me
i've grown a lot i've matured a lot but now
i need to go for the next level the next
level of maturity and so i want to explain what
that means here you might have noticed that over the
last year i haven't been putting out as much content
as i usually do i like to put out one
episode a week i've been taking more breaks and there's
actually a list of reasons why i've been putting out
less content last year uh one of which is that
i only really want to be putting out the highest
quality stuff that i really believe in no filler content
no easy content which means like sometimes i skip a
week because uh i just am not satisfied with the
content that i'm working on at that at that time
or i don't feel the insights are particularly good and
it just needs more time to marinate right because like
i have to i have to do research for all
these episodes like i have to sit down and like
think it through really deeply and i have to generate
genuine insight right so all my episodes are built on
genuine insight that means i have to generate that i
don't just read it in some book i have to
generate it and then it has to be good sometimes
it's good sometimes it's not good it needs more time
to marinate in my mind sometimes i work on an
episode for for months or even free for over a
year just kind of brainstorming ideas loosely until something coheres
that's worthy of a of an entire episode sometimes there's
a topic that's kind of vague in my mind i
know it's an important topic but i haven't fully articulated
it even to myself i'm not sure how to communicate
it it's something slippery and abstract and i need more
examples and then some of the examples usually the initial
examples that i come up with are kind of not
the best i have to really brainstorm to come up
with the juiciest examples i have to think about how
could people misinterpret what will be said to come up
with you know advice for the traps that people fall
into so all this kind of stuff right this takes
time um and it's hard to do that on on
a schedule but anyways that's my work i'm not really
complaining about it other reasons is i've been facing chronic
health problems over the last two years and so i've
been dealing with fixing my health stuff that's been taking
a lot of time and energy away from from the
actualized work um so there's that getting that under control
has been challenging it's also been emotionally very taxing on
me and so forth so i've been working on that
um i've also been just getting burned out you know
doing youtube for 10 years very consistently tends to burn
you out so i've been taking more time off to
work on my personal life and i've been also working
a lot on my dating life on my intimate personal
relationships on my friendships that's stuff that i've put on
the back burner for the first 10 years of of
actualize.org and now i'm uh i'm i'm getting back into
that um just because it's something i personally need in
order to be able to actually do the actualized work
at the next level i need to work on that
stuff i can't neglect it so i've i've talked about
that a bit in my episode called burning through karma
so i've been devoting quite a bit of time to
that and as i devote time to that that does
take away energy and time from the videos uh i've
been integrating also some very crazy awakenings uh the awakenings
that i have lately are so profound that i don't
know how to communicate them um and they just kind
of stopped me in my tracks yeah i just they'd
leave me i don't know what to say um but
i've been working on integrating those and then thinking about
how to teach those in the future and how to
guide people towards that that's something i'll have more to
say about that at the end of this episode and
also in the next episode to come uh also what
i've been doing is i've been shutting off my mind
part of integrating these deep crazy awakenings was this um
necessary period of just like shutting off my mind and
thinking a lot less and the downside of that is
that that takes away from the videos because the videos
require a lot of contemplation a lot of insight a
lot of like relative type of ideas um and in
a certain sense the awakenings the crazy awakenings take you
beyond all that they take you beyond all the videos
all the content all the linguistic logical stuff they take
you way beyond all that and so um i've been
learning to operate more from a mind set of just
like no mind shutting off the mind and i've also
been applying that in my relationships and my dating life
and so forth um that was very necessary for me
but that does come at a trade-off in terms of
my work and i'm finding like a a way to
balance those because if you completely shut off your mind
that that turns off the spigot of insights which is
not ideal um and but if your mind is always
active that's also a problem because then you're like you're
lost in mind all the time so finding that balancing
point is something i've been working on over the last
year and uh now finally i'm starting to to reach
that that balancing point i've also been rethinking my whole
approach to teaching like what do i really want out
of being a teacher i started thinking about that more
because at this point i have 10 years of of
my body of work out there i've taught a lot
of stuff um like what what comes next am i
just going to be doing this for another 10 years
i don't want to be doing the same old thing
i want something new i want to evolve it to
the next level or i've been even thinking about moving
on to other things if i can't evolve it to
the next level so i'll be talking more about that
as we keep going i've also been investing a lot
of time just working on my own personal development working
on myself personal stuff reflecting about my character trying to
polish up my character make improvements or just even thinking
about what kind of improvements do i want to make
to my own character and just rethinking in general like
what do i want out of life i'm going to
be approaching 40 soon i'm 37 now i'm gonna be
40 in three years that's going to be coming pretty
soon and i'm almost feeling like a sort of a
midlife crisis of like well i've lived basically half my
life already if i'm lucky half maybe even more than
half um and really the best half i have lived
the best half the half where i'm the healthiest the
most mentally sharp i have the most energy that half
is already gone so now i'm thinking like okay what's
left for me right and i've already accomplished a lot
but also i'm thinking like uh what do i want
for the second half of my life how's my life
really gonna end what's the like what's gonna be my
legacy all that kind of stuff so i'm thinking about
that a lot and that requires also not just thinking
about it but making adjustments to my work over the
years putting out content for me has gotten harder and
harder because my expectations for myself have become so much
higher basically as i've become more conscious through all the
awakening and spiritual work and development work and all the
research and study uh it's really quite painful because i
become conscious of all of my own tricks my own
ego all of my own flaws limitations my own finitude
and all the mistakes that i make all the ways
in which i could be better like i clearly see
all the ways in which i can be better and
it's kind of painful because then it's hard to live
up to that so with a higher consciousness comes a
higher responsibility and so i'm feeling the the burden of
that responsibility and then i have to adjust my life
to that and i feel like i have to mature
myself like really mature as a teacher to rise to
to the to the kind of consciousness that i want
to ultimately embody so there's two aspects to this evolution
of my teachings going forward that i want to talk
about aspect number one is refactoring my own models and
understanding of reality so over the last 10 years i've
shared many different models with you about spiritual stuff personal
development stuff how to be successful and all that kind
of stuff and just in general my views about reality
and how you should think about reality right well my
latest awakenings are so radical that it's forcing me to
rethink all of my models and all the ways in
which i frame and teach things and even the way
art i articulate things to myself uh the way i'm
thinking about it right now it's almost like i need
an upgrade to the core operating system of my psyche
and how i teach and how i model reality like
i need a new architecture uh it's almost like if
you think about game engines you know you have like
unreal engine 4 and then you have the next generation
unreal engine 5 which is like a a whole new
leap in rendering and graphics processing and physics and all
that kind of stuff right you're you it's like a
new generation like every every 10 years maybe a new
game engine comes out that transforms the whole game industry
that's happening right now with unreal engine 5 that's coming
online so i feel like almost like i need to
go from unreal engine 4 in my own mind to
unreal engine 5 and what that would look like and
that means rethinking some things and framing things in different
ways it's not that all the old stuff is wrong
it's just that it has to be it can be
made better it can be solidified deeper connections can be
made it can be made higher quality it can be
made more nuanced more accurate and it can be deepened
so that's something i'm going to be working on and
aspect number two of the evolution of my teachings is
becoming a better role model so see i could have
the best models and the best explanations of reality that's
one thing let's say i get that right but then
what kind of role model am i that's a separate
thing right likewise you can be a great role model
in life for others but then your actual models of
reality your understanding of reality could be flawed or bad
or not as good as it could otherwise be so
both these aspects are important so this this aspect number
two being a better role model um this is perhaps
an even greater challenge because i don't really doubt my
ability to refactor my models and my understanding of reality
that i'm really good at that that's sort of like
my bread and butter uh being a better role model
that's that's much more tricky uh i need to change
my teaching behavior and the delivery to make it more
mature and aligned with the highest truth and love so
i need to be teaching from a higher integrity place
i need to be teaching with greater artfulness and more
intelligence in order to have the kind of impact that
i want to have on people now let me go
into some more depth about both point number one and
point number two so back to point number one about
refactoring my understanding of my teachings and upgrading my sort
of game engine after some deep awakenings that i've recently
had it's come to my attention that i need to
revamp my teachings to make them more solid more accurate
more direct to deepen them also it's become very clear
to me that i need to go through a process
of purging teachings that i picked up from others over
the last decade or two so that all of my
understanding of everything that i teach is my own really
comes from myself because you know i've read hundreds of
books i've gone to many workshops and seminars and i've
looked at many courses and i've literally tried to integrate
hundreds of perspectives from some of the best teachers masters
gurus yogis and experts across many different fields and i
encourage you guys to do that and that's that's a
very good approach so i'm not saying you shouldn't do
that you should but after a certain point you wake
up so deeply that you realize that a lot of
that that you got from others even though it was
great and useful it still wasn't really grounded in your
own direct experience and ultimately what you need is to
ground everything in your direct experience and what i've noticed
with my deepest awakenings is that i notice more and
more of the things that i got from the sort
of multi-perspectival approach that i love uh more and more
like the little nuggets that i got here and there
that many of them just aren't true to my direct
experience and so i need to purge all the stuff
that's not true to my direct experience and teach from
my direct experience i've actually awoken to a lot of
stuff that contradicts and goes way beyond classic non-dual teachings
and spirituality and so it's becoming more and more clear
to me all the the [ __ ] and the
games and um just the the limited ways in which
spirituality was taught and taught to me and let that
go and invent sort of from the ground up something
fresh something new i call this wiping the slate clean
i really want to wipe the slate clean and develop
my teachings uniquely based on my own awakenings and experiences
and not be concerned about what other people are teaching
or have taught or trying to integrate with them and
all that kind of stuff just do what i got
to do so i have to shed the old start
from a blank slate uh otherwise that baggage holds you
back sort of like you know you have an operating
system installed on your computer for a long time for
many years that operating system over the years you use
it you know it gets clogged up with junk files
and old stuff and some viruses are in there and
some trojan horse stuff is in there and some some
bad programs and stuff's malfunctioning sometimes i mean it still
all works but it's not like smooth it's not as
good as installing a totally new os besides which the
new os you're going to install is going to be
like a higher version os that's going to allow you
more features and it's going to be faster it's going
to have more bandwidth it's going to have new capabilities
that your old one didn't have so that's kind of
like what i'm doing with my own understanding of myself
and reality and all these teachings these sort of ancient
foundations that you start life with they get old and
they start to hold you back and so once in
a while you have to just just you know sit
down and say okay like maybe once every 10 years
you sit down it's okay i'm just going to wipe
the whole slate clean throw away all of the all
of the old teachings all the beliefs all the stuff
just like throw it all away and let me just
start from scratch that's a really good principle to adopt
if you can adopt it maybe once every 10 years
do that wipe the slate clean and rebuild anew because
those crummy old foundations you know they get rotted out
and then you're stuck with that and then you're building
on that rotten foundation and after a certain point you
can only build so high on that rotten foundation you
got to go back and redo the foundation so you
can build higher now of course this doesn't mean that
you throw away everything you learn it's not like i'm
telling you to forget everything you learned you couldn't do
that anyways you're not going to forget it all uh
it's sort of like a a mental exercise you do
where you kind of wipe this light clean and then
of course you never forget the stuff you really learned
um mostly what you're throwing away is theories hearsay beliefs
stuff that wasn't in your direct experience the stuff that's
in your direct experience that's mostly going to stay with
you those insights those life lessons those experiences those aren't
going away i want to purge my understanding of reality
of all human ideas that i acquired along the way
towards awakening really the way that humans make sense of
reality is incredibly problematic because it's very human centric and
human biased it's all about being human surviving as a
human doing human things and human ways of looking at
the world in order to act human that's fine for
being human but then when you transcend being human and
you realize you're not human and you want to go
beyond being human then you got to shed all those
ways that humans traditionally make sense of reality those i
need those ideas were necessary to get you this far
but now you need to let them go and operate
from direct experience and from things that transcend humanity as
much as possible at least that's what i'll be doing
for myself now there's a concern here when you're doing
this is that you're going to seem like you're contradicting
yourself and you guys might think that i'm starting to
contradict myself and you know in a certain sense my
teachings do contradict themselves and the reason that is is
because my teachings were always about my own evolution and
so when you're evolving and growing you basically have sort
of a choice you can be consistent and stay the
same or you can be inconsistent and evolve when a
caterpillar is turning into a butterfly it's contradicting contradicting itself
it can't stay a caterpillar and turn into a butterfly
it has that that that has to die it has
to change it has to admit that its old form
was inferior and that there's a superior form that it
needs to evolve to and that's all part of the
growth process so you might notice that some of the
things i talk about in the future are going to
contradict things i've said in the past and you might
wonder why is that well because because i'm evolving and
the reality is is that reality is such a complex
thing that there's no way that you can be born
and just nail it on your first try what's going
to happen is you're going to make many many mistakes
in making sense of reality modeling reality many many self-deceptions
many mistakes and you need to adopt an attitude of
admitting those as soon as possible and then correcting yourself
even if that means that you're going to contradict yourself
it's better to contradict yourself than to be wrong for
the rest of your life and yet be consistent don't
fall into this trap of sort of a foolish naive
consistency what you want is evolution and really ideally what
you want is that every year when you look back
upon your life you want to be saying my god
how stupid i was the year before and how stupid
i was the year before that and you want to
be doing that every year this means you're growing and
i really feel that like when i look back at
my episodes that were done five years ago i cringe
like it it it's cringe-worthy the things i said and
how i behave are cringe-worthy and that just shows how
much i've grown because if i look back at my
old episodes from five years ago i'd be like yeah
that's awesome that means i wouldn't have grown you see
so the lesson here for you is that this isn't
just happening to me this is also going to happen
to you if you're growing along with me your understanding
will will significantly ripen and solidify and change over time
and you need to be comfortable with that your friends
your family might think you're inconsistent your students your clients
might think you're being inconsistent but actually what you are
is you're growing the mind loves to invent narratives and
construct sense making and then as you awaken and you
do this deconstruction work that we do here you become
more and more aware of your own mental constructs and
how your mind is constructing reality and those constructs that
need to be let go or they need to be
changed or upgraded to better constructs this is what we
call construct awareness go see my episode called the nine
stages of ego development especially part three where we talk
about construct awareness so i'm becoming painfully aware of construct
awareness at this point like it's it's really bad see
to be able to teach these things i have to
i have to construct mental constructs to give to you
and they're useful they're like training wheels but these mental
constructs then become their own limits and they also need
to be transcended and upgraded to better constructs and so
on and so this will be happening going forward i
will be inventing better mental constructs going forward upgrading the
old ones right so you never want to cling to
your mental constructs too much you want to always remind
yourself that oh this model here or this explanation of
something there this is a mental construct it's not absolute
truth therefore we can always adjust it improve it throw
it away find something new etc so yeah mental constructs
can contradict and conflict with each other as you grow
over time and the narratives you create also will require
retooling as you develop and your mind basically operates on
narratives what you have of reality is not absolute truth
what you have is you have a bunch of narratives
and these narratives are biased limited finite short-sighted they're only
as good as how much experience you've had how awake
you've become um what states of consciousness you've accessed what
kind of information you've fed into your mind what kind
of perspectives you've heard of and haven't heard of yet
as you hear more perspectives your narratives will change as
you acquire more life experience your narratives will change as
you awaken deeper your narratives will change and honestly it's
been very challenging to figure out how to talk and
teach my deepest awakenings there's little precedent for how to
do that and i'm unsatisfied with the way that most
spiritual teachers teachings and schools have done that in the
past so i have to invent my own way going
forward and there's no road map for that it has
to just be invented as we go along and as
you're inventing stuff you're kind of experimenting you might come
up with one model one example one mental construct it
might be great or maybe it's going to be something
else you'll find something else better not you know next
year that's how it doesn't find it works for me
so that process will be continuing now on to point
number two which is about the character development aspect of
my teachings so i noticed that after about 10 years
of doing this youtube stuff i've had a lot of
success i've been happy with that but i've also the
success has has made me grow somewhat complacent self-absorbed and
insensitive the grind of putting out the content every week
the routine of it um i'm very sensitive to routines
because i'm a very creative person so i can get
stuck in a routine and then that robs me and
my creativity and so you know as they say power
corrupts and i'm not immune to corruption so i always
have to keep an eye on how am i being
corrupted by my audience trying to please them on youtube
just by the grind of putting out consistent content uh
you know the potential for money and fame and status
all this kinds of stuff there's a lot of ways
you can get corrupted as a teacher and so i've
been thinking about that i've been really reflecting on the
impact that my work has on others how i perform
and behave as a teacher i'm becoming a lot more
self-aware of the impact that my work has on people
and actually that's not something that's obvious it's not obvious
because i'm so deep in the work that i'm too
close to it and it's hard for me to have
an objective sense of how the work actually impacts others
and especially through an online medium you know the majority
of people whom my work impacts i don't ever speak
to them i don't ever see them and so i'm
just sort of guessing and so and a lot of
times i'm guessing based on comments that i get but
the comments that i get the emails the feedback that
kind of stuff that's not an objective representation of the
impact that my work has on people because there's like
disproportionate amount of trolling or disproportionate amount of ass kissing
both in the positive negative direction it's distorted right so
um the majority of the impact that i have on
others i never get feedback for so i have to
just sort of guess and those guesses can be wrong
and over the last 10 years you know i've been
i've been looking at that and thinking about what my
impact is and as my impact has grown you know
i recognize that i have a lot of positive impact
on people i also negative but realize that these teachings
can be dangerous they can be misused and that there's
some negative impact that i have on people i'm painfully
self-aware of the immaturity and corruption in my teachings it's
not that hard to see it what's hard to do
is to change one's behaviors an entire character to get
rid of those right that's not something you can just
that's not fixed just by seeing it that requires uh
years of like reprogramming work so i want to clean
that up i'm painfully aware of how people use me
as a role model for their behavior that's one thing
that i've really noticed and become very sensitive to every
word that i say every action that i take you
know thousands of people watch me look up to me
and then they try to emulate me because human beings
were just like monkeys and i noticed myself doing that
with teachers that i look up to you know everything
they do everything they say i just you know instinctively
want to emulate like a monkey and i notice that
for example every time that i say [ __ ]
someone's gonna think oh leo says [ __ ] a
lot therefore it's good for me to say [ __
] a lot or every time that i criticize or
judge somebody uh somebody in the audience is going to
think that it's it's a good idea to judge and
criticize people or every time that i act a little
bit close-minded in some capacity or fashion somebody else is
going to act that way or every time that i
act in an unloving way somebody else is going to
copy that so that's something i want to improve i
recognize that i have been very lucky to get this
public voice with significant reach on this youtube platform which
most people will never get i'm very grateful for that
opportunity and i understand that i have a responsibility to
use my voice and this platform in the name of
consciousness selflessness and love and this needs to be modeled
not just spoken of but actually embodied and modeled this
means leading by example this means not just talking consciousness
selflessness and love but doing it showing it and all
the little behaviors little micro behaviors that express or exhibit
that need to be aligned and made correct and what's
funny is you would think like oh well if you're
just you know awake or you have a bunch of
awakenings or enlightenment then all that stuff will just auto
correct itself right and the answer is no it won't
that stuff getting all little micro stuff little micro behaviors
into place that requires a lot of additional training in
programming that's not just going to happen automatically now to
some degree some of it will automatically improve and correct
and that has happened for me over the years but
uh but then to really get it down right is
going to require a lot of training which is what
i'm committing to here i really want to model and
embody spiral dynamics tier 2 cognition not just at the
intellectual level but also in my tone in my delivery
and in my style i feel i could improve in
that department still i want to be a better leader
i want to show and demonstrate what conscious leadership looks
like so i'm going to be working on that a
lot and actually the next episode that i'm going to
release is going to be a demonstration of what conscious
leadership looks like we'll get to that next week hopefully
i've been thinking a lot about what it means to
be a conscious leader a good leader because in history
we see so many bad leaders and even we don't
even need to go back deep into history we could
just look at current times current news current events we
have so many bad leaders behaving in various devilish ways
and so i want to make sure that i'm not
modeling that and instead modeling the other possibility which is
conscious leadership which is which is rarely found out there
there there there are conscious leaders out there but um
they're not explicit about it all the time because they're
usually doing something else they're not teaching you how to
be a conscious leader or why you should be a
conscious leader and also it's just rare it's just rare
to find this i'll have an episode in the future
about conscious leadership that will be a very important episode
i want to be a better cheerleader for the highest
potential that i know there is in you that's ultimately
what my leadership will boil down to and being a
good leader a conscious leader is hard because it takes
a lot of responsibility and selflessness that's why it's so
rare and frankly it's a responsibility that i never really
signed up for i never wanted it um the way
i began actualize that org i didn't think to myself
oh i want to be this conscious leader and that
a bunch of people will look up to me right
like i didn't start that way all i thought when
i was starting actualize.org was just like i want to
release cool insights that i know there are about how
to develop yourself and how to create a amazing life
there's all these amazing insights and concepts that i feel
are not getting enough spotlight in the news and in
the culture and in the media and so i want
to create this catalog of cool insights and concepts that
can help you to live a deep life uh i
didn't i didn't realize that at that time that i
would have to like how deeply i would have to
embody those and where they would ultimately lead me towards
and how much responsibility would come with that which now
i'm much more aware of because now i'm you know
10 years later i'm much more conscious i had no
idea really where this was going i sort of intuited
that it was going in a in a powerful direction
but i didn't realize how powerful and i didn't realize
the responsibility would take from me but now at the
level that i'm at now in my consciousness this sort
of um you know shirking of responsibility or not knowing
about the responsibility that i have this can no longer
fly things are not going to be so simple as
just having a catalog of cool insights and concepts for
people it's way deeper than that now so rather than
shirk my responsibility i want to accept this responsibility i
want to put it to best use and set the
best example that i can i have a responsibility to
use my influence and platform to model the highest levels
of personal development which is what i'll be doing going
forward i'm painfully aware of the ego laced throughout my
past teachings but also it couldn't be otherwise see because
in this work you know i didn't start out awake
i didn't start out enlightened i didn't start out god
realized that's like the end of the path it's not
the beginning of the path so what makes it so
difficult is that you start from a place of deep
ego and then you work and work and work your
way slowly out of that but regardless i'm not using
that as an excuse i want to take as much
ego out of my teachings as possible i want to
remove as much noise from the signal that i'm communicating
and that's an important concept noise versus signal we'll be
talking more about that in the future and i want
to do that so that my teachings are pure for
posterity one of the things that that pains me the
most is when i look at one of my old
videos and i can see i can see i can
see the beauty and the brilliance the insight the intelligence
in the teaching but i can also very clearly see
the noise the corruption the ego and it's like having
a beautiful painting like you know imagine a mona lisa
painting or something by picasso hanging in a museum with
like ketchup splattered over it dirt stuck to it that's
what i feel like my past teachings are like and
that really doesn't sit well with me and i also
don't know that it couldn't be otherwise so i'm not
going to be too harsh on myself you know i
can only do as good as i can i can
only create work up to my level of consciousness and
my level of development i can't go beyond that unless
i raise my consciousness more and develop more which i'm
going to be doing um so it's all fine it's
all good but like going forward when i think about
my work and the legacy that i want to leave
behind i want to i want to get to a
point where my my work is very like clean very
pure spotless and so that requires a lot of work
that i need to do on myself now you might
be thinking but leo if you're admitting that you make
mistakes and that you're corrupt and all this kind of
stuff then why should i listen to you because you're
not reliable here's the thing though is that every public
intellectual that you would listen to will make mistakes in
fact most public intellectuals out there say some very stupid
things they say some very egotistical things and many of
them are very corrupt without even realizing it most public
intellectuals have deep flaws in their world view and they're
so stubborn about it that they're never going to change
they're going to keep those flaws in their world worldview
for the next 20 30 40 years they're going to
go to their grave still maintaining their ideology and their
flaws i don't want to be one of those most
public intellectuals are deeply biased and self-deceived i don't want
to be one of those many spiritual teachings and teachers
are limited biased and very partial i don't want to
be one of those so this is my effort to
correct that to preempt that in the future in a
sense it's good that my teachings are not perfect because
actually it forces you to work on yourself now that
might sound like an excuse it's not an excuse i'm
going to try to make my teachings as good as
i can make them but i've actually been thinking about
this and kind of wondering like let's say i'm able
to make my teachings just perfect and spotless is that
even going to be a net positive for people because
if even i reach that point by the time i
reach that point people are going to be so in
awe of the teachings and are going to be so
like enraptured by that that they're going to stop thinking
for themselves when you have teachings like that you stop
thinking for yourself and you offload the responsibility just onto
the teachings the teachings become the next dogma it becomes
the next bible it becomes the next quran sort of
thing and i was actually thinking about this um like
how good would it be if in the beginning of
the bible the very first page of the bible it
said something like this this book contains many important truths
however we have deliberately sprinkled in 10 percent falsehood into
these pages 10 percent of the information in this whole
book is complete horseshit you figure out which 10 or
horseshit and which 90 are the gold that's on you
use your critical thinking skills to figure it out this
was done by design so that you don't turn this
into a blind dogma imagine if that was the first
page of the bible or the first page of the
quran that would be the most important page in the
bible and the quran it would completely change how people
take those books and those teachings and that wisdom i
call this the poison pill strategy i've actually deliberately thought
about in the future placing poison pills into my videos
deliberate falsehoods literally telling you false things on purpose that
i know are false you know maybe up to 10
worth um so that and then informing you of that
so that you you be forced to think for yourself
and to verify these teachings for yourself right this would
be like a a safety measure against these teachings being
turned into a dogma because that that's that was my
number one concern when i started all this and still
is to this day it's like people turn this stuff
into a dogma they don't really think about it critically
and that's very dangerous so maybe in the future i'll
put some poison pills in there but you know uh
i've been fortunate that since i'm not perfect you know
i don't need to deliberately put poison pills into my
teachings throughout my old teachings you'll find things that i
said that were mistakes or that were wrong or that
were corrupt you'll find that i would say probably maybe
five to ten percent my to ten percent of my
teachings just naturally just given my level of consciousness ego
and development when i created those videos five to ten
percent are are wrong and you went to a leo
then why why would i follow your teachings then well
um good luck finding some teachings that are 100 percent
unbiased 100 impartial 100 free of corruption and ego good
luck finding such a teacher or such a set of
teachings and even if you do you're going to start
to worship that teaching so much that you're going to
turn into a dogma and then what will happen you're
not actually going to be embodying those teachings so very
realistically how can you expect any human teacher to be
perfect like think about this this is a silly and
dangerous expectation be careful that you don't expect too much
from your spiritual teachers the point is not to fall
in love with your spiritual teacher the point is to
take the hints the pointers the nuggets and apply it
to your own life and then to rise to the
level be to a level that your spiritual teacher was
at or even beyond your spiritual teacher that's the point
right it's not to worship the teacher speaking of being
a spiritual teacher i've had to bootstrap myself as a
spiritual teacher nobody licensed me nobody ordained me nobody taught
me how to lead or how to teach no one
taught me how to talk about god or how to
model god truth love selflessness consciousness i had to figure
this stuff out along the way as i struggled through
it you have to understand that when i started actualize.org
let me think when i started it i knew about
the concept of enlightenment but i had never experienced it
yet and i didn't even talk about it at that
point when i started actually working i didn't talk about
enlightenment i i vaguely knew about it and i knew
that i would be going that direction but like i
had no idea where it was really going to lead
i knew it was going to lead to good things
but like i had no idea really so like there
was so much evolution a lot of my work is
documenting in a sort of implicit way it's documenting my
own evolution and of course it's showing you what your
evolution would look like as well the evolution that you
go through just from learning about you know let's say
you get into self-help then through self-help after a few
years of doing that maybe five years of self-help and
success type of basic stuff then finally you you learn
about spirituality then you start kind of like sniffing around
the spiritual field and then you try a little thing
here there you do a little meditation you do a
little bit of a retreat here there do a workshop
you know whatever watch a few videos then you get
more serious about it you know this whole evolutionary process
you know it's going to be very messy very chaotic
you're going to have a lot of wrong ideas about
how all of it works you're going to have silly
and stupid expectations you're gonna trick yourself and fool yourself
you know your first awakening you're thinking oh my god
i've awoken fully and all this and then you're gonna
realize that you're just kidding yourself right like and this
would just go on and on and on and on
and you'll fall into all sorts of spiritual traps along
the way it's a messy process and so what's been
happening with my work is that i've been building the
airplane as we've been taking off the runway you don't
start off life with a with a fully built perfect
airplane you have to assemble it as you're taking off
and there's a horde of barbarians chasing you so if
you don't take off they're gonna get you that that's
kind of like our situation here and i've had to
do this with plenty of ego obstructing and being in
the way what matters when it comes to spiritual teachings
or any teachings basically or really any information content that
you consume online is what matters is the signal to
noise ratio i'm going to have a whole episode on
just signal-to-noise ratio but basically you want to stop thinking
of teachings as either right or wrong good or bad
and you want to start distinguishing what is the signal
and what is the noise in the teaching so i
would say that my teachings have a lot of signal
in them the signal is the good stuff it's the
pure stuff the noise is the corruption it's the the
ego so i would say that my teachings have like
90 to 95 signal and maybe 5 to 10 noise
that's pretty good considering you know what's out there these
days online a lot of the stuff you find online
is like you know 50 signal 50 noise or even
worse like sometimes you get 90 noise and like 10
signal so start thinking of teachings in that respect now
what causes noise in my teachings fundamentally it just boils
down to my own lack of consciousness my selflessness my
selfishness my biases my ego my limited life experience my
youth and immaturity my arrogance my cravings my bad habits
that i've picked up over the years basically all of
that my ignorance and this goes for any teacher or
any media you consume out there basically that's what the
noise is the less consciousness you have the more selfish
you are the more bias you have the more ego
you have the the less life experience you have the
fewer perspectives you've experienced and contemplated and come in contact
with the more arrogant you are the more cravings you
have the more bad habits you have the the noisier
the teaching will be the only way to learn from
life is to make mistakes really so you have to
be willing to admit your mistakes and to forgive yourself
for them so even though i recognize various mistakes that
i've made in my delivery of these teachings um i
also don't beat myself up over it or feel too
guilty about it because i realize that really it couldn't
be otherwise right there's uh there's always stuff i'm not
conscious of uh like i've said in the past i
i'm not i'm never immune to self-deception i always have
to be vigilant about that i'm not immune to corruption
either and so it's a messy process and you just
gotta like you can't be perfectionistic about it you gotta
do the best you can do and uh allow yourself
to make mistakes it's okay to make mistakes what's not
okay is to make the same mistake over and over
and over again for years and for decades and to
not change so i don't want to do that so
i allow myself to make mistakes but then i want
to learn quickly from my mistakes and that's what this
episode is about and even though i say all this
going forward in the future i still reserve the right
to be wrong and to make mistakes and i still
don't hold myself as immune to self-deception or to corruption
all of that stuff will be operative for the rest
of my life i never expect to be immune to
those things i can get better and better at them
as i become more conscious i can become better at
avoiding that corruption and that noise but it's never going
to be perfect and so you have to set your
expectations realistically don't expect perfection for me and don't expect
perfection from yourself and don't expect perfection from from your
gurus uh i want to speak a little bit about
arrogance i'm aware that i come across as arrogant sometimes
and that's because i i am arrogant and that's something
i want to improve on going forward um but also
i was thinking to myself you know why am i
arrogant where does this arrogance come from and i kind
of look through my life and looked for it and
basically i i've always been arrogant um since a teen
is just it was there and i was like asking
myself why why is that arrogance there for me the
arrogance has been a tool that i use to actually
cut through the [ __ ] there's so much [
__ ] in society so much [ __ ] from
teachers professors philosophers that i've read um you know friends
that i've talked to in business and marketing within religion
within science on online from public intellectuals there's so much
[ __ ] out there that basically i've used arrogance
as a weapon to cut through the [ __ ]
basically the way i've used arrogance is it's like um
you're not going to tell me what to believe i'm
not just gonna adopt your perspective or your worldview i'm
gonna hold my worldview as sovereign um and i'm really
gonna stay true to what makes sense for me i'm
going to stay true to my intuition to my direct
experience and so from that came this arrogance and also
because i've been extremely ambitious since i was young and
my ambition and my vision for what i knew was
possible in my own life and life in general for
others you know what can be made out of life
i saw people living such mediocre lives and making such
small things out of their lives and getting stuck on
such petty human [ __ ] that for me you
know that ambition coupled with like a a real um
honoring of my own sovereignty of my own creativity uh
of my own intellect uh led me to this arrogance
and it's funny because you would think that like arrogance
you know it's very anti-spiritual you know traditionally that's true
uh but actually this arrogance is is this arrogance coupled
with this ambition is the thing that ultimately allowed me
to punch through all of the [ __ ] out
there within science within religion within philosophy within you know
politics within business within marketing within relationships within within all
of that to cut through all of that and ultimately
get to absolute truth now i'm not saying this in
order to justify continuing arrogance going forward i'm just sort
of explaining you know the deep psychology behind in a
certain sense i'm very grateful for it because you need
that because the reason you kind of like you have
to really be able to respect your own intellectual autonomy
and sovereignty because in the end to reach absolute truth
you have to do it through your own direct experience
you can't do it by trusting somebody believing some spiritual
guru and so my my arrogance has allowed me to
stay intellectually independent from everybody else right i never adopted
a guru and the reason that is because i was
too arrogant i never i never subscribed to any spiritual
school like buddhism or hinduism or vedanta because i was
too arrogant i never believed any spiritual teacher too much
i never put any spiritual teacher on any kind of
pedestal and thought of them as perfect i never kissed
their ass and in that respect it was perfect it
was exactly what i needed to get me to the
highest levels of awakening uh but also of course i
realize the obnoxiousness of it i realize the corruption it
creates within my teachings and my my manner i realize
how it rubs people the wrong way turns people off
it's not the most intelligent and artful way to teach
and this is not a kind of behavior that i
want to model for others to emulate although maintaining your
intellectual sovereignty is something that's very important so i'm just
you know sharing some some insights i had about my
own character flaws here um again this is not an
excuse it's something that i definitely want to correct going
forward as my teachings mature another point that i want
to address is exaggeration i've noticed that i'm prone to
exaggeration and i was asking myself why because otherwise i'm
very like interested in truth but then if i'm exaggerating
on some point then that's like it's taking the truth
into the falsehood and i start asking myself why does
that happen to me why do i have this character
defect and then i realized that the reason i exaggerate
is because when i'm communicating what i'm trying to communicate
is not the letter of the law so to speak
but the spirit of the law sometimes i exaggerate a
point because i'm trying to be true to the spirit
or essence of a thing the emotional impact of a
thing rather than its technical accuracy i'm trying to get
across the emotional significance of something that's more important in
the big picture because what i've always resented and disliked
about some teachers and teachings is when they understate things
like something huge like awakening you know they just say
it in a very sort of like it's a false
humility this sort of like false humility understating it it's
like oh it's no big deal it's you know it's
just a little a little thing it's just it's just
ordinary it's like no it's not ordinary it's the most
radical thing you could possibly imagine right so like when
i speak about awakening sometimes it seems like i'm exaggerating
something when i'm speaking i'm actually doing that deliberately i'm
doing that to communicate it's emotional significance to you and
to me that's more important than technical accuracy honestly i
don't really care about technical accuracy very much and you
can find technical inaccuracies and things that i've taught in
the past and you'll probably find stuff that i teach
in the future and um the reason it's never bothered
me or never cared about it very much is because
look here's the here's the problem is that i noticed
early on in academia that a lot of academics are
so focused on technical accuracy that they have perfect technical
accuracy but in the end everything they're teaching everything they're
studying is deeply deeply partial narrow and will never lead
you to absolute truth and so there's this funny trap
that you can fall into where you're so academic that
you're technically accurate on anything uh you're technically accurate on
everything that you talk about but in the end you're
fundamentally epistemologically and metaphysically and spiritually ignorant you have no
idea what's really going on and nor will you ever
you will never awaken because awakening is not about technical
accuracy and so it's actually possible to lie and to
deceive yourself and others through technical accuracy because you create
this veneer of oh look i've got everything it's all
technically accurate it's all scientific like all the numbers add
up all the logic is perfect and even though that's
true maybe um you're missing the bigger picture the bigger
picture is always more important than technical accuracy you can
always lie with statistics with numbers you can always deceive
this is the thing that many logicians and academic types
don't understand it's way too narrow of a way to
to conceive of reality to try to understand reality and
also the sort of academic style where you know in
academia it's frowned upon to exaggerate and it's it's frowned
upon to stress the emotional significance of a thing like
for example if you discover some you know some great
important new discovery within science the culture of science teaches
you or the culture of academia is to like report
it in the most driest technical sort of objective way
possible in the most like neutral way possible such that
when when people read your discovery their eyes glaze over
the problem is that when that happens people read the
discovery they don't understand the significance of the discovery it
doesn't really touch them it doesn't move them the spirit
of it doesn't hit them this is a critique i've
had of academia for a long time in my own
mind and so with my work i deliberately try not
to do that i don't literally try not to get
lost in technical minutia or to win technical arguments or
debates or to overwhelm you with data and facts and
studies because you can easily lie with data facts and
studies you can find a study that will lead you
to to come to conclusions that exact are exactly the
opposite of what's true so then what good are your
studies what good is your logic what good is your
data what good are your proofs when they can be
so easily recontextualized undermined and flipped upside down so again
this is not an excuse for exaggeration uh sometimes i
take the exaggeration too far but actually sometimes i don't
exaggerate enough for example when i speak about awakening when
i speak about the highest god realization the highest god
realization is so good that your human mind cannot imagine
that level of goodness any level of goodness that you
imagine the highest god realization is infinitely more good than
that and it might seem like i'm exaggerating but actually
i'm not that's that's actually the most accurate way to
describe the highest god realization it's absolute good it's infinite
good you can't conceive of such a good it's not
possible and if you ever reach that you'll understand what
i'm talking about but it might seem like i'm exaggerating
and sometimes i do just exaggerate something a little bit
you know here there i do value accuracy i do
want to be accurate and precise in the way that
i speak about the things i speak about but also
i want to stay true to communicating the emotional significance
of things like when speaking about awakening for example i
hate it when teachers do not communicate the emotional significance
of it how radical it is when they downplay it
this is i feel like this is such a disservice
to students now sometimes i can't tell are they doing
it because they actually haven't had the highest awakening therefore
they don't understand its significance and radicalness with some people
it's like that with other people i think they have
had it but then they feel like they just have
to like really play it down this sort of false
humility but this is not accurate actually you know when
something is deeply emotionally significant to communicate it without equal
emotional significance is actually a lie to say that god
realization or awakening is ordinary is a lie it's not
ordinary there's nothing ordinary about it and to feed that
idea into students minds to me this is a deep
disservice to students so this point about exaggeration is a
little tricky you can go wrong in both directions you
can become arrogant and you know overly exaggerating certain things
but you can also take it in the other direction
where you're you're too humble and you understate things so
here's a list of the aspects of my teachings that
i want to improve very specifically first i want to
change the tone of how i teach to be more
solid and more what i call tier 2 cognition see
my episode spider-dynamic stage yellow for more on that uh
i uh i feel like i'm very well grounded in
in in tier two but i feel like my tone
often times comes off as tier one so it's a
tonal shift it's not that i like i think in
tier 2 all the time but i don't always speak
in tier 2 i can get better at that speaking
of speaking the next point is i want to be
more careful with my use of language i want to
be more precise with my use of language that's something
i want to work on more the next point is
i want to be less arrogant less talking down less
finger wagging less self-righteousness and less shaming i use a
lot of shaming techniques if you haven't noticed now for
some people it works great you know for a certain
level of consciousness shaming shaming it works really well but
then for a higher level of consciousness shaming might actually
scare those people off so i'm cognizant of that and
i want to improve on that along with that is
less ridicule less belittling and more accepting of people and
intellectual positions and so forth i tend to ridicule a
lot again ridicule can be a powerful weapon uh but
it can also be taken too far it can turn
people off too um [Music] so i i'm i'm more
cognizant of how the manner in which i communicate these
teachings turn some people off and i want to correct
that so a lot of this list is about that
uh the next point is i want to be more
careful with judgment and criticism because anytime i express judgment
or criticism i'm actually i'm out of alignment with truth
and love and also i'm modeling that out of alignmentness
with you and then people people then get infected with
that judgment and that criticism and then they become judgmental
and critical that's a problem so i need to correct
that uh the next point is i want to exhibit
more respect for my audience less be less dismissing of
them more respect for your sovereignty more assuming a highly
intelligent audience sometimes i fall into the trap of assuming
that my my audience is dumb now this is tricky
because again actually you know if we're going to be
technically accurate the majority of my audience is dumb i'm
not saying that as a judgment or criticism or belittling
people that's just the case the majority of mankind is
stuck in a profound ignorance that's just the dark ages
that mankind is in right now we're in a profound
ignorance collectively um so it's tricky so do i speak
in a way where i'm speaking to the lowest common
denominator because like if i randomly just make an assumption
about who's listening to me right now chances are it's
an ignorant person sorry you know um but uh i
also recognize that a lot of you who are listening
are very intelligent and when i speak as though everybody
who's watching me is ignorant that does a disservice to
those of you who are very intelligent and by definition
if you're a fan of my work and you watch
a lot of these episodes then you're way more intelligent
on average than most people and i want to honor
and respect that in you and i want to encourage
more of that intelligence in you so it's a little
tricky to get this balance right um because here's the
other problem if i speak assuming high intelligence on everybody
who's listening to me that's also that's also a problem
because you might say well leo why don't you just
be like magnanimous and just assume that everybody who listens
to you is very very intelligent but if i assume
that then the way in which i teach for highly
intelligent people you see the problem is that if in
reality a lot of ignorant people are watching me they're
gonna easily misinterpret the intelligent things that i say to
those intelligent people that i'm assuming they are and then
they're going to do very unintelligent things with those intelligent
insights for example when in my mind i picture that
somebody who's listening to me is is stupid i have
to issue a lot more warnings for the things that
i say for example if i'm talking about psychedelics to
highly intelligent people i have to qualify a lot less
of what i say but if i assume that you
know some some 18 year old [ __ ] is
listening to what i'm talking to what i'm saying about
psychedelics then i have to say okay look be careful
with psychedelics make sure you're careful with your dosing make
sure you don't get yourself into legal trouble make sure
that you don't you know do it when you're on
a balcony so you don't jump out of a window
make sure you don't jump off a bridge make sure
that you don't kill yourself don't make sure that you
don't have a loaded gun near you right to explain
all these things to a highly intelligent person is insulting
that person's intelligence because he would think that leo that's
so obvious why are you wasting time on this you're
wasting my time but the reality is that many people
who watch thousands of people who watch this stuff are
not intelligent enough to understand all those basic things so
it's see it's not so simple just assuming that your
audience is highly intelligent just because you want to be
magnanimous and generous this is not necessarily in their benefit
really what's necessary is an accurate picture of your audience
and part of the problem is that i honestly i
don't know the full breakdown of the intelligence of my
audience some of my audience is very very intelligent some
is not and i'm not sure you know the full
proportions of it um you might say well leo then
don't assume but you see the problem is that when
you're teaching and you're speaking to an audience you do
have to make assumptions about your audience you have to
assume what your audience might know and what they might
not know you have to assume what traps they might
fall into which requires assuming their level of experience their
level of wisdom their level of intelligence their level of
consciousness their level of development so sometimes i sort of
like have a rough idea of what the average level
of intelligence or development or consciousness of my audience is
but i could be wrong about that that's very hard
to predict that because we're dealing with these sort of
gross averages how do you really know i don't have
very good feedback on that and in truth i probably
have a very diverse audience and then so when you
have a very diverse audience audience from all over the
world and uh different ages different development levels different spiral
stages like how do you speak to all of them
at once it's hard it's tricky but still i want
to improve on that that's not an excuse um i
also want to give more acknowledgement of spiritually advanced listeners
sometimes i speak as though you know you're spiritually you're
spiritual [ __ ] and a lot of people out
there are just spiritual morons that's okay you know we
all have to start there um but many of you
i also know are spiritually advanced and i want to
honor that about you also i want to be less
sexist and more friendly more female use more female friendly
examples sometimes i use overly male centered examples sometimes i
say somewhat misogynistic or sexist things so i want to
i want my teachings to be equally accessible to male
and female even though the majority of my audience is
predominantly male like 95 my audience is male so that's
part of the reasons why i use mail examples however
it kind of like it kind of goes both ways
it's two-way street because maybe it's because i used so
many mail mail examples that most of my audience is
male but honestly on youtube online the majority of audiences
for this kind of content are going to be male
and also just because i have sort of a masculine
style of teaching i have kind of like a brash
style of teaching um which is going to rub many
females the wrong way but hey those of you females
who are into that thanks for sticking around i appreciate
you i also want to be less heteronormative sometimes i
use examples that kind of exclude lgbtq people so i
want to i'm becoming more sensitive to that i can
improve on that um sometimes i use like heterosexual examples
rather than homosexual examples stuff like that um or i
just like assume that the audience is heterosexual which is
generally true but not always true the next point is
i want to aim for more technical accuracy more precision
i can improve on that less exaggeration as i've talked
about i want to be more professional in my style
in my manner i want to use less profanity and
less vulgar examples sometimes in the past i've taken that
overboard i've been trying to dial that back and i
will continue dialing that back going forward i want to
be less pushy with my worldview and my agenda because
there's sort of like a reverse psychology thing going on
the more pushy i get with enlightenment or with god
then the more resistance you're gonna have to it so
i have to like pull that back sometimes i'm a
little too pushy with that stuff um and that can
turn people off it can give kind of a tier
1 flavor to the teachings rather than the tier 2
flavor that i want a lot of this stuff is
kind of stylistic it's more style than substance but style
is important because people who come to these teachings you
know within five seconds they they make a judgment about
me about my style about the way that i teach
the language that i use and so that turns people
off and i don't like that obviously i want to
be more compassionate and more loving going forward in these
teachings that's very sort of you know love that's very
general um a general thrust of improving my teachings is
they're just going to be more loving going forward i
want to be more inspiring more hopeful and more encouraging
sometimes i feel like i'm not encouraging enough like i'm
maybe being a little bit too realistic on you or
a little bit almost like too harsh or too pessimistic
without really inc like encouragement i can do a lot
better at encouraging you that's that's gonna you're gonna notice
that in future teachings uh i want uh more recognition
of the god in you that you don't yet see
in yourself so i want to recognize that more in
you i want to treat you like your god but
you don't yet realize that about yourself as opposed to
treating you as just some stupid human some monkey less
straw man objections sometimes when i pose them sort of
like but leo sort of objections to my own arguments
and to my own teachings those objections sometimes they're a
little too ridiculous um they're not like the strongest like
i want to rack my mind to come up with
strong objections to the things that i teach and then
so that i can address those better less reactivity to
criticism of my work sometimes in the past i've gotten
hung up on you know people criticizing trolling me and
then i would kind of get like triggered or reactive
into that i've gotten a lot better at avoiding that
and in the future that's gonna like i'm gonna completely
eliminate the kind of reactivity towards criticism of my work
because that creates a lot of drama and distraction and
it just makes me look bad and honestly at this
point i just i've stopped care how i've almost stopped
caring about criticism of my work not completely but um
especially all the trolling type of stuff and sort of
silly objections and critiques i just want to like let
people do that and just not care and not be
reactive at all basically um the lesson when it comes
to cr you know criticism if you're a public intellectual
or something is just like just don't be reactive just
ignore it and just do your work and that's what
i want to focus on just doing my work doing
the best that i can and the criticism it's all
irrelevant i want to let's make less absolutistic statements rather
than saying stuff like every and all same instead most
or many like rather than saying that you know something
like all women love players rather than saying that say
that many women love players that's a more accurate way
to say it right or rather than saying that uh
all men will say anything get laid rather than saying
that it's better to say most men will say anything
to get laid that's more accurate all right um rather
than saying that all politicians are devils it's better to
say most politicians are devils more accurate um i want
to be more generous with giving credit to other teachers
and people who inspire me with insights a lot of
times i'll listen to some teacher about this or that
and then that triggers an insight in me i should
give more credit to those sources where i get insights
and inspiration from i also want to be less critical
of other teachers and public intellectuals and very careful not
to straw man their positions i've been a bit guilty
of that in the past i want to correct that
going forward i want to be more cautious and issue
more disclaimers for the mentally ill one of the things
that i discovered in this work over the last let's
say three or four years is just how prevalent mental
illness is honestly it's pretty shocking i didn't realize when
i began this work how many mentally ill people are
into self-help and spirituality they're attracted to it like moths
to a flame uh i didn't realize how much of
my audience suffered from mental illness honestly because i've never
suffered from mental illness so to me this was not
really an area of interest i haven't studied it very
much until recently and um and so i just assumed
it was something rare that i didn't have to deal
with it but now i understand like that you know
probably 20 of my audience has some kind of mental
illness and they're in deep suffering they have a lot
of trauma and this sort of psychotherapeutic stuff which is
really not my forte it's not really what my teachings
are about but i have to be cognizant of that
and i have to adjust my teachings for such people
issue the right disclaimers otherwise these people can easily abuse
these teachings take them the wrong way and so you
know that's something i had to learn just through kind
of trial and error um [Music] again in a certain
sense i was assuming the best about you guys i
was assuming the best about my audience which was sort
of like that the majority of you are not mentally
ill which is true the majority of you are not
mentally ill but i was assuming that like 98 of
you are not mentally ill but actually like maybe only
80 of you are not mentally ill the rest of
you are and look i'm not judging you like i
totally understand how difficult that is i feel very grateful
that i don't suffer from mental illness and i don't
have a lot of deep trauma in my life some
of you have gone through horrible life situations childhoods you
know have been abused in various ways or traumatized i
i totally understand that that's valid and that that's needs
to be treated seriously but also you should understand that
that is not the focus of my work there are
other teachers and therapists and you know techniques and methods
that you can find out there that that can help
you more with that that's not my forte that's not
my wheelhouse even though i can have some profound insights
for you on those topics it's just really it's not
really something that i'm very passionate about and the reason
that is because i just don't have a lot of
experience with that i don't i have not been a
lot around of been around a lot of mentally ill
people in my life um in general i don't tolerate
them very well like in my own personal life like
i i wouldn't be friends with a mentally ill person
no offense to those of you who have it it's
just that i have very high standards like for the
kind of drama that i'm willing to tolerate in my
life i don't i don't allow drama because that drama
distracts me from doing the work that i need to
do right and one of the biggest problems with this
mental illness and this trauma that you have is that
like it makes your life so chaotic and so dramatic
you're always in some kind of drama you're in these
whirlwinds of drama that you can't really self-actualize properly you
can't do the work you can't do the spiritual work
because you're you know you're always like uh in some
new storm of drama and i totally understand that that's
where you're at uh but also like to do the
kind of high-level work that i do i can't allow
that in my life so i don't i don't allow
that like near me and as a result i don't
have a lot of experience dealing with that now i
i totally appreciate other people teachers and therapists who specifically
actually work with that and they want that near them
like they want to work with mentally ill people and
people who are in deep suffering and trauma that's great
that's a very noble very very like incredible life purpose
to have is to to help those kind of people
heal but don't expect too much of that for me
like i'm getting better at that but that's not again
that's not my forte and that's not my specialty because
i'm i'm thinking about much higher stuff than that so
now you understand how that go works um the next
point is i want to be more concise shorter and
more direct and more potent in my teachings sometimes i
can ramble on too much or give too many examples
i'm gonna in the future i want to try to
like condense stuff down sometimes i just go a little
bit overboard and that's because sometimes you know i like
to hear myself speak too much i'm going to improve
on that going forward really it's don't judge the quality
of my videos by their length really judge it by
the potency by the density it's like how much insight
can you pack into as short a time as you
you can so if the video is only an hour
long but still manages to pack in three hours worth
of content and insight into one hour that's a better
video than a three hour video so the quality of
my videos is not just based on its length don't
judge it based on that the next point is i
want to be true more true to my own direct
experience i've already talked about that at the beginning of
this video um the next point is i want to
be more careful before giving specific advice to people in
general i've been pretty good about not just you know
giving too much advice to people like very concrete advice
um but i want to get even better at just
saying i don't know a lot of times people ask
me for advice in their dating life in their spiritual
work whatever and the honest answer is a lot of
times i don't know i don't have all the answers
for you a lot of times you have to figure
that stuff out yourself i have general principles i can
give you but that doesn't mean i know what you
should be doing specifically in your you know life situation
because there's so many details that come into play there
and it also depends on your personality type and what
your goals are and your motivations and your strengths and
your weaknesses which vary from person to person and i
don't know that about you the next point is i
want to be more responsible for what i say less
irresponsible with my words because i'm more sensitive and cognizant
of how words can hurt people words can be used
as a weapon so i want to be careful about
that i want to be less abrasive less confrontational less
aggressive i tended to be more aggressive in my early
videos i've i think i've softened up a bit i'm
going to soften up more i want to be more
gentle and more kind in my manner i want to
be less opinionated i want to be more honest and
vulnerable less posturing less pretense i struggle with vulnerability sometimes
in certain ways i can be very vulnerable in these
videos in other ways uh i also notice certain pretense
that i put on certain kinds of posturing and a
sort of a phony vulnerability so that's something i need
to work on going forward i also want to listen
to people better better and deeper with less judgment and
more charity especially when they have a significantly different point
of view than mine less dismissive of divergent points of
view this would be modeling more of a tier two
manner in style and lastly i want this work to
be less about me and more about the insights the
truths themselves that are being communicated and not my truths
but just truths so it's not about me these really
shouldn't be my teachings these are just insights of the
nature of the universe i don't own these insights i
didn't even generate these insights the universe generated these insights
through me since i am part of the universe and
i don't really deserve credit for the insights the insights
are universal if they're true and if they're not true
then what good are they now you might say well
leo it sounds like you're sort of like trying to
soften yourself to become more politically correct and wouldn't that
be sort of a sort of like selling out to
wokism because you don't want to get canceled or something
like that but that's not really my motivation here nobody
is pressuring me into changing or threatening to cancel me
this is more about me recognizing that i want to
be a better role model and a more conscious leader
and to me when i think about the kind of
leader i want to be in 10 years this list
that i just ran off all these improvements need to
be made to my teaching and to my style tone
and delivery in order to to match my own ideals
of where i want to be let's say in 10
years basically i want to live and teach with higher
integrity and this is what that looks like for me
so i've already been doing this over the last six
months but i'm going to be doing it even more
as i you know i'm gonna be watching myself like
a hawk any kind of acting out or emotional reactivity
i'm gonna be looking for that like a hawk i'm
just like i'm becoming so aware of my own emotional
reactivity to anything someone criticizes it's like oh i can
like immediately become aware of like oh i have some
emotional egoic reaction to that criticism and then i can
kind of like rather than acting on it just kind
of like you know cut it cut it off rather
than acting from that place or i can become aware
of like when i'm getting a little self-righteous or arrogant
and then kind of like tamp it down rather than
acting it out so this is what happens when you
become more conscious you become more aware of these little
subtle like egoic dynamics that are subtly corrupting all of
your expressions and behaviors with all the people around you
because you're always in this state of emotional reactivity in
one way or another you know something is threatening your
survival you get reactive about it so a lot of
what this process of improving myself is going to be
in the years to come is just like really carefully
watching myself and then cutting cutting off the emotional reactivity
and not acting out like sometimes i would give myself
just carte blanche or license to act out but then
when i do that i notice a negative impact that
it has on my audience my students someone that i'm
communicating with that i don't like and so i realize
that i have to become more careful about that so
does all this mean that my previous teachings are junk
now should you not go and watch the old stuff
no that would be a mistake there's a lot of
useful and profound insights in those old videos like i
said i consider at least ninety percent of what i
teach to be signal and only five ten percent noise
so that that's still a pretty good ratio also remember
it all depends on what level you're at actually you
know like for many people who are at the lower
levels of the spiral they will resonate better with teachings
that are a little bit more aggressive a little bit
more shaming a little bit more critical uh a little
bit more vulgar and use a little bit more profanity
that kind of stuff because it meets them at the
level that they're at the most advanced teachings are not
necessarily the best for you right now and also one
of the things that i want you to see i
think one of the most valuable things i can demonstrate
to you and teach you is just how much growth
happens in this process there's an evolutionary process that's that's
going on here and it's one thing to learn from
a teacher who's like 70 years old and has gone
through the entire evolutionary process but you saw none of
it all you see is the end result some old
guy sitting on a chair you know like i cartoli
teaching you about awakening and you don't see any evolution
in him because you know he's already he's very old
he's very mature that's not a criticism of him you
know great good um but that can give you a
distorted picture of what it's going to be like for
you for a lot of people it's going to be
hard to even resonate with someone like eckhart tolle because
he's just this like soft spoken humble quiet little you
know german gnome looking man sitting on a chair um
you know softly slowly speaking to you he's not really
kind of like matching the culture you grew up in
the kind of friends that you probably have the way
that your intimate relationships are the way that your family
situation is where you're yelling at each other fighting with
each other you know there's a lot of drama going
on it doesn't match that and also when you see
him like that like it's hard for you to connect
the dot between like um the dots between where you're
at right now let's say in your 20s or 30s
and where he is in his 70s it's like what's
going to be the process of getting you to that
what are all the intermediate steps you're gonna have to
go through so with me what you're getting um there's
trade-offs right um i'm not as mature as eckhart tolle
maybe i'm not as emotionally grounded as him or whatever
uh maybe i act him out more maybe i'm more
arrogant okay fine but you have to realize that that's
actually kind of like closer to where most people are
and and also that that's where you're going to be
at my age most people at my age are going
to be at that level or worse and so what's
going to be the process of getting of getting to
your highest self to your most mature self well it's
going to look like this process that i'm sharing with
you here and that you're seeing through all of my
episodes starting 10 years ago to today and beyond that's
what it looks like and so if you want to
go through that process you can kind of like see
what that's going to entail for you it's going to
entail you going through a similar sort of process that
i'm going through here and all the struggles that come
with that and also a lot of suffering and pain
from looking at your own shitty behavior from the past
i mean that's a lot of what this is like
the way you improve yourself is you look back and
you realize oh that was ugly and i said this
ugly thing and i did that ugly thing and i
behaved in this weird way why did i do this
and why did i say that it's like oh my
god i'm ashamed of myself it's like oh ugh it's
embarrassing it's cringy yeah that's growth that's how you grow
if you don't experience that then you're going to just
stay the same for the rest of your life you're
not going to mature so it's very important to confront
your mistakes be honest with them and then forgive yourself
for them because honestly you couldn't do better you can
only do as good as your conscious right now and
your stage of development you can't go beyond that this
shift in my teachings and in my style is going
to be subtle at first so don't expect some you
know dramatic change starting next week it's going to be
subtle i'm going to be working on it for the
next year and beyond it's going to grow and develop
slowly over time such that majority of people who watch
my stuff won't even notice it unless you're like a
hardcore fan and you've watched 100 episodes then you'll start
to see it going forward but you know for the
average person who just watches a few videos they're not
even going to notice that this is happening which is
why i'm shooting this episode to explain it to you
i want to make it explicit because i want you
to see like the nitty-gritty of what personal development looks
like it's not clean it's hairy it's messy it's dirty
a lot of times it's shameful so that will be
happening going forward hopefully you'll be able to sense a
little bit of it every week a little bit more
every week and uh i'll i'll still probably fall into
old habits because those old habits have been ingrained over
10 years of teaching and it's going to take me
some time to you know to adjust and to change
because the mind and the brain doesn't change overnight it
takes weeks months years these stylistic changes will apply not
just to my videos but also to my posting on
the blog and on the forum it should also be
said that learning how to be a good spiritual teacher
is something extra beyond just being spiritual it's one thing
to just do spirituality for yourself it's another thing to
then become a role model for spirituality and dealing with
you know hundreds and thousands of people and leading them
that's an extra step beyond just your basic awakening so
keep that in mind for those of you who are
watching who want to become spiritual teachers or who want
to be conscious leaders and role models that's extra that
doesn't come automatically with having your awakening that's extra work
you got to do to be able to be artful
at that developing that skill just because you can understand
something in your own mind doesn't mean you're great at
articulating it or teaching it to others conveying it to
others that's a separate additional skill you have to develop
and what's going to happen here is that as i
succeed in holding myself to this higher standard that i'm
setting for myself now i will also then after i
transition more into that maybe let's say in a few
months and beyond is i will then hold my audience
to that higher standard as well that's part of the
reason that i'm doing this and talking about it i
don't want to just hold myself to a higher standard
i want to hold you to a higher standard but
i want to lead by example so first i have
to do it then if i do it then i
feel like i will be in integrity to ask you
to do it what i can't do is ask you
to do it before i've done it that would be
out of integrity so that's why i'm doing this and
talking about it and one of the reasons i'm motivated
by this is because it's less even for me than
it is for you um like it's not so much
that i want to enforce the standard on myself as
i want to enforce it on you but to enforce
it on you i have to force it on myself
and especially especially those of you who are on the
forum some of you trolls and bullshitters on the forum
who are acting out um and being devils um you
know sometimes i'm a devil on the forum you know
social media tends to tends to bring out the devil
in us um but those of you who are on
the forum acting out uh watch out because my behavior
on the forum will improve over the next six months
let's say and and then i will be asking for
better behavior from all of you as well i grow
fast that's one of the things that i'm good at
like um i make plenty of mistakes in my life
but the one advantage i have is that i learned
quickly from my mistakes and i love to change i
recommend you adopt that same attitude i recommend you make
these changes with me so that we grow together otherwise
we're going to grow apart and i'm not going to
be waiting for you to catch up like you gotta
get on it right get on it do the work
do your homework grow yourself now hopefully it's obvious to
you that even though i've been talking a lot about
myself in this episode making it all about me me
me me me actually all of these lessons apply to
you as well as you go on to be a
conscious leader whether you're a spiritual teacher or not a
spiritual teacher you're going to be in some sort of
leadership role going forward probably especially if you do this
work you're going to be in a position to be
a conscious leader at work within your family amongst students
in your relationships whatever and uh all of these lessons
and problems will mostly apply to you as well so
really i'm telling you not just what i'm doing but
what you'll be doing if you're going to go all
the way with this work i've realized recently just how
much of a rare privilege i have to model the
highest truth consciousness development intelligence and love with the position
that i'm in right now this is the next level
of my life purpose the next level for me is
to become my teachings not just to teach but to
become my teachings now i've been doing that you know
for the last 10 years but like really emphasizing that
going forward i've redoubled my commitment to this work going
all in on my teachings here's what's coming next for
actualize.org uh currently i'm working simultaneously on 100 new episodes
this is like my roadmap for the next two years
basically i at best i can release about 50 episodes
a year at best so i'm working on about 100
of them brainstorming them outlining them i bought like 10
white boards that i'm working on simultaneously developing all these
ideas interconnecting them like working from the big picture down
to individual episodes so expect a lot of very practical
deep topics and episodes coming in the future not a
rehash of the old stuff but more new stuff believe
it or not yes there's still hundreds of totally new
topics that i haven't covered on covered yet and that
are going to be important and that you're going to
stick around for so stay tuned for all those and
then also what i'm committing to and i'm getting really
serious about is courses specifically i'm working on two courses
one course is going to be on how to program
your mind reprogram your mind rather and the second course
is going to be on how to access the deepest
levels of god realization and also on psychedelics how to
use psychedelics for those purposes so um those two courses
i'm going to be working on and i hope to
release probably one in 2022 this year and then um
the next one uh a year after that so again
this is sort of like my road map for the
next two years uh these courses are going to be
life-changing courses the first course on reprogramming your mind is
going to be very practical and it's going to work
for everybody who's into any kind of self-improvement or spirituality
and then the the second course which is going to
be on the the highest levels of god realization that's
going to be my most advanced material uh totally life
transforming stuff i'll show you how to access levels of
consciousness that are completely unimaginable even to those people who
have been studying spirituality for decades uh and there i'll
share with you my my deepest my deepest realizations and
i'll help you to completely deconstruct your mind and reality
that's like for the most serious of you um so
that's coming now when it comes to these courses i'm
not going to be marketing them to you i'm not
going to be chasing you down to buy these courses
and so i'm going to expect that you're going to
be wise enough to follow along with me long enough
that when these courses release you're going to find out
about them because if you just watch a few of
my videos and then you leave you're never going to
hear from me again you're never going to even know
these courses came out and you're going to miss these
courses which is going to completely transform your life this
is going to be some of my best work and
i think it's going to be some of the best
work that there's going to be within spirituality and within
self-help very life-changing stuff but i'm not going to be
chasing you asking you to buy this stuff so what
i recommend you do is either subscribe to this channel
if you're on youtube and or go subscribe to my
newsletter i have a newsletter that is specifically used just
to make big announcements about courses or big stuff that
i release i don't release some sort of like fluffy
[ __ ] every week kind of newsletters like literally
i'm gonna send out one email when my new course
comes out and then another one a year later so
i'm not to be spamming you with a bunch of
emails this is a way to ensure that we don't
get disconnected because you know even when you subscribe to
youtube sometimes youtube doesn't send out the notifications or you
might miss a video or your your youtube feed is
is full of a bunch of people you subscribe to
and so you just might miss the announcement for a
new course so if you want to make sure that
you don't miss these courses like i'm really committed and
serious about these courses um if you're serious about developing
yourself go to actualize.org slash newsletter i'll have a link
down below actualized newsletter put your email in there and
your name sign up to it i promise you're not
going to get spammed use a legitimate email address not
some [ __ ] one that use for spam when
the course is ready and only if the course is
ready and i'm fully satisfied with the course because i'm
not going to release a course that i'm not satisfied
with then i will send you an email that it's
out and that's going to be some serious some serious
personal development and some serious spiritual development for you so
i'm hyping this up right now because i'm really excited
about it like i've i've redoubled my effort here with
actualize.org with all the hundred videos that i'm working on
and these courses i'm planning it all out simultaneously so
i have sort of a roadmap for the next two
years and part of the way in which i want
to lead more consciously is i want to give you
a larger vision of where we're going together in this
work so it's not just like you're getting a one-off
videos like oh leo help me how to be more
decisive or help me how to get laid or help
me make some money it's like no we're doing something
much much much bigger than that with this work you
know the level of depth at which i teach almost
nobody teaches at this level of depth my courses are
going to be even deeper than that this is your
chance to make a decision that can alter the whole
trajectory of your life going forward and i also want
you to start thinking about your development more long term
than just watching a couple of random videos here and
there like really stick with me for this journey we're
not here for a few episodes we're here for the
next decade we're here for the next 100 episodes we're
here for the next two courses we're here to show
you how to reprogram your whole mind we're here to
get you to the point where you reach the highest
levels of awakening humanly imaginable that's possible but that takes
some long-term commitment and vision which is what i want
from you i don't ask very much of you i
don't advertise much to you i don't pitch to you
and do a bunch of sponsor deals and [ __
] like this these courses are a way for me
to sustain myself you know survival um to sustain actualize.org
without having to sell out to corporate sponsors and a
bunch of [ __ ] ads and all sorts of
gimmickry like this i've been very careful to avoid that
kind of gimmickry with my channel and with my website
um these courses are really how i sustain myself and
how i sustain these teachings and all the free content
that i do i couldn't do this free content otherwise
in fact last summer youtube killed about half my business
in a single day just by tweaking their algorithm i
lost about half my views in a single day and
forever from that day forward also lost half my revenue
in a single day and forever from that point on
uh i'm not blaming youtube i'm not saying they demonetize
me or anything like that no just algorithm changes right
youtube is always changing their algorithm tweaking stuff so i
get less traffic i'm not mad at them or anything
like that it just this is just how business works
this is how youtube works youtube is maturing as a
platform and so forth uh youtube is more competitive than
ever now you know everyone is chasing after tick tock
tick tock is the hot new thing now youtube is
doing these youtube shorts where they're doing these like short
little videos that are under a minute long my content
can't compete with that i need to do hour long
two hour long three hour long episodes that's what i
need i'm not going to be doing stupid tick tocks
right um it is getting more challenging for me to
survive and for these teachings to survive in this kind
of environment people's attention fans are getting shorter and shorter
and people are getting stupider every year i don't know
in 10 years if there's going to be many humans
left who can even sit and watch an hour long
video anymore it seems like everything's transitioning to tick-tock style
videos um again i'm not i'm not angry or bitter
about that it's just it's just how things are um
and so um [Music] it does help a lot for
the success and survival of this work in this channel
that you guys buy the courses the courses are how
i sustain all the free free content i can't do
free content otherwise and in return for that support of
buying the courses what i'm committing to is to make
some really amazing courses so that whatever you pay for
the course you're going to feel like it was a
steal or a bargain at the end of the day
i love to over deliver on content i love to
over deliver on the courses i love to make the
courses very practical that's what i'm committed to so if
you're interested in that go to actualize.org newsletter subscribe subscribe
to the channel if you're not subscribed stick around we've
got amazing stuff my best work is yet to come
i feel like my understanding of reality is finally reaching
a level after 10 years that i've just dreamed of
right in the beginning of this work for me the
vision was that i would be able to reach this
profound level of interconnected understanding of reality and then to
be able to share that with others it's taken so
long it's taken so much longer than i thought because
reality turns out to be so much deeper than i
thought so much bigger than i thought but finally i'm
starting to reach that point and i'm just so excited
to share the next hundred videos that i'm going to
be releasing are going to be amazing amazing content and
then the courses are going to be even better than
that so i hope you stay tuned for that and
thank you for your support the last thing i want
to say is this you i hope you realize that
you are a diamond in the rough that's what you
are the brilliance inside of you is waiting to be
unleashed but this diamond it's rough you yourself may not
realize that you are this diamond yet because this diamond
needs to be cut and polished and there's an art
to cutting and polishing a diamond correctly so that its
full brilliance can shine you got to cut it at
the right angles you got to polish it with the
right materials and so on and then you've got this
beautiful brilliant diamond that's what you are that's your full
potential and this work is about cutting and polishing yourself
year after year after year after year in more sophisticated
and nuanced ways until you get to the point where
you start to shine with your brilliance your inner brilliance
shines and it shines and it inspires everybody else around
you to do the same for them and this is
the highest joy in life this is really the sort
of meta life purpose whatever your specific life purpose is
that's great but then the meta life purpose for everyone
that applies to everyone is to realize that everyone is
this diamond in the rough and it's just about finding
ways of correctly cutting and polishing yourself up over a
period of years and decades to allow your brilliance to
shine and the saddest thing is the majority of people
have no idea that they're how brilliant they are inside
if they would cut and polish themselves up and they
confuse themselves for just ordinary stones and rocks when really
they're diamonds that's your true nature you're a diamond of
infinite brilliance and that's what this work and these courses
and this spiritual stuff this will this is what it
will teach you and this is where you get the
highest joy in life is when you are able to
shine with your brilliance and this brilliance becomes infectious and
infects everybody close to you in your life and that's
ultimately what we're working here towards we are not working
towards just helping you to improve some little aspect of
your life our goal is total it's the total transformation
of your life into brilliance in your unique way that
brilliance will be different for different people you know depending
on what your career you're going to choose and what
kind of relationships you're in and so forth but this
is what is going to keep you from becoming depressed
and nihilistic and cynical and bitter with life is to
find that brilliance and that's where you find meaning in
life the meaning in life comes from polishing yourself up
until you're shining and infecting others and that fills you
with joy endless joy a joy that is better than
any amount of money you'll get or sex or any
of the material pleasures that you can have although you
will get those naturally along the way so this is
not a replacement for that you'll get those things too
as you're polishing yourself up you know why because the
more brilliant you become the more value you put out
into the world the more attractive you get to other
people and also the more you start to attract opportunities
to yourself and good things materially and money and all
of that that all comes with discovering your own inner
brilliance and that's basically all there is to life you
