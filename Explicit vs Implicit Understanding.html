explicit versus implicit understanding the point of this episode is
to give you a deeper understanding of understanding what is
understanding have you ever wondered about that how does understanding
work it's a very mysterious thing understanding is not the
same thing as knowledge you can know for example that
the Eiffel Tower is located in France you can know
that as a fact that's well and good could be
true could be false so you could of course have
a false belief false knowledge but that's not the same
thing as understanding to understand something for example when you
understand how the engine in your car works that's a
different thing than just factual knowledge there's understanding there when
you understand how your computer works or something like that
understanding is actually one of these things that we take
totally for granted yet we're using it all the time
throughout life it's actually a very mysterious thing and it's
hard to put your finger on what exactly understanding is
because it's so vague and amorphous and yet it's so
central to how we live life it's so important and
that's exactly the point is that it's amorphous so we're
gonna have to work with that and this episode here
is going to be just the beginnings of laying the
foundation for understanding what understanding is by the end of
this episode you're still not going to understand what understanding
is but you'll be a little bit closer and to
get you there we're gonna be talking about the difference
this distinction that I call the explicit versus the implicit
distinction there are really sort of two types of understanding
explicit and implicit so what does this mean let's give
you a bunch of examples and definitions so explicit here
I just pulled these from the dictionary just went online
and pulled a bunch of different dictionary definitions for explicit
this is illuminating let's take a read here vote fully
revealed or expressed without vagueness implication or ambiguity fully developed
or formulated unambiguous in expression definite specific specific and exact
fully and clearly expressed or demonstrated leaving nothing merely implied
described or shown in realistic detail definite and unreserved an
expression outspoken so that's explicit in other words this is
stuff that's concrete that's material that's manifest that's actualized these
are all synonyms for that now let's contrast that with
implicit quote capable of being understood from something else though
unexpressed implied tacit unspoken not stated directly involved in the
nature or essence of something though not revealed expressed or
developed potential something is understood but not clearly stated involved
in Tangled suggested but not communicated directly that's implicit in
other words are actualized unmanifest or the essence of a
thing the amorphous essence of a thing that can't be
quite put into words so of course explicit versus implicit
this is a duality one of many many dualities that
we've talked about definitely make sure you watch my three-part
series called understanding duality where I give you a list
of hundreds of different dualities and I explain how they
work and how they reconcile and how they collapse so
the key here lesson that I want you to bring
in from that three-part series is remember I told you
that all dualities must eventually collapse and of course that's
going to be the case with implicit and explicit as
well but for now before we start collapsing them let's
first work to separate them in order to distinguish them
so that they're clear in your mind because right now
it's a confused mess for most people so reality of
course is both made out of explicit things but also
implicit things and it's the implicit that I really want
to focus on because the explicit is kind of obvious
and we all know about it it's all the material
stuff of life the stuff that's just spelled out it
doesn't take a lot of intelligence or consciousness to to
understand but then there's the implicit so the problem here
is that society and science because these are collective social
endeavors both society is and Sciences science is a social
endeavor if you don't know they both have a bias
towards the explicit why is that well of course because
when you're working collectively with other people it's really helpful
to be able to communicate and to express your understanding
otherwise how do we come together and create a set
of norms or how do we build a consensus that's
what science is science is building of a consensus amongst
a group of many people it's a cultural activity it's
not merely measuring things it's measuring things but then agreeing
on our measurements agreeing on our standards of measure and
so forth agreeing on how to interpret what we're measuring
and then society at large of course we need to
come up with laws rules ethics norms for how to
create a good decent peaceful society and for that we
need to come to some sort of consensus so there's
this inherent bias just in the fact that we're being
social creatures that we tend to favor that but that
becomes a problem because then there's the other side of
the coin the implicit aspect of reality which gets ignored
because it's difficult to express it's difficult to talk about
and so because of this the implicit gets treated as
less than it gets denigrated it gets treated as unreal
as imaginary as a fantasy or as the explicitly objective
stuff this creates a problem because this biases our understanding
only to the explicit actually makes us dumb our culture
conditions us to assume that everything can be explicate 'add
and if it can't be explicate 'add it's assumed that
it must not be true because hey everything kuru can
be explicated right but how do you know that did
you actually go through some sort of experiment to prove
that everything true can be explicated no because you'd literally
have to go through the entire universe to prove that
so clearly it was never actually proven empirically by science
that everything that's true can be explicate 'add and in
fact the opposite is the case which I'll be showing
you with examples in a moment here there are many
many things within reality which cannot be explicate a-- deafer
and in canada in fact there are many examples within
science where this is the case many examples within madame
at mathematics we'll be getting that to that in a
moment so the problem here is that the implicit goes
unacknowledged and undervalued in our culture and all throughout school
and as you were raised and the culture that you
were brainwashed with has so skewed your mind to the
explicit understanding that most people don't even know that there
is such a thing as implicit understanding or implicit aspects
to reality so that's what this episode is working to
correct try to comprehend this just because a thing cannot
be easily shared doesn't make it any less true or
any less important and consider the possibility that there might
be some things which are true in reality which can
never be shared with anybody or ever communicated yet they
are still true and they might still be very important
so if if that's true what I just said that's
a big deal that's also a very big problem for
us as a society because if there are things that
are true but which cannot be spoken well how do
we disseminate those things how do we teach those things
how do we get other members of society to agree
with us about these things this becomes one of the
core epistemological binds that we find ourselves in in life
is that there actually are very important truths which simply
cannot be shared and yet they need to be shared
because if these truths are not shared then mankind falls
into devilry and depravity and falsehood and society becomes sick
and dysfunctional and yet at the same time if you
do share these truths you can never share them so
I see you're stuck in this bind that's that's one
of the whole tricks and problems with this work that
we're doing with all the stuff that I teach naturalised
at org is a lot of the things I teach
are the implicit aspects of reality which are difficult to
share which is why you didn't learn them through school
and through your culture notice that you have many intuitions
in your life that you cannot easily articulate and yet
at the same time honoring these intuitions and following these
intuitions is crucial to your development and crucial towards truth
seeking if you're interested in seeking the truth so let's
stop beating around the bush and give you an example
so that you're clear about what I mean by implicit
so the best example that I came up with is
the natural numbers you know 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 the integers that keep going to infinity now
here's the challenge try to explicate the natural numbers try
to make them all explicit let's try 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 let's see you
you you see the problem here we can keep going
forever when do we stop you can't ever explicate all
the natural numbers why not because there's an infinite number
of them you'd have to explicate forever so the natural
numbers are actually we might say implicit the infinitude the
entire set of natural numbers is implicit because it generates
forever it's like a forever expanding object now of course
this seems very obvious and you might wonder well so
what what's they deal but here's my question to you
how is it possible that even though we all agree
that even if you lived for a hundred years counting
numbers you would never be able to explicate all the
natural numbers how is it possible that you're able to
understand that the natural numbers are actually infinite I mean
if you insist on being very strict and there are
these people who are really you know who love to
pretend like they're very scientific and very rational and very
skeptical and very strict you know no nonsense just hard-nosed
no rule stuff no airy-fairy stuff just very very factual
objective people these types who like to insist that everything
be strictly proven and demonstrated and no mystical nonsense so
if you're not that type of person then how can
you understand what infinity is because there's there's two facts
here fact number one is that the natural numbers do
keep going on forever they don't stop and you can
keep explicate the forever and fact number two is that
you actually understand that you understand that so don't try
to play dumb and say like oh well we don't
really know Leo we don't know maybe the numbers stop
at some point because you know maybe after a few
trillion it just stops how do you know if you
haven't explicator them all but you do there's an understanding
that takes place here that's what I want you to
notice you can actually you can take a child who
is just learning numbers for the first time and you
can actually if you did a very careful experiment you
can have the child like count up one two three
maybe give them some marbles to count one on one
marble two marbles three marbles four marbles and then you
can actually kind of lead them through that process and
then you can ask him like well when does this
stop how many marbles can we have and the child
will sit there and think about it think about it
think about and then he'll have an insight he'll have
an understanding of he'll say oh it doesn't ever end
these marbles we can have as many marbles as we
want it's infinite at some point in your life in
your career in mathematics in school you also realize that
so my question to you is how did you realize
that because if you're a stickler for only the hard
facts well the hard facts are that no human ever
has ever has ever been able to explicate the natural
numbers so what I'm suggesting to you is just the
fact that you're able to understand that natural numbers are
infinite that's already a mystical phenomenon that's going on your
understanding of that but you're overlooking it because you're just
taking it for granted you are your mind or your
consciousness is somehow coming into contact with something implicit something
transcendent which are the natural numbers and somehow the mind
is able to grok it obviously you're knowing here cannot
be explicit its implicit knowing so how is that possible
start to just wonder about that that's a mysterious thing
how is it possible for you to know that stop
taking that for granted stop assuming that it's obvious and
in that it's easy it's like oh well everybody knows
that it's just it's just a matter of adding one
plus two plus three and you just keep adding more
and more and more and it's just as no this
is this is mysterious spooky mystical stuff that's happening so
your mind see is your mind is so clever that
it's able to grasp a thing holistically intuitively implicitly without
having to go through every step and prove every step
along the way you can just say one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten and then by
that point you start to your mind goes AHA I've
grasped all of the numbers at once I don't need
to keep counting any further I've grasped their essence or
their nature and that I understand clearly is endless you
see so even though your mind is too finite to
be able to count all the numbers it's still capable
of grasping infinity this numerical infinity all at once but
if I ask you what are the steps show me
the steps prove to me explicate to me how you
understand or how your mind grasped infinity in this case
you can't do it because when I asked you that
when I asked you to demonstrate every single step of
how you grasped infinity that itself would be infinite you
see I'm asking you to explicate something that's implicit infinity
is implicit I'm asking you to explicate it but you
can't explicate it because it would take forever but yet
you can still get it that's some spooky stuff that
I suggest you stop taking for granted and you start
to contemplate and wonder about how that's possible and just
wonder at the amazement of it that's an amazing thing
you're able to do here's another example there's something called
transcendental numbers pi e and others that you learn in
school humans know the number pi you know 3.14159 six
whatever it is humans know that number two one truly
trillion digits decimal points but here's the astounding thing is
that no matter how far we calculate how many decimal
points further were still never any closer to getting to
the end of pi I want to read you this
quote from cliff pic over about this curious phenomenon of
Pi he writes quote in 1882 German mathematician Ferdinand von
Lindemann proved that pi is transcendental finally putting an end
to two and a half thousand years of speculation in
fact he proved that pi transcends the power of algebra
to display it in its totality it can't be expressed
in a finite series of arithmetic allure algebraic operations using
a fixed size font it can't be written on a
piece of paper as big as the entire universe end
quote that's pretty amazing just one number pi turns out
to be infinite and endless and what's even more amazing
is that this German mathematician Ashley was able to explicate
or to prove he was able to prove that basically
pi is transcendental that's pretty amazing how is it possible
to prove that something is infinite using finite symbols here
are some more examples a coffee cup I got a
coffee cup right here very simple object and I might
ask you is this a is this an object that
we can explicate is this an explicit object or an
implicit object and you might say and you know modern
physics will probably tell you something along the lines of
very kind of simplistically the materialist paradigm will tell you
well yeah Leo here's the classic definition of an explicit
object everything about this object here it is it's all
known in fact what we can do is we can
we can create a list of every possible fact about
this object and eventually we'll get to the bottom of
it and we'll have a complete description of this entire
object and that will be that and we will know
everything about this object that's sort of the metaphysical and
epistemic paradigm with which scientific materialism approaches that object and
basically the entire world but it's patently false that's actually
not how it works because the list of properties of
this object is literally infinite if you want to make
a list of all of the properties of this object
you're gonna have to list how soft it is how
hard it is how tall it is how small it
is how big it is how much mass it has
how much energy it has how much electrical charge it
has how much heat it has its temperature and so
forth then after you get done with all those you're
gonna have to start to list literally every position of
every molecule in it and you might say well so
what we can do that I mean yeah it's gonna
be a very large list it's gonna be trillions of
molecules that make up this cup but we can you
know if we had a really good measuring system and
a computer and a lot of time we could maybe
go through and actually calculate the the position of every
molecule in this cup and then we'll be done because
supposedly there's a finite number of these molecules right well
but that assumes that every molecule that's the end it
just stops it atoms but it's about atoms at atoms
have subatomic particles there's hundreds of subatomic particles you can
keep breaking them down further and further and further and
if you know a little bit about quantum mechanics there's
not even such a thing as a particle down there
really these are probability clouds various quantum field equations and
of course this cup you're not able to understand what
a cup is in isolation from its environment and from
the entire universe because when you get to that very
quantum level the particles in this cup are entangled with
the rest of the universe see and it's possible for
you to actually become directly conscious that this cup has
no bottom to it it goes on forever you can
keep zooming into it more and more and more and
more and more forever this is an infinite cup you
can view it from infinite angles you can zoom into
it forever you can zoom out of it forever and
you can list its properties forever and no matter how
much you describe and talk about this Cup you will
never get to the bottom of talking about that about
this Cup you could spend a thousand years talking about
this Cup and you will not be any closer to
the end of talking about this Cup now of course
some wise asses heroes olia but what about the Planck
length the Planck length for quantum mechanics tells us there's
a there's a rock bottom floor to reality below which
you cannot get and supposedly at that level everything is
quantized and there's just like little little bits you know
sort of like pixels on a screen and once you
you know no with all those pixels represent just like
on a TV screen then that's it you have a
full representation of the cup and there's nothing more this
is this is fantasy this is not how it actually
works there's no such thing as a bottom to reality
reality reality is bottomless it's infinite now you might want
to rollio but how do you know it's infinite oh
well here's the problem you're asking me to explicate to
you how I know infinity but I could ask you
the same question about the numbers the natural numbers how
do you know they're infinite you have to grasp it
with your consciousness implicit understanding or intuition so what I'll
tell you about this Cup is that I become directly
conscious that reality is infinite to the bottom most level
it has no bottom the cup goes on forever and
what I'm suggesting to you is that you can become
directly conscious if you work at it that this cup
is infinite but of course this is not easy to
do this requires enormous superhuman levels of consciousness which you
don't currently possess because you haven't practiced it but if
you sit for 10 years in meditation staring at that
cup for 10 hours a day you might be able
to do it or maybe take a psychedelic you might
be able to do it so for now just you
know take my word for it although of course I'm
not telling you this as a belief I'm just telling
you at this as a possibility that you can prove
for yourself so I'm not asking that you believe me
that this cup is infinite I'm just kind of like
giving you my conclusions here you know you have to
understand that what I talked about is just the tip
of the iceberg of everything that I know and all
the work that I've done I can't possibly give you
all the work that I've done everything that I've become
conscious of through one of my videos it's just the
tip of the iceberg my video is explicate implicit and
much larger sort of like the iceberg under the water
effect you only see the tip the tip is the
explicit part the rest the iceberg is the implicit part
most of reality is implicit the problem is that when
you expect me to explicate all of it for you
that itself is the mistake that's the core mistake that
science makes is that it approaches the study of reality
with the assumption that all of it can be explicated
and if it can't be explicate it isn't true that
turns out to be a dogma of science that turns
out to be false and it turns out to be
one of the fundamental fundamental limitations of science because you
can keep doing science for a billion years and you
can keep describing and measuring and explicate are-- ality and
you will not be any closer to the end of
it and that's fine you can do that there's nothing
wrong with doing that but the mistake is not getting
that that's what you're doing you see science would be
a lot better off if science understood that what it's
doing is that it's explicate the implicit and that it
will never ever complete that process and how do we
know that through implicit understanding you see a scientist will
say olio but you don't really know that prove it
but you see when you take that stance that is
the very problem that I'm talking about this is a
meta problem this is an epidermal logical problem it's in
a sense it's it's more fundamental than science its meta
scientific a meta scientific problem a problem that can't be
solved within science is that you have to go outside
of science prior to science to be able to understand
the limitations of science and the limitations of your demand
that all of reality can be explicate 'add it can't
let's give you some more examples let's give you some
more common ones not such nerdy ones like for example
the punchline of a joke you spoil a joke when
you over explain it what makes a joke a joke
is that there's something implicit there the punchline that your
mind in one instant Grox it's like oh yeah and
it's funny there's there's a sort of a a reversal
a twist that happens within the punchline of a joke
that makes the situation funny and imagine if you were
a type of person that was so serious about life
that when somebody told you a joke you were so
literal about it about interpreting it you weren't intuitive at
all you weren't willing to to go into the implicit
at all you were just completely explicit that you didn't
get it you never got what a joke is you've
never laughed at any joke in life because you just
hear the jokes very strictly and then you asked the
person to explain it to you and by the time
they explained it - it's no longer funny ever had
that happen to you I think I should tell a
joke I guess at this point to demonstrate this what's
so with a joke that I know okay there's a
there's a funny one interesting one so Sherlock Holmes and
Watson his companion they went to the desert camping and
they set up a tent and they they lay there
in the tent and they go to sleep and then
in the middle of the night you know they go
to sleep looking at looking up at the looking up
at the sky and then they go into their tent
they go to sleep and then so in the middle
of the night Sherlock Holmes wakes up Watson and he
says Watson look up and tell me what you see
tell me what you deduce and so Watson looks up
at the night sky and he looks at the stars
and he says wow there's so many stars up there
it looks like there's thousands of the millions maybe even
billions and you know can you imagine homes if if
only 1% of those stars had planets and only 1%
of those planets had life how many different life forms
and aliens and creatures must be out there in the
universe that we haven't even contacted yet so so homes
what I deduce is that there must be the universe
must be teeming with life and Sherlock Holmes tells him
no you idiot somebody stole our tent tada you get
it so see there's something implicit in the punchline there's
something unspoken that's what makes it funny and if you
need it to be described to you then you don't
get it and that's sort of the problem that's happening
with science is that science is so fixated on everything
being turned literal and explicit that it misses the punchline
of life the punchline of reality and mysticism is really
sort of the antidote to that mysticism is the exploration
of the implicit aspects of reality which science neglects because
it's only focused on the explicit another example for you
is flirtation and sub communication flirtation is implicit if it's
done right and if you take flirtation and you make
it explicit you ruin it and a lot of men
who first start to learn how to flirt with women
and I have to go through this process because I
was I was really bad at flirtation because I was
so explicit that I had no subtlety I didn't understand
the subtle art of flirtation I mean I had to
learn that I'd sort of like rewire how my brain
thinks in order to think in an implicit way to
be able to flirt with women and to attract then
see but a lot of like very nerdy artists are
autistic guys they they don't know how to flirt and
there's a really there's a really good example that I'm
gonna steal here from slaw Boise Jack who's a philosopher
post modernist philosopher and it's his example about coffee and
flirtation so some movie I forget which movie he stole
it from some movie so there's a guy and a
girl they have their date they come back to the
outside of the girl's house and so you know the
girl is trying to you know figure out how to
get the guy and so she says oh would you
like to come upstairs for a coffee and the guy
says oh I don't drink coffee and she says oh
that's okay I don't have any see that's flirtation that's
something is being communicated but it's not being explicitly stated
and that's exactly what you need for successful romance to
take place now imagine if the guy was autistic and
he needed everything to be fully explicate to him and
so the girl said that and he said oh so
you mean we're gonna come upstairs and [ __ ]
is that what she mean cuz you don't have coffee
that mean we're gonna [ __ ] right so if
he said that that's it the girl would never [
__ ] him he ruined it see but he has
to be clever and and wise enough intuitive enough to
understand that we have to keep it subtle you can't
just explicitly tell a girl that we're gonna go [
__ ] it's not gonna work but the way scientists
approach life in reality is they're like that autistic guy
where when the girl is like hey you know come
upstairs for a coffee and the guys like oh so
you mean I'm going to insert my penis into your
vagina oh please please tell me more here let me
take out my clipboard and let lets let's write out
all the things we're gonna do how many times do
you want me to insert my penis into your vagina
isn't gonna be 20 times 30 times and then are
we going to do some more stuff is there gonna
be cunnilingus involved is there gonna be oral sex and
what kind please describe it all to me this is
what science is doing with reality but by the time
you end up doing that that is you see that
very process of approaching reality and life that way in
that explicit way something is lost in that process but
many of these scientifically minded types who are very against
mysticism just as a Dogma they're against it they don't
get what they're missing so the point of this communication
is to help you to see what we're missing so
in this communication what I'm doing is I'm noticing notice
what I'm doing is I'm giving you examples similar to
what we did with the natural numbers like the example
1 2 3 4 5 so as I'm giving you
more of these examples I'm hoping that at some point
it gets through to you and it penetrates into your
into your skull and you have an epiphany where you
realize like oh I've been approaching my entire life in
this very limited explicit fashion and there's there's all these
other aspects of life that are in place that I
have been missing out on that's what I'm hoping you
get so by explicate Ingush I'm hoping you're gonna grasp
something implicit by the end of this episode will that
happen depends on you depends on how intuitive you are
depends on how holistically you're able to think about the
things that I say here so if you haven't gotten
it yet let's keep going I got more examples for
you so just to touch a little bit more upon
the flirtation business when you're trying to attract women as
a man the most important thing for attracting women is
the sub communication getting your sub communication correct what is
sub communication it's all the stuff that you don't say
which is actually doing the speaking for you when you're
speaking to a woman and you're trying to attract her
so for example you know most guys if you tell
a guy if you tell just like a total newbie
hey go go approach that girl and try to attract
her and flirt with her he'll immediately get in his
head and he'll be he'll be confused and he'll be
wondering like okay well what should I say what are
the perfect lines that I need to tell her to
get her to fall in love with me but see
that's thinking about it all wrong that's thinking about it
explicitly there is no particular line that will get a
girl to fall in love with you rather the way
you attract her is in the way you approach and
in the way you present yourself it's actually the sub
communicating the subtle cues that you don't even know you're
doing it's at the subconscious level it's your eye contact
it's your tone of voice it's how you square up
with her it's how you present yourself it's how confident
you are it's how easy you are about yourself it's
how fearless you are because if you come up to
her and you're mumbly and you're stumbly and you're scared
and you're shy and you're meek and you try to
supplicate to her you can't keep eye contact with her
and you're worried about what kind of lines to say
maybe you have a memorized line that you think is
cool and you're gonna say that I need to try
to impress her with your coolness if you do it
that way you're guaranteed to fail not because you said
the wrong words but because of the way in which
you sub communicated yourself you see because she is reading
your sub communications for honest signals of your masculine energy
she doesn't care about the words you use because words
are easy to fake she knows that you can memorize
some line and you can use that line on a
thousand girls that's easy to fake but what you can't
fake is being a genuinely expressive authentic masculine man with
that kind of nice confident energy and a [ __
] you know laid-back sense of humor and authenticity and
a bravado and confiden that's something that's very difficult to
fake and so what a lot of people don't understand
about how it attraction works is that the whole way
that you get good as attraction as a man is
that you actually you don't try to find some trick
to get in the woman's pants no you actually change
yourself as a man to become that kind of person
who can exude the authentic honest signals that she will
later pick up on and will attract her and that's
genuine attraction rather than sort of fakery see and of
course the woman is doing all of this without any
awareness that she's doing it it's all happening automatic on
her end so many women don't even understand that this
is happening they just have an intuition and women are
extremely intuitive and one of the reasons women are so
intuitive is because over thousands of years of men trying
to trick them into bed women have had to learn
how to suss out the the real men from the
fakers see women are more explicit by their nature their
mind works in a more implicit manner than a man's
mind a man's mind is more autistic and it wants
everything explicate 'add and that's a lot of times why
men get frustrated by women in relationships for example you
ever get frustrated if you're a man with a woman
where it's like the woman has some sort of problem
she's crying or she's upset or whatever and you're trying
to comfort her and you know if you were comforting
a man you could just ask your man friend just
like okay what what's the what's the deal let's work
through your problem brainstorm some solutions and then I'll give
you some advice and then we'll just move on everything
will be fine but you can't do that with a
woman with the woman you have to you have to
read between the lines you have to kind of like
intuitively guess what's going on and then you know she'll
tell you all nothing is wrong you know she might
be crying but you'll say oh nothing is wrong or
she might be angry but she'll say oh I'm not
really angry there's no problem and then you know if
you're a dumb guy you'll say Oh there's no problem
well Leo she said there's no problem so there's no
problem right wrong she said there's no problem that means
there is a problem it's exactly the opposite now as
a man we think like well why can't you just
be [ __ ] straightforward with us if there's a
problem why can't you just say there's a problem why
does she have to deny it and play these games
because she's she's operating from a different paradigm she's operating
from an implicit paradigm so if you want to get
good with women as a man you have to learn
to to tune into that different paradigm and then things
will go well for you and if you try to
be overly explicit with women in all these situations then
you're gonna find yourself rejected and and heartbroken as they
leave you until you learn your lesson and that's a
large part of what learning how to be good with
women is for a guy is is learning these learning
how to think differently see men like to get everything
spelled out literally whereas women like to be a lot
more intuitive another example of the implicit is in movies
in a really good movie they show you things rather
than just telling you things so if you're a good
writer you will write a scene where something gets shown
to the audience without being explicitly stated for example you
could have a movie scene if it's written by an
amateur writer it'll be two guys you know they're in
a room and it's just a UH exposition dump of
dialog one guy will tell the other guy I am
angry at you because you did XYZ to me something
like that that's not nearly as masterful as showing it
without saying it so if you're a good writer you
have to kind of think backwards and if you think
about like okay how can I show the audience that
guy a is pissed off at guy B for reasons
XYZ but not say any of that in the scene
so it'll be through a look it'll be through what
he's doing I'll set up the scene in such a
way where maybe he's acting passive-aggressive or you know you
know guy B has like a favorite a favorite object
of his and you know guy a who's pissed off
he steals it and breaks it or something you know
and that is what communicates to you that guy is
pissed off at guy be so explicit is not always
better and then for those of you nerds who are
really you know scientifically minded and rationally minded there's the
example from logic I talked about this in a lot
of length in my episode called the metaphysical implications of
Google's incompleteness theorem where Google basically discovered and proved that
all logics are inherently limited in that there's always stuff
that's true within a logical system that cannot be proven
or demonstrated by the logical system itself there are sort
of meta truths that require a meta logic to the
first-order logic there's a second-order logic that needs to be
added on top of it in order to explain all
the truths at the first-order logic level but then there's
other truths at the second-order logic level which can't be
described by second-order logic you need a third level of
third order logic and then there's additional truth of the
third level now that are created which can't be described
by the third level there needs to be a fourth
level and so on to infinity that's what basically Google's
incompleteness theorem shows there are always truths which are outside
of any logical symbolic system which cannot be proved it
and coudl prove that see and so there's an infinite
number of orders of logic and a different number of
different types of logic contrary to what many scientifically and
rationally minded people like to think see so Ashley logic
itself is transcendental and truth transcends logic you can create
a million different orders of levels of logic and you
will still not be able to capture all of truth
within your logic it's impossible what qoodles incompleteness theorem shows
is that if your logic is complete it necessarily contradicts
itself and if your logic is incomplete or rather if
your logic is if your logic doesn't contradict itself then
it's necessarily incomplete that's a twisted strange loopy conclusion which
is the consequence of the fact that truth cannot be
encapsulated in any kind of symbolic system and we'll talk
about that a little bit more in a moment here
about why that is here's another example of the implicit
let's say you're getting into meditation and you learned that
the monkey mind is the enemy in your life and
you want to silence the monkey mind and so basically
what that means is you want to stop thinking so
you sit down you try to meditate you center yourself
and then you start to say to yourself okay I'm
thinking all the time and now I want to stop
thinking let me stop thinking ah I've done it I've
stopped thinking oh no that's a thought oh that's another
thought oh no that's another thought wait a minute okay
I got to stop thinking let me stop thinking okay
hold on three seconds from now I'm gonna stop thinking
one two three I did it oh no that's a
thought you see what's going on here you can't use
the mind to stop thinking but of course it takes
a lot of practice for the mind to be able
to grok that because the mind every time it stops
thinking it wants to think some more wants to think
about how it stopped thinking which is just more thinking
which is sort of the self-defeating process so what needs
to happen through meditation is it there you need to
implicitly grasp some sort of new approach which is a
non thinking approach to life and it's hard to grasp
that because that that can't be done with the thinking
mind see it can't be done explicitly there's no explicit
like formula you can follow to stop thinking and you
need to grasp that and the mind is resistant to
grasping that because it's stuck on thinking here's another cool
example this is an example of reading between the lines
and I like this phrase reading between the lines because
this is something that I want to really teach to
you as a life lesson but first let me present
it to you with just this specific one example notice
the following if you're a writer no matter how much
you write it will always be possible to read between
the lines of what you've written for example Shakespeare you
know Shakespeare wrote a bunch of stuff and we can
go back and read Shakespeare's work and we can wonder
well he yeah he wrote these lines these are the
explicit lines of what he wrote but what did he
really mean by those lines did he mean a B
or C which did he mean now you might say
well wouldn't it be easier if Shakespeare just wrote exactly
what he meant because it seems like Shakespeare was kind
of ambiguous in certain places I know writers generally are
ambiguous sometimes they write sentences which are ambiguous you don't
know if the writers trying to say a B or
C or something else so how do we know which
way to interpret them and you might say wouldn't it
be nice if the writer just you know was extremely
explicit all the time and and just literally wrote everything
he thought and you would say well that would work
right but it wouldn't because it's always possible to read
between the lines of what was written how would you
know that the writer was fully explicit you might say
well the writer could write at the end of his
book he could say okay in this book I have
written everything that I wanted to write and everything in
this book is completely explicit and exactly the way it
is and it should be read completely literally the end
but you could always wonder well is he being genuine
about saying that or is he playing coy is he
serious or is he joking is he playing some kind
of trick on me is he being honest or dishonest
is he fooling himself so you could always wonder these
things which sort of leads us to the paradox of
honesty um if you're wondering whether somebody is honest you
can't determine that by asking them to explicitly tell you
what does an honest or not so let's say that
I'm a dishonest lying thief and you and and you're
doing business with me and I'm a con artist also
and so you're worried that I might con you and
lie to you and you know bilk you out of
your hard-earned money and you ask me Leo are you
honest are you gonna steal my money from me what'll
I tell you of course not I would never lie
to you I'm the most honest person in the world
I would never I'm not a con artist I would
never steal money from you you can totally trust me
let's go into business together it'll be great are you
gonna trust me see it makes it it does no
good to ask me whether I'm honest or not if
I'm dishonest to determine whether I'm honest that's a meta
that's an implicit meta thing that's outside of the scope
of our conversation you can't really encode that into the
first order level of our conversation because honesty is about
that it's a meta issue you see you can't make
it explicit it's an implicit thing which goes back to
the point about flirtation with women the reason women have
to listen to your sub communication rather than to your
first order communication to your words is because it's very
easy for a man to just lie to a woman
with words it's easy for a man to come up
to a woman say oh I'm a millionaire I have
a fast car and I'm awesome and I'm you know
I'll be a great husband and all this you can
tell her all that but can she trust you no
she can't trust you because you know she knows that
you want to get her into her pants at any
at any cost so you're gonna lie so what she
has to do is she has to go meta or
read your sub communication to make sure that the guy
isn't trying to [ __ ] her see she's looking
for honest signals the stuff that's difficult to fake words
are very easy to fake this is not a bug
of reality this is a feature of reality this is
not a bad thing essentially how reality works at a
deep metaphysical epistemic level that's what I'm trying to show
to you and this this notion of reading between the
lines is extremely important in this work that we're doing
you can't just approach reality in this dumb explicit manner
where you only read the lines and nothing between the
lines a lot of religious people suffer from this problem
because they read a Bible or some sort of holy
text or they listen to some words from some guru
and they take them so literally that there's no room
for interpretation in their mind but the whole trick to
all spiritual writings and teachings is that they're always talking
about something transcendent and implicit which can never be spoken
so if you try to approach spiritual texts with this
explicit mentality you're always going to get it wrong because
the true heart of what it spirituality trying to point
you towards mysticism is trying to point you towards is
the implicit and transcendent that which cannot be put into
words that which can only be sort of pointed to
vaguely and then it's your job to to realize the
finger is pointing at the moon so basically what I'm
trying to tell you here is that to a certain
degree all understanding is implicit there's different degrees of understanding
and implicitness or explicit as to understanding you can't make
someone understand something that they don't understand that might seem
like a tautology and it might seem like a vacuous
statement but actually it's a very profound statement to get
somebody to understand somebody to get under to get somebody
to understand something you have to explicate more and more
of that thing until eventually you're hoping that they grok
it intuitively and if they lack that intuitive grokking ability
no amount of explication will be enough for them to
get it there is no substitute for understanding or for
grokking even within mathematics you might say well leo it's
obvious that one plus one equals two and everybody can
get it no the whole point is that it's not
obvious that one plus one equals two it's obvious to
you because you take it for granted but at some
point in your life it wasn't obvious that one plus
one equals two that was something you had to understand
and that was a leap in consciousness that happened see
and if you were incapable of making that intuitive leap
of consciousness you would not know that one plus one
equals two if you try to tell a donkey that
one plus one equals two the donkey won't get it
you might say well that's because the donkey doesn't understand
English that's not why I mean of course the donkey
does not understand English that is of course a problem
but that's not the fundamental problem the fundamental problem is
that the donkey can't grok it and in fact all
mathematical proof hinges on personal intuitive understanding so the irony
about mathematics is that people who proclaim mathematics as the
ultimate apps of the truth and you know the most
scientific of things the most objective and indisputable of things
the irony of that position is that what these people
don't understand is that there can be no mathematics without
personal direct intuitive understanding a mathematical proof cannot work without
that in the same way that I said before if
you take a donkey and you show him his reflection
in the mirror and you try to point and you
try to like get the donkey to recognize his own
face in the mirror it's not gonna work the donkey
isn't capable of it not because the donkey is stupid
per se but because there isn't that intuitive leap in
a sense for a donkey to be able to recognize
his own face in the mirror a mystical insight needs
to occur which us humans take for granted see when
you get up in the morning and you go brush
your teeth and you look in the mirror every morning
at your own face and you recognize that as being
you you don't think of that recognition of yourself in
the mirror as being a mystical experience you think of
it is just like it's obvious it's just a an
objective scientific fact there I am but there's nothing objective
or scientific about that fact that's a mystical understanding it's
just so commonplace and you share it amongst everybody else
in your tribe so much and your culture that you
just take it for granted and you've called this science
or objective but there's a mysterious understanding how do you
actually know that that thing in the mirror is actually
you some kind of recognition had to take place there
that was intuition at work you shouldn't certainly didn't go
through some sort of proof process it's not like you
sat down one day looking at a mirror than you
said okay here's a freckle on this cheek and there's
a freckle on that cheek and here's a nose and
there's a nose and here's a lip and there's a
lip and here's a tooth and there's a tooth and
there's a hair here and a hair they're all oh
it's me I proved it you didn't go through that
process you grasp it intuitively instantly at one point in
your life and most creatures on this planet can't do
that if you can supposedly crows can do it certain
chimps and monkeys can do it Apes I think [Music]
maybe a few more animals can do it I think
like Ravens can do it or something um and and
that's about it maybe dolphins I don't know and so
this takes us to the issue of God now of
course so why is there this all this confusion about
God how do you come up with a proof for
God you can't come up with a proof for God
because God is implicit God is everything so how do
you prove God you can't the only way you can
understand what God is is to realize that you are
God do you understand that right now that you are
God are you conscious of that no you're like that
donkey in that mirror you don't get it and so
I mean I could help to kind of explicate more
and more of God to you but at some point
no matter how much I exploit eight at some point
you got to grok it or you won't get it
and you will just sit there and deny that there's
a God you just don't get it and there's no
substitute for forgetting it other than getting it you have
to get it you can't make someone understand something they
don't understand there's no substitute or shortcut for understanding understanding
is it you either get it or you don't of
course it can be helpful to explicate God in the
same way that it can be helpful when we're dealing
with a child to explicate the natural numbers 1 2
3 4 5 until the child gets it so if
we took for example a group of a hundred children
who or I don't know let's say five years old
or something like that children who basically didn't know numbers
we took a hundred of them and then we sat
them all down and we just did a science experiment
where we we took a big whiteboard and we started
writing out one two three four five and then we
told the children as we're doing this what we told
them raise your hand at the moment that you under
and that numbers are infinite and endless so a few
children a very small percent of children would raise their
hand immediately because they already get it but most of
them wouldn't so you'd have to explicate so you'd have
to say ok 1 2 3 4 5 by the
time you got to 5 a few more children would
raise their hand because they would get it that it's
good this gonna keep going forever but many children still
wouldn't get it they're a little bit slow not as
intuitive as the other ones so we got to keep
going 6 7 8 9 10 a few more would
raise their hand by the time we got to maybe
50 the number 50 the majority then we're ready to
raise our hand but if you still wouldn't you know
they're in third they're lagging behind so we would keep
doing this until one we hope that they would all
get it at some point but but some of them
wouldn't get it even if we went to a million
so that person is a lost cause that's a problem
with their intuition so it's exactly the same way with
God if you're trying to become conscious of God what
God is except it's a little more tricky with God
because it's it's so it's so devilishly tricky and twisted
that we explicate more and more of God to you
through various spiritual teachings and through meditation exercises and so
forth guided meditations and so on and their self inquiry
practice and so on you keep doing that doing that
through psychedelics as well you can keep explicate more and
more and more of God until one day it becomes
so [ __ ] obvious that you're like oh all
of this is God oh okay I get it now
duh of course but it took all years and years
sometimes decades of explication for you to get to that
point and every person will wake up at their own
pace some people need a few days some people need
a few years some people need a few decades some
people need a few lifetimes to wake up here's another
example for you of implicit versus explicit I was at
a workshop a while back with Peter Ralston he was
teaching this workshop and I'll never I'll never forget this
we were talking about language the nature of language language
is a very interesting thing to contemplate and anyways mmm
he was explaining basically how all symbols are sort of
a relative and meaningless we project meeting onto symbols that's
all nice and fairly easy to understand but there was
a moment where my jaw dropped in my understanding of
how symbols work and how language works and that's when
I understood that the act of pointing at a thing
with your finger that that itself is a meaningless act
that we are projecting meaning onto so you might say
like how does a child know what the word cat
means well you would say probably something like the parents
say the word cat and then they take their finger
and they point at a cat that thing over that
furry tailed thing over there they point at it they
say Cat Cat Cat Cat and the child goes oh
yeah okay so cat is is that thing that the
parent is pointing at and that's first of all recognize
that that's a pretty big leap in consciousness to be
able to recognize at all the word cat is somehow
connect to that furry thing over there that's a that's
a pretty amazing thing the human consciousness is able to
do but but there's something even more amazing here what's
even more amazing is that the human consciousness is able
to understand that this that this thing here this act
of pointing that this that this has a meaning to
it beyond what it actually is more than just a
finger because if you go to a donkey and you
point to a donkey hey hey look back there and
you point this way the donkey is not gonna look
at your you know where you're pointing the donkey is
just gonna look at your finger and see a finger
he's not gonna see a pointer so just to understand
that a finger is a pointer he's already a momentous
leap in consciousness that's a highly implicit and intuitive activity
so it's not just that the child is connecting the
sound cat to a furry creature over there it's that
the child is first understanding the meaning of this pointing
activity and that there is even such a possibility as
pointing at all when I realize that that's when my
jaw dropped that's a mindfuck right there when you understand
the significance of that that a pointer is something that
your mind is projecting onto reality there's really no such
thing as pointers until you imagine that there are the
finger is not really a pointer wow that's deep so
reality is transcendental what does that mean sounds like a
fancy philosophical ordered sounds like it's just a word salad
doesn't mean anything well no it means something here's a
definition for transcendental again gathered for merits online dictionaries quote
surpassing or superior mystical supernatural metaphysical abstruse which means difficult
to understand or obscure and abstract a function that cannot
be expressed by a finite number of algebraic operations not
expressible algebraically in terms of variables and constants idealist lofty
categories that have universal applications such as being oneness truth
and goodness extremely special and unusual and cannot be understood
in ordinary ways beyond the human experience things that lie
beyond the practical experience of ordinary people and cannot be
discovered or understood by ordinary reasoning extra categorical categorical attributes
of being that's transcendental so basically what transcendental means is
that no matter how much you explicate reality there will
always be more left over which is implicit and unexploited
and that is in a sense the very essence of
reality itself reality is a thing which is endlessly being
explicate it without ever ending reality is like a bag
of marbles and you can pull out at one marble
two marbles three marbles four marbles and you can keep
pulling out these marbles forever and they never end and
you might wonder that's impossible that's crazy how could that
be this breaks the laws of logic and science and
physics and all this no it doesn't break the laws
of anything if you look around you carefully you'll see
that this process of an infinity being explicate 'add from
going from the implicit to the excellent is happening all
the time in all places whether it's a coffee cup
or it's the natural numbers that you learned in in
grade school or it's anything and literally any object around
you as infinite can be explicate forever I guess it
would be more accurate to say that reality is like
a bag out of which we can just pull objects
of any kind we can pull out a marble we
can pull out a fish we can pull out a
cat a dog a building a car a tree sex
male/female a planet a galaxy a universe a star a
meteor a dinosaur and a human and we just keep
going and going and it's an endless bag of anything
you want that's basically what infinity is now okay be
careful though to distinguish when I talk about infinity there's
sort of two infinities the infinity I was talking about
the very beginning the numerical infinity of the natural numbers
that's infinity with a lowercase I so just it's the
infinity of numbers and then when I'm talking about infinity
of the entire universe I'm talking about absolute infinity that's
the nature of what God is it's absolute infinity that's
the nature of what everything is absolute infinity that's not
a numerical thing don't confuse that with numerical infinity absolute
infinity is actual infinity actual infinity is what is happening
right here right now is everything it's all the physical
stuff that you see that's actual infinity so be careful
to distinguish those two and not blur them together numerical
infinity is just 1 infinity within absolute infinities the absolute
infinity contains an infinite number of lower infinities so I
want you to take seriously the possibility that the deepest
truths and understandings in life are necessarily irreducibly implicit requiring
intuition and consciousness that can't be replaced or substituted with
anything else cannot be fully articulated cannot be broken down
into a linear sequence of steps cannot be formally proven
and that none of this is a weakness that this
is actually a strength because this is what allows reality
to be endless if it wasn't this way reality would
be finite and we would quickly get to the end
of it and it would be rather boring and and
kind of bland because we would know everything the amazing
thing about reality is that it's endless you could never
know it you can keep trying to know what forever
and that process will never end but at the same
time even though that's true you can also grasp the
fact that it's unknowable or that it's infinite absolutely infinite
as a whole in the same way that you can
with the natural numbers so don't make the mistake of
thinking like well if reality is infinite that means that
we can't really know that it's impossible to know that
and therefore we're screwed no no that's not what it
means that would be the same mistake as a child
seeing me writing on a whiteboard one two three four
five and the child say oh well we're screwed now
because obviously you know we're not gonna sit here forever
and count up all these numbers no you can actually
understand that this goes on forever and that that is
the nature of numbers that they go on forever you
can know that without explicitly knowing what the trillionth number
is and that's an amazing thing that your mind is
able to do your mind ape is able to holistically
understand a thing without having to explicate in a linear
sequence all of its finite steps but if you keep
insisting that we have to explicate everything now there you're
screwed but in that case you're screwing yourself which is
what I want you to recognize you're artificially limiting your
own self your own mind your mind is capable of
going infinite if you let it but if you demonize
the infinite and if you demonize paradox and if you
demonize and diminish the implicit and you deny that it
exists well then you've limited yourself to being limited see
so you have to be careful about how your own
mind limits you in this situation so why is it
that truth with a capital T the ultimate truth why
can't it be explicate it because of oneness because everything
is one that means knowing and being are necessarily entangled
because the explicitly implicit and they're entangled the truth cannot
be explicate for the same reason that a hand cannot
grasp itself because it is itself explication is a subset
of truth for explication to occur truth needs to be
there first is not limited to explication but explication is
limited to truth because for a thing to be it
has to be true for explication to be it has
to be true it has to exist for my words
to be able to describe reality first they have to
be real then they could or could not faithfully represent
reality both are possible words can lie or they can
be more honest but either way they have to exist
see this means words are second-order they're not first-order true
this first order which is why you can't explicate all
of truth because truth is infinite and your words your
thoughts pictures symbols whatever you want to use to do
your explication all of that is finite explication articulation explanation
communication proof these are always indirect it's a type of
translation and something is always lost in translation that's what
I want you to to understand here it's a handicap
to go through life expecting all of it to be
explicate 'add this is one of the handicaps of science
that science is gonna have to overcome to transcend in
order to really deeply start to explore reality this is
going to be a synthesis of science there's gonna be
a coming together in the future of science and mysticism
because the two were never really at odds science does
some great stuff with this explication work and mysticism does
some great stuff with it with its penetrating into the
implicit aspects of reality and both our two sides of
the coin that really need to work together in tandem
when they're too separated from each other and the two
sides don't talk to each other because they both hate
each other they both think the other is wrong that's
when you get um a dysfunctional system like we have
right now there's value to both the implicit and the
explicit it's just a matter of getting the balance correct
and not denying one in favor of the other here's
a list of examples of things that cannot be explicate
'add truth the absolute consciousness and God all of those
are the same thing you can't ever explicate those that
is the ultimate nature of reality non duality awakening enlightenment
this cannot be explicate 'add love intuition a gut feeling
a hunch have you ever had a gut feeling that
something is wrong about a situation but you can't quite
put your finger on it if I asked you to
articulate and describe why you think this is a bad
situation you shouldn't enter into this situation you can't say
what it is you just know you shouldn't enter that
situation you shouldn't go to that building you shouldn't enter
this marriage you shouldn't be hanging around this person and
sure enough you know a year later you discovered you
know that building collapsed this person got killed in a
car accident and this marriage would have been terrible for
you or whatever you know but if the scientists ask
you you will well where's your proof where is your
proof that you knew this you ain't gonna get proof
this is something that's deeper than proof can reach other
things that cannot be explicate a sunset and orgasm a
vision a psychedelic trip a mystical experience the paranormal and
extra sensory perception ESP insight the reason behind creation all
of creation there's a reason to it and you might
wonder well what's the reason Leo I can't explicate and
see it's implicit you'll only get it when you get
it there's no point in me trying to tell it
to you you ain't gonna get it can't be put
into words reading people's emotions and intentions that's implicit stuff
your life as a whole is really implicit you can't
explain your life to anybody what it's like to be
you and to live as you this is something that
is unique to you only you know what it's like
to live in your shoes and to experience life in
the way that you experience life only you have that
unique experience and no matter how many biographies you write
or whatever you're never gonna be able to explain to
anybody what it was like to live as you the
only way other people can know what it's like delivers
you is actually to live through your life by being
you literally that's the only way everything else is a
poor translation Zen is another good example of the implicit
Zen koans the way that the Zen masters teach you
know when you first start learning Zen from a Western
perspective especially if you're kind of scientifically minded the way
that I was when I started learning Zen reading about
it this was maybe 10 years ago reading my first
books on Zen and you know one of the biggest
things that baffled me was like why do these Zen
masters speak in riddles why can't they just be straightforward
and tell me what the [ __ ] they're trying
to say why do they ought to beat around the
bush with their stories about birds and frogs and fish
and this and that and monks doing mysterious things just
tell me what the [ __ ] you want to
tell me and I'll I'll know it but of course
they can't because the whole point of Zen is that
they're trying to point you towards the absolute which is
inexplicable by its very nature you can't explicate enlightenment which
is why that masters speak in riddles it would be
helpful for you if you're trying to learn Zen or
you're pursuing spirituality to realize that you know I see
people often on the forum for example on the actualised
forum they will you know post endless questions about God
about enlightenment about Awakening about this about spirituality question after
question after question just like a verbal diarrhea of questions
but at some point the student in this process needs
to understand that your questions can be forever your questions
turn into a distraction because when you're asking a question
that assumes that you could just get an answer and
then you're gonna read that answer you're gonna believe that
answer that's like okay now I got it but you
don't got it if you think you got it you
don't got it when it comes to this work you've
got actually contemplated and go for that intuition the answer
needs to come from inside of you not from my
words which again creates one of the biggest traps of
all of the work with actualize that org the biggest
trap is that you're gonna listen to all the things
I say you're gonna take it all literally and you're
gonna think you're out you're gonna think that you understand
what I said but actually all you have are just
beliefs and ideas just mental masturbation and armchair philosophy and
you haven't actually done any of the work to become
directly conscious of the things that I speak about and
that that's gonna be very problematic for you it's gonna
create suffering for it's gonna screw up your whole life
so watch out be careful of that trap so finally
in conclusion you might wonder well Leo so what how
is any of this practical here are the practical takeaways
of what you should do about the things you learn
in this episode first of all acknowledge that reality is
implicit acknowledge that the implicit is as real as the
explicit secondly stop expecting and demanding everything to be explicate
to you thirdly learn to be silent and to appreciate
the wisdom of silence it's in the silence that you
get your deepest answers it's through the silence that you
reach the implicit not through constant talking and debating in
yabbering and jabbering and opinion izing and all of this
fourthly start to rely more on your intuition this is
a huge huge component of becoming a highly advanced human
being is really working on trusting your intuition well listening
to your intuition feeling it honoring it because one of
the biggest challenges with your intuition following your intuition it's
not that you have to silence yourself enough to even
hear it which is the first problem most people are
so distracted by watching TV and their smartphone and all
this crap that they don't even hear their intuition another
big part of the population doesn't even believe that intuition
is a thing or if they do then to them
intuition is just some sort of you know woowoo airy-fairy
thing that shouldn't be taken seriously because science is what's
real and intuition is just some new-age nonsense so you
gotta overcome that but even after you overcome those two
hurdles there's going to be the biggest hurdle is that
once your intuition starts talking to you and you start
listening to it it's gonna tell you some scary stuff
it's gonna tell you things about how you could change
your life in in ways that you don't want to
change it's gonna be a threat to your ego which
is precisely why you're drowning it out all the time
with video games and other crap because your intuition is
guiding you towards truth towards love towards consciousness towards God
but this is not easy this is difficult work it's
almost like learning to use the force from Star Wars
could you imagine the absurdity of a scientist in the
Star Wars universe flying to Yoda's planet Dagobah in the
Empire Strikes Back flying to his planet in the swamp
and he'll the scientists and a team of scientists you
know with their notepads and their lab coats white lab
coats they go to Yoda's Hut they locate it then
you know they stay they get their tape measures they
start measuring the diameter of Yoda's Hutson and then they
you know they start measuring the diameter of Yoda's ears
and how long they are in the hairs and everything
they treat it like a lab animal and then they
start asking questions like okay so tell us about this
force that you know about this spooky force what is
this force like can you quantify it for us can
you explicate it for tell me how does this force
work this is why what does it do where does
it come from and where's it going where'd it come
from and and what and why and how and this
and this and how do what kind of experience can
we run on it this is not how the force
works at that point he would just force choke that
scientist you see that's not how you approach learning the
force it's a different paradigm it's more heart-centered more intuitive
more holistic the problems that our culture has demonized this
and has called it mu airy-fairy stuff subjective stuff stuff
that your mind is making up stuff that you're imagining
it's demonized it with these sorts of labels and that's
a great shame and so what we're doing in this
episode is we're trying to reverse that that misconception that
culture has spent to you about the nature of the
intuitive and the implicit and the transcendental another takeaway here
for you that's practical is stop trying to explain or
to justify your highest divisions and motivations and intuitions to
others if you have a vision for your life that
you feel in your heart is something you got to
follow something that's important if you feel that it's important
for you to seek the truth or to follow some
life purpose or to go to some career to be
an artist to be a musician to you know be
a teacher or a doctor or whatever if you feel
this if you have a vision for for mankind it's
your job to honor that and not to justify it
or to explain to others because there will be many
may say or your parents will say oh oh you
wanna you want to pursue the truth oh well well
how you gonna pay for your food who's gonna pay
for your rent you know that's how parents often think
about such things it's like all you want to become
a musician how so so like why don't you become
a lawyer instead that'll earn you more money but you
gotta you gotta trust your own vision and a vision
is an intuitive thing it's a very personal thing only
you can know whether your vision is appropriate for you
and whether your vision is gonna be appropriate for the
people around you and for mankind as a whole if
you start to approach visions for your life in some
sort of scientific autistic manner works like all will let
me prove whether this vision is good or not you've
already screwed up visions are like the force you got
to learn to to trust and cultivate your visions to
make your vision stronger and more powerful until you're able
to use those visions and enforce them for the vision
is really something implicit that's coming out and then into
the explicit some more practical things allow your understanding of
things and situations to be intuitive and abstract really get
good at thinking in abstract ways this topic of abstraction
is so important that actually there's a entire separate episode
long episode I'll have about that get good at reading
between the lines remember that example that I gave you
there are many situations in life where you need to
read between the lines in attracting a mate in a
relationship in a marriage with your children with your students
if you're a teacher reading between the lines with your
health if you're feeling something in your body read between
the lines there when you're reading spiritual texts when you're
listening to spiritual teachings when you're in business you can
read between the lines of things read between the lines
of the data that's being presented to you that's what
makes you a great business leader read between the lines
of people's words what they tell you so forth read
between the lines of the things that I tell you
of my work there's a lot in my work that
lies between the lines of what I say that which
goes unspoken also practically speaking understand that others read between
the lines of what you say and do you it's
possible to read you like a book even better than
a book just by washing your face your emotions your
body posture your language all this sort of stuff and
you can get good at that other people can get
good at that too this is a valuable skills in
art form also practically understand that there will be always
gaps in communication and things will always be lost in
translation take that into account especially when you're listening to
deep teachings after you finish watching one of my episodes
you could always ask yourself okay so that's what leo
ashley said but one of the things he didn't say
that are important in this episode what was he communicating
that got lost in translation that can be a fruitful
question to ask in various situations stop demanding proof for
everything there are many things in reality that cannot be
proven that doesn't make them false that's just the nature
of reality and also stop trying to prove everything to
others too there are many aspects of life that you
can't prove to another if they can't understand it they
can't understand it and that's their own problem their own
limitation you know don't stop don't start beating a donkey
over the head because he can't understand that one plus
one equals two just realize that that is the donkey's
nature that's where the donkey is at meet the donkey
where he's at so he can't understand that one plus
one equals two beating him over the head with it
cursing at him and judging him and demonizing him he's
not gonna help him so only gonna piss him off
make him angry and he bites you and lastly what
I want to point out to you here is that
really this episode and the next episode that I have
planned about abstraction I hope to release that after this
one they're gonna sort of dovetail together they're laying the
foundation for not only understanding what understanding is but they're
laying the foundation for what is called vision logic or
post rationality there's the pre rational there's the rational and
then there's the post rational the post rational is not
irrational it includes the ability to be rational about things
but it goes beyond it's also transcendental you can call
it trans rational as well as post rational same thing
vision logic is the ability to have logical thinking but
not to be so limited by that logical thinking that
it's also visionary it's highly highly intuitive that's what you
want to be working towards and so I'll have more
episodes in the future to help you to understand what
vision logic is and maybe how to practice it more
there's a lot that could be said about that but
we're just starting to kind of like lay a foundation
for it so now you're starting to understand vision logic
is that kind of logic which is not purely explicit
but recognizes the implicit the transcendent and learns how learns
the art of sort of tangoing with the transcendent because
you can't grasp a hold of a transcendent in the
same way that you can with the non transcendent stuff
see it's it's a different way of of dealing with
reality of thinking about reality it's it's more like you
might say it's kind of a fuzzy logic not a
strict form of logic but fuzzy logic that's actually a
thing they have a whole subfield of logic which is
called fuzzy logic kind of interesting so so yeah so
there you go the question is now do you understand
what was said here and if you do understand what
is that what is understanding what did you understand from
this episode how did you understand it what is that
thing that you understood understand maybe not contemplate it contemplate
what understanding is try to locate understanding in your direct
experience don't think about understanding so much as observe yourself
in the process of understanding or in the process of
struggling to understand that's also useful so if you didn't
understand anything here and you feel all confused and misunderstood
then look at that observe that and wonder so what
is misunderstanding then because if you can understand what misunderstanding
is that's a form of understanding there you go that's
a roundabout way of understanding understanding all right that's it
I'm done here please click that like button for me
you can support me on patreon if you like this
kind of work go to patreon.com/scishow I'm really grateful for
those it helps to give me a little bit more
peace of mind with this work that I'm doing it
allows me to invest more time and effort into doing
research so that I don't have to be constantly putting
out as much content so that my content can be
better and deeper and it doesn't have to be as
dumbed down as it would be if I didn't have
a you know an independent source of income and I
had to like always be trying to sell you something
or advertise something to you so I'm really grateful for
being able to have that kind of financial independence that
patreon offers so thank you for that and what do
I want to say here as a final thought hmm
yeah ever every one of my episodes requires very careful
reading between the lines so much is left unsaid and
so one of the one of the lessons I hope
you learn from this episode that you apply to all
my other videos that you watch in the future is
that when you watch my future videos you're gonna watch
them more carefully trying to read more between the lines
trying to you know intuitively pick up on what's being
communicated it's not so much about the words that I'm
saying that are important it's what I'm trying to get
across to you it's the essence of what the words
are trying to point to again it's the finger pointing
to the moon don't pay attention to the finger pay
attention to the moon that it's pointing at at the
same time even though I say that I have to
again qualify it here again because there's a trap because
when I tell you to read between the lines there's
also the other danger you could swing the pendulum too
much in the other direction so you can be too
literal with the teachings that's bad or you could swing
too much in the other direction where you start to
read so much between the lines that you start to
project all of your own personal biases and fears and
ego stuff into what I'm teaching and saying so you
might be you know you might be so paranoid like
oh well Leo said this and this does that means
something there like this like you know like for example
I released that those episodes that I release about um
me and my living room there when I uh you
know taping one of my awakenings or something people see
the three symbols behind me in the back the decoration
and they say oh my god it's it's a 666
what does it mean what does it all mean is
this a secret Illuminati thing there's a devil thing what
is Liam trying to teach us I I hid in
a lesson what oh my god it's explained it to
us and it literally means nothing your mind reads it
is 666 until you guys told me at 666 I
didn't even notice it I've had it there for years
didn't even notice it it means absolutely nothing see so
sometimes as they say a cigar is just a cigar
not everything has meaning in fact all the meanings are
projected there by your mind so be very careful because
if you're starting to you know if you have a
paranoid mind you start to read between the lines of
everything your mind is gonna show you exactly what you
expect to see whatever your self biases are whatever your
worldview is your mind will see that in my teachings
if you're a devil you're gonna use my words to
deepen your devilry so be careful that's always been the
problem with spiritual teachings from the very beginning of civilization
there have been spiritual teachings but the people who are
reading these teachings they either read them way too literally
missing the essence of them or they misinterpret them according
to their own paranoid self biased projections and knees and
fears and then they distort the teachings and apply the
teachings to do enormous evil those are you know two
ends of the of the spectrum two traps two extremes
that are traps and then you know striking the right
balance that's that's an art form being able to read
a spiritual text or listen to a spiritual teaching and
to to try to suss out and and grasp exactly
what the teacher was intending for you to get not
necessarily what he said but what he intended you to
get that's the key so when you're reading the Bible
it doesn't matter what the Bible says what matters is
did you get the essence of what was intended as
the purpose of these writings by the Mystics who wrote
them if not then the whole exercise of reading the
Bible is completely useless in fact it's worse than useless
it's a it's gonna deepen your devilry so keep that
in mind and make sure you stay tuned for the
next episode which should be about abstraction if it's not
gonna be the exact next one it might be one
or two you know into the future so maybe wait
a few weeks it's gonna come out it's really gonna
be like a a part two and build on top
of everything we built upon here you
