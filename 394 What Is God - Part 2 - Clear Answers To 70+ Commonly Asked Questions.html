            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/YMLuA2MzV40' target='_blank'>What Is God - Part 2 - Clear Answers To 70+ Commonly Asked Questions</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>God's presence in individuals</b>: Leo Gura addresses the question of whether an individual is a part of God or God themselves. He clarifies that it depends on the interpretation of 'you'. In the conventional sense, 'you' are a part of God. However, the deeper sense of self, which is realized through awakening, meditation, and self-inquiry, is fundamentally God.
</li><li><b>God's disguise and self-concealment</b>: Leo explains that God is constantly tricking individuals into experiencing reality. The whole universe is God, but individuals often do not realize it because it's not directly related to their survival. He points out that seeing a physical object, like a Pepsi bottle, is actually seeing God in disguise.
</li><li><b>Being part of God and realizing God</b>: The presenter emphasizes that individuals are always part of God and can always realize God. However, this realization often comes in stages. At first, a person might feel only partly connected to God, but deeper consciousness work can lead to the realization of being the entire God.
</li><li><b>God's deceptive nature and necessity</b>: Leo explains that God is deceptive to allow the existence of different forms. God's most essential nature - formlessness, turns into various forms, whether a Pepsi bottle, a planet, a man, or a woman. This ability to shapeshift makes God difficult to recognize.
</li><li><b>Why God hides</b>: The presenter addresses why God hides from individuals. He suggests that reality is a never-ending process of forms emerging from formlessness and that this process necessitates God's trickery. He adds that this does not make God evil or bad; rather, it is just the nature of creation.
</li><li><b>Claims about God and their falsifiability</b>: The presenter explains that the claim of God being an invisible being seems unscientific and inherently unfalsifiable to critics. However, he counters that God is the elemental truth and, as such, isn't subject to falsification. Hence, while claims about God aren't strictly falsifiable, they are verifiable through personal exploration and experience. However, he emphasizes that God is beyond empiricism and scientific falsifiability. 
</li><li><b>The burden of proof</b>: Leo suggests that the burden of proof lies on individuals to discover and understand the truth of God, instead of it being something external that needs to be demonstrated or proved scientifically. He highlights that knowing God requires a more profound, introspective form of knowledge and understanding.
</li><li><b>Claiming God different than blind faith or superstition</b>: Leo argues that his teachings are not based on blind faith or superstition, but are experiential and verifiable. Understanding them requires engaging in practices that lead to mystical states and revealing the absolute truth, a self-validating realization. Leo posits that there are no falsehoods, only delusions that stem from lack of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Burden of proof</b>: Leo addresses the criticism regarding burden of proof. He elaborates that the quest for truth should be a personal journey and individuals should be willing to validate it for themselves, not expecting it to be handed to them. He remarks that, while he offers guidance, he is not obligated to convince anyone and can't compel skeptics to perceive the truth if they're not open to it, as they can deny it.
</li><li><b>God works in mysterious ways and God of the gaps argument</b>: Leo refutes the 'God of the gaps' argument and states that reality is a mystery and is inherently infinite. Therefore, science will never fully unravel it. According to him, the missing substance in reality's phenomena filled with mere surfaces is the 'emptiness' or 'nothingness', which unifies all surfaces into a oneness.
</li><li><b>Difference between the atheism and realising God as 'nothing'</b>: When Leo says God is nothing, he means a different kind of existing nothingness which can be realized by consciousness, contrasting the atheistic belief of God being non-existent. Atheists don't recognize that physical reality is an illusion, reality is subjective and relative, and that human beings do not exist  they are God consciousness.
</li><li><b>Atheist's refusal to acknowledge aspects of reality</b>: Atheists refuse to recognize certain aspects of reality, including the subjectivity of experience, the nonexistence of humans as entities separate from universal consciousness, and the sentience, intelligence, and aliveness of reality itself, mistaken as mechanical and computationally deterministic.
</li><li><b>Atheists and the concept of God</b>: Atheists view reality as a mechanical system with simple linear cause-and-effect whereas reality is actually a spontaneous occurrence. They don't recognize that the substance of existence is love, the oneness of the universe, the concept of self-creation, and the illusion of time, space, past, future, matter, energy, cause-and-effect, birth, and death.
</li><li><b>Consciousness</b>: Consciousness is not the byproduct of the brain, but the brain is something that exists within consciousness. Atheists do not recognize this, and they believe that science should be able to explain everything including God which is incorrect. 
</li><li><b>Perception of God</b>: Atheists do not believe that they themselves are God. They also do not consider the fact that reality is infinite, with no boundaries outside of the physical universe. The possibility of experiencing God through states of spiritual awakening are also dismissed by the Atheist as a delusion.
</li><li><b>God as a hallucination or a delusion</b>: God is not a hallucination or a delusion, and it can't be a brain state either. The moment one becomes directly conscious of God, there is no room for doubt. God is a state of being that does not rely on interpretations or perceptions.
</li><li><b>Limits of science</b>: Science has limitations and it cannot explain everything. It holds an inaccurate conceptual belief that reality can be understood through the lens of cause and effect. It is also grounded in the illusion of time and space.
</li><li><b>Use of psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT can help individuals experience God. However, skeptics argue that the God experienced through psychedelics is nothing more than an altered brain state induced by the chemical compounds, undermining the profound spiritual awakening that can occur. Using psychedelics can be seen as an interaction of consciousness with consciousness that can lead to a realization and understanding of God, not as a brain state but as an absolute truth.
</li><li><b>God Being a Hallucination or Computer Simulation</b>: Leo affirms that reality and our experiences are essentially hallucinations; speculating about something beyond God, or God as part of a computer simulation, betrays a lack of understanding about the absoluteness of God. God encompasses everything including the imagined and perceived phenomena like computer simulations or hallucinations.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding the Concept of Infinity</b>: Leo explains that the notion of God is equivalent to absolute infinity or totality, going beyond what the limited human mind can conceive. When God is referred to, what is being discussed is everything; it cannot be generated by something else or exist as part of something else.
</li><li><b>God's Self-Limitation and Interaction with Itself</b>: According to Leo, God interacts only with itself because there is nothing else to interact with; therefore, God imposes limitations on itself, taking various forms to experience different aspects of existence including the inability to perform certain tasks.
</li><li><b>Understanding of God as Form and Formless</b>: In discussing questions about God's ability to create a rock it cannot lift, Leo emphasizes that the formless Godhead has no physical capabilities; lifting, and similar actions, only exist within the realm of form where God incarnates itself into specific forms and limits itself to experience different aspects of existence.  
</li><li><b>The Concept of Matrix within Matrix</b>: Explaining the infinite nature of God, Leo suggests an analogy of a matrix within a matrix to infinity. This portrays God not just as an experience outside the matrix but the realization of a meta-truth that encompasses infinite matrices. 
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as a Path to Truth</b>: Leo suggests that the experience of taking psychedelics isn't just seeing hallucinations but it reveals that all of reality is a hallucination. It can help individuals arrive at the absolute truth, in situations where it seems impossible. 
</li><li><b>Using Numbers to Explain Infinity</b>: Leo uses the example of numbers and infinity to clarify the concept of God, essentially likening God to the absolute infinite set of set theory. It includes all elements and potentialities, negating the possibility of anything existing outside of it.
</li><li><b>Nature of God and limitations</b>: God is unlimited but can limit itself into various forms, each with its own limitations. Humans, for example, have physical and mental strengths that an ant does not. 
</li><li><b>Can God destroy itself</b>: Leo explains that God, in its formless state, cannot be destroyed. However, incarnated versions of God, such as humans, can cause their own destruction. The destruction concept only applies within the realm of form. 
</li><li><b>Confirmation bias and experiences of God</b>: Leo discusses potential confirmation bias in his experiences of God. He states that the truths from his experiences often come as shocking surprises, contrary to what he had read or believed prior. Also, he cross-references his insights with various spiritual texts and traditions to ensure accuracy and avoid self-deception.
</li><li><b>Religious affinities</b>: Leo denies being a closeted Christian or Buddhist and says he does not subscribe to any particular religious teaching or tradition. He has no religious beliefs until he has profound awakening experiences.
</li><li><b>Certainty about God</b>: Leo emphasizes that absolute truth, including the understanding of God, is either known or not known. If it is known, there should not be any room for uncertainty or false humility. 
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding God</b>: Leo acknowledges that it is possible to misunderstand God or have false experiences of God. However, with awakening, individuals can become conscious of the truth. Even so, the potential for self-deception demands continuous study, contemplation, and cross-referencing.
</li><li><b>Limits of scientific knowledge</b>: Leo contrasts his certainties with science's commendable but inadequate 'we don't know' stance. He states that a definitive claim of not knowing also implies knowledge (that we cant know), which is untrue because breakthrough insight might be possible.
</li><li><b>Existence of evil and suffering</b>: According to Leo, evil does not exist. It is merely a projection of the ego that labels threats to survival as 'evil'. Suffering is a mechanism that helps us avoid dangerous situations. Without suffering, life as we know it would not exist.
</li><li><b>God's formless, infinite nature and self-incarnation</b>: God's formless and infinite nature is not engaging or interesting, necessitating its self-incarnation into the world. However, such incarnation limits God and obligates it to play the game of survival, causing pain and suffering.
</li><li><b>God's perspective of evil</b>: From God's point of view, there is no evil, and nothing terrible is happening in the world. The world is fine and beautiful from God's perspective, and it is considered perfect. Human misunderstanding of this arises from the perspective of the ego.
</li><li><b>Analogy of movie viewing</b>: From a higher vantage point, as an audience member watching a horror movie, there is no problem with the violence and horror because it is only fiction. The issue occurs when the audience starts believing the events as real and get emotionally involved. This is analogous to confusing human suffering, pain, and the idea of death for reality due to egoistic and selfish thinking.
</li><li><b>Rollercoaster and Skydiving analogy</b>: The situation of humans is similar to experiencing a rollercoaster ride or skydiving. Initially, one may enter these experiences out of desire for thrill and enjoyment, but on experiencing the discomfort and fear, they might regret it. The realization comes later that one intentionally puts themselves in these situations, and despite the fear and discomfort, the thrill and experience can be exhilarating as well.
</li><li><b>Judgment vs Unconditional Love</b>: God's love is unconditional and does not apply judgment; therefore, God does not judge murderers, rapists, etc. The human judgment of good and bad comes from the survival instinct and the creation and defense of identity. Humans create identities of morality and often view themselves as defenders of innocent people against immoral acts.
</li><li><b>God's love for everything that exists</b>: God's love is infinite, and it loves everything, including what humans hate and consider evil or wrong. This is too radical for humans to comprehend as they are not ready to embody this unconditional love since they have too much at stake, such as their lives and identities. Because God loves everything, everything that exists does so as a manifestation of God's love.
</li><li><b>The concept of God and unconditional love</b>: God embodies true unconditional love and fully realizing and embodying this love requires individuals to become conscious of their divine nature. This consciousness coincides with becoming fully awakened. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the concepts of evil and hate</b>: Evil only exists from the ego mind's perspective and cannot be seen by God. God can experience evil and hate by incarnating itself into limited forms like humans. While God experiences evil and hate, these notions are only visible from a limited human perspective. 
</li><li><b>The existence of the "Devil"</b>: The "Devil" refers to survival mechanisms, the ego, and separation, illusion, and falsehood. God created the "Devil" and it can disguise itself as "Devilish" forms to experience what it's like to be a "Devil". 
</li><li><b>The confusion, dilution, and inaccuracies in mainstream religion</b>: Religions were mechanisms for understanding the concept of God and were created by individuals in an era of limited scientific understanding, leading to metaphorical descriptions and stories to reach a wider audience. These accounts might have been filtered through the interpretations and cognitive levels of non-enlightened individuals. 
</li><li><b>Evil and God</b>: Evil facets of life such as murder and rape are creations of God. From the ego perspective, these creations look evil, but from God's point of view, they are part of God's creation experience.
</li><li><b>Dissemination of religious teachings</b>: The teachings of enlightened beings like Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad might have been interpreted, transmitted, and eventually recorded by individuals less enlightened, leading to the dilution of the original teachings.
</li><li><b>God creating the "Devil"</b>: As per the principles of oneness, if the "Devil" exists, it is a part of creation. "Devilish" forms are incarnations of God meant to experience what it is to be a "Devil". 
</li><li><b>Corruption of religious teachings</b>: Over time, religious and spiritual teachings have been corrupted and used as tools for control and justification of rule by various nations and rulers, leading to mass delusion and confusion. 
</li><li><b>Religion's development over time</b>: Religions have developed and morphed over time due to a variety of factors, including changes in humans' cognitive development, societies' moral structures, and technological advances such as the creation of the printing press. 
</li><li><b>The challenge of spreading the realization of God</b>: The realization of God is a personal and subjective experience, making it challenging to spread through conventional means like books, videos, or other forms of mass media, leading to potential means for ego co-option.
</li><li><b>Understanding Religious Disagreements</b>: The major religions of the world show surprising agreement considering their diverse origins. Their differences can be attributed to cultural variations, time periods, language use, and incomplete awakening experiences. Self-experience and direct mystical experience can help discern the shared truths in these religions. Disagreements are often superficial, resulting from misunderstandings and a lack of effort to integrate religions. An integral and holistic approach to studying spirituality can reveal the commonalities among different faith traditions.
</li><li><b>Role of Religion in War and Evil</b>: While religion has been used to justify war and evil, this does not delegitimize the experience of God. Humans inherently have selfish and tribal tendencies, which have been exploited for evil purposes through religion, technology, and capitalism. The spread of belief in God across cultures and eras suggests a kernel of truth underlying religion beyond mass delusion or superstition.
</li><li><b>Language Choices in Discussing God</b>: The word "God" is used due to its immediate association with the divine. Despite misunderstanding and confusion, it encapsulates the experience of encountering something divine. The human mind uses symbols, including language, to understand realities. Different wording or labels can introduce confusion or misinterpretation. Alternate words such as "reality" could fail to illustrate the extraordinary nature of a person's experience with God.
</li><li><b>Variations in Religious Visions</b>: Different people and religions have varying experiences or visions of God due to cultural symbols and beliefs. The mind's understanding is shaped symbolically, and interpretations are influenced by inherent belief systems. For example, a Christian's experience might appear as the vision of Christ, while someone scientific might interpret the experience mathematically. This supports the notion that the understanding of God is filtered through personal and cultural lenses.
</li><li><b>Limited Awakening Experiences and Minor Mystical Visions</b>: Most people do not experience a full awakening but have minor mystical visions. Consequently, their interpretations of God lean towards their cultural symbols and learning. Few people attain the "pure non-dual god consciousness" that one might achieve through intensive and lengthy meditation. However, using substances like 5-MeO-DMT can allow individuals to experience pure, undiluted consciousness, free from visual distortions or hallucinations.
</li><li><b>Study of all spiritual traditions</b>: Leo Gura rebuts the claim that he is stealing and rebranding ideas from Eastern religions like Advaita Vedanta, Zen, Yoga, and Buddhism. He states that he studies all spiritual traditions, emphasizing that no culture or religion has a monopoly on God or spirituality. He explains that he integrates the best ideas from various traditions into his teachings.
</li><li><b>Difference between Buddhism and Hinduism</b>: Leo clarifies a common misconception and reveals that Buddhism does indeed have a concept of God, although it is not traditionally referred to as such. Buddhism's God is referred to as Mu, a no-self state, Buddha mind, the Dharmakaya, or Nirvana. Leo suggests that any perceived difference between the Buddhist 'no-self' enlightenment and the Hindu 'self' enlightenment is simply a matter of different stages of realization.
</li><li><b>Importance of cross-referencing sources</b>: Leo asserts the crucial need for validating experiences by cross-referencing with high-quality sources. He emphasizes this due to the potential for misinterpretation of experiences and the problematic tendency towards the 'Zen devil', one who pursues spiritual practice without a theoretical foundation.
</li><li><b>Potential for reincarnation</b>: In response to a proposed concept of committing suicide to become God, Leo expounds on the constant cycle of reincarnation. He affirms that death will lead to becoming God but emphasizes the precious opportunity of the current incarnation and the importance of making the most out of it.
</li><li><b>Goal of early Enlightenment</b>: Leo communicates the preciousness of early enlightenment. The early realization allows for a life lived with the consciousness of God in order to experience the richness of life. He suggests that late reformation leads to a realization of wasted life potential.
</li><li><b>Concept of conscious, enlightened living</b>: Leo introduces the concept of conscious, enlightened living. He suggests that understanding oneself as God and awakening to one's own mind and illusions can lead to fruitful and fulfilling existence. Leo emphasizes that the goal of life is to play the games of the universe, where God experiences various incarnations of itself and, through awakening, realizes its fullness.
</li><li><b>God's All-Knowing Nature</b>: God, being all-powerful, can set up a situation where it forgets itself and then awaken to itself. The human mind, filled with various concepts, delusions and false ideas, can awaken to the formless Godhead and understand how it manifests in different forms.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Talking about God</b>: The discussion of God aims to raise the awareness of the possibility of realizing God for oneself. It has the potential to transform lives, freeing individuals from suffering and delusion, and opening up possibilities of genuine joy, health, and well-being.
</li><li><b>Science and God</b>: Modern science, being conceptual and symbolic, may not understand God, who is beyond symbols and equations. However, as science evolves, it will open up to mysticism and non-symbolic methodologies, eventually recognizing God. This new science will likely incorporate mysticism and recognize concepts like absolute infinity, or nothingness.
</li><li><b>Incorporation of First-Person Experiences and Psychedelics in Science</b>: In the future, first-person experiences and psychedelics could become legitimate scientific tools. This development will bridge the gap between academic materialistic science and the science of God (mysticism), which has been pursued for over 5000 years through meditation, contemplation, and yoga.
</li><li><b>Merging of Modern Science and Mysticism</b>: The merging of modern science and mysticism will lead to integration and powerful insights. Scientists having mystical experiences combined with scientific understanding can lead to significant breakthroughs in the future. However, science will become similar to mysticism to a certain degree.
</li><li><b>Science and Spirituality Integration</b>: Leo Gura predicts that the future will see a convergence of science and spirituality. However, for this to happen, science must change its materialistic dogmas and recognize its limits. The current approach to science only works within the mind, language, and concepts, but Leo argues there are aspects of reality that are beyond the mind that science will have to accept and acknowledge. He sees his personal contribution to this as being instrumental in helping to integrate science and spirituality, aiming to lay the foundation for the reform of science's epistemic grounding, which he believes will advance both science and spirituality.
</li><li><b>CHanging Epistemology of Science</b>: Leo is currently working on various projects such as books and videos to contribute to the epistemic reform of Western science. He argues that serious changes must be made within the foundation of science, which, in turn, will significantly advance science's understanding of spirituality and allow for their integration. This development, he claims, will signal a new scientific revolution and be a crucial milestone for Western civilization.
</li><li><b>Science and Spirituality Working Together</b>: Leo posits that in the future, science and spirituality will work together closely, creating a blend of scientific and spiritual understanding. He believes he plays a significant role in this process through his teachings and considers his work as laying the groundwork for the reformation of science's epistemology.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Loneliness</b>: In his discussion on loneliness, Leo differentiates between the formless Godhead and God incarnated as humans or animals. For the formless Godhead, loneliness does not exist as there are no feelings or qualities attached. However, God in incarnated form can feel loneliness. To relieve this feeling of loneliness, Leo suggests the concept of other beings and people was created as projections of God's imagination.
</li><li><b>Curiosity about God</b>: According to Leo, some people naturally have a more metaphysical brain type or orientation and hence, are more curious about God and metaphysical questions. He speculates that these people might be more genetically predisposed towards spiritual attuneness and curiosity about God. Leo mentions certain environmental factors like upbringing and exposure to spiritual topics at a young age which could influence one's interest in God. Nevertheless, he warns that curiosity about God can be dangerous as going too deep into this curiosity can potentially result in a complete dissolution of one's prior understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Mechanism of God's Creation</b>: Leo tackles the complex topic of how God creates things. He refutes the materialistic notion of a mechanical creation process underpinned by cause and effect chains. Instead, he suggests that the universe exists spontaneously and lacks any mechanism or mathematical equations behind its existence. This creation process is direct and requires no mechanisms or causes and effects. However, this fact can only be realized through a process equivalent to a spiritual awakening. By fully surrendering to the present experience and becoming conscious of it, one can perceive the universe as one unbroken miracle.
</li><li><b>Evolving Materialistic Science</b>: The central point Leo makes here is the need for science to evolve beyond its materialistic framework. He does not believe that science, as it is defined and understood today, could ever answer all questions or replace mysticism. Instead, science must dismantle its materialistic dogmas, recognize its limits, and start acknowledging aspects of reality beyond the mind. Leo explains that there are truths that exist beyond the mind and, hence, cannot be proven in a traditional materialistic sense. He argues the process of redefining science must include incorporating aspects of mysticism.
</li><li><b>God, Science, and Creation</b>: God is eternal, infinite, and is constantly creating and evolving itself. This present moment is an act of God's self-creation. This act of creation, however, is so direct and intimate that it cannot be explained, pointed to, or known, but one can become conscious of it. Leo argues against the idea that God could have been created by something else like an alien or an AI, emphasizing that God includes all things, including AI and aliens. Leo suggests that creation can be seen as ongoing evolution, not something that occurred solely in the past. He also addresses the apparent contradiction between God's eternal existence and the concept of creation, resolving it by differentiating between the eternal, formless aspect of God and its incuranted forms, which are constantly being created. Ultimately, God created itself because it wants to experience itself in all possible ways.
</li><li><b>God, Evolution, and Life</b>: Examining the relation between God and scientific evolution, Leo conveys that traditional Darwinian evolution occurs within the larger context of God's mind, implying an inherent intelligence and design within the process. This reconciles the seemingly contrasting concepts of design and evolution by explaining they are part of the same process. Addressing the individuals ability to change their unsatisfactory life, Leo encourages personal growth and spiritual awakening as tools to alleviate suffering and elevate one's life experience. Furthermore, he suggests that God, being in love with all aspects of its creation, lives through every possible human scenario without judgment. Spiritual awakening is thus seen as a means to handle life's challenges with grace.
</li><li><b>Attaining Permanent Awareness of God</b>: The section highlights the possibility of becoming constantly aware of God, not only during peak experiences or meditative states, but at all times in everyday life. This permanent state of awareness is referred to as sahaja Samadhi. Leo acknowledges that most initial awakenings likely fade into moments of peak experiences that do not last. These experiences are meant to give glimpses of the absolute truth that is too vast to comprehend in one encounter. As such, unraveling the truth and deconstructing the illusion of life are complex processes that require time and diligence.
</li><li><b>God's realization and survival mechanisms</b>: Realizing God can be both difficult and easy due to survival mechanisms driving individual behaviors. The transformation from a survival-driven life to God consciousness involves rewiring one's neurons and changing behaviors and habits. Radical openness, concentration, and metaphysical curiosity accelerate the journey, but the process can also be challenging due to the seductive power of illusion and entrenched habits related to survival.
</li><li><b>Realizing God while managing life commitments</b>: One can realize God while managing family or career commitments by allocating dedicated time for individual pursuits. Being fully concentrated and committed to realizing God can yield results within a few years. There are examples of enlightened individuals who realized God while managing family and professional life.
</li><li><b>Visualization techniques for realizing God</b>: Techniques from Tantra yoga and Tibetan Buddhism involve intense visualization of a deity with the goal of merging oneself with it, leading to a non-dual, unitive mystical experience. However, it's essential not to get attached to the deity's form to fully realize God, a state that transcends any form or image. 
</li><li><b>God realization irrespective of age and cognitive development</b>: God can be pursued and realized at any age, including teenage years and early twenties. While the pursuit of God realization is beneficial, individuals in these stages should also focus on building practical skills for survival, education, understanding social dynamics, and financial independence. Spiritual development should not neglect practical life aspects. 
</li><li><b>Realizing God at different cognitive development stages</b>: God can be experienced at any cognitive development stage, but how God is understood and interpreted will largely rely on the individual's cognitive level. Advanced conceptualizations of God usually occur at higher levels of development, such as tier two or beyond. However, even at pre-rational and rational levels, God realization is possible. The individual must approach God from a direct experience standpoint, rather than through intellectual understanding or cultural conditioning.
</li><li><b>Realization of God at different stages of the spiral</b>: Regardless of the point in the cognitive development spiral, you can experience God, but the nature of the experience will be shaped by one's cognitive stage and development. An individual at a lower cognitive stage may experience God in a partial, limited way as per their religious or scientific understanding.
</li><li><b>God's need to self-realize</b>: God, in its essence, doesn't need to self-realize. It exists and experiences itself through various possibilities, living through both enlightened and unenlightened lives. However, when you awaken within your current life, you can fully understand and realize your God nature in ways that couldn't be experienced if you were a non-conscious form like a dog or worm.
</li><li><b>God as personal and impersonal</b>: The God concept is both personal and impersonal. From an atheist's point of view, the universe is impersonal with no human qualities. However, since we are the universe experiencing itself, the Godhead also has the personal qualities that we exhibit. Integrating these two perspectives can provide a comprehensive understanding of God.
</li><li><b>God's manipulation of lives and plan for the universe</b>: While the Godhead itself is just passive and observing, it's the manifest form of God that steers and manipulates your life. As for a plan or agenda, the universe's purpose is to simply be and experience itself, but from a human perspective, it seems to have an evolutionary trajectory toward greater complexity and self-awareness.
</li><li><b>Comparison between pantheism and panentheism</b>: Both pantheism which states that everything is God and pantheism which asserts that everything is inside God hold true. All reality is God and exists within the formless Godhead. This apparent paradox exists because form and formlessness are intertwined aspects of God.
</li><li><b>Origins of mankind's awareness of God</b>: The view is that mankind has had knowledge of God since the dawn of human existence, possibly even extending back to our anthropoid ancestors. This could have arisen from numerous factors including meditative states from sitting around in early human history, natural spiritual gifts, use of psychedelics, and experiences related to shamanism.
</li><li><b>Reasons God takes on specific human forms</b>: God embodies every possible form simultaneously, including your particular human form. Your existence is one manifestation of God's ongoing exploration of every potential form.
</li><li><b>God's creation of humans and animals</b>: God, being the totality of everything possible, forms every possible entity including humans, animals, aliens, AIs, and beyond. More complex life forms like humans and animals provide God with a richer experience, allowing it to experience a variety of emotions and complexities that simpler forms like atoms and rocks cannot.
</li><li><b>Using the realization of God</b>: From a human perspective, the realization of God can be used to elevate the consciousness of mankind, improve every aspect of life, and possibly lead to special or paranormal abilities. However, Leo warns against using this realization for materialistic gains.
</li><li><b>Miracles and their possibility</b>: Leo suggests that miracles, understood as paranormal happenings, can occur, citing examples like paranormal healing and synchronicities. Conversely, Leo mentions that each moment and all of existence are miracles in themselves.
</li><li><b>Assessment of Biblical content</b>: Leo suggests that the Bible, while containing valuable wisdom and teachings, also contains outdated, incorrect, and biased information. The limitations of the Bible stem from its human authorship and the fact that it was not directly authored by divine beings like Jesus.
</li><li><b>Duty towards God</b>: According to Leo, humans have no duty towards God because they themselves are God. There are no requirements for worship or prayer, as this is seen as a form of self-worship. Leo suggests that the ultimate-goal should be awakening and raising awareness.
</li><li><b>God's desire from humans</b>: Leo asserts that God requires nothing from humans and is satisfied with however they choose to be. On another level, Leo suggests that humans should strive to be as conscious as possible, aiding in the upliftment of mankind's awareness and appreciating life's magnificence.
</li><li><b>Role of religion</b>: Leo recommends abandoning one's religion due to its potential to hinder the realization of God. However, Leo stresses that each individual is the source and realization of what religions point to, and that realization of God is possible even without adhering to religious dogmas. 
</li><li><b>Comparison of Leo's teachings to religious texts</b>: Leo recognizes that several religious texts, such as the Quran and the Bible, contain similar wisdom as his teachings. However, he suggests that his teachings provide a more holistic perspective as they integrate modern science and psychology. He emphasises the importance of critical thinking, cross-referencing, and validation of information in seeking spiritual truths. 
</li><li><b>Power of concentration</b>: Leo identifies concentration as a key element for realizing God and for personal development. He suggests that total focus, radical open-mindedness, and genuine metaphysical curiosity are crucial for spiritual awakening. 
</li><li><b>Awakening journey</b>: Leo states that the journey of spiritual awakening requires multiple experiences, time for integration, and efforts. He mentions that psychedelics or practices like yoga and self-inquiry can aid in accelerating the journey. Acknowledging uncertainty, and not seeking a preview of awakening, are recommended for a successful spiritual journey. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's future work</b>: Leo mentions his ongoing work on books, videos, and projects that aim to contribute to revolutionary scientific development. He promises to guide and support individuals in their personal development, and encourages viewers to check out his website for additional resources and guidance.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Teachings and Traditional Religions</b>: Leo Gura explains that although his teachings might seem similar to traditional religions like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Vedanta, his approach comes from a more modern, integral, and holistic perspective. He points out limitations of traditional religious teachings such as dogma, lack of empirical basis, and limited consideration for modern scientific understanding. He emphasizes the need for modern spiritual teachings to adapt to current realities and continuously evolve to match the universe's accelerating evolution. Leo aims to outline the cutting edge of spirituality integrating insights from psychology, quantum mechanics, sociology, and modern philosophy not found in traditional religious texts.
</li><li><b>Key Requirements for Realizing God</b>: Leo proposes three critical requirements for realizing God: developing laser-focused concentration abilities, having radical open-mindedness, and possessing genuine metaphysical curiosity. He stresses the importance of seeking to understand existence, the reason for existence, and God, not as mere beliefs or theories, but real experiences. 
</li><li><b>Reliability of Leo Gura's Teachings</b>: Leo insists on not blindly trusting his teachings but validating them through cross-referencing, reading different resources, and personal experimentation with practices like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, and potentially psychedelics. Trusting too blindly or being too cynical can both be impediments to spiritual growth and self-realization. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Singular Awakening Experiences</b>: Leo articulates the idea that understanding God requires more than one awakening experience. He believes multiple experiences coupled with time for integrating these insights and deepening understanding are essential. He claims these experiences could be facilitated through practices like yoga and self-inquiry, or the use of psychedelics, emphasizing the importance of personal choice in this matter. 
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Resource for Spiritual Awakening</b>: Leo concludes by inviting viewers to utilize actualized.org, a platform he compiled featuring resources like blog posts, book lists, life purpose courses, and forums. He maintains that following his practical teachings and potent spiritual techniques can lead to significant spiritual awakenings, even within short periods like six to twelve months. Leo promises to continue guiding followers, providing new techniques, and helping avoid spiritual traps.
