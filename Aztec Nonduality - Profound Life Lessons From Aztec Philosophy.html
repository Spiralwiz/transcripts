[Music] in this episode I'm excited to be sharing with
you some profound lessons about life from Aztec non-duality now
you might wonder Leo Astec non-duality is such an obscure
impractical topic what's the point of talking about this well
actually you're going to find that it's very practical and
it's also gonna interconnect things in your own mind because
many people don't know that the Aztec people were non
duelists and you'll be amazed to see all the interconnections
between Aztec non-duality and Buddhism Hinduism Christianity Islam and everything
that we've been talking about so this here I'm gonna
be reading to you from a specific article a lengthy
article from the internet encyclopedia of philosophy the articles entitled
Astec philosophy written by James maffei of the University of
Maryland and what's so remarkable about this article as I
was reading it is that it struck me as the
most elegant and most complete description of God and spirituality
that I've ever read anywhere coming from this sort of
obscure Aztec source and it blew my mind and so
I want to share it with you this is a
very big picture overarching view of what the spiritual path
is all about and this is also another way that
we can talk about God so we'll be describing explaining
what God is from the Aztec perspective and of course
it's going to be exactly what I've been telling you
all along throughout all of my other videos so without
further ado let's get right into it now I'm gonna
be reading here and quoting extensively from this article of
course I've cherry picked sections I'm not gonna be reading
the whole thing if you want you can go online
and find this article and read it all the way
through yourself which I of course I highly recommend you
do but I'll be reading it here for you the
most juicy parts there will be some technical language and
terminology that I will sometimes come across as I'm reading
and I'll point that out to you and we'll discuss
it I'll be giving a lot of commentary on and
stuff that I'm reading based on my own direct experiences
of non-duality and God and for now the one term
that I want to point out to you so you
understand is the word Nahua now who uh I'll be
saying this word a lot as I'm reading and what
that word refers to here is it refers to the
Aztec people so technically in the academic literature they're referred
to as the nahua their language is referred to as
nahual or not wali and this is is a is
a broad language group that encompasses the Aztecs and various
other Mesoamerican peoples that lived in that area across many
different eras so here is their spirituality here's what it
looks like quote at the heart of Nahua philosophy stands
the thesis that there exists a single dynamic vivifying eternally
self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power energy or force what the
Nahua is called Toyota or God so this is another
technical term Toyota will be saying this one a lot
so reverent Toyota Liz just the Aztec term for God
moving on quote Elizabeth boon writes the real meaning of
Toyota Liz spirit or a concentration of power as a
sacred and impersonal force Toyota continually generates and regenerates as
well as permeates encompasses and shapes the cosmos as part
of its endless process of self generation and regeneration that
which humans commonly understand as nature for example the heavens
the earth reign humans trees rocks animals etc is generated
by Toyota from Toyota as one aspect fasted or a
moment of its endless process of self generation and regeneration
yet Toyota is more than the unified totality of things
Toyota is identical with everything and everything is identical with
Toyota since identical with Toyota the cosmos and its contents
ultimately transcends such dichotomies as personal versus impersonal animate versus
inanimate etc as single all-encompassing life force of the universe
Toyota vivifies the cosmos and its contents end quote so
this is sounding a lot like Buddhism a lot like
Taoism a lot like the yin and yang aspects of
spirituality and that's exactly right so a theme that's going
to be developing here within this Astec philosophy of God
is that God is a shapeshifter and takes on many
forms and that what the universe is and God is
just synonymous with the universe is sort of a meta
organism that is alive and sentient and what it's doing
is it's moving through an endless cycle of generation and
regeneration taking on an infinity of different kinds of forms
from the earth to the rain to humans trees and
rocks and animals and so forth and that this is
what unifies everything so everything is one totality and this
totality is called Toyota but also total separates itself and
incarnate sit self into all the various forms that are
a part of this infinite totality so moving on quote
Toyota is both metaphysically immanent and transcendent it is imminent
in that it penetrates deeply into every detail of the
universe and exists within the myriad of creative things it
is transcendent in that it is not exhausted by any
single existing thing end quote so you see this issue
comes up for example in Christian theology very commonly is
is God imminent or transcendent and what that question means
is is God in the universe or is God outside
and beyond the universe and of course the answer is
both simultaneously that's the paradox of God it's a superposition
of both imminence and transcendence so everything that is happening
right now as you're watching me everything in your room
that's going on wherever you are that's the imminent that's
the real tangible world that you know and then the
transcendent is the formless beyond that formless consciousness so both
are actually identical they're happening simultaneously you are both inside
of God but you were also the overarching unification of
the entire universe which is also God see the universe
can be thought of as one large thing the entire
universe but simultaneously the universe contains all the little tiny
stuff in it ants and viruses atoms molecules and all
of that and the Aztecs understood this going on quote
now who a metaphysics is processive process movement becoming and
transmutation are essential attributes of Toyota Toyota is properly understood
as an ever flowing and ever-changing energy in motion not
as a discrete static entity toi yodel that word refers
to the eternal universal process of Toyota lysing end quote
I love that so what we're saying here is that
rather than thinking of the universe is a object like
a chair think of it as a process like a
waterfall it's just a never-ending stream of stuff pouring forth
and it's ever flowing and ever changing energy in motion
and so you can think of God traditionally as a
noun as an object as a thing or you can
think of God now as to utilizing or Godding what
is God God is the process of God ding what
is the process of God in or to utilizing its
the ever it's the never ending process of things coming
into being and out of being that is what the
universe is moving on quote although essentially process of and
devoid of any permanent order the ceaseless becoming of the
cosmos is nevertheless characterized by an overarching balance rhythm and
regularity one provided by and constituted by Toyota Toyota 'ls
and hence the cosmoses ceaseless becoming is characterized about what
I call dialectical polar monism dialectical polar monism holds that
one the cosmos and his contents are substantively and formally
identical with total and to that Toyota presents itself primarily
as the ceaseless cyclical oscillation of polar yet complimentary opposites
end quote so that is precisely what the yin-yang symbol
from Taoism is supposed to represent so the universe is
both non dual and dual at the same time what
we mean when we say it's non dual is that
it's all unified in its one entity to yodel and
you can become conscious of that that is the monism
term that is being used here and then that term
polar dialectical polar dialectical polar what that means is that
like beginning yang there's the black and the white the
the light and the darkness the good and the evil
and that they're always at interplay with each other and
that's not a contradiction to monism or to non duality
that's actually what non duality is is it includes within
it all the duality it's the unification of all dualities
and so the mistake that many scientifically finded people rashly
minded people atheistic Lee minded materialistic invited people make is
that we get caught up in the duality of everyday
life but we don't see the overarching connection of everything
and of course the materialist will respond by saying well
but Leo I understand that the universe is one thing
reality is one thing and yet even though you understand
that perhaps intellectually you're not really grasping the significance of
what it means to understand that everything is really one
unit and that you aren't intimately connected to the entire
universe you're missing the monism part and you're looking at
the world dualistic aliy most of the time and that
becomes a problem because you're overlooking the biggest picture possible
and you're also not seeing that this cyclical oscillation of
polar opposites is absolutely necessary and integral to how the
universe is functioning so a lot of people they get
wrapped up in in these various quixotic ideas of how
they want to transform the world or how they want
to change society and they get the silly idea that
oh well we can just stop all the bad stuff
and just maximize all the good stuff and then it'll
be heaven on earth without realizing that you can't do
that because the very nature of the whole universe is
that it's an interplay between various oscillating and polar opposite
forces that are complementary to each other and that this
is fundamental to the whole thing and so you're not
gonna change that dynamic moving on quote Toyota's process presents
itself in multiple aspects preeminent among which is duality this
duality takes the form of the endless opposition of contrary
yet mutually interdependent and mutually complementary polarities which divide alternatively
dominate and explain the diversity movement and momentary arrangement of
the universe these include being and not-being order and disorder
life and death light and darkness masculine and feminine dry
and wet hot and cold active and passive life and
death for example are mutually arising interdependent and complementary aspects
of one in the same process life contains the seed
of death death the Fertile energizing seed of life at
court so you see this exactly what I was just
describing and you know some people get it in their
mind that death is a bad thing and that if
all that humanity does is just find some way to
keep ourselves immortal through genetic engineering or some technological singularity
uploading your brain to a computer or something like that
that's somehow you're gonna hear can escape this polarity between
life and death without realizing that you can't have life
without death and you can't have light without dark and
you can't have masking without feminine and so a lot
of the problems we have collectively in societies is work
we're not striking that right balance and we're not understanding
that the universe has to move dualistic Lee dialectic Lee
through these different polar opposites and navigate through this sort
of dynamic process maintaining this equilibrium sort of like balancing
on a unicycle and that you can't ever stand still
on a unicycle you always have to be moving but
at the same time balancing and this is the dynamic
balance of life which is so critical that so many
people miss whether it's with your relationships or with your
business or with your health or with how much television
you watch or how much time you spend on video
games or the internet it's not that these things are
bad it's not that porn is bad it's not that
sex is bad it's a question of are you able
to strike the balance and we'll be returning to this
topic of balance over and over again because it really
is one of the central themes of spirituality and living
the good life which is why we're talking about any
of this in the first place moving on quote according
to Nahua duality order and disorder life and death etc
alternate endlessly without resolution it neither conceives death as inherently
evil and life is inherently good nor advocates the conquest
of death or the search for eternal life the created
cosmos consists of the unending cyclical tug of war or
dialectical oscillation of these polarities all of which are the
manifold manifestations of Toyoda because of this the created cosmos
is characterized as unstable transitory and devoid of any lasting
being order or structure yet I O'Toole is nevertheless characterized
by enduring pattern or regularity how can this be so
Toyota is the dynamic sacred energy shaping as well as
constituting these endless oscillations it is the imminent balance of
the end dialectical alternation of the created universes interdependent polarities
and quote one of the mistakes that materialists and scientists
make is they tend to assume an objective external world
out there somewhere behind the scenes which is totally static
and unchanging and they conceive of the physical laws as
static as unchanging and various kinds of physical constants the
gravitational constant so forth as static and unchanging as absolutes
and instead what we get with this aztec metaphysics is
we get a different picture we get a picture of
the universe as having no static point so there's no
anchor that grounds it which means that literally there's no
reality reality is simply the arising of whatever appearances are
arising right now and those of course are forever changing
and that's exactly what buddhism teaches buddhism teaches a very
central principle of impermanence and it's very important to become
conscious of the impermanence of reality otherwise what happens that
we cling to people our pets our family our business
our money our health our age our ideas our life
our country some technology but all these things are constantly
changing Theo de liz constantly renewing itself building on top
of itself forever which means that it has to let
go and shed off all things and of course many
of the problems we have socially culturally is that a
lot of people they cling to their guns they cling
to their religion they cling to their way of doing
business they cling to their philosophy their claim to their
Bible they cling to their economic ideology whether it's capitalism
or Marxism or whatever people cling to these things and
then they used to let them go which is really
sort of like they're trying to grab on to the
waterfall and to kind of like hold it in place
without realizing that this is delusion insanity because the waterfalls
nature is to always be falling down and always to
be renewing itself so even though you can try to
cling to certain parts of reality and try to hold
on to them eventually every human body dies every species
goes extinct every planet gets destroyed every star is exhausted
and burns and blows itself up every technology becomes obsolete
every language changes in morphs every country and every government
changes and gets destroyed and gets overthrown and goes through
revolutions everybody loses their youth everybody loses their health you
see so you can't you can't maintain yourself that way
and even in your own personal life just your own
body think about how much your own body has changed
over the span of your whole life imagine what would
happen if you were seven years old and you said
you know damn it I just want to stay seven
years old I'm gonna try to maintain my body the
way it is at seven years old you can see
how that leads to a lot of dysfunction right because
you have to be open to it to the ever
flowing nature of Toyota moving unquote because essentially process of
and dynamic Toyota is properly characterized neither by being nor
not being but by becoming being and not being are
simply to dialectically interrelated presentations or facets of Toyota and
as such in applicable to Toyota itself similarly Toyota is
properly understood as neither ordered nor disordered but as unordered
indeed this point is fully general life / death active
/ passive male / female etc are strictly speaking not
predicable of Toyota Toyota captures a tertium quid or a
third kind transcending these dichotomies by being simultaneously neither alive
nor dead yet both alive and dead and simultaneously neither
orderly notice orderly yet both orderly and disorderly etc and
quote this is precisely the paradox of non-duality is that
even though Toyota or God contains these various qualities like
male and female active and passive life and death and
big and small and so forth it also simultaneously transcends
all these dualities and so it can't be pinned down
to being any one particular thing and that's what makes
Toyota so tricky to grasp and to understand for human
beings because as human beings were part of the contents
of reality and so we're used to looking at the
contents or forms of reality and thinking that if something
is real or something exists it must be a particular
way it must be either a male or a female
it must be big or must be small it must
be rational it must be irrational but it can't be
both and it can't be neither and it certainly can't
be both and neither at the same time but yet
that is precisely what the universe is looking at it
from the biggest picture perspective possible and this is what
we mean by saying that God is everything but God
is also simultaneously nothing not those things so even though
God is a man and a woman it is a
tree in a car and a dog in a planet
and a star and a galaxy it's all those things
but simultaneously none of those things are the totality of
God or Toyota moving on quote in the end Toyota
is essentially an unstructured and unordered seamless totality in western
philosophical terminology one perhaps best characterizes the radical ontological indeterminacy
of nahua metaphysics as an extreme nominalist anti-realism and toyota
as a Conti enlike noumenon end quote so here this
passage has a lot of sort of fancy philosophical terms
what it really means here is that reality is not
how materialists and realists conceive of it to be Nahua
metaphysics and non-dual metaphysics of any mystical tradition is fundamentally
anti-realist which denies the existence of a static fixed external
objective reality and Toyota is what caught called the noumenon
so the noumenon is that which is beyond all phenomenon
so phenomenon is all the shapes and colors that you
see we might call that perceptions and the noumenon is
some other invisible aspect or the nothingness the void which
is holding all of that or you could call it
consciousness or awareness pure consciousness is the noumenon of conte
and it is total moving on quote now who a
philosophers also conceived Toyota pantheistic Allah of course a everything
that exists constitutes an all-inclusive and interrelated unity be this
unity is sacred see everything that exists is substantively identical
and hence one with the sacred D the sacred is
total there is only one thing Toyota and all other
forms and aspects of reality and existence are identical with
Toyota and finally e Toyota is not a minded being
or person and quote that's exactly right we're talking about
pantheism or also pan and theism they're really the same
thing yes we have this unity but also you have
to realize that it's not enough to realize that the
universe is one single entity or unity you also have
to realize that it's sacred which is which is difficult
for many atheists wrap their mind around and you have
also have to realize that that that this unity is
not a person in the way that Orthodox religions conceived
of it to be so this is the critical mistake
of classical Orthodox Christianity or other religious traditions even in
Hinduism you know they have a lot of avatars which
take on anthropomorphic human forms and all of this fundamentally
misses the point that Toyota is formless God is formless
but pantheism is precisely correct it is what mysticism is
it is the core truth at the heart of every
single major religion in the world pantheism but because pantheism
is scary too many spa dynamic stage blue Orthodox people
what they do is they deny and this is this
is amazing the mental gymnastics that Orthodox religious people go
through to deny the pantheistic nature of God so if
you are religious and you're not conceiving of God pantheistic
Allah you're you're getting your religion wrong whether you're a
Christian a Hindu a Jew or a Muslim right and
of course it's precisely because what pantheism says that God
is identical with the entire universe and it's precisely because
you are part of the universe that you literally are
both a part of God but also all of God
simultaneously which freaks so many Orthodox religious people out because
they want to separate themselves from God which is why
fundamentally they deny pantheism moving on quote - yodels ceaseless
generating and regenerating of the cosmos is also one of
ceaseless self transformation and cell-free transformation the cosmos is Toyota's
self transformation and self transmutation not is creation x Nilo
the new Whois understood this process to be in two
closely interrelated ways toyota is a sacred artist who endlessly
fashions andrey fashions itself into and as the cosmos the
cosmos is Toyota's quote flower and song as Toyota's flower
and song the cosmos is Toyota's grand ongoing artistic come
metaphorical self presentation or Toyota's ongoing work of performance art
or metaphor in motion and quote so it's a bunch
of words there let me describe what this means so
the universe is Toyota's work of art or as the
Aztecs called it the flower and song so the entire
universe is God's flowering or coming into being it's an
artistic thing you got to see the beauty of the
universe and that's the whole power of spirituality that's the
whole appeal of being spiritual that you get to then
by becoming conscious of total in everything you then get
to see the beauty and genius of this artistic work
of performance art that is the universe and it's an
infinitely beautiful thing which people miss out on even many
religious people miss out on this so you got a
you got to see to really appreciate life at a
deep level you have to see the artistry of life
the artistry of what God is doing here and just
how brilliant and amazing it is and this is precisely
what many materialists and atheists completely miss because they're so
stuck in their head they're so stuck in the left
hemisphere of their brain that they only see the world
as justice is this dumb mechanical system this clockwork of
a random stuff happening with no meaning and no purpose
and it's just sort of like this cold bleak universe
and it's just like very mechanical and scientific and logical
and mathematical without bringing in the heart component they're missing
the heart because they're so stuck in their left hemisphere
of the brain moving on quote secondly the nahua conceived
total self transmutation in shamanic terms the cosmos is teo
Dalls nahual or disguise or mask the word nahual derives
from mahallae signifying a form change in shaman the continual
becoming of the cosmos and its myriad aspects are teo
Dalls shamanic self masking and self disguising end quote this
is absolutely critical to understand notice that the word the
houl means disguise or mask and then who'll people than
a hua people they they call themselves than the hua
which derives from the hawala which is a form changing
shaman so literally they named themselves after shamans which is
of course right because the shamans have the highest wisdom
so it'd be right to name yourself at and it
would be right to name your language that and of
course a shaman is always going into disguises and wearing
masks and this symbolizes the fact that that's what God
is doing so the reason that the shaman is wearing
masks and various disguises and is considered like a shapeshifter
is because Toyota or God is a shapeshifter and that's
such an important metaphor to understand why God is so
difficult to understand because God is shifting its shape all
the time and as a shapeshifter you might think well
but what is God's real form when it's not shape-shifting
when God isn't being a tree or a mountain or
a cloud or a car or a woman or a
man or a dog what is God's true shape and
the mindfuck of it is is that God has no
true shape at all God's true shape is no shape
and when you think about it that's brilliant it's actually
an ingenious design because look if you want it to
really be the best shapeshifter you could be so to
speak you would need to make yourself totally empty because
if you weren't totally empty there would be some part
of you which disrupts your ability to take on some
shape totally right like you couldn't totally become a tree
because there would be some part of you some essential
nature or form that you had which is getting in
the way for example you as a human being if
you want to be an actor the problem with that
is that you have a certain form that you have
and so you can't really be the best actor you
can be in a certain sentence because like you know
a man can't really play an effective woman in a
movie unless he's just doing like a parody and you
know a white man can't really play an effective black
man nor vice versa in a movie right because like
you'd have to get rid of your whiteness to be
able to fully embody blackness and you have to get
rid of your blackness to fully embody whiteness and you
have to get rid of your femaleness and your maleness
and your whether you're a short actor or tall actor
you know that limits what kind of roles you can
play but the whole genius of God is that it's
not limited to that so therefore it literally is completely
empty and then it can take all forms in all
shapes and that explains why God is so difficult for
people to find and to for people to grasp with
the mind is because the thing you're trying to grasp
is the fact that God is the shapeshifter and then
of course right now it's shape-shifting into you and shape-shifting
into me and what's happening right here even though it
looks like it's a man over here sitting talking to
a camera and you over there either a man or
a woman sitting there listening to me making sense of
all this although it seems that that's what's happening actually
this is God's mask this is God's disguised as God's
performance art and you need to be able to be
smart enough to see through that which requires consciousness and
intelligence which few people have and so therefore when they're
told about God they think all God just a belief
just some fantasy but what you don't understand is that
you got to be conscious what's going on here you
know what it's sort of like pointing out God to
an atheist or to materialist is so frustrating because they're
so dense it's almost like we go to a rainforest
and there's like a beautiful chameleon sitting on a branch
or a beautiful owl sitting on a branch and I'm
walking through with you and you're the atheist or the
Mateus and you you've never seen one of these al-zor
chameleons and I point to it and I said look
look at it there's the owl there's the chameleon there's
the butterfly but because your eyes are not accustomed to
looking through the camouflage of the chameleon of the owl
of the of the butterfly their camouflage is so perfect
they completely blend in with the jungle and so you
look at me and you say leo what are you
stupid what are you crazy what are you insane you're
hallucinating there's no owl there there's no chameleons there's no
butterfly it's just the jungle it's just a tree it's
just a branch is just a leaf but of course
you would be able to see the butterfly or the
chameleon or the owl if you spent a lot of
time just observing them in this jungle but because you're
here for the first time you can't even believe it's
outside of your realm of belief and possibility that there
could be this amazing owl sitting right a few feet
away for you and you can't see it it's like
Leo there's no such thing as owls well there's not
for you because you haven't spent enough time observing these
owls because they're so well camouflaged God is the perfect
chameleon it's able to perfectly camouflage itself and so it's
pointless in a sense to ask for evidence of God
the way that materialists do in the same sense that
you can ask for all the evidence in the world
of owl that's camouflaged on a tree branch but unless
you're able to grasp the outline of the owl you
know I mean I'm pointing to what the evidence is
there you're being pointed the evidence all the time the
evidence for God is everywhere all the time you're so
deeply immersed in it that's precisely why you can't see
it you have to be able to to sort of
grasp it or broke it at once you have to
go aha oh that's what this is oh yeah that's
the owl oh yeah that's the chameleon oh yeah that's
the butterfly I see the butterfly see and the mistake
that the materialists make is that he says all leo
but you need to you need to provide proof prove
to me that that's an owl it's like no I
can't prove to you this oh now you got to
be able to see it to see the owl so
I love this metaphor this is for me this is
my favorite metaphor for God is that God is a
shapeshifter this explains why God is so deceptive why God
is so tricky why it's so confusing why your own
mind prevents you from being able to see it because
that's the whole thing we're dealing with here and of
course in Hinduism this notion is known as Maya we're
talking about Maya here so notice all these interconnections between
the Aztecs descriptions of God and also many of the
eastern ones and of course in the West they have
the notion of the devil you might think Oh Leo
but the Christian God the Christian God isn't deceitful in
a sense it is because in the in the Christian
God there is the devil in the Christian conception of
God and the devil of course is a trickster and
a shapeshifter so that is sort of the devilish nature
of God God has this devilish side to him which
you could call Maya or the devil moving on quote
Toyota artistically comes shamanic Lee presents and masks itself to
humans in a variety of ways one the apparent thickness
of existence for example the appearance of static entities such
as humans mountains trees insects etc this is illusory since
one and all are merely facets of total sacred motion
and to the apparent multiplicity of existence for example the
appearance of discrete independently existing entities as individual humans plants
and mountains this is a losery since there is only
one thing Toyota and three the apparent exclusivity independence and
irreconcilable opposition allottee of dualities such as order and disorder
life and death etc this is illusory since they are
interrelated complementary facets of Toyota and quote so what we're
talking about here is the illusory nature of Toyota the
illusory nature of reality the deceptive nature of your own
mind are you noticing these themes coming up over and
over again as you're doing personal development as you're growing
as you're learning about your own emotions as you're learning
about the counterintuitive nature of life as you're learning about
things going full circle I've talked about all these things
in the past go check out all those episodes that
I have about all those topics you need to start
to see that your own mind is the thing that's
getting in the way of you being fully conscious of
everything in the universe and all of your problems fundamentally
stem from this one problem of illusion and delusion and
self-deception and that's what you need to put your attention
and energy towards not that other people are deluding you
with conspiracy theories knots that some religious fundamentalists and fanatics
are trying to recruit you into their cult but that
your own mind is tricking you constantly your own mind
is shaping the way that you see everything because it's
affecting how you interpret all of these perceptions and it's
radically changing what's right before your eyes without you even
being aware of it your mind is creating various kinds
of conceptual contexts which are helping you to make sense
of the world around you and that this is where
the chief delusion is rooted in in that including your
sense of self and your sense of evil and suffering
in the world right it's all rooted in the various
ways in which your mind tricks you and the way
that it tricks you the reason it tricks you rather
is because that's necessary for you to be able to
survive as yourself it has the illusion that you are
that's how Toyota created you God didn't just take some
matter and assemble it together to create a human that's
not how God created you God created you by tricking
itself into believing that it's a human and that it's
not God tada you see and the reason that's possible
is because everything all of this the entire universe is
just the mind of God there is no physical substance
to it so God could imagine anything including being a
human which is precisely where you find yourself right now
moving on quote as an epistemic consequence of Toyotas self
disguising when humans customarily gaze upon the world what they
see is Toyota as a human as a tree or
as a female for example they see total self disguised
rather than Toyota as Toyota as we shall see shortly
below wisdom is what enables humans to discern the sacred
presence of Toyota in its myriad disguises and quote this
is critical for you to understand even though Toyota is
everything including that tree that man that woman and so
forth these are the disguises that Toyota is wearing which
you are fooled by as an ordinary human being and
the point of spiritual practice the point of consciousness is
to be able to penetrate through the veil of the
illusion and to realize what the illusion or the disguise
is really hiding behind the scenes which is Toyota as
Toyota so this is the emptiness the void the formlessness
the Godhead that is total as total proper but Toyota
as disguised is a human a tree a car and
your body and your mind you see so the point
of self inquiry is for you to realize Toyota in
its pure form in its empty form to stop confusing
it with its formed versions because you might wonder like
what Lea what's the point of doing self inquiry if
you say God is everywhere then why should I look
inside of myself to ask myself Who I am or
what I am when I can like look at a
tree and just say that well the tree is God
the car is God that woman is God why do
self inquiry well you're doing self inquiry because you want
to get to the root of of the fact that
you yourself are God and you want to get to
that pure realization of Toyota as total not as a
disguise so you're using the neti neti method that we've
talked about you're using the neti method to eliminate all
the disguises of God in order to get to God
in its most pure form which is just pure empty
consciousness or awareness or nothingness you see and wisdom is
your ability to do that and so the reason that
many scientists and atheists and materialists are incapable of doing
this of course via certainty are incapable of it as
well in most cases is because they lack wisdom and
this is why IQ is so irrelevant to living a
good life it doesn't matter how high your IQ is
because your IQ does not give you the wisdom that
is required to see through the illusion or the self
disguise of Toyota and that is fundamentally what allows you
to be a good human being and to live life
well and to be happy and to avoid delusion and
falsehood and this explains why many very intelligent scientists and
PhDs in Harvard and Stanford and Yale and other places
all around the world who run fancy laboratories and have
fancy experiments and fancy technology and all this they have
billions of dollars of research funding and all that and
they have a bunch of Nobel Prizes but they don't
have enough wisdom to realize that all of the science
and research that they're doing is happening within a dream
that they're doing it within the matrix because for that
what's required is not reason or logic or intelligence because
those are aspects of the dream aspects of the delusion
you need wisdom to be able to break through it
to see through to disguise of Toyota and that's good
news for you if you don't have a high IQ
means you're not screwed next next section quote Toyota possesses
metaphysical epidermal ah djegal moral and aesthetic facets in that
it functions simultaneously as the source object and/or standard of
reality knowledge value rightness and beauty although the priests nobility
and sages embrace this monistic aspect the uneducated masses tended
to embrace the polytheistic aspects of nahua metaphysics state-sanctioned Aztec
religion construe Toyota as the Supreme God named AMA Toyota
i'ma Toyota literally means to God our mother our Father
or the old God as well as a host of
lesser gods stars fire and water AMA Toyota was the
god of duality a male/female unity who resided in AMA
mayo con the place of duality which occupied the highest
levels of the heavens Amata yodel father door mothered her
himself as well as the universe on Matteo we'll provided
the universal cosmic energy from which all things derive their
original as well as their continued existence and sustenance she
he provided and maintained the oscillating rhythm of the universe
and she he gave all things their particular natures end
quote so if you want to think of God you
can think of God as literally this two-sided figure with
one male half and one female half if you really
want to anthropomorphize God properly or just as the yin
and the yang the way the Dow's do quote in
virtue of these attributes she/he was called the one through
whom all live and the one who is the very
being of all things preserving them and sustaining them because
metaphysically imminent Almaty yodel was called quote the one who
is near to everything into whom everything is near almaty
Odle was called the one who is quote invisible like
the knight and intangible like the wind and quote exactly
they're describing the Godhead they're describing pure consciousness and that's
very difficult to point to and that's what all non-dual
teachers are trying to do they're trying to point to
the unta ball how do you point someone who isn't
conscious to what consciousness is that's the whole difficulty of
teaching non duality because consciousness is invisible like the night
and intangible like the wind so you can't prove it
you can't give people evidence of it because evidence is
a form proof is a form whereas consciousness is formless
you see so if you're looking for proofs and evidence
for consciousness you're never gonna grasp consciousness which is exactly
the problem with science because science only admits of the
existence of forms and it doesn't admit of the unformed
because science is a formed activity which is where mrs.
sim comes in which is why you need the field
of missus ISM to be able to teach you other
kinds of techniques which will allow you to grasp the
ungraspable to find the gateless gate the groundless ground to
find the invisible in the intangible that's right here right
now but you're overlooking it because you're stuck in it
like a fish and water quote because they saw everything
earthly as total soft disguise nahua sages claimed everything earthly
is dreamlike new who is sages conceived the dream likeness
or loser eNOS of earthly existence in epistemic anat ontological
terms illusion was not an ontological category as it was
safer Plato Nahua sages employed the concepts of dream likeness
and illusion as epistemic categories in order to make the
Epis logical claim that the natural condition of humans is
to be deceived by tayos disguise and to misunderstand to
yodel not the metaphysical claim that has two handles disguise
all earthly existence is ontologically substandard and not genuinely real
earthly existence provides the occasion for human misperception misjudgment and
misunderstanding the dreamlike character of earthly existence the mask of
unknowing which beguile us as human beings is a function
of our human perspective and toyota's artistic self disguise these
being ultimately one in the same end quote so again
you see every great mystical tradition and sages throughout history
Buddhist ones Hindu ones and others talking about reality as
though a dream as though it were a dream that
it's an illusion it's a mirage it's not real you
could also call it a hallucination that's what psychedelics reveal
to you is that everything is a hallucination including this
very moment right now that's what it means to say
that the universe's giant mind and so the problem with
being a human is that we miss perceive and we
get wrapped up into this illusion and we deny the
dreamlike qualities of reality because we need it to be
real to believe in it you see when you're growing
up you need to you need to feel like your
mother and father are real things you don't want to
feel like they're illusions likewise when you're being religious you
need to feel that God is a real tangible thing
a man or a woman in the clouds someone you
can count on not some empty formless thing not some
shapeshifter not some trickster you know when you're running a
business and you're earning millions of dollars you need to
feel that those millions of dollars are real in order
for you to keep doing that you don't want to
realize that millions of dollars are just an idea in
your mind a concept of fantasy a pure illusion that
money is just a pure human invention see when you're
creating some court of moral legal system and you want
to tell people to stop murdering and raping and going
to war and thieving and all this sort of stuff
you need to believe that you're grounding these rules into
something real and tangible because how do you convince millions
of people to all agree that murder is wrong only
by getting them to believe that it's really wrong it's
objectively truly really wrong now that's not true of course
but that illusion is necessary in order to build up
a civilization if that's what you want to do and
so illusion is at the heart of all survival activities
which is why humans don't want to give it up
which is why we're filled with so much misunderstanding and
why we miss God so easily because we've really traded
God or truth for our illusions because our illusions help
us to live and that's totally understandable but then it
also explains why God is so difficult to understand and
why there's so much confusion and controversy around it it's
really a function of you being human that you miss
Toyota's artistic self disguise because as a human you care
about living not about art or truth moving on here
in quote wen hua sages characterized earthly existence as ephemeral
and evanescent they did so not because earthly existence lacks
complete reality but because as fascist of tales disguise they
are subject to the endless oscillations of dialectical polar monism
illusion is a function of our mistaking the commonly perceived
characteristics of the myriad shapes structures and entities of tayos
disguise as characteristics of toyota itself in some the new
who is AB stemologica conception of illusion does not commit
them to an ontological dualism between two different kinds of
existence illusion and reality and is therefore consistent with their
ontological monism end quote see so materialists or duelists might
object to non duality on the grounds that they say
well Leo you talk about illusion and then you talk
about the ultimate truth and it seems like these are
two separate things you're talking about the ego as if
it's an illusion you're talking about the earthly realm it's
all illusions and all the survival and human stuff that
we do that's all illusions and then you talk about
some ultimate absolute truth the god had the infinity so
isn't that duality and of course the answer is no
because those two things are precisely identical but you need
to become conscious of that you see so first in
your awakening process what you need to do is you
need to separate illusion from absolute truth and then it'll
seem like the material physical world is just an illusion
and the absolute truth that's the real truth the Godhead
but you don't wanna get lost in that because if
you do if all you do is you just say
well the absolute void that's that's the only truth and
reality orly existence it's all just delusion and delusion if
you if you take on that as a worldview then
you will be a duelist actually not a non duelist
if you want a truly fully embodied on duality if
to bring that absolute truth back and have to realize
that oh the absolute even though I could distinguish it
from the illusions at the same time I could collapse
that that distinction and realize that they were one in
the same the entire time which is precisely why it
was so difficult to separate them in the first place
because they're identical so what are you doing when you're
trying to separate them you're trying to really do the
impossible but really reality is relative so it's possible for
you to separate them out by looking at it one
way and then possible for you to integrate it back
together by looking at another way right so really what
it means to say that reality is relative is that
depending on how you look at it you can see
two different things in the same way that if you
look at a half-filled glass of water one person can
look at and say well it's half full not a
person to look at and say it was half empty
which is true both are true simultaneously and you need
to be able to to to look at that glass
in both ways and you need be able to jump
back and forth but the monism or the unit of
the unity or the non duality a part of this
whole metaphysics is that there's only really one glass there
the glass is not in one state of fullness and
another state of of half emptiness it just is one
thing but you can see it in two different ways
depending on how you look at it moving on quote
a further consequence of nahua monism is the metaphysical impossibility
of human beings perceiving DeRay anything other than toyota l'
Forte odel is the only thing to be perceived DeRay
now just as an aside what DeRay means is to
see something directly not through a veil of perceptions or
through some process but to literally become the thing so
for example rather than seeing a tree you become the
tree going on now quote but then how can the
huis ages claim that humans normally miss perceive and misunderstand
total humans normally perceive and conceive Toyota laddie dick doe
or under description that is as maleness as death as
night etc when doing so they perceive and conceive totals
self disguise and consequently perceive and conceive Toyota in a
manner that is untrue unrooted inauthentic on concealing and non
disclosing it is humans miss perceiving and misunderstanding Toyota as
its disguise which prevents them from seeing total reality as
it really is and quote this is super important did
you get this so there's two ways that you can
perceive reality or perceive God you can perceive God in
its disguise which would be D dicto or D ray
you can perceive it indirectly to perceive God directly is
to be conscious of God to perceive God indirectly D
dick toe through description as a particular form that is
what's delusion illusion misunderstanding misperception and that's when you see
physical reality so where's God God is right here all
this is God but Leo it doesn't look like God
right because you're looking at it the wrong way you're
looking at it under description you're looking at it indirectly
so what this is this is the whole trick of
trying to perceive God you need to go beyond your
descriptions beyond specific forms and you don't know how to
do that you need to be trained in how to
do that which is where meditation and yoga comes in
and self inquiry in psychedelics moving on quote the only
way humans experienced a Odle knowingly is to experience a
Odle sans description which means - description without description humans
experienced toyota knowingly via a process of mystical style union
between their hearts and Toyota that enables them to experience
a Odle directly that is without mediation by language concepts
or categories one comes to know Toyota l' through toyota
l' once perception and conception are no longer be fogged
by the Cloud of Unknowing note however that although metaphysically
imminent within human hearts Toyota is nevertheless epistemologically transcendent in
the sense that humans are not guaranteed knowledge of Toyota
and quote you get this so the way you access
God is through mystical union and the only way you
can know God is through God which is another way
of saying that the only way you can discover what
consciousness is is not through a scientific inquiry not through
neuroscience not through equations not through models not through ideas
of consciousness happening in some brain somewhere but directly you
must become consciousness to know what consciousness is because consciousness
is the only thing there is there's nothing else if
you're not conscious of what consciousness is and you're lost
and forms by definition you're not conscious and so of
course you don't know what it is this is the
critical mistake that neuroscientists make or even philosophers many Western
philosophers make when they try to resolve what's called the
hard problem of Saia the hard problem of consciousness or
it's also called the mind-body problem Western philosophers aren't able
to resolve it because they're doing their philosophy using concepts
language and categories which is an intermediary which is preventing
them from realizing and grasping directly what taeil is of
course Toyota is language and concepts and categories but Toyota
is more than that and so long as you're lost
in language concepts and categories you're lost within Toyotas disguise
see that's why it's so tricky and you're not guaranteed
knowledge of Toyota precisely because this trick is being played
and you're playing this trick on yourself you might ask
well beliya why why why would God be so cruel
as to hide himself from me and let me live
my whole life without discovering him well since you are
God since you are Toyota you're doing it to yourself
so stop doing it so the only beef you should
have is with yourself your own mind is getting in
the way it's not that guide is hiding from you
it's that the very sense of you is separating you
from God so surrender that separate sense of you otherwise
known as the ego which you have and then you'll
see Toyota everywhere it's really just that simple next quote
a fundamental metaphysical difference thus divides the underlying problematic of
Nahua and Cartesian style Western epistemology the latter the Cartesian
conceives subject and object dualistic Allah and the relationship between
subject and object as one mediated by a veil of
perception that's the standard materialistic scientific paradigm the subject access
to the object is indirect being mediated for example by
appearance or representations of the object the know who is
epistemic of problematic on the other hand conceives the subject
and object monistic Allah and the relationship between subject and
object in terms of a mask and quote so this
is really the difference the key difference between what we
might call Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy is that Western
philosophy tends to be very dualistic and materialistic and it
tends to divide the world into subjects and objects and
as soon as you do that you create a big
problem this is the problem how do you know anything
because as the subject over here try to know some
object like God how can you be sure leo how
can you know that that you're not deluded when you're
knowing God so which you have to understand though is
that to really know God you have to collapse the
subject-object duality to the point where you become God and
so therefore it's not that you know God it's that
you are God and so the question of possible delusion
or misunderstanding or confusion is eradicated because you are God
miss Nirmala ji and metaphysics the way that they're conceived
of in Western philosophy has been two separate fields they're
unified and it's never gonna be possible for Western philosophy
to resolve the ultimate questions of life and reality and
the hard problem of consciousness unless they realize that epistemology
and metaphysics are actually one the same thing the only
way you can know a thing is by being a
thing you must get rid of this middleman of perception
the veil of perception that you think exists between you
and the real world the external physical world out there
doesn't exist because there is no physical world that there's
only appearances and appearances are immediately accessible to you all
the time appearance just is what it is so you
actually contrary to what you believe you actually have direct
unmediated access to absolute truth or God right now all
the time because there's nothing but God and there's nothing
in the way between you and God other than your
own mind and delusions which really isn't a thing at
all since it's an illusion it doesn't actually exist so
there actually is no veil that's how tricky this is
that's how amazing this is you so discover that there
never was a veil between you and God or you
and the external objective physical world this is it right
here all of it is open to you but you're
just not conscious of the fact that it is wearing
you need an Enlightenment experience to disabuse you of that
notion next quote the Nahua regarded earthly life is filled
with pain sorrow and suffering indeed the Earth's surface is
a treacherous habitat for human beings it's named in the
hua literally means on the point or the summit of
the earth suggesting a narrow jagged point like place surrounded
by constant dangers the nahua proverb quote it is slippery
it is slick on the earth end quote was set
to a person who had lived a morally upright life
but then lost her balance and fell into moral wrongdoing
as if slipping in slick mud humans lose their balance
easily and so suffer misfortune frequently they therefore desperately need
guidance end quote so this explains our predicament here on
this earth we are trying to delicately balance ourselves on
a very precarious position on jagged peak and if we
lean too much to one side or the other then
we're gonna fall into dysfunction and depravity of various kinds
and so our job as sages as self actualize errs
as spiritual aspirants is to maintain our balance on that
jagged point and not to slip and you know I
keep telling you all the time that there's all these
traps you can fall into this trap or that trap
or some other trap with this work well that's precisely
why I'm telling you about all these traps these are
all the ways in which you can lose your balance
and slip because it's so easy to slip and this
is what it means to be a sage is to
learn how to balance yourself on this precarious perch that
we call life next quote nahua sages conceived the raison
d'être a philosophy in terms of this situation and turn
to philosophy practicable answers to what they regarded as the
defining question of human existence which was how can humans
maintain their balance upon the slippery earth this situation questioned
jointly constitute the problematic which functions as is defining framework
for Nahua philosophy morally epistemic ly and aesthetically appropriate human
activities are defined in terms of the goal of humans
maintaining their balance upon the slippery earth all human activities
are to be directed towards this aim at bottom nahua
philosophy is essentially pragmatic and quote so this contrasts much
of Eastern philosophy and spirituality against Western academic analytical philosophy
the problem with the way that analytical philosophy is done
these days in modern universities across US and Europe is
that it's way too conceptual it's way too abstract way
too theoretical and detached from the real word world problems
of how do you you how do you live a
good life how do you navigate all the craziness all
the delusion that's actually happening every single day in the
media in the news with politics at work in your
family all this delusion all of these beliefs and ideologies
how do you navigate all this and find the truth
and maintain a sense of balance and find your place
in life and live a happy fulfilling tranquil life and
not be a devil and not contribute to evil and
delusion and depravity see modern academic philosophy like is completely
disconnected from these questions these questions were at the heart
for example a philosophy for the ancient Greeks and Romans
they practiced philosophy so that they could be better citizens
better politicians better orators better speakers better human beings so
that they can understand nature better so they could be
better scientists but today science has split itself so far
off from philosophy and everyday people have no connection to
felt academic philosophy - it's taught such that the word
philosophy has become a pejorative to mean something abstract and
philosophical and something that is disconnected from from real life
like business or family or success and so what actualize
that org is about is about returning philosophies to its
to its origin the function of philosophy and the way
that I teach actualized org is in such a way
that I take abstract esoteric philosophical things that maybe you
would learn in some university and I show you how
to bring it down to earth and how to use
it to transform your own life practically how to transform
your mood how to solve problems of depression addiction loneliness
anger fear resistance not having a sense of purpose in
life how to solve your career how to align your
career with your heart how to get in touch with
your heart how to be more authentic how to be
better more honest within your relationships how to be a
better leader how to be creatively independent as an artist
how to connect with your creative source which is of
course Toyota that's where all art comes from we'll get
to that in a minute right so what we need
is we need ordinary people who would otherwise never be
interested in philosophy because they treat it as some abstraction
or some theoretical thing to realize that they're actually missing
out on the very heart and core of practical everyday
life living and that's precisely why most people in the
West live such miserable depressed mediocre depraved lives addicted deluded
depressed with no sense of purpose alienated nihilistic and just
like completely lost in life with no idea of what
they should be doing working some dead-end job at McDonald's
or Starbucks this is why this is happening precisely because
nobody is really taught true philosophy and philosophy has turned
into some mental masturbation exercise within academia it's a very
problematic state of affairs this is directly responsible for very
practical problems we have in life including war genocide criminality
all the problems you see in politics all the diluted
politics we have all the culture wars it's responsible for
all of this it's responsible for climate change it's responsible
for corruption within government corruption within business oligarchies and corporate
rule like all of this stems from people fundamentally not
being taught philosophy proper true philosophy which is what I'm
reading to you right now this Nahua philosophy is the
proper philosophy it's not just know who a philosophy this
is a universal philosophy this is philosophy that works for
all humans it's been tested across thousands of years across
all continents and all cultures and it works next quote
to the question how can humans maintain their balance upon
the slippery earth the Nahua answered humans must conduct every
aspect of their lives wisely to the question what is
the best path for humans to follow on the narrow
jagged surface of the earth then who answered the balanced
middle path since it avoids excess and imbalance hence miss
stepping and slipping hence misfortune and ill-being end quote so
what modern human beings lack is not intelligence or technology
what we lack is wisdom what we lack is a
sense of balance what we lack is a sense of
context and big-picture perspective we lack perspective on our own
lives and also collectively as a society we lack perspective
and because we lack perspective we are not able to
balance ourselves properly and we swing our pendulum too far
to one side or to another next quote wisdom aims
and instructing humans how to maintain their balance like skilled
Mountaineers as they walk upon the narrow twisting and jagged
path of life upon the summit of the earth the
new Whois conceived wisdom dynamically in terms of balancing a
consumption rooted in indigenous shamanism and in their conception of
Toyota wisdom is a characteristic of how one conducts oneself
and one's affairs not as a thing or as a
set of eternal truths one grasps apprehends or possesses by
enabling them to walk in balance wisdom affords humans some
measure of stability and well-being in an otherwise evanescent life
filled with pain sorrow struggle and suffering here on an
impermanent doomed earth end quote so wisdom is balance go
check out my episode about balance the importance of balance
and personal development search for balance and actualize that organ
you'll find it or I talk about this dynamic notion
of balance that balance on a static thing but it's
like riding a unicycle that's a very important concept which
we need to be returning to over and over and
over again because in every aspect of your life it
comes up and it's not enough just to understand balance
and generically you need to really appreciate how to strike
the right balance within business within finances in your life
within your health with your diet with your exercise with
your sexuality with the way you're raising your children how
many children you have with your relationships with your boss
with your work with your career with your spirituality even
with your psychedelics with every that you do how do
you strike the right balance everything I teach is in
a sense designed to show you how to strike these
right balances and oftentimes I tell you that well you
shouldn't do this thing here because it's gonna be too
much to this side and you shouldn't do that thing
here because this will be another trap and so I'm
pointing out various traps to you hoping that you stay
in the middle and don't step on a landmine you
see so wisdom is not so much a set of
fixed truths like the ten commandments rather wisdom is the
ability to actively balance yourself in life in various situations
and the better you aren't balancing across more situations the
more wise you are next quote how do humans become
wise they must become well rooted authentic true and non
referentially disclosing their intellectual emotional imagine of and physical dispositions
and behavior must become deeply and firmly rooted in total
end quote so that's what every religion across the world
has taught you is that for you to become wise
and for you to live a good life you must
become deeply rooted in total in God which means you
must become conscious of God now the problem with most
religions is that they get it backwards they try to
give you a set of rules and Commandments to live
by and tell you how to be a moral human
being without putting you in touch with God first and
that's precisely putting the cart before the horse creating a
lot of pathology and problems instead what needs to happen
is that religion if done properly needs to give people
access to God as quickly as possible through various techniques
and then once the person is able to access God
then the religion doesn't need to teach rules and Commandments
for how they should live the religion doesn't need to
moralize down to people rather people just by becoming conscious
of God will automatically correct their behaviors and know exactly
how to behave and and what to do and become
quote unquote good decent human beings next quote wisdom involved
four ultimately indistinguishable aspects for the Nahua number one the
practical ability to conduct one's affairs in such a way
as to maintain some measure of balance and purity and
hence some measure of well-being in one's personal domestic social
and natural surroundings to the practical ability to conduct one's
life in such a way as to creatively participate in
reinforce adapt and extend into the future the way of
life inherited from one's ancestors three the practical ability to
conduct one's life in such a way as to participate
in the regeneration and renewal of the cosmos and for
the practical know-how involved in performing ritual activities which genuinely
present Toyoda authentically embody toyota l-- preserve existing balance and
purity create new balance and purity and participate alongside toyota
in the regeneration of the universe and quote that's it
right there that's true religion for you see number one
conducting your affairs with balance number two creatively participating in
the unfolding of Toyotas plan and helping other people to
be conscious see three participating in the renewal of the
cosmos which means of course living in harmony with nature
so this idea the way that that Christians for example
in the United States many many evangelicals and Christians the
way that they live where they don't worry about the
climate for example they don't worry about global warming this
is antithetical fundamentally to what religion should be about the
religious people really if they were doing the religion properly
should be the ones that are most concerned about their
environment because they understand or they should rather that the
human being is connected with the cosmos and working together
in tandem and now we need to work alongside Toyota
rather than against Toyota raping and pillaging the earth and
then number four is it's it's the practical know-how of
performing these various ritual activities that help to authentically Express
Toyota preserving balance and purity moving on quote the nahua
universe is a participatory universe characterized by a relationship of
compelling mutuality or interdependence between humans and the universe this
is simply a consequence of the interconnectedness and oneness of
all things not only does the universe causally affect humans
but humans causally affect the universe human actions promote cosmic
harmony balance and purity on the one hand and cosmic
disharmony balance and impurity on the other hand and quote
so you see this is all about having an ecological
sense an ecological perspective seeing how you and your community
of humans your tribe fits in with the larger whole
how all of us can live on this globe in
peace and in harmony with nature and with each other
and with animals and with the whole cosmos see this
is what most religions are are missing because most religions
are so tribal that they only care about their tribe
their people their community their country and their religion and
to hell with everybody else but this overlooks the bigger
perspective that the entire universe is one whole and all
of us are interconnected this is central to what religion
should be about what spirituality is about but what of
course most religion isn't which is what's causing all the
the evil and suffering a lot of the evil and
suffering that we see around in the world today is
because people don't take this holistic perspective and they just
think of themselves as independent agents just doing their own
stuff this sort of libertarian ideology this toxic libertarian ideology
which is so short-sighted that hey you know it's all
about by individual freedoms as long as I can maximize
my individual proof freedoms and profit nothing else matters this
is devilry this is antithetical to how you're supposed to
live life which is why people these days are so
depressed and so lost and so materialistic because they're disconnected
from Toyota land from the wisdom that AOL offers when
you become conscious of Toyota next quote the new who
has conceived moral psychological and physical health well-being righteousness and
purity in terms of keeping one's balance on the Earth's
slippery surface and so regarded the Earth's surface as a
psychologically physically and morally dangerous place in the hue wisdom
urged humans to act with extreme care and to follow
the guidelines of the ancestors as any other path would
inevitably lead one to stumble down the Earth's slopes into
psychological physical and moral imbalance perverseness instability and disease end
quote that's exactly right except there's a very common pathology
and mistake that happens here with this a lot of
spiral dynamics stage blue people would agree with this entire
passage and they would say yes Leo that's right and
that's why I need to preserve my tribes rituals and
that's why Christianity is the best or that's why everyone
needs to believe in Allah that's why the Quran is
the best or this is why Buddhism is the best
you see we got to preserve the traditions of our
ancient Buddhist ancestors but that's not right that's to ethnocentric
about you you can't just blindly preserve ancient traditions you
also need to take account of the shifting nature of
Toyota Land the fact that technology and society is changing
rapidly at an ever-accelerating rate and the reason that our
society is so trouble today the reason so many people
are sick depressed getting cancer getting heart disease obesity the
reason there are so many people in poverty and many
many other social problems that we have is precisely because
as a society we haven't developed a modern philosophy non-dogmatic
non ethnocentric philosophy that all of us can agree on
a common set of values grounded in a yodel and
we can all agree upon of course to do that
we would need to become all conscious of to yodel
first which is why it hasn't happened we don't have
this and so what we have is we have different
tribes and factions thinking that their value system is the
only right one trying to dominate every other one and
so we just have this free-for-all system where everybody's just
fighting for themselves and then even we've got atheists who
are all now fighting against the religious people because they
think that atheism is the solution to everything right yeah
and they're just as deluded as the religious people and
so just it it's a it's all happening fundamentally because
none of these people are directly conscious that they are
total and what it means to be total so they
don't have that wisdom that they would have if they
became conscious of peyote and so that's why our earth
right now is on the break at a tipping point
ecologically politically geopolitically socially culturally and so forth is because
we're screwing up our balance economically we're out of balance
as well with rampant capitalism and people are taking sides
and just becoming more and more polarized and more and
more ideological and dogmatic about it next yet the dire
situation of humans on earth did not prompt the Nahua
to reject earthly life in favor of some otherworldly life
the Earth's surface is the only realm wherein humans enjoy
the full potential for well-being since only here are their
various vital forces fully integrated the new who is resolved
to live as best they could and indeed earthly life
does allow some measure of well-being like sleep laughter food
sexual pleasure conjugal union and procreation yet these were scarce
momentary and needed to be taken in moderation as any
excess resulted in imbalance end quote that's exactly right the
trick with balance which spiral dynamic stage blue people religious
people don't understand is that they think they can codify
balance into a set of Commandments or rigid rules that
can be followed mechanistically this isn't true balance it doesn't
work so again the fundamentalist religious people will agree that
yeah Leah we need to take sex and food and
other things in moderation but the problem is is that
these people are not thinking for themselves they have like
a set of Commandments that they need to follow that
they need to not do and they think that if
they ters stick to those Commandments that that's gonna that's
gonna allow them to navigate and to balance properly it
doesn't because the environment is changing all the time so
the Ten Commandments maybe they were great 2000 years ago
they might have worked even back then it certainly wasn't
enough to balance properly but it might have been a
good foundation but today if you're still sitting to the
ten commandments and you think the Ten Commandments of 2,000
years ago are gonna work for today or you think
some Sharia law from thousands of years ago of Muslim
interpretations of the Quran is gonna apply to today and
work in today's world with today's ever globalizing culture and
economy and and all this it doesn't work it creates
tension and creates chaos it creates evil so you need
to learn how to balance without moral without Commandments next
quote now who a philosopher saw humans as creatures yearning
for rootedness that is for a deep firm and lasting
anchoring in their lives and who restlessly searched for it
obtaining well rootedness enables one to become an upright man
to live a balanced pure and genuinely human life without
roots one finds neither balance purity nor humaneness obtaining well
rootedness is difficult and in their search many humans give
their hearts to what appears to be well rooted and
authentic but it's not since this cannot provide grounding and
stability humans inevitably become dissatisfied with it and abandon it
only to begin their search anew oftentimes repeating the process
over and over and over again end quote is this
ringing any bells are you seeing how you're doing this
what are the ways in which you're trying to root
yourself but it's not working you might try to root
yourself in religion it doesn't work you might try to
root yourself and pick up and chasing girls it doesn't
work you might try to root yourself in business and
chasing money it doesn't work you might try to root
yourself in video games chasing after the new latest greatest
video game that's released and every single one of them
ends up disappointing you and leaving you feel worse you
might root yourself in pornography and that doesn't work you
might ruin yourself in some drugs and that doesn't work
you might root yourself in a relationship and starting a
family and that also doesn't work none of this can
work because that's not well what rel rootedness is you
can't root yourself in material forms which are impermanent the
only proper route is total God you must become conscious
of God that is the proper route and of course
that is the ruthless route the groundless ground there's no
real route there and that's precisely what routes you that's
the paradox of it you might wonder Leo how can
I route myself in nothingness but that is the only
true route is nothingness the better question is how can
you route yourself in something this how can you route
your self in the ten commandments when the commandments change
how can you route yourself in a language when the
language evolved and changes how can you route yourself in
your country or in your national identity whether you're a
German or an American or Japanese when national identities change
boundaries change cultures change what are you trying to route
yourself in are you trying to route yourself in your
body your physical body well how can that work when
your physical body is gonna deteriorate age and die there's
only one true route which routes you absolutely which is
the absolute absolute truth absolute truth is the only unchanging
thing but that also means that it's nothingness moving on
quote their hearts inevitably becomes scattered unbalanced and lost such
humans become vagabonds wandering about aimlessly from one illusion to
the next they become beastly unstable unbalanced impure perverse dull-witted
intemperate and vicious they fail to realize they're humanists and
merely appear to be human they become deceivers robes and
de simulators they quote act on things with their humanity
dead end quote they are quote lumps of flesh with
two eyes and quote and quote they are defective human
weights and quote so take a look isn't this perfectly
describing the state of the world today depraved Faga bonds
wandering around from one illusion to the next doesn't this
perfectly describe our politics our business environment our economy everything
within the church religions geopolitics in your own life all
your friends everybody you know your family aren't they just
deceivers rogues into simulators isn't that what you are aren't
you a rogue at a simulator a deceiver of course
starting with the deception of yourself that explains the state
of the world if you wonder why there's so much
suffering in the world here's your answer nobody is routed
in Toyota hardly anybody is so the ultimate root solution
to all of humanity's problems is to ensure that people
get rooted in total that everybody gets rooted in total
this is the ultimate solution the problem though is that
you can't force people to do it because if you
force people by trying to religiously indoctrinate them the way
they do in the Middle East or the way Christians
do or the way Buddhists do it's actually gonna backfire
and actually make the problem even worse because you can't
substitute for a direct consciousness of Toyota with mere ideas
and dogma and ideology about Toyota because that Dogman ideology
doesn't have the same effect it doesn't come with that
higher state of consciousness which is then what leads to
proper decent life and proper decent interactions between human beings
and other human beings and human beings in their environment
next quote humans are born quote faceless with undeveloped powers
of judgment and they need other humans for the education
and discipline needed for acquiring a quote face for becoming
balanced and becoming fully human developing a proper quote face
and heart is only possible through the opportunities provided by
well-ordered social living unstable foolish and diseased the loner slips
constantly upon the path of life one's home neighborhood polity
and environment are healthy or diseased depending upon whether they
are balanced or not personal domestic and social balance nasaw
imbalance impurity and ill-being are contagious encode and so again
we're continuing to describe all the ills of society and
culture today is this right here see we don't have
a proper education system that is our biggest deficiency right
now is the state of our education system we're teaching
children the wrong things we're not preparing them for being
decent human beings and by this I don't mean we
need to religiously indoctrinate them I mean we need to
teach them philosophy metaphysics epistemology spirituality meditation self-actualization self-improvement nutrition
fitness health proper scientific thinking within certain bounds not in
the materialistic unlimited sense that it's taught today see we
need to teach for wisdom not teach children how to
memorize answers for tests and so because of this our
neighborhoods our polity our environment our health is all polluted
and diseased and this pollution this disease spreads across everywhere
like a cancer through the internet across Facebook across YouTube
across newspapers across the television screen into neighborhoods through medicines
into the business sectors into various industries whether it's pharmaceuticals
or the military-industrial complex or Big Oil it spreads into
the government its tentacles go everywhere it's a contagion it's
a mind virus that infects everyone's mind and it makes
everyone materialistic and disconnected from Toyoda behaving like animals rather
than the spiritual beings that we could be this is
the state of modern society and it's our job to
cure the contagion but you have to be careful with
curing the contagion because a lot of times what happens
is that naive people ignorant people try to cure the
contagion thinking that they know the cure and their cure
actually ends up being part of the contagion which just
spreads the contagion even further and that's what a lot
of religions do because like I said before the devil
co-op's religion to guide people away from total moving on
quote the aim of cognition from the epitome illogical point
of view is walking in balance upon the slippery earth
and epistemologically appropriate inquiry is that which promotes this aim
to say a person cognizes truly is therefore to say
that she cognizes with well-grounded stability or well-rooted ly Nahua
philosopher's thus process possessed a concept of truth but they
conceived truth in terms of well groundedness and stability and
well-founded nystagmus not in terms of Correspondence aboutness representation reference
fit or successful description in short they understood truth non
semantically end quote a big problem with the Western intellectual
tradition as a whole Western philosophy in Western science is
that we treat truth as a set of propositions or
statements such as snow is white grass is green the
Sun shines in the morning the Earth revolves around the
Sun and so forth but this is a really an
improper conception of truth truth is a non semantic notion
truth is a non linguistic notion truth sits deeper than
language or concepts or ideas or our models of the
universe so that's what is so difficult about truth is
that language doesn't allow you to route yourself in the
truth and so then how do you spread truth on
a massive scale that's the whole challenge of philosophy and
religion and science and epistemology is that you really can't
you need people to actually have direct insight which nobody
does the work to have and so everybody is fundamentally
disconnected from truth and that means that nobody is really
well rooted and because you're not well rooted you're a
devil and you run around looking for pleasure and solutions
to a never-ending stream of problems have you noticed that
you have problems in your life to infinity they never
end every problem is followed up by another problem every
problem you solve just creates more problems that's because you're
not rooted and you're not addressing the root problem that
is sourcing all of these amount more minor problems next
quote the new who has characterized persons things activities and
utterances equally and without equivocation in terms of truth and
they understood truth in terms of well rootedness in total
that which is well rooted in total is genuine true
authentic and well balanced as well as non referentially disclosing
and I'm concealing of total creative things exist along a
continuum ranging from those that are well rooted in total
and hence authentically represent and embody Toyota as well as
disclosed and unconcealed Toyota at the one end to those
things which are poorly rooted in total and hence neither
authentically embody and represent Toyota nor disclosed and unconcealed Toyota
at the other end then code see see this is
describing a sort of higher transcendental good or transcendental beauty
that comes with spiritual awakening is that you can categorize
human actions and hammers and creations in terms of sort
of a spectrum of those things which are reflecting the
truth of total and those which are not those things
which are unconcealed Toyota helping to raise the consciousness of
mankind and ourselves and those things which are not see
so let's give an example of what's being meant here
so we're talking about truth but don't think of true
there's just some abstraction think of it this way like
if we take a can of coca-cola and we say
is this a truthful object is this in alignment with
Toyota we would say of course not it's on this
end of the spectrum because what is this coca-cola doing
it's filling children with sugar which is destroying their health
making them obese making them hyperactive and ADHD such that
they can't learn properly we're putting this coca-cola in vending
machines in schools we're advertising it all over the TV
on the Super Bowl in other places all around the
world we're not regulating this product we're not putting limits
on the corporation of coca-cola in the way that it
advertises this all around the world coca-cola is Raheem billions
of dollars selling this coca-cola do they care about the
health that they have on the human population of course
not do they care about eliminating sugar from their dreams
of course not do they care about making a healthy
drink of course not in fact what they do is
they Lobby the government to make sure that the government
doesn't regulate this stuff and to make sure that they
can export this stuff all around the world very cheaply
with no tariffs no taxes no regulations whatsoever and that
this stuff is actually not treated as junk food literally
American junk food manufacturers have to lobby government in order
to prevent the government from placing labels on junk food
telling the populace that it's junk food and that it's
damaging to your health and they actually get this this
legislation passed such that in various free-trade agreements between America
and Canada and Mexico and all this they've banned the
placing of junk food labels on junk food you see
so it is deviled this this whole coca-cola dynamic is
pure devilry you see it's pure deception it's untruth and
fundamentally all this contributes to people not being able to
access to yodel because when children are are so ADHD
that they can't even focus and meditate for 20 minutes
and they're so obese that they get various kinds of
diseases and then they become so addicted to video games
and other things all of this comes together in such
a way that then the connection from ever accessing T
odel is completely lost you see and then even if
somebody comes along like myself who wants to maybe deliver
a little bit of truth by teaching total can I
actually do it on a mate on a broad scale
no because the entire advertising and marketing ecosystem in the
world is completely dominated by players like coca-cola and giant
banks and giant oil companies and giant pharmaceutical companies and
so forth that someone who's actually teaching Toyota and can't
compete with that can't compete with the millions of advertising
dollars that are necessary to actually spread this message in
the proper way see because they take up all the
oxygen in the room and I'm not I'm not I'm
not really whining about that I'm just giving you an
example here of how how this really works so as
a society what needs to happen in the future is
that we need more institutions corporations and entities organizations that
are helping to create products and services and systems which
are more revealing of total revealing of the truth so
that more people have access to that and then through
that process Toyota will become more apparent to everybody showering
everybody with wisdom allowing us to live better together both
individually and collectively that's the ultimate solution and hope you
can see how practical that is truth is not just
some abstraction truth permeates every single aspect of your life
and when you're not connected to truth by definition you're
living in falsehood and delusion which leads to depravity which
leads to all the problems that you have in your
life individually and collectively next quote humans come to note
a yodel using their heart not head or brain the
harp serves as a Center for T alia that vital
force which induces humans towards that which alone fills their
emptiness and gives them roots total knowing requires that one
possesses a quote Toyota lized heart that is a heart
charged with Toyota's sacred energy and enjoying sacred presence the
quote totalized heart possesses an extraordinary amount of Telia one
possessing a Toyota lized heart has Toyota in his heart
and his quote wise in the things of Toyota end
quote so this is the difference between being focused and
based from your left hemisphere to your right hemisphere the
right hemisphere is more holistic more integrated you could also
call it your heart it is connected with your heart
it's holistic whereas the left hemisphere is very rational logical
demanding proven evidence for things and so when you try
to live your life and you try to do philosophy
from the LES hemisphere from your brain from your head
and not enough from your heart what you is you
get the common problem that you find today in modern
academic philosophy within academia in general the way that science
is done you get the materialistic paradigm that we talk
about you get rationalism reductionism scientism you get denial of
spirituality you get a ignorant about psychology ignorance about self-deception
ignorance about states of consciousness denial of states of consciousness
believing the states of consciousness are just byproducts of the
brain believing that God is just a byproduct of the
brain all of this is part of the spiral dynamic
stage orange phase of cognitive development where people are really
stuck in their heads and by going beyond that and
by experiencing toil directly you realize that there is an
awakening of the heart which happens and then you start
to live your life from your heart rather than your
head and the more you do that the more you
connect with Toyota the more wisdom you have the better
things go in your life the more satisfied you are
less disease you have the less despicable of a person
you are the less selfish you are and the more
you fulfill your mission in life which is to love
if you want to know more about that go check
out my episode called what is love where I talk
about that next quote the Nahua word for heart and
Robin who it just means Aztec so the Aztec word
for heart derives from the Aztec word for movement this
indicates yet another way in which the heart is the
organ best suited for knowing Toyota's way Toyota is essentially
movement a Toyota lized heart moves in bounds with the
movement of Toyota and as a result moves knowingly as
one's heart comes to move knowingly one becomes quote wise
in the things of Toyota one comes to have a
Odle in his heart Toyota presents and discloses itself to
and through one's heart end quote and this is why
many spiritual traditions talk about love and talk about compassion
and talk about the heart it's big within the Christian
tradition but it's also big for example within Buddhism they
teach compassion they teach something called love and kindness meditation
many religions teach prayer of various kinds the Sufis talk
about the love of God that's from Islam because the
more conscious you become that you are Toyota the the
more your heart opens because you realize that you are
intimately connected with the entire universe you are the entire
universe and then comes the letting go of judgment the
letting go of tribalism and demonization and ultimately what you
can experience is you can experience platonic existential metaphysical love
as one facet of Toyota because Toyota loves everything God
is all loving and you can then realize that since
you are God you also can love everything next quote
Toyota is ultimately ineffable since it is undifferentiated and unordered
a seamless totality consequently humans only experience Toyota knowingly in
a manner unmediated unspecified and undefined by language concepts and
categories along with their divisions classifications and distinctions these are
facets of Toyotas disguise or mask and thus contribute to
humans d-dick Domus perceiving and misunderstanding of Toyota to the
degree that language concepts and categories are essential to human
reasoning humans thus understand Toyota non rationally alternatively expressed Toyota
only genuinely discloses itself non linguistically non-discursive Lee none rationally
and quote so we already touched on this but it's
such an important point that it bears repeating again you
can't get to total linguistically discursive ly semantically rationally through
proofs and models and equations you cannot quantify total because
total is infinite and all your models and quantifications are
finite so you're not gonna succeed in that stage orange
spar lemak stage Orange people cannot cope with this truth
because they want to be able to quantify all of
reality and they want to be able to model all
of reality but they're forgetting that they themselves are total
how do you quantify yourself so you need some sort
of practice which goes beyond language and symbols and so
one way to talk about enlightenment is we can talk
about it and term it non symbolic consciousness ordinary human
consciousness is symbolic conceptual consciousness even when you're thinking about
the future and what you're going to do tomorrow and
you know what you're going to do at work tomorrow
that is symbolic consciousness you're stuck in symbolic consciousness without
even knowing that you are and so you might not
be a mathematician or a scientist or an academic or
a philosopher and so you might say well Leo I
don't I don't really make models of the universe or
a reality or I don't use equations I'm not trying
to quantify reality but in a sense you are you're
stuck in in a in in symbolic relationship with reality
because you're thinking of the future you're living in the
future you're thinking about the past or living in the
past and all the meanings that you assign to the
world and so forth all of this you do linguistically
rationally and symbolically and so it's very counterintuitive to try
to move beyond that into the trans rational realms the
non linguistic non symbolic realms that's difficult to do because
we as humans as a culture we have enormous addiction
to symbols and to models to concepts and we just
have this unspoken assumption within science and within our culture
that everything that is true that is valuable can be
grappled with symbolically and it just turns out that that's
not the case in fact the truth is non symbolic
by definition if you have a symbol of God it's
not God it's not the truth it is a O'Toole's
disguise and so you're lost in the disguise rather than
seeing Toyoda osteotome next quote composing and performing song poems
in particular are the highest form of human artistry and
the finest way for humans to present Toyota since this
activity most closely imitates and participates in Toyota's own cosmic
creative artistry now let me pause and us inside here
and explain what is meant by song poems don't take
this too literally so of course the ancient Aztecs and
their shamans they would literally perform songs and dance and
sing lyrics and so forth that was their way of
doing art and communing with Toyota and expressing the artistry
and beauty of Toyota but if we bring this term
more into modern times you can think of any human
art whether it's speaking film videogames painting poetry writing books
and novels whatever kind of art you do this is
what the Aztecs refer to a song and poem so
quote hence song poems rather than discursive arguments are the
appropriate medium of sagely expression and sages are perforce singer
song writer poets flower and song comes from a ritually
prepared heart which embodies and presents a proper balance of
reason and passion male and female active and passive etc
end quote so art plays a very important role in
human life because the whole purpose of art is to
display and glorify the virtues of Toyota and the only
way you can be a great artist is by having
a strong Toyota lized heart and a connection a direct
connection to truth which is Toyota the less connected you
are the truth the more your art comes from egotism
and artifice and deception and illusion the less beautiful the
art is so I'm telling you all this for the
for all you artists out there who really want to
nail your art you need spirituality even more so than
you need your technical skills for your art because all
of your creative ideas that comes from the Godhead comes
from Toyota Toyota is the creative source of all of
existence and since you are Toyota and you want to
create you need to be connected with yourself as long
as you're an artist who's disconnected from Toyota yourself then
your art will not be authentic and true and therefore
it will not be beautiful and all the most beautiful
art is that art which helps to display and reveal
Toyota in some way whether it's through a song through
a book you write we could be fiction it could
be nonfiction it could even be your art can be
science you know the greatest scientists like Albert Einstein for
example or Nikola Tesla what were they doing they were
connected to Toyota they were conscious of themselves as Toyota
land then they were expressing that through their scientific work
same thing with like Isaac Newton for example or Kurt
gödel or Gare Cantor many brilliant mathematicians and scientists and
logicians of past times they were geniuses precisely because they
were pursuing Toyota and connected to Toyota lat least in
some fashion now I'm not saying all of them were
enlightened I'm just saying that they had an unusually strong
connection to Toyota in some sense it doesn't mean this
they were fully enlightened and that's why you know most
artists of course in society most of our greatest artists
they're not enlightened but they have some sort of intuitive
connection to spirit or to the creative source from which
they draw their inspiration whether they're a rapper or a
film director or just a traditional artist painting on a
canvas like Picasso so the more you connect with a
odel the better your art becomes next quote acquiring a
Toyota lized heart and becoming knowledgeable of Toyota also requires
that one engage in Flour and song artistic activity epistemic
ly improves one's heart causing it to move in balance
with Toyota and hence move knowingly by engaging creative artistry
humans imitate and participate in albeit imperfectly the self transforming
cosmic creativity of Toyota in so doing they fashion their
hearts after Toyota end quote see it goes both ways
it's a two-way street by doing good art you come
to better understand Toyota and by better understanding to yodel
you come to do better art mm-hmm and so this
also ties in now with life purpose so one of
the reasons most people are so dissatisfied with their life
because they work lame nine-to-five jobs which are not their
art and so they spend half of their life working
on stuff they have no heartfelt connection to and in
fact he's usually the opposite they're working to to peddle
illusion and to peddle falsehood to others and so this
becomes very depressing and soul draining and so one of
the most important pillars of your life is to find
a sense of life purpose to find a way in
which you want to artistically express yourself this is important
because you as a human being you are Toyota and
Toyota is getting his kicks out of life from creating
so you as a human if you're not really connected
with the whole process of creating something beautiful whether it's
in science or in the domain of business or in
the domain of traditional art or music or whatever then
you're really missing out on a huge pillar of life
you are god you're like a little mini god that
gets to create in human form of course as a
human you're limited there's only certain things you can create
you can't create as powerfully as title itself can but
you'd be amazed at the kind of amazing stuff you
could create once you connect yourself deeper into Toyota and
then also how that makes you feel how good that
feels and also how that helps you to connect with
Toyota C so it's sort of like a a positive
vicious cycle that and that goes upwards or conversely it
goes downward if you're if you're not doing that so
a lot of people are depressed simply because they don't
have something like this in their life they don't have
a sense of life purpose and they're just kind of
wasting it away by the way Oh what is what
is this that's happening right now I'm here talking what
is this talking this is my flower and song this
is what I do to get my kicks this is
what I do as god I found this thing for
me and the way I found it is I explained
in my life purpose course I go through the steps
and the principles that I went through to create actualized
org and solidify it for myself as my vehicle actualize
already is my vehicle for doing my song and dance
and expressing my totalized heart and as I do it
more and more my heart becomes more mortised and the
better and better and the deeper I can go with
my work the more of my work can help to
reveal Toyota to you the more that inspires me as
I get feedback from that and it creates this positive
vicious cycle for me that's quite rewarding and that's that's
how I enjoy my life is doing this work tah-dah
that's what's going on here this is my art now
of course your art has nothing to do with my
art per se I'm not saying you need to become
like me I'm saying you need to become like me
in the general sense that you need to develop a
Thao to last heart and you need to connect deeper
with total and you need to find your artistic outlet
whatever that is and ideally make that your career so
that your work is doing something that you're proud of
and you know you find meaningful and then this actually
becomes a spiritual pursuit in Hinduism they have something called
karma yoga or bhakti yoga where your spiritual path isn't
to sit in to meditate or to do self inquiry
but rather it's to participate actively in the world and
by doing something good for mankind and doing it suffice
ly with your entire heart that this in and of
itself is supposed to produce a sort of enlightenment now
I'm personally not that big of a fan of the
of the idea that you can use karma yoga or
bhakti yoga to become enlightened per se I think that's
a very indirect method and many people who try to
do it that way will fail but I think that
there's something very important too to the idea of bhakti-yoga
and karma yoga and really what that is is life
purpose what the Hindus call bhakti yoga and Karma Yoga
Yoga I call life purpose really that's your career that's
what your career should be as a human being and
then of course I think you still also need some
more direct forms of yoga like self inquiry or meditation
in order to fully realize total because you're probably not
going to realize total as the Godhead just through your
career next quote acquiring a totalized heart and becoming knowledgeable
of toyoda also requires that one be well rooted well
balanced pure authentic and morally righteous and that one possesses
strength self-control moderation and modesty humans must show humility and
respect towards total before Toyota discloses itself end quote so
you see a lot of you who are trying to
pursue enlightenment are doing it from a place of inauthenticity
egotism and therefore it's quite difficult now I'm not saying
you should stop trying you should probably try but in
many spiritual traditions for example what they tell you is
that before you even begin to meditate you already need
to start clearing out your head and clearing out your
mind and following certain rules that they give you for
living a pure life why is that because only by
purifying yourself of various kinds of egotism that you have
in selfishness and materialism do you open yourself up to
the possibility of total disclosing itself to you which is
why many people who are deeply sucking atheism and rationalism
and materialism and money and greed and sex and all
of this you know it's impossible to talk with them
about God they're at a certain level of consciousness and
development where they're not at the point where they can
even entertain a serious conversation or teaching about how to
reach God they can't sit down and meditate they don't
see any point in it because it's in their mind
is taking away time from having sex or watching porn
or doing drugs or drinking alcohol or partying with their
friends right so you got to do this more basic
simple self-improvement type of work before you can really start
to listen to these higher teachings that I'm teaching now
with actualised org and so those of you who haven't
done that work yet this toyoda stuff is going to
be all over way over your head you've got to
go back and do some really simple kind of stuff
like clean up your diet stop certain addictions that you
have stopped watching television you know stop being a jerk
to your friends and your family it's very basic stuff
you got to start to do clean yourself up in
other words next quote the foregoing characteristics are not only
Epis Tamala djegal but moral and aesthetic as well they
not only help humans become knowledgeable and live wisely they
help them to live morally authentically purely well balanced ly
and beautifully humans cannot become knowledgeable of total without becoming
genuine pure morally righteous and beautiful and vice versa in
short the process of epistemological self-improvement is also one of
moral and aesthetic self-improvement and quote so that's everything that
I just said underscored next quote humans and Toyota coexist
in a moral interrelationship of reciprocity and becoming knowledgeable involves
a morally regulated exchange with Toyota when humans behave in
richly prescribed ways they may expect to attain those things
which they come to merit wisdom emerges as a consequence
of moral come epistemological come aesthetic interaction and participation with
Toyota end quote so the better human being that you
become the easier it is for you to access to
yodel but many Orthodox stage Bleu religious people take this
too far and they spend all of their time and
attention trying to be a good person which comes with
lots of guilt and shame and various mechanical rules that
you must follow doing various mindless rituals without raising their
consciousness and so they try to be a good person
through mechanical means rather than by becoming more conscious as
you become more conscious you will automatically want to become
a better person and that's what many Orthodox religious people
miss so be careful not to fall into that trap
but it is true as all religions tell you that
you should be a decent person and the reason that
they tell you that and they stress it so much
is that if you are living a chaotic life in
a chaotic family in a chaotic community where all sorts
of egotism and mischief and devilry runs amuck various kinds
of sinfulness then your chances of ever really being able
to actualize these higher teachings are going to be very
very low and so in a sense the purpose of
old-school religion is to create an environment within a social
community and environment where accessing total becomes possible for the
average person and not just for the super hardcore yogi
because the super hardcore yo you can just let go
off and live in a cave and realize God not
really a problem there will always be people like that
the the really challenging problem societally speaking culturally speaking is
how do we how do we get the rest of
mankind who isn't that hardcore and isn't willing to sacrifice
all the material luxuries of life like family and sex
and food and business and so forth how do we
get those people to realize total that's what's really hard
next quote to the degree humans approximate balance and purity
in their lives they perfect their humaneness and flourish to
the degree that they do not they destroy their humaneness
and suffer beastly miserable lives toyota functions as the ultimate
source and standard of intrinsic value since beauty and purity
are properties of Toyota Toyota's own balance and purity are
genuinely embodied and presented in well-formed quatl tail feathers Jade
and turquoise one obtains this balance in purity by routing
oneself firmly and deeply in total and quote I love
this so gods and allegiance comes with this extraordinary beauty
and the best way to see it is go look
at some high-resolution photographs of animals look at the beauty
with which animals are designed you can take a peacock
tail feather and just look at it you can even
buy one and just look at it and see that
the the beauty of the design of it see the
truth in the in the peacock tail feather or a
butterfly or some bird outside your house or in iguana
or a tiger or uh-hmm even even a cat if
you have a cat or a dog just try to
see the beauty of their design they were designed by
total sea and so you can you can look everywhere
throughout society and throughout life and you can look at
man-made things and you can ask yourself how well does
it mirror the genius of the designs of Toyota and
you can see that certain objects certain electronics certain computer
certain phones are really you might say truthful or accurate
to Toyota and that's what makes them beautiful and functional
at the same time and then there are other objects
that are designed by by hacks who are just trying
to earn money and who have no artistic sense no
no proper sense of design or sense of beauty or
symmetry or or balance or order these people are disconnected
from themselves and from Toyota and therefore the designs are
ugly they don't function very well they glitch there's a
bunch of problems and it they have bugs and you
don't want to use them and you don't appreciate that
they're beautiful because they're they're hideous Frankenstein monstrosity and these
of course quickly get replaced and cold by natural selection
and they get replaced by by the beautiful stuff out
competed by the beautiful stuff by the truthful stuff at
least in the long run in the short term of
course there's a lot of ugly stuff out there a
lot of ugly designs that don't work very well but
you can see that what evolution is doing is evolution
is total moving towards greater truth consciousness beauty purity and
balance next quote morally appropriate conduct helps humans assume a
face and develop a heart and enrich their lives it
helps them become authentically human morally inappropriate conduct on the
other hand causes humans to leave their heart undeveloped lose
their face and impoverish their lives the soundest wisest course
is moderation one should neither do too much nor too
little of anything for example eating sleeping or bathing acting
wisely consists of walking a middle path between these two
extremes end quote this is sound familiar does this sound
like maybe the Buddhist middle way that's exactly right Aristotle
also talked about the the golden mean he talked about
how to be a good human person human being you
need to find the balance between being too kind or
too too mean-spirited you got to find the middle point
between those two or you got to be um find
them at the balance point between being too rash or
being too fearful if you're too fearful then you're a
coward if you if you're too brave to the point
of being rash and and just like jumping into dangerous
situations that's also problem so you got to find the
middle point between that and so on across the line
with all human qualities next quote immoral conduct causes an
entity to suffer a loss of balance which in turn
causes it to suffer decay disorder randomness and spoilage spoilage
and humans for example typically result in physical or psychological
disease end quote today in America and in Europe and
all around the world materialistic people are suffering from all
sorts of diseases autoimmune conditions dozens of different versions of
them exists thyroid problems fibromyalgia chronic fatigue cancers of various
kinds all throughout the body mental illnesses and dysfunctions from
bipolar to depression to ADHD to schizophrenia anxiety and panic
attacks heart attacks heart disease various kinds of MS and
the list goes on and on and on and on
and on what is this this is not just an
accident this is a byproduct of how you live your
life and right now we're living a very diseased time
where there's a lot of spoilage within humans it of
course starts with the things you put in your mouth
but it doesn't end there it's also about how you
use your body how you use your mind what kind
of information you put in through your eyes and through
your ears into your skull what kind of people you
surround yourself with what kind of community that you're a
part of what kind of activities you engage in and
devote a lot of your focus and attention to what
kind of sauce you have on a habitual regular basis
are they negative toxic thoughts are the thoughts about hurting
others are they thoughts about enemies and people that you
demonize judgments that you make and so forth or are
they positive thoughts loving thoughts so right now we have
a lot of spoilage within our society both individually and
collectively because we're out of touch or how to balance
with our ecology and with ourselves and with Toyota next
quote the new who has characterized education as the art
of strengthening or bringing up of men and the act
of giving wisdom to the face humans are born incomplete
and faceless meaning without character yet they are perfectible through
proper education education aims at perfecting children by developing in
them a wise face and strong humanized heart and fashioning
their character into a well smoked and precious turquoise this
equips them with the means for keeping their balance on
the slippery earth end quote you see this is what
true education is about and I already talked about the
problems in our education system but here's keeping some more
criticism on top of that the point of school and
university should not be to pass tests or to learn
mathematics or English or science but it should be to
give children a face to teach them how to live
life to teach them a proper sense of priority and
perspective to make them wise and strong and give them
a totalized heart and to show them a pathway to
Toyota to teach them how to be decent human beings
not through indoctrination or through dogma not through testing not
through memorization not through mechanical rules but through raising of
their consciousness teaching them how to think for themselves teaching
them how to do metaphysical and epistemic inquiry teaching them
how to connect with their artistic talents and how to
express those teach them how to be authentic how to
be truthful teach them psychology teach them how their mind
works teach them about self-deception teach them about the dangers
of belief systems and ideologies in effect very self-serving Lee
everything I talked about through actualize that art but why
do I talk about these topics and other topics precisely
because the whole foundation of actualized org was me saying
to myself okay what are the most important things in
life that I need to know let me make a
catalog of all of those things which are not being
talked about anywhere else not in school not in most
books not in most magazines not on most TV shows
not on most YouTube channels let me make a catalog
of those the highest human wisdom and let me make
it practical and let me embody it and actually find
techniques actually do the techniques and actually do this stuff
because I can't teach it without doing it and that's
what actualize that already is tada so if you're some
future educator if you really want to change our education
system if you want to be a good teacher a
good professor good guru and this is what you got
to understand this is what you got to work on
help our children to really be educated properly now how
do you do that with essa that's it's a big
problem there's a lot of systemic obstacles in the way
that I can't talk about here but at least now
you're starting to get the idea and if you're one
of those kids who never really liked school found that
it was boring or too technical or that you were
never motivated to learn it's just because the school schooling
was done in the wrong way when you are doing
education properly as we're describing it here you're gonna be
excited about it you're gonna be passionate about you're gonna
want to buy books and go to course and listen
to seminars and and actually try techniques and do this
this is exciting and fascinating stuff this is what it
means to be human this is why you were born
is to be constantly learning every single day the most
important aspects of reality and how to live a good
life but uh I can certainly understand why why many
many kids these days feel very alienated and disillusioned with
our education system because it hardly teaches any of this
stuff but you know what the good news is that
you can teach it to yourself the resources are all
here the books the courses the audios the podcast it's
all there but you have to take responsibility for it
right now our society is not as a stage of
development where it's just spoon fed to you and delivered
to you on a silver platter you have to create
this high-quality education for yourself and that's actually very exciting
so I highly recommend that you commit to educating yourself
whether you're young whether you're still in high school or
whether you're older and you're past your college years and
you think that you're done with education no education has
barely begun for you next quote in his or her
capacity as educator moralist and role model that is as
the teacher of people's faces the sage is akin to
an artist who skillfully shapes a formless block of stone
into a beautiful statue the sage shapes a child's faceless
lump of human flesh into a genuinely human face at
heart end quote so that's what we're doing here every
time you're listening to me that's what I'm trying to
do to you and how good I am at doing
that directly depends on how closely I am connected to
Toyota the closer I develop my connections they yodel the
better I get at shaping you into somebody who is
closer to yodel and the more you do the practices
the closer you get to Toyota the better this whole
process works tah-dah next quote to possess a perfected wise
face and good heart is to exhibit sound judgment and
sentiment one psychological intellectual and physical behavior promotes balance and
purity and averts imbalance and impurity the person with a
good heart humane and stout is wise in the ways
of total the person lacking such heart has an enshrouded
heart he is mad foolish and dull-witted end quote I
think that's self-explanatory next quote living wisely also requires performing
ritual activities devoted to restoring lost balance and purity or
to averting future imbalance and impurity such activities include penitence
mortification end quote strengthening one's heart and quote and there
is a large roster of various kinds of spiritual techniques
that have been invented by all the various traditions for
how to restore balance and purity into your life so
if you're addicted to drugs or you're stuck in a
rut you're lazy you're addicted to pornography you're depressed you're
miserable so if you're stuck like this in life what
you need is you need to straighten out your heart
you need to find some kind of process for doing
that whether it's going to rehab center or doing some
five Meo DMT - rudely awakened you or going and
living in the forest you know in a cabin all
by yourself for a month or doing a long meditation
retreat or taking it upon a retreat or changing where
you live moving to a different City moving to a
different country you know whatever it is cultures all across
time have had ritual techniques for how to straighten out
one's heart and get back on the straight and narrow
path towards Toyota and of course in modern times we
have gotten disconnected from many of these ritualized techniques we
don't really have them in in many modern cultures they're
considered antiquated but also of course many of them are
antiquated you know like sacrificing a chicken or a pig
the way they used to do thousands of years ago
may not be appropriate today so we need to develop
new rituals and new techniques for how to straighten one's
heart and of course different problems of the heart require
different straightening methods so if you're addicted to drugs you
might need one method if you're addicted to porn you
might need another method if you're addicted to TV you
might need another method next quote that which is aesthetically
valuable or beautiful is also a morally valuable and epistemologically
valuable and conversely it is the well-rooted well-balanced true disclosing
and pure that which is aesthetically valueless or ugly is
disordered duplicitous perverse unbalanced impure and deceptive since unrooted on
disclosing inauthentic and false encode so I already mentioned this
with regards to art how important this is to art
your art can't be duplicitous and perverse and unbalanced or
impure otherwise it's not going to be considered good art
and you're not going to be proud of it when
you create art that you're proud of it's well rooted
well balanced true disclosing and pure please notice that it's
also loving and it elevates the consciousness of mankind please
notice that but I want to extend this a little
bit further than just art those of you who are
into business I want you to think of your business
on these terms ask yourself is your business or if
you don't run a business is the business you participate
in as part of your job or your career so
for example if you work at McDonald's or Starbucks I
want you to ask yourself is the work that you're
doing for this company is the work that your business
doing is it well rooted well balanced true and disclosing
of total or is it disorder disordered duplicitous perverse unbalanced
impure deceptive and unrooted inauthentic and false does it spread
illusion or does it spread truth it's not easy to
create a job or a career or a business that
is aligned with Toyota it's hard enough to start a
business as it is but to start one that is
aligned with Toyota that's a tall order to fill that
takes a lot of work took me a lot of
thinking and strategizing to figure out how to do that
I talked about that in my life purpose course if
you own a business or whatever job or career you
have you need to figure out a way to align
it with Toyota next quote the who is esthetic views
creative activity and its products in the following terms first
creative activity and its products are aesthetically valuable if and
only if they genuinely present and truly disclosed Toyota secondly
creative activity in its products are aesthetically valuable if and
only if they contribute positively to the existing store of
balance and purity in the cosmos works of art accomplished
this by faithfully presenting and hence actually embodying balance and
purity that is by literally being well balanced and pure
third aesthetically valuable creative activity in products must spring forth
from a morally and epistemologically qualified Toyota lized heart and
hence Bergeon from and be well rooted in Toyota end
quote so this is exactly what I was just talking
about but see the problem with most modern art and
business is that the people who are creating this business
do not have a t own alized heart they're disconnected
from Toyota land so the business that they do is
illusion untruth and devilry and same for their art and
it's harmful its of balance and out of harmony with
the environment and with humanity and that's why we see
a lot of ecological collapse we see the coral reefs
collapsing we see insect populations collapsing we see rainforests being
stripped and mined and logged and on and on and
on it goes we see fracking we see wars fought
over oil around the world leading to deaths of hundreds
of thousands of civilians displacing millions of people creating refugee
crises immigration problems you see how it's all interconnected and
where does it all come from because the people in
charge do not have a tea or alized heart and
that's why spiral dynamics stage Orange is so dangerous that's
why secularism and atheism and materialism and scientism and Technology
ISM is so dangerous when you think that you can
just build a great society purely through technology and rationality
that's extremely dangerous actually that will lead to the deaths
of millions of people because the people who are doing
that are obviously disconnected from total because they denied a
yodel it's a serious pathology moving on quote the accomplished
artist is necessarily morally upright and knowledgeable of total fools
and rogues are incapable of creating beautiful works of art
end quote and finally quote a life wisely lived offers
humans of fleeting momentary repose from the inevitable sorrow suffering
and transience of earthly existence it enabled humans if only
momentarily to flower and sing end quote does this strike
you as a parallel with for example Buddhism where Buddhism
teaches that life is suffering material existence is suffering that's
because it is and this has been recognized by spiritual
traditions since the dawn of time on every continent around
the world and so the solution to this suffering and
sorrow and to the impermanence of material existence is to
connect yourself with the one permanent true thing that there
is which is total or your own true self and
if you are able to do that then you can
live the rest of your life beautifully nobly flower and
song see and so you don't want to put off
discovering Toyota for late and too late into your life
you want to discover to yodel now so that your
life can flower and sing and so that you can
minimize your own suffering and of course the suffering that
you inflict on others because the suffering you inflict on
others is roughly proportional to how much you suffer and
how disconnected you are from Toyota so there you go
I've read to you everything that I want to read
in conclusion a few points first of all go check
out the whole article I recommend reading it over a
couple of times there's so much there when I was
reading it I was highlighting and underlining pretty much all
of it I'll post a link down below or you
can go check it out it's really worthwhile to read
it for yourself it's sort of like a grounding spiritual
texts and it gives you a very nice overarching encapsulation
of everything we're doing here it gives you the really
big picture of what you're supposed to be doing in
life this is it just follow this blueprint it's very
general it's very abstract but just follow this blueprint and
you'll have an amazing life this is it don't try
to reinvent the wheel humans have tried sex and marriage
and families and and money and business we've tried all
this stuff and we know it doesn't work this is
the only thing that really works because you need to
connect yourself with your own true nature and your own
true nature is Toyota you are Toyota how can you
be satisfied in life even if you have lots of
money and sex and everything else how can you ever
be satisfied when you are fundamentally disconnected from your own
true source and nature it's not possible which is why
everything you tried doesn't really work and doesn't alleviate your
suffering you've just been given here in this episode the
keys to life this is the master blueprint I don't
know what more you could want this is the blueprint
for how to become a sage for how to become
a visionary leader and incredible human being now it's up
to you to actually go and to actualize it and
to find the concrete steps that need to be taken
the techniques and so forth to make it happen which
of course I share with you through all the other
videos that I had released also I want you to
appreciate what True Religion is I want you to really
understand what religion is here I've basically been describing Aztec
religion but it's no different than Christianity or Islam or
Buddhism or Hinduism or Judaism or Jainism or anything else
the principles are all fundamentally the same as long as
you don't get caught up on the technicalities of bickering
back and forth about who's right or what commandment to
follow you have to you have to you have to
be able to see the essence extract the essence out
of the religion whatever it is Christianity or Islam or
Buddhism extract the essence from it and ditch the the
rest ditch the Bible ditch the Quran ditch the books
ditch the scriptures you don't need that what you need
is you need the high level ideas and then you
need two techniques to embody that and if you're a
materialist or an atheist then I want you to really
think hard and really contemplate this question of what is
religion and why does it exist it's very important that
you have a proper understanding of what religion is and
why it exists and this silly answer that many materialists
are atheist give that religion is just some childish superstition
mumbo-jumbo of the ancient past which is no longer relevant
today that's not gonna fly that's complete horseshit you're not
appreciating what religion is offering you're not seeing the commonalities
between all the religions and you're not really appreciating how
significant it is that billions of people in the world
across all of human eras and across all continents have
had spirituality and religion as a central pillar in their
lives now granted a lot of it was dogmatic Orthodox
tribalistic ethnocentric religion and I'm no fan of that but
there's something there that you're missing some kernel of truth
that you're missing what is that find that and then
pursue that and that will lead you to the best
life that you can live all right that's it I'm
done here please click that like button for me and
come check out actualize that work that's my website right
there you will find resources to help you on your
journey like my blog where i share exclusive insights and
even sometimes exclusive videos I also have the book list
with resources there for you to read I have the
life purpose course which helps you to get your career
aligned with Toyota a career based on your heart and
then the the forum check out the actualized forum where
you can talk about this stuff in conclusion I'll just
say that I want you to appreciate that there's value
to reading what we call scriptures what I was reading
here for you today we might call one of these
scriptures it could be written by a Buddhist or by
Muslim or by a Christian or by just some academic
some philosopher but these are like grounding texts which gives
you insights and wisdom into how to live your life
and what you're supposed to be doing don't take those
granted the more of these scriptures you read the more
you will be able to triangulate what wisdom is and
what the truth is they will all kind of converge
and start to point you towards something which of course
will be total but also all the ancillary stuff that
comes along with total various techniques and practices and minor
truths so reading these scriptures is important cuz otherwise what
you might become as the Zen devil there is valuable
wisdom contained within ancient traditions and this valuable wisdom was
hard-won lots of blood was spilt hmm lots of people
became deluded and fell into various kinds of traps in
order for us to learn this wisdom so do learn
from the Scriptures but also at the same time don't
don't become too exclusive about them don't start to get
all favorite play favorites with various scriptures that there are
just like be willing to study various scriptures and connect
things and be integral in how you study the scriptures
don't just stick to your own school or tradition and
what you'll find is you'll find a that it's much
much more rewarding and that it reveals many more traps
to you than you would have discovered if you only
stayed within your little narrow school or tradition and that
will help you to avoid becoming a Zen devil you
