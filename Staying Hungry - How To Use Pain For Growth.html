hey this is Leo for actualize org and in this
video I'm coming at you from the city of Toronto
Canada as you can see behind me right there we've
got the CN tower we've got the whole city back
there but in this video what I really want to
talk about is I want to talk about the idea
of staying hungry and how it's important to remind yourself
of where you came from especially if you already got
a good amount of success in your life right now
alright so let's talk about how to stay hungry so
a little bit of backstory here I'm in Toronto right
now and the reason that I'm here is not Pro
vacation it's cold it's Whitney literally my fingers are feeling
like they're about to freeze off it's still pretty much
winter here it's bleep the reason I'm here is for
a legal case that I've been trying to battle now
for two and a half years we're an old client
of ours from a previous business owes me and my
partner 23 thousand dollars not only that but finally I
come out here to argue the case and my lawyer
ditches me so I'm without a lawyer I have to
argue the case myself not only that but the the
guy who didn't pay us he owns twenty two thousand
off cash on goods that we delivered so not only
that but he's countersuing us with a bogus claim fifty
five thousand dollars because that's the most convenient way for
him to escape paying us anything so so I'm on
the line 55 grand beyond the money that I'm already
being owed and on top of that I was here
and I'm driving a rental car and I park it
at night at the hotel and in the morning some
thus crashes the sketches the side of the car and
I can't even can't mine them what how we did
it but card scratches now to pay for it so
kinda had a brutal miserable day last night yesterday all
of yesterday I spent inside a court room for eight
hours arguing a case by myself no lawyer just arguing
it I said 30 hours straight preparing for it its
sleep basically that whole day and the day before it
I just argued my ass off argued for my life
um I have some I have I stub fears and
emotional triggers around money right still have fears around that
from childhood and so when I when I'm on the
line 55 grand for me that's that's something I perceive
as a life-and-death situation and I really I was pumped
full of adrenaline yesterday I was really operating on a
survival kind of killer instinct type of mode it was
a do or die to the situation at least I
perceived it that way and I was very very emotionally
triggered I haven't been this emotionally triggered probably in five
or ten years I would say this was literally one
of the toughest most brutal days of my life emotionally
and it kind of brought me back home it brought
me back home and it triggered some memories of where
I came from in the sense that you know emotionally
where I came from internally my mind sets where those
came from because I can vividly remember back to two
times in high school in college when I was studying
my ass off trying to be a good student and
how much emotional labor went into that or at the
end of college when I lost 65 pounds in six
months how emotionally taxing that situation was and how much
of a kind of do-or-die vent ality I had to
apply there to get the result I wanted same thing
for the business that I started first business that I
started was also a do or die have a situation
where literally I was going to either succeed I was
going to be homeless so is that kind of a
that kind of decision and and then after that getting
into the dating scene getting that pickup scene studying sexuality
and female psychology like for me that was also do-or-die
of a situation it might sound funny to you just
to hear that but literally for me it was like
that because I was so bad with women I was
so bad and that literally for me was it was
going to be die miserable and lonely or like put
massive massive massive attention and effort on this problem in
your life and fix it and then maybe you could
have a chance there's a chance to even be kind
of at a normal level in the in the dating
relationship area of your life so for me that was
that was a very serious type of thing so so
having done all those you know I kind of forgot
and I've kind of started to get into a little
bit of a rut a little sense of complacency started
building up within me and I didn't notice that until
yesterday when this thing came and just kind of like
BAM like it punch me in the face and I
felt it I felt what it was like to be
fighting for your life that's what I literally felt and
I also felt that I could empathize a little bit
better with some of you guys because I know so
you guys are already fairly successful already have good jobs
already have good relationships already have good fitness levels good
inner development of your mind in your psychology but some
of you are our ad zro quite frankly some of
your lies are some of your lives some areas within
your lies or maybe your finances are or your relationships
are or you have no really promising career or business
opportunities for you you know maybe you're emotionally unstable maybe
you're depressed maybe you're miserable maybe you're anxious maybe you're
having panic attacks whatever that is I consider that kind
of being at level at level zero you know a
ground level and then you have to kind of work
your way up and so I can I can empathize
with you a little bit easier now I mean I
could in the past but it's just that I've forgotten
that and that's literally what happens that when you get
more successful you get more and more successful than what
sorts of habit is you start to kind of coast
it's just a coach on that success that initial killer
instinct that you had that got you to your present
level of success what happens is that that killers and
kind of starts to shut off because that's like a
survival mechanism it's like I'll you know a lion jumps
out in front of you as you're walking through the
through the jungle well sure you're gonna get all fired
up or you're going to start to act immediately you're
not even gonna think twice you gonna start to run
it and start a fight it's that flight-or-fight response well
you can't keep that up all the time right so
what happens is that slowly you kind of get accustomed
to it accustomed to an accustomed to it and then
you start to get into a run and any kind
of dreams or goals that you had up there you
know just kind of forget about them to kind of
dissipate or you kind of sort of think ah I
don't really need that anymore I'm kind of comfortable where
I am and you get into this rut and being
in this rut you know it can be nice you
just kind of get comfortable but it also keeps you
from getting to that true high level of success that
level of self-actualization that you want to get to taking
there take something more right you have to have more
vision you have to start to motivate yourself in creative
ways you can't just always look at yourself by negative
pressure negative pressure negative forces survival instincts that's not going
to be enough to get you to your ultimate level
of potential to do that really you need those loftier
goals you need be working towards something bigger for me
personally now what that is it's not really money it's
not sex it's not food it's not a you know
a better house or a nicer car it's none of
that it's really impact for me that's impact is the
impact that I'm having on you guys it's the impact
that I'm having on everybody that I interact with with
the information I'm delivering right this is my purpose is
what I'm doing so for me that's very important and
to me what I'm doing now is I'm starting to
notice that I need to I need to start to
take this and I need to make it like a
base need in my mind I need to kind of
trick myself and say okay this idea impacting people to
me it should be as important as breathing air you
should be as important as the need for water and
for food and for sex right it needs to be
one of those kind of more baser levels because what
I'm noticing is that for the last year I've been
pursuing these lofty ideals these lofty values the problem is
that I still get complacent on a day-to-day level and
sometimes I get lazy sometimes I don't want to work
that hard and honestly you know I'm not working as
hard as I used to how hard I'm hurt out
of college how hard I work to start my business
like literally I work so many hours are so hard
I'm not doing that anymore it's hard for me to
motivate myself to do that I'm working smarter now so
in many ways I'm more efficient but uh but still
there's something about having that kind of a that kind
of raw Drive that raw determination to just go out
there like work through a problem no matter what and
that can be a very very powerful force a lot
of times what happens is that people lose that force
once they reach a moderate level of success maybe that's
you maybe that is where you're going to stuck at
and that's the reason that you are feeling frustrated and
the reason that you're feeling unmotivated is because you're stuck
in a rut and with this half we like to
define that well you know what are two things can
knock you out of it so I say that most
people get stuck in a trundle stuff stay stuck in
there for a very long time and maybe the rest
of their lives a certain other percentage of people it'll
happen is they'll get stuck in that rut but that
an external circumstance will come in will knock them out
knock them out of that rut so this has to
be something jarring it's something emotionally triggering right for me
for example it's this this case this legal case so
it was very jarring for me kind of again enough
contrast in my life that I can see like whoa
that's what it used to be like that's what it
used to be like to have that kind of hunger
for life okay awesome so that was a does a
great reminder but you know for you it might not
be a legal case for you it might be the
breakup of a relationship or it might be you know
just kind of finally looking at yourself in the mirror
one day and saying enough enough is enough and like
you start to see that you're disgusted with your body
if you start taking teen parents for losing waste when
going to the gym maybe that kind of thing maybe
it's a sort of rude comment that someone makes at
you but you know it's one of those comments that's
lewd but also true at the same time and it
starts to like get you to really see yourself in
a new light maybe it's the collapse of a business
that you've got maybe it's some bad luck that you
get you know maybe you lose you lose your car
maybe someone you know steals a bunch of money from
you it's not like that happens I didn't see it
sort of like reevaluate your life and you're just gonna
like forced into it or maybe a death in the
family maybe someone near to you dies that's always a
very very powerful external influence that can get you to
rethink your life and to subjugate you out of the
run get some of that thirst for life back again
right because you start to see that wow life is
short and I've been worrying about a lot of patiently
petty that's not going to be remembered by anyone after
a bed I'm not going to build any kind of
legacy I'm not helping any with the sphere that I've
got so why don't you why don't I just like
forget that for a second and just like focus on
something that's actually important but something that's bigger than me
about that so so I tend to see that you
know one of these external services can come and kind
of knock you out of place and those can be
good a lot of times we think that those are
really bad like for example if you asked me yesterday
I would've told you that this is horrible what I'm
going through is literally one of the most brutal days
of my life but but you know now I look
back at and like yeah that was actually uh that
was actually an awesome growth opportunity I really grew myself
a lot by having to to go through through that
whole ordeal and and then of course the the final
point is that you know sometimes an external circumstance won't
come along now if it doesn't come along then you're
probably going to just stay in that rut but of
course you can't take conscious control and that's kind of
what I'm doing now is that I've had this external
circumstance come in but I'm also going to now start
taking external control more I could myself to that you
know take take conscious control of this situation and so
what does that mean well I think that that means
taking some bold action you know it's not enough to
take a little baby step sometimes that's good that's generally
how I do personal velopment through baby steps but sometimes
you also need to take a bold step up in
order to get higher sometimes you just think that like
bust through the wall make support a big bold radical
decision to bust you out of a rut when you
know that you're in a rut what could that be
well it might mean moving out of the country living
in a new country just out of the blue maybe
moving to a new city a new state kind of
change your environment totally change your environment maybe it might
mean getting out of a relationship breaking up a relationship
maybe getting a divorce if that's what's right for you
maybe my mean finally dropping that business that you know
is it isn't what you really want to be doing
maybe it's time to quit that lame job that you're
frustrated with that's keeping you down maybe it's time to
even quick a very successful job that you've got which
is taking up all your time and keeping you from
from your dream projects so you know there's there's a
whole list of these kind of bold actions that you
can take now I'm not saying that you should be
frivolous and stupid and just go ahead and quit your
job tomorrow ah no I'm saying that you have to
do this in a very intelligent well planned out a
strategic sort of way but ultimately if you've been in
a rut and you notice that you've been in a
rut for a year or more I would say a
year or more maybe five years you know if you've
been in a rut for a long time and you
know that you're not going to change just by yourself
you know that you need some sort of external stimulus
to come like put you out of it pull you
out or you need someone to help you or you
need to basically put yourself in a situation where you're
not going to be able to improve the property loan
well then maybe you should consider doing that you know
because it's really nice to have that thirst thirsty life
again and sure it's top it's not always a pleasant
in the moment to be kind of fighting for your
life but wow it's also it's also it's also very
lane to be stuck in that rut to write very
very lame to be stuck in that rut and I
think right now the best situation or the best solution
is to go out there and have the loftier goals
for after the Lochner values but then infuse into that
sort of killer instinct that you had from the past
right I think that's the ultimate ideal situation that's personally
what I'm going to try to create for myself right
now I'm feeling extra pumped up in that case extra
pumped often still have not gotten the verdict from that
argued my ass off even the the opposing counsel came
up to me the other trial and said how how
impress you us by how hard I argue that case
even the guy that I was suing II was at
the trial he's witness he came out to me at
the end and he said how how impressed he was
how hard I argued that case and there were even
like legal students uh that were taking some notes they
were just like students that were studying laws and you
were just taking notes and observing the trial and they
told me the same thing that they were surprised at
how well I argue that and that I wasn't a
lawyer myself so I guess you know what I learned
from that is in other videos ultimately it's this it's
this feeling you know it's the feeling of people a
contract really fighting for something not just in a kind
of a slow-paced sort of way but you know like
ah like do-or-die sort of way that can be really
powerful so see if you can create that kind of
scenario in your life and if you're in that scenario
right now already not of your own choice because you're
stuck in the mud and your life is then you
know what um I've been there I've just been there
yesterday I've been there many times before in my life
and just kind of you have to push through you
have to push through and trust that there's gonna be
something bigger for you I know I know now how
painful it is I remember very vividly how painful it
is just because I went through an experience like that
