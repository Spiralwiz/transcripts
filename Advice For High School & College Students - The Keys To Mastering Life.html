hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
episode I want to give some real-world advice for high
school and college students this right here is going to
be your game plan for mastering life as I study
the principles of psychology self-help and success and as I've
been doing this for the last five or ten years
I've been keeping a running list of all the most
important principles that I wish I knew when I was
younger when I was back in high school or in
college or even in middle school like what kind of
habits could I've established what kind of things do I
wish my parents and my teachers told me what kind
of things do I wish I actually did that would
have set the entire foundation for my future and so
I've been keeping this list in my back of my
mind and now I want to share some of that
with you this is the advice I wish I got
let me lay out the stakes for you if you're
in high school in your college this right now is
your only opportunity really to build a solid foundation for
creating an amazing fulfilling life right now you've got about
eight years four years in high school and four years
in college and chances are you've already pissed away some
number of those years into doing stupid stuff now you've
got less than eight years left what's going to happen
after that is you're going to get kicked out of
your family kicked out of the nest you got to
go into the workforce and you're gonna be working eight
hours a day and you're going to be commuting a
couple hours a day probably to work so it's going
to be ten hours right there every single weekday that
you're going to be putting into work and you're not
going to have any more energy or time left over
from then on to work on yourself to develop yourself
to lay a foundation for yourself not only that but
you're going to waste those initial eight years that you
had you're going to waste all that and you're going
to lose a lot of growth that you should have
gotten think of it this way have you ever seen
a graph of exponential results for example if people are
investing money in the stock market and they invest a
thousand dollars and then they get a twelve percent return
on that thousand dollars per year and that interest compounds
right because it grows and then the interest grows and
then that interest grows and just compounds every single year
what you see is you see an exponential growth curve
which looks like this it starts off very flat for
the first ten years then it starts to rise rise
and by year twenty or thirty it shoots straight up
like this that's an exponential growth curve that's what your
result in life will look like if you invest in
yourself early and if you don't invest in yourself then
your result in life will basically look like this it'll
be just a very flat shallow curve like this and
it'll never go anywhere high why is that because to
get the exponential results you need to invest especially through
the early phases those first 10 or 20 years you
have to sit there and invest invest invest and not
really see huge returns then all the huge returns come
most people in life they die or they retire before
they see all the huge results why is that because
when they were in high school and in college they
pissed away all their time they didn't build a great
foundation and so they never experienced what's possible to experience
in life they never experienced that high level of satisfaction
fulfillment of being on a sense of mission in life
of having a life purpose of living their passions of
having incredible career of building a lot of wealth for
themselves of mastering relationships none of this stuff is available
to them because they're stuck in a dead-end job working
9:00 to 5:00 and they're too tired at the end
of the day to do anything about it so you
have the potential to gain lot and you have the
potential also to lose everything that you could gain in
the sense that you'll gain it if you put in
the work right now to build your foundation and you'll
lose it if you slack off and you're lazy and
you don't think about your future then you will not
gain all this stuff and in fact your life will
probably go downwards not upwards because you can't experience negative
growth in life that's actually what happens with many people
is that not only are they stuck but they get
more miserable more angry more depressed more of a victim
as life goes on because they start to really see
like oh man I wasted my youth and all the
energy I had and all the free time I had
I wasted all that on partying and drinking and other
stupid things I'd invest it properly and now I feel
like a victim and now I feel like I can't
turn it around so those are the stakes the stakes
are pretty high now let me give you a list
of some of my best advices pieces of advice for
how to build a really strong foundation right now if
you're ambitious and you want to get far in life
and you want to really work on your foundation this
is what you need to do perhaps the most important
thing is you need to find your life purpose as
soon as possible life purpose is what is going to
be your field of mastery life how do you want
to impact the world what are you most passionate about
how do you create a career out of your top
passion in life if you can figure that out and
become definite about it be crystal clear about it then
that's going to focus all of your energy into that
and you're going to become a master an expert in
that and from this will come a lot of your
financial success from this also will come a lot of
fulfillment and a lot of satisfaction because fulfillment comes from
being good at something you're not going to be fulfilled
at life by just dabbling in a bunch of little
stupid things we're working a job that you're not really
excited about you need to position yourself as an artist
in life what's your art form you got to find
what that is people who find this when they're six
years old or ten years old they have an exponentially
better advantage in life competitive advantage then those that find
their life purpose only in their 30s or in their
40s so find it as early as possible do whatever
it takes go experiment with your passions right now you're
young you're not sure what your passions really are you
don't really understand yourself so start doing the exploration process
if you have some nascent passions you know some passions
that are still kind of like just starting to bud
go and nurture those and just see where they take
you if you're interested in art go do some art
if you're some music go play some music if you're
interested in starting a business go maybe try starting a
business and just see where that takes you you might
discover like oh I really love this or no you
know I thought I loved it but I actually kind
of hate it and those are very valuable insights for
you to have but as you're exploring around always keep
your eye out for the choice you've got to make
a choice you got to make a commitment and a
decision as to what your life is going to be
about what are you going to be mastering is it
art is it music is it business is it Human
Resources is that accounting is it math is it science
is it history what's it going to be for you
and that's a little challenging of a topic to talk
about there's a lot that needs to be discussed to
help you find your life purpose in fact I created
a whole course 25 hour course on how to find
your life purpose so if you're just in that you
might want to check that out but I'll keep going
with other points so one of the things you got
to do is you got to explore a variety of
experiences right because before you can go very deep on
one subject you kind of want to get a lay
out of the landscape and just kind of see what
does life even offer think of life as a giant
buffet with hundreds of dishes that you could sample well
you want to go around and sample a bunch of
those so that you have a sense of like oh
yeah I kind of know what's out there know what
the menu is like then you can be more firm
then you can go deep on that one thing that
you really do like when you find it so you
have certain authentic interests maybe something in you is kind
of pulling you in direction of music or in the
direction of art or maybe you like traveling or maybe
you have a fascination with dinosaurs or maybe of a
fascination with mathematics and numbers or computer programming or whatever
you know your mind is kind of pulling you in
one of these directions so honor that go explore your
authentic interests and just kind of see where it takes
you right and try to get you your parents to
support you in that so if you need some some
money or you need to go take a you know
class buy a book it's kind of stuff try to
get your parents to see that this is important for
you to go explore this stuff alright next point is
don't be afraid to break off on your own a
lot of times we grow up and we don't really
know how life works and we don't know how business
works and we don't know how careers work when we're
still young and so we just kind of take whatever
we saw around us in our family life like what
our parents were doing or what our friends were doing
and we kind of assume that we're going to go
down that same track so for example maybe your parent
works in a corporate job and so you think like
yeah well I'll get out of college I'll get my
degree I'll work in some corporation and then I'll climb
the ladder then I'll get a nice position and then
I'll get a good retirement fund going and and then
start my own family and this kind of like the
track that you have set for yourself here's the thing
working in a corporate job is miserable it's soul draining
work it sucks all the passion and joy out of
you generally speaking now I mean there could be some
good corporate jobs but generally P is speaking people don't
like staying in those jobs even people who do well
and they start earning a six-figure salary and they get
some nice benefits and stuff usually what happens that they
leave nobody likes staying in a giant corporation most people
leave they go off on their own they won't start
their own business find their own niche in life build
their own brand build their own celebrity status you know
get their own operation going now everyone is entrepreneurial some
people like working at a salary position that's fine but
I encourage you to once you find your life purpose
also open yourself up to unique possibilities you don't have
to be working in a corporate job if you don't
want to the marketplace these days is so diverse you
could have your own online business you can have your
own brick-and-mortar business you could be a consultant you can
be a professional speaker I mean there's you could be
a writer there's there's so many unique niches in life
that you can find you have to go out there
kind of like a look and see what's out there
there's a lot more out there than just corporate America
a lot more and in fact a lot of it
is much more satisfying than corporate America so leave yourself
open to these uh possibilities for something very unique maybe
what you want to do is you want to move
to the Philippines and you want to start your own
online business and you know sit on the beach sipping
a piña colada and go go partying at night while
during the daytime you know you work on your online
business from your laptop maybe that's the kind of lifestyle
that you want instead of being stuck in a corporate
job where you have to work 12 hours a day
consider that consider what you want your lifestyle to be
like what do you want your lifestyle to be and
I'm not saying that you just want to choose the
most cushy lifestyle possible you know yeah of course it
sounds nice to be sitting on a beach sipping a
piña colada that's a bit of a fantasy but kind
of like pick you know if you are going to
be working and you're gonna be working hard I don't
encourage you that you try to come up with a
dream lifestyle where you don't don't do any work or
you work like four hours a week or something plan
on working 40 hours a week but think about how
do you want your work to actually play out you
want to be sitting on a computer you want to
be answering emails you want to be going to corporate
meetings what do you want to be doing think about
that the next point is you got to build a
strong work ethic while you're young one of the things
I regret the most is that I didn't really build
a strong work ethic the way I could have when
I was younger and now I kind of suffer for
it even today when you're young your mind is still
very malleable and so habits you install when you're young
they tend to stick as you get older it becomes
more and more difficult to build good habits so what
I recommend is since you're in school and you're going
to be studying anyways in order to pass your classes
you might as well use your study ethic to build
your work ethic and that's one thing that I did
do right when I was younger is that I studied
really hard I really valued academics and so because of
that my work ethic wasn't totally shot it's still a
lot better than most people's because I was a really
rigorous student so I recommend the same for you don't
study for grades study for knowledge study for the sake
of studying study because you love to learn about how
life works study because you need to learn how to
study because you're gonna be a lifelong student as you
go off into business as you master whatever field of
life or whatever your passion is gonna be mastering that
area of life so build those habits now read the
books you like whatever they are read a lot of
nonfiction books especially and I'll talk more about that as
we go on right it would be a shame to
waste eight years of high school and college combined slacking
off with studying then getting out of that having a
crappy work ethic and then trying to go become successful
in life you're going to be way behind the ball
if you do it that way the next point is
about relationships and dating I recommend that you get involved
with relationships and learn how to date treat it also
like a learning opportunity go have sex go have safe
sex go experiment around with different partners learn what the
possibilities are within relationships learn also to socialize don't become
a a nerd to the point where you are like
a a Quasimodo living in your dank dungeon it's kind
of like what I did you know I became very
introverted and very reclusive focused only on my studies to
the point I didn't really learn how to socialize didn't
learn how to date in high school and in college
and what that did is again it put me really
behind the curve once I got out into the real
world so you do want to learn these things except
one word of caution about this a lot of teenagers
will waste years of their life and a lot of
their emotional energy will go just completely down the toilet
because what they do is they get caught in one
of these young you know early life romances and they
fall in love with this girl of this boy and
they think that this is the perfect thing and this
is your first time falling in love and so you
think this is the one this is it and what
happens is that you invest all this time and energy
and you sacrifice your schoolwork and you sacrifice your work
ethic and you sacrifice your life purpose and all of
this you bend over backwards for this person and then
what happens it breaks up a year or two later
and you never see that person again and all that
energy you have that you could have been investing in
your foundation that would have been paying dividends for your
hope there the rest of your life is pissed down
the toilet so my advice is don't waste time in
serious relationships when you're this young you should not have
any super serious relationships when you're in high school and
college date around if it's going well have it go
well you know don't sabotage your relationship on purpose I'm
not saying that but I think the ideal is that
when you get out of college you want to have
at least had two or three or maybe five different
partners so that you can see you know what are
the kind of guys that are out there what are
the kind of girls that are out there so that
you can kind of know after you get out of
college like okay now I kind of know you know
I'm going to want to settle down they don't want
to get married or whatever get into a really serious
relationship but now I know I sampled a buffet I
kind of know what's out there what happens to some
people you know if they've only been in one relationship
their whole life and then that relationship breaks apart then
they're really left in the dark because it's like well
I have this one relationship then it broke apart and
now I don't even know you know how to date
how to meet new people how to so because I've
just been stuck in that one thing I just got
lucky when I was really young you don't wanna be
in that situation also what happens and this happens with
guys a lot is they get into a relationship that
they think is great and then they stay in it
for let's say 10 years with their high school sweetheart
and then what happens is that the relationship is still
pretty good but the guy starts getting these doubts like
well what if I could have found a better girl
I don't know you know I haven't even I haven't
even flirted with other girls how do I know that
my girl is the right girl and they have all
these doubts and basically this leads them to to break
the relationship off which is them which is a shame
so you want to get that early experience in alright
so that's my point on relationships next let's talk about
the things that you should not do the following things
no drinking no partying no drugs no frats no cults
and no social groups avoid all this stuff this stuff
is a complete waste of your time it might seem
appealing on the surface but it's all really shallow stuff
it's not really as fun as it sounds it's not
as appealing as it sounds and it's going to waste
thousands of hours and a lot of mental energy is
going to go into these things and what's going to
happen is that all of them are going to kind
of dissipate they're not going to lead anywhere important you're
not really going to invest that time their energy into
a long-term thing that's going to pay you dividends for
the rest of your life this is where most people
in high school and college waste and piss away all
their foundation right they piss it away and they don't
invest it and then they never see the exponential results
so you don't want to get into that place the
next point is sports for some people sports might seem
like a way out of this whole thing you know
like life is difficult I'm going to work hard for
it and I'm gonna learn this stuff but I could
avoid all that if I just master sports what if
I become a Kobe Bryant or somebody else you know
top athlete in the field and become the best in
the world and then I get money and fame and
status and my life is fixed everything is solved well
I Got News for you in fact in reality or
solves nothing does it really solve the problem of life
sports works for about 10 or 20 years when you're
at your physical peak when you're still young once you
get into your late 30s and 40s sports professional sports
even if you're the best in the world it stops
working so it's going to have to happen is that
you have to find a new life purpose now if
sports was your life purpose now you need to find
a new one so it's like you're starting from scratch
it's like you took your bank account and you wiped
it all out 20 years later and now you have
to start investing completely from scratch very bad move not
only that but even if you're really successful in sports
it still won't fix all the things you got to
really learn about life you still need to become a
good student you develop a strong work ethic you still
need to learn about relationship you need to learn about
psychology you still need to cut out certain things here
that are draining you of your potential so all the
advice I'm giving here will still need to be learned
the hard way for you you're not gonna find some
magic shortcut through sports for this in fact it's probably
going to be the opposite even if you make a
bunch of money that money will actually because you're so
immature you don't learn these principles the hard way that
money will actually probably destroy your life and lead you
into a lot of bad decisions and situations the other
point I want to make is about socialization so a
lot of time in high school and in college is
wasted on gossiping socializing worrying about your social status trying
to fit in trying to look cool all this stuff
is a total waste of time completely useless it's not
going to help you in your future you're not investing
this time energy into anything valuable long-term you're just pissing
it away and it's not even making you feel good
so cut out the gossip stop caring about social status
social status is the stupidest shallowest thing there is it
doesn't matter what your ranking is among your social circle
or you know are people posting pictures of you on
Facebook are they saying good things about you on Facebook
it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter focus on your
agenda what do you want to accomplish in life what's
your life purpose focus on that focus on developing your
passions focus on learning focus on studying not on trying
to fit in this is one of the biggest mistakes
young people make trying to fit in too much stop
caring about whether you look cool doesn't matter what your
clothes are or what cars like or your haircut you
have the coolest haircut it doesn't matter this stuff is
going to look laughable to you after you get out
of college you're gonna look back and be like man
why did I waste so much time thinking about this
stuff it was so shallow and stupid try to have
the wisdom to see now that it's shallow and stupid
not ten years later the other thing you should stop
doing is them stop wasting your time playing video games
and watching television now I'm a real authority on this
because in my youth I literally invested probably tens of
thousands of hours playing video games and watching television ah
man nothing robs you of your potential as much as
those two things it takes up so much time just
if I can think about even investing 10 percent of
that time that I wasted into reading books or meditating
or doing some other positive habit I would have been
so much better off now so cut that stuff out
you don't need to like be a Puritan and cut
it out entirely you can still play video games and
watch TV but like just limit limit your exposure to
that by ninety percent you can still get plenty of
video games in just within ten percent but like limit
ninety percent of it cut out ninety percent of it
you don't need that much you don't need to be
spending thousands of hours spend a hundred hours but not
a thousand hours you see the difference all right um
see you need you need time to build your foundation
you need to actually be doing working and you be
thinking and you be reading you need to be building
positive habits that's really what comprise the building of your
foundation when you're young so between school and video games
and watching hundreds of hours of TV you're not going
to have the time to build a foundation so where's
that time going to come from well you don't want
to cut school you want to cut the video games
on the TV the next point is about diet you
need to clean up your diet you're going to be
so glad that you did this that you built this
positive habit early in your life it's much easier for
you to change your eating habits now when you're still
young then it will be when you're in your 30s
and 40s here's what you need to clean up about
your diet all of the following stuff needs to be
cut cut soda sports drinks Pizza potato chips all forms
of alcohol bread and any other refined wheat products candy
other junk food and fruit juices all that stuff cut
it out of your diet immediately and never touch it
again ever in your whole life build that habit this
is going to make you so ridiculously healthy if you
do this also it's going to give you a lot
of energy right now instead of just thinking about how
you're going to feel 40 years down the road and
all the cancer and all the disease you're going to
avoid think about right now you can get some immediate
energy boosts if you cut all this stuff out of
your diet you're going to feel a lot lighter on
your feet you're going to feel a lot less sleepy
sleepy and groggy you're gonna have much sharper mental focus
that you can use to work on your studies and
school and building your foundation right and you're going to
feel good in your body and you're going to build
the positive habits so that later on in your life
you're already gonna have a track record of eating healthy
very important you're going to be so grateful once you
hit your 30s and 40s that you did this now
in your teens the next point is about debt be
very careful about debt that is super dangerous and destroys
many people's potential completely destroys many people's potential no debt
is the policy no debt of any kind buy on
cash get a debit card and use your debit card
do not get credit cards do not be tempted by
those airline miles do not be tempted by all those
cash back rewards programs do not be tempted by all
those special elite card offers that you get from your
bank or in your mailbox all that [ __ ]
is just a scam it's not saving you money it's
making money for the credit card companies that means that
money is going to them it's coming out of your
wallet so be very careful about that I would completely
avoid all credit cards and all forms of loans the
only exception that I'll make is that if you need
a loan in order to pay for your college tuition
then go ahead and get that loan those loans are
usually given by the government they've got a low interest
rate which doesn't even start to add up until you
graduate so those are fine you know if you got
to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and your parents
can't support you with your tuition checks then then you
can get a loan for that and you can pay
that off later with a great career so that's fine
but every other form of debt you should have would
otherwise it will destroy your potential to build wealth in
the future also you need to build proper habits for
managing money and this is one of the most important
money money management skills that you can learn right now
when you're young is to completely say no to debt
the other thing you should understand is that your college
diploma really doesn't mean anything it's not going to be
your ticket anywhere one thing you'll be shocked to learn
after you graduate is that nobody even asks you about
what college you went to what your diploma was they
won't even check your diploma it's quite ridiculous in the
real world in the business world what people care about
is the results that you can generate they will care
about your past real-life experience what kind of results did
you generate in the past that's what they care about
they also care about how you carry yourself they care
about how much emotional intelligence you have they care about
if you're a quick learner they care about if you
have a good work ethic they care about if you
are smart at reasoning if you're sharp on your feet
street smarts that's what they care about so focus on
building that stuff and don't think that your diploma is
going to be like your golden ticket to success in
life because it won't be that's just the foundation now
does this mean you don't need a diploma no I
think a diploma is very important because University teaches you
how to learn if you can learn one thing at
university it's learning how to learn and developing a love
for lifelong learning University like the foundation for all the
learning you're going to do later on in life and
I'll talk a little bit more about that in a
minute here I want to actually give you a list
of the eight most important subjects that you should be
learning and this is stuff that usually they don't teach
you in school or in college but in school in
college you can still learn some good stuff you need
to learn the foundations in the basics make sure you
know science learn physics learn biology learn chemistry that's important
learn philosophy philosophy was very important for me because it
taught me how to reason it also taught me how
to see [ __ ] in other people's logics it
taught me the limits of human lot of human knowledge
which was also very important to understand as you go
forward in life take some psychology classes learn about different
psychological studies that have been done the last hundred years
learn about the history of psychology that's a very important
topic to understand learn about history history is important understand
because history builds judgment history makes you wise make also
makes you worldly so you can talk with other people
intelligently maybe take some nutrition classes learn about nutrition that'll
be good for you sue so those are the things
that you can learn through school in college that's good
but you need to go beyond that and one habit
that I really recommend you start right now starting tomorrow
is the following reading self-help books I want you to
read one self-help book every single month throughout high school
and throughout your college years it's not a lot just
one per month that's not a lot you can handle
that most self-help books are pretty short so all you
need to do is just have a list and in
fact I have a list of some of my favorite
most powerful self-help books on my website and go check
that out actualize that org but this is this is
a huge habit here's why because self-help books have basically
distilled all the principles of success and happiness that human
beings have discovered in the last 2,000 years and especially
the last hundred years there's been so much research done
on how to be successful in business how to be
successful in relationships how to be successful with your happiness
levels how to meditate properly the scientific benefits of meditation
and so on and so forth and self-help books are
not just abstract you know very pedantic type of books
that you might read in college these are very practical
these are written to get you results these self-help books
have exercises in them they have techniques read those start
practicing those if you just read one book per month
for the next let's say eight years that would be
close to a hundred books that would give you the
entire theoretical foundation that you need to master life you
need to know the theory the problem is that schools
and colleges don't teach you the theory of practical real
world success they teach you these hard subjects like science
and math and history and that's great you need to
know that basic stuff but you can't be successful on
on the basics right over the last 2,000 years human
beings have really mastered the principles of success you don't
want to reinvent the wheel by making a bunch of
mistakes in your own life learn from the mistakes of
others so start this habit starting tomorrow by your first
self-help book the next habit you want to have is
a meditation habit of all the things I regret the
most is I regret that I didn't start meditating when
I was six or seven years old if I started
that habit ah man I would be at such a
different place in my life right now I'd be so
much happier so much more fulfilled meditation is the key
to mastering happiness and happiest is different than success you
could read all the self-help books in the world and
become very successful but you still will not be fulfilled
and happy and that's because you haven't practiced meditation so
start tomorrow 20 minutes a day at the very least
make that commitment for the rest of your life you're
going to meditate for 20 minutes every day for the
rest of your life no matter what no sick days
no days off you're never going to miss a day
starting tomorrow that's your mission and then after a year
- I recommend you bump that up to one hour
per day if you really want to supercharge your fulfillment
levels in life how do you meditate I have a
lot of great videos on that so just search for
it and you'll find my videos that show you exactly
how to meditate it's very simple it's very easy all
you got to do is just have the foresight to
see the exponential results that you will get from it
and you will get extraordinary exponential results as your meditation
habit starts to snowball the other point I want to
make is that a lot of young people will waste
their energy and time fighting with parents about all sorts
of stuff your parents probably have ideas for how your
life should run and you probably have your own ideas
and sets of values and that's fine I urge you
though to take control of your life live your life
right now start living it as though you're living on
your own that doesn't mean you go party that means
like be responsible the way you live your life imagine
that your parents didn't pay for you and then do
stuff for you but that you were completely independent how
would you have to live your life then bite off
the challenge of working real hard right now work your
ass off right now to build your foundation that time
that you waste fighting with your parents about your grades
or about not studying or about socializing too much or
playing too much video games all that crap take control
of your life take responsibility start building the foundation when
your parents see that you're doing this and that you're
being hyper responsible and that you're really being a long-term
thinker and that they can see that you've got wisdom
that you're connecting all these different dots in a much
wiser way than they did when they were young they're
gonna look at you and be like oh damn my
kid is amazing my kid is so wise my kid
is putting all this stuff together on his own they
will then give you more trust and more leeway to
live life the way you want to live life so
try not to go against the grain of your parents
try to just kind of focus on yourself focus on
building your life purpose finding your passion to know working
hard when your parents see that your relationships with them
will be smoother and you won't waste so much time
arguing and fighting some teenagers they waste eight years of
their life all of high school and all of college
just bickering with their parents it's nonstop completely wasted the
entire future of their life be curring with parents time
energy down the drain it's really quite sad and the
last thing I want to say is plan on becoming
a lifelong learner do not stop learning after college do
not stop learning after high school there's a lot you
need to learn and the key to all success in
life is learning if you learn the right things and
you learn them early and you spend time thinking about
them then this will allow you to avoid all the
dead ends and pitfalls and traps and tragedy that befalls
almost everybody else you can learn to avoid miserable divorces
you can learn to avoid bankruptcy you can learn to
avoid a depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts you can
learn to avoid regrets in your life and terrible health
when you're older and cancer and miserable relationships you can
avoid all that stuff if you just start learning the
right things so let me give you now the eight
most important subjects that I think you need to be
investing a lot of time and energy learning about by
books on all the following subjects psychology self-help meditation and
enlightenment nutrition and fitness business and marketing dating sexuality and
relationships biographies and money management learn how to properly manage
your money how to invest your money how not to
waste your money learn how economics works you can find
practical books in each one of these categories that will
tell you exactly what to do and what not to
do that will give you specific techniques and I have
a lot of amazing books on my list of 140
top self-help books which is available at actualize that order
that you might want to check out also it might
be very beneficial for you is to check out my
life purpose course nothing will set a stronger foundation than
discovering your life purpose and also learning the principles of
how to live your life purpose effectively this is stuff
that most nobody teaches you even in the sub help
in the self-help field very few self-help people have a
thorough and proper discussion of what life purpose is how
to discover it and how to live it I had
to read through dozens and dozens of books and piece
it all together over the course of a decade to
figure it out which is why I thought it was
so important to create this course so you might want
to check that out if you really want to get
a head start but that's it that's my advice if
you follow these principles then you will set an extremely
strong foundation you will start to get those exponential results
and where your life will be when you're in your
30s and 40s not to even mention your 50s it's
going to be extraordinary you're going to be able to
change the world you're going to be a leader you're
going to be one of the most practically intelligent and
wise and successful human beings out of everybody that you
know and the flavors of happiness that your life will
take on the levels of fulfillment that you'll get of
satisfaction are going to be unimaginable so does it take
some foresight and some wisdom and some hard work it
certainly does there's a cost to this you're not going
to get this for free there's no shortcut here but
if you have the wisdom to see that this is
really going to be valuable for you a little bit
later in life then you'll start working tomorrow right now
