hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to be talking about spiritual enlightenment part
2 where we're going to go deep on understanding the
truth of no self in this video we're continuing on
talking about spiritual alignment if you did not watch my
first video called spiritual alignment you should definitely go and
watch that because that introduces you to a lot of
the fundamental concepts which I won't be going into here
here we're going deeper and deeper and where we left
part one is that we basically were talking about the
truth of no self and we were saying that this
notion that we have in society that there is a
self to a life the self that experiences all of
life that this does not exist that this is in
fact a illusion and that it's possible to extract yourself
out from this illusion and actually then live in the
truth and that this is a very profound shift the
most profound shift that you can have as a human
being this is where the deepest most powerful psychology work
happens is right here and we also said in that
video that you're gonna be doing a empirical investigation to
discover this truth for yourself you're not just going to
go and believe in it so now what I want
to do is I want to help you to actually
start doing the looking and before you can even start
doing the looking you have to start to understand some
basic distinctions so this video is going to be all
about laying the groundwork and some very interesting and fascinating
distinctions is going to go very very deep this is
going to blow your mind some of this stuff so
stick around there's three fundamental questions that we are concerned
with in doing this investigation question number one is Who
am I question number two is what is the truth
and question number three is what is reality or another
word for reality is existence so what is reality what
is existence these are the three most fundamental metaphysical kind
of questions that you could possibly ask and scientists and
philosophers have been asking these questions for thousands of years
and they've been coming up with all sorts of interesting
answers and having all sorts of interesting debates but there's
actually something that's very very profound that many of them
missed which is that their theories and their debates are
not the fact and that in fact it's possible to
answer these questions conclusively through an empirical investigation which many
people assume cannot be done now you might think about
well Leo the question Who am I I know what
that is that's pretty obvious right is it obvious on
this thing here on this body I'm this being I'm
this consciousness well let's take a look at that question
is it really that obvious have you actually sat down
and looked really looked for the answer to that question
or do you just believe what others told you or
do you just have your own opinions about who you
think you should be that turns out to be very
critical distinction what you have right now is you have
a lot of opinions you have a lot of beliefs
and you have a lot of stories that other people
have told you but you have not actually sat down
and looked and the reason you haven't is because you've
assumed and all of us have assumed that all well
it's obvious I mean it's so obvious we wouldn't why
would we even need to sit down and look why
would I waste my time on this but interestingly it
turns out that it's not obvious at all and this
veneer of obviousness is actually hiding something very powerful and
deep and profound the most profound truth that you can
find out as a human being it's hidden under many
many layers of obviousness obvious turns out to be a
smokescreen so let's start to look a little bit deeper
and question some of this obvious news so if we
take your current beliefs that you are the body this
thing standing here talking or sitting on the other on
the other end of the screen that's what conventionally we
consider ourselves so if this is me you got to
wonder okay so let's really think about this so my
hand right this is me too right so my hand
and all this basically everything inside the envelope of the
skin is me okay so that means that what what
happens if I take my hand and I cut off
my fingers am I still me and you think about
your like well I don't really I dunno I mean
yeah I can lose my fingers and people have lost
their fingers they're still themselves nothing really fundamental about me
is going to change if I lose my fingers okay
so um interesting well what if I cut off my
arms and my legs would I still be me and
you think about really hmm well people have actually had
amputations and they still seem to be themselves so I
know I'd still be me if I lost all those
so then the fundamental me that I think that I
am isn't contained within the hands or the legs interesting
okay then you ask yourself well what if I got
a heart transplant and on somebody somebody else's heart went
into my heart what I still be me and you
think about your like mmm yeah actually I would still
probably be me so then you start wondering well what
would have to really change to change the fundamental mean
not the superficial me but the fundamental mean I would
have to change to change that and you say well
I'm the mind I'm inside the head I'm sitting here
behind the eyes my thoughts my mind my mental uh
activities that's what's really mean more so than the interesting
interesting so even right now just through the simple investigation
we've already basically dis identified you with most of your
body commonly you say oh I'm the body but are
you really the body we've already had this identified you
with a lot of the body only the mind now
when we get into the mind we can question even
further so the mind what part of the mind are
you what if we cut part of your brain out
are you still going to be yourself now you might
wonder and say well I'm not quite so sure not
so clear to say if you cut out enough my
brain I probably won't be myself anymore maybe I'll lose
a part of myself interesting but then even inside the
brain and really we're talking about the mind because you
don't know the brain you only know the mind you
know kind of the software components what you know through
your consciousness so now from within your mind you're looking
around and what are you inside your consciousness are you
the thoughts that you're having is that what you say
is you so when you have thoughts about being hungry
when you have thoughts about going to the bathroom when
you have thoughts about your girlfriend or your boyfriend are
those thoughts literally you you probably say mmm no those
things aren't me I'm the one thinking those things interesting
so already we've said that you're not even all of
your thoughts according to your model now you're only certain
types of mental phenomenon maybe you're the one who's behind
the thoughts who's thinking the thoughts who's seeing the thoughts
so to speak are interesting and we can take that
even further back what in your conscious experience is actually
experiencing thoughts who is thinking thoughts the thoughts think other
thoughts or is there some sort of entity that creates
thoughts what is the entity that's creating thoughts are you
a thought at all or are you something totally different
from a thought are you some sort of entity what
are you actually some people say well I'm the soul
on the spirit if you say that then what is
the soul in what is the spirit in here you
have to be very careful because you have a lot
of preconceived notions and beliefs that have been fed to
you by society people telling you what a soul in
a spirit is but the question is remember we're doing
an empirical investigation that means we're using first hand direct
experience we're not taking anyone's word for it what am
i if I look for myself what am I can
I actually see myself can I experience myself am i
my self image so the things I think about myself
for example if I think of myself as a great
husband if I think of myself as a great girlfriend
if I think of myself as a great parent or
a child or a great student or a great business
person is that actually mean what happens if I eliminate
that thought does that mean that some part of me
is lost or do I still remain now I'm saying
and asking all these questions not so that you can
come up with new theories and so that you can
say okay let me start theorizing cool possibilities no what
I'm saying is I'm saying you don't really know who
you are but you believe so firmly that you do
isn't that interesting isn't it interesting that you like to
come up with a bunch of theories about who you
think you might be and you don't really spend a
lot of time actually looking at the evidence of who
you are instead of looking at the evidence you'd much
rather come up with a bunch of theories we've already
got a very rich history of philosophy with theories theories
upon theories upon theories so let's not go that direction
instead let's go the unorthodox direction let's go to the
looking direction where we want to see firsthand from the
inside what the truth is there's a second question so
this is the first question about Who am I the
other question that I pose to you is what is
reality in existence this is a very very fascinating question
and a lot of people get really caught up on
this one too because they also have a lot of
preconceived notions and theories and beliefs and religious dogma about
what existence is and scientific dogma too but if you
really think about it you don't know what existence is
and the model that you presently have existence makes no
sense and here's what I want to show you is
that your current model makes no sense so let's take
the most basic model the scientific model we say that
there was a big bang and then before the big
bang there was supposedly no space there wasn't even a
vacuum because a vacuum is still extended in time and
in space there was no time and no space before
the Big Bang then the Big Bang happened this is
creating the kind of matrix of reality in which we
live this created breadth and depth and with energy and
matter and time and this stuff expanded and currently the
universe is still expanding and in fact the expansion is
accelerating we're not quite sure where it's going to go
maybe it's going to all collapse into a Big Crunch
or maybe it's going to keep expanding forever we're not
quite clear the question though is what is the most
fundamental ultimate existence so if we say that occur entrie
ality came from the Big Bang what was before the
Big Bang was it nothingness or was it something if
it was something what was it if you say it
was nothing that's an interesting consideration most people don't like
to say that it was nothing most people like to
say you can't have something come out of nothing and
so that something had to come out of something else
so where did it come out of well we might
say okay well it really might be that existence came
out of nowhere how do we know that something has
to come out of something else can it be the
case that something comes out of nothing and you might
say well that violates the laws of physics you can't
get energy from nowhere but see it's very interesting because
we only have one example of existence people like to
make assumptions about how existence has to work but notice
that we are operating on only one point of data
which is our own single existence we don't know any
other existences at least I don't I only know one
existence so that means that it's a very problematic to
start making assumptions about how existence came about from being
inside the existence and only knowing one existence it's kind
of like having a single sample point in a scientific
study if you have a single sample point you can't
make any conclusions or predictions or set any trends how
do you know that existence can't come out of nowhere
how do you know that has to come out of
somewhere you say well I look around me and I
see that everything comes out of something else well but
you're inside of existence our question isn't about inside the
existence our question is about existence itself you can think
of existence kinda like a bubble so inside the bubble
sure we have these rules but what are the rules
outside the bubble are they the same rules or are
they different rules now you might say well they're the
same rules how do you know they're the same rules
have you been outside the bubble have you seen other
bubbles or have you always been inside the bubble and
only know what's inside the bubble we can't say we
don't know now someone might say well Leo you know
a better theory instead of saying that existence can out
of nowhere is that he came out of somewhere so
this bubble what if this bubble is inside another bubble
which is inside another bubble inside another bubble and so
there's always something outside of it that is couched in
so what if our universe is kind of analogous to
a molecule in a human body some like you'll thinks
that it's this cool thing and after all a molecule
is actually very big compared to let's say a subatomic
particle molecule is huge it's composed of I don't even
know how many tons and tons of subatomic particles but
relative to the human being the molecule is so tiny
we can't even see it you can't even see it
in a microscope it's so tiny so what if the
universe was like that what if we're like just a
little molecule which is a component of something much much
larger many made constructed out of many many universes could
that be the case well if that's the case then
where did all that come from so let's say that
it's a bubble inside a bubble inside a bubble where
did the biggest bubble come from you're really not answering
the question you're just delaying it for a little bit
you see you haven't answered the question if you say
that the universe is in a bigger bubble then you
haven't accounted for the ultimate truth of existence because then
how did the most outer bubble come into being where
did it come from did it always exist did it
come out of nowhere did it come out of another
bubble now you might say it always existed okay interesting
but we don't know if that's true you might also
say came out of nowhere which is where we're back
to you know something come out of nothing or you
could say that there's an infinite chain of bubbles and
that there's this bubble on top bubble until the bubble
it just goes to infinity that would be pretty pretty
cool and interesting and kind of counterintuitive you might say
well Leo God created the universe God created existence well
that doesn't solve anything because what is where did God
come from now you say well God God existed always
so then basically you're saying that God is the outermost
bubble that always existed so it doesn't really matter if
you have a mystical supernatural explanation like you've got God
or if you say that it was just like you
know mmm physics and all this kind of stuff you
know bubbles which don't include any kind of deities in
it it really doesn't matter what the actual mechanics of
the explanation are because the fundamental part and problem of
this whole thing is that you don't actually explain what
existence is by citing God you explain nothing all you're
saying is that there's a bubble that always existed where
where did this bubble come from God is like a
bubble so where did he come from did he always
exist did he come off out of nowhere or again
is he containing something bigger which would just push the
question back further unless you said that it was an
infinity thing so which of those is it or maybe
it's something that we haven't even thought about here it's
fascinating my point here is that you don't really know
what existence is I want to give you three distinctions
now three distinctions that are very important in our discussion
here and they all are basic different flavors of the
same thing so the first distinction is the one that
was introduced by Immanuel Kant who was a philosopher back
in the was it the 1700s I believe in Europe
and what he said is he was looking at Rene
Descartes he was looking at David Humes work and he
was basically trying to synthesize two different strands in philosophy
one was called rationalism the other one was called empiricism
and basically he came up with this distinction that says
okay look here's how reality is we've got something called
phenomenon which are the sensations of reality the stuff that
we know directly as human beings colors taste sounds this
kind of stuff this is what empiricism talks about empirical
meaning sensory and then we have something called the new
mental world and new bhana are the things that are
behind the sensations behind the phenomenon so I'm actually going
to use an example here with an orange take a
look at this orange and we might say okay so
the phenomenon of the orange is the the roundness of
it and the orange color and also yet the smell
that it has a zesty smell and the taste and
everything else that we can perceive about it now what
is the noumenon the new minute is the stuff that
the orange is actually made of because we don't actually
think that the orange amount of the color orange it's
not actually made up of the the zesty smell it's
made out of something some sort of matter or you
know whatever something we can't see so that's the phenomenon
newman a distinction and what Kant said is that we
can know phenomenon but we can never know newman uh
because how would we access it we also we always
have the layer of perception that we have to go
through it's like a filter so we can never get
to the Newman ah because we have to go through
phenomenon interesting distinction the next distinction is the matter qualia
distinction and this is kind of like a scientific paradigm
which says that things are created of matter or if
you want you could call it energy matter energy these
are like the subatomic particles that make up this this
orange but then there's also the accounting of the orange
phenomenally and that we call qualia qualia is the stuff
that we perceive about the orange so for example we
think that the orange is made up of cells and
those cells are made up of molecules and atoms but
we don't see any of that what we see is
we see the orange color and we have certain smell
to it and it has a certain feel to it
these experiences but these experiences the color orange for example
right now the color orange is not made up of
atoms it's something else it's a perception so this is
the matter perception distinction and one of the very fascinating
questions in philosophy of science and philosophy of mind is
what are qualia made out of our qualia I may
not have matter or not and if not what the
hell are they and then we have the third distinction
which is the inner outer world distinction you might have
heard me talking about this in other videos in other
contexts where I talk about that conventionally we think of
there's the inner world that we have of our feelings
and sensations that our thoughts and our moods and our
emotions and then the outer world of hard physical matter
and energy and physical laws it's kind of like the
inner world the physical laws don't work the physical laws
only work in the outer world and the inner world
is all filled with qualia and the outer world is
filled with matter so all these three are like flavors
of the phenomena Neumann a distinction that Kant was talking
about there turns out to be a very important distinction
and it's important to talk about these because the question
ultimately becomes who do you think you are and the
thing that you think you are where does it exist
does it exist in the outer world or does exist
in the inner world and also which world is more
real is the outer world more dependent on the inner
world or is the inner world more dependent on the
outer world and you might say well leo the inner
world perceptions these are all dependent on matter is that
true though is that really true have you really thought
about that which world is couched in which world it's
not immediately obvious if you think about it I want
you to introduce a further distinction and this is getting
into the real meat of doing spiritual alignment work so
you have to really understand this distinction well to be
able to understand spiritual alignment and this is the concept
of conceptualizations consider three three types of entities one is
the thing as it actually is the Newman ax that
thought was talking about too is the sensations of that
thing and the perceptions of it so if we have
this orange then we've got the actual real orange the
thing that we can't even see that's responsible for all
the sensations so we've got that whatever it is we
don't know it's kind of like a question mark then
of course we have the sensations of the orange the
phenomena of the orange it's here that's kind of one
level higher we have direct access to that and then
we have one level higher what's one level higher one
level higher is concepts concepts is the things we think
about the orange here we have actually the way in
which we usually interact with the orange even the label
orange it's an orange it's an object that's already a
certain attitude that I take towards it that's the human
mind projecting onto the orange certain things certain labels certain
attributes certain opinions that I have about a certain beliefs
certain relationships in which I am with this orange so
the difference between the perceptions and the concept is that
the perceptions are just raw perceptions without any of my
biases or opinions about it the conceptual orange is a
lot of my opinions about it so for example I
might love oranges I might hate oranges I might be
disgusted by this by the side of an orange when
I look at an orange I might have some thoughts
and memories about oranges I might get hungry I might
start to salivate I might want to throw it at
somebody there might be a million different attitudes I'd take
towards this orange I might start dreaming of other oranges
and even interestingly when you take the orange away and
you put it behind your back and you don't see
the orange there at all in your mind you can
still in the orange so right now you're not seeing
the orange I'm not looking at it either behind my
back but we can still imagine the orange imagine it
right now you have a mental picture of the orange
what is that that's a concept you also have a
vocal story in your mind that you're hearing which says
something like I'm thinking of an orange that is an
orange this images of an orange an orange is a
type of fruit so that's where we get into the
really tricky aspects of being a human being is that
we think that we live here or here but actually
we live from this domain over here which is the
domain of concepts and we overlay all these concepts on
top of sensations and then we tell ourselves that all
of this is actually the truth the ultimate question wrong
the noumenon the thing that is the noumenon and this
gets us into a lot of trouble we're talking about
oranges and that's not really pertinent to our psychology the
question though is what are you within this framework when
you think about yourself you the person I'm pointing out
right now you nod your head right now nod your
head yeah you're nodding your head so that thing that
you think you are what is it on this model
it is a concept is it a perception or is
it the actual Newman Ultherapy very objectively self honestly what
you're going to admit is that it's a concept you
as a concept it's not even a perception you think
it's a perception but it's actually a concept overlaid on
a perception with further concepts behind it telling it that
it's not a concept very interesting what are you really
then if you are not a concept and you're not
a perception what would be the real you the new
middle you hmm interesting I've never asked that question before
of myself have I I could come up with a
bunch of theories but how would I really know what
I really am you might say well Leo that's not
possible is not possible to know the best we can
do as con said is we can just know the
phenomenal so sure maybe what you're saying is like there's
some you know deeper part of me the real me
behind the perceptions and I can never know that so
that's just something now we can't speculate let's not speculate
about that stuff let's not be speculative let's just stick
to the stuff that we can touch see smell hear
and think about but what if it was actually possible
actually possible to know the real thing would that be
freaky or what will that blow your mind if that
was actually a fact that you could know yourself well
it is how can this be the case I'll get
to that in a little bit what I want to
do now is I want to tell you about another
very important concept which is what I call the voice
the voice is primarily what makes concepts happen in your
mind what is the voice the voice is the internal
talk and languaging that's happening all the time throughout your
day right now as you're sitting there watching this video
you're talking to yourself you're having opinions you're agreeing with
me you're disagreeing with me you have certain beliefs that
come up certain objections comments criticisms opinions whatever and it's
literally like a little voice inside your head saying stuff
like oh that's a great point that's interesting oh I
never thought about this Oh Noah leo you're wrong and
so the voice talks and talks and talks and talks
and there are two aspects to the voice one is
the words the way it sounds and two is images
so what we're talking about here is thoughts the voice
is responsible for your thoughts the voice is basically your
thoughts and thoughts come in two flavors words and images
images are think about the orange right now you've got
an image of the orange that's a thought say the
word orange in your mind right now that's also a
thought of the orange so there's two different ways in
which you can create a thought and access it and
a lot of times there are both operating at the
same time you might be imagining and thinking about it
at the same time this is what allows concepts to
happen is the voice comes in there and create them
now it's interesting that you've never sat down and really
looked at what the voice actually is you might have
some opinions about what the voice is and why it's
there and who's talking but have you actually sat down
and looked very deeply very objectively at what the voice
actually is who's creating the voice and who's listening to
the voice is the pertinent question see the way it
works is that your voice talks all the time it
talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and
it creates a web of concepts which it then calls
reality and it also creates a self-image the self image
is the image of yourself and ideas about who you
think you are and how you behave so any notions
that you have right now about your nature your true
nature those are all part of your self image and
there's something which is created by voice now the question
is can we break out of this self image if
the self image is all concepts then what is the
actual self when you get rid of the concepts and
get rid of the self image what's the real self
not the M of the self now you might say
well Leo we can't get rid of concepts in fact
concepts are good we don't want to get rid of
concepts well keep your mind open what if concepts are
actually a smokescreen that prevent you from seeing something very
very very real which is the Newman --all you and
now comes the crux of the matter when you say
that you're the body and when you say that you're
the mind and when you say that you're your thoughts
or the one perceiving your thoughts what actually is that
is that a physical fact a physical reality or is
that a conceptual reality the identification you have with your
body and I'm not being literal I'm being very serious
and very I mean I'm not being figured if I'm
being very literal here so when I say identification with
your body that means that when I cut you with
a knife you recoil and you experience pain and emotional
distress why is that because you believe that I'm actually
injuring you I'm not just entering a body I'm injuring
your body I'm injuring you when I tell you a
mean nasty comment like you're stupid and ugly and smelly
and you're never going to get a good relationship then
you take that personally because you identify with being a
certain way you have a certain self-image you want to
be handsome and attractive and sexy and certain other qualities
so you are threatened now the question is what is
being threatened could it actually be the case that the
identification you have with your body is conceptually constructed by
the voice and that as the voice constructs it you
believe it automatically you never question the voice and so
you identify with your body now you say well leo
but I actually am my body you're telling me I'm
not my body sounds like a a far-fetched theory a
philosophy of some kind I am the body look I'm
the body it's real it's a fact what are you
stupid who's saying that is the voice saying this is
the voice telling you that you are your body that
you really think that you're the body that you're fascial
is that real or is that the voice constructing stories
now you might say well leo but the voice why
is the voice false why is not the voice true
you're telling me that my voice is false what a
my voice is true maybe but consider that the voice
can come up with a lot of different concepts that
are not factually true for example think about Santa Claus
Santa Claus is a contract of the voice is Santa
Claus real no think about a horse with two heads
on it got that image is that real or is
that just a story in your mind think about yourself
right now sipping on a pina colada sitting on a
tropical island enjoying the warm Sun you've got that image
what is that is that a concept or is that
reality are you actually sitting on a beach or is
that just a figment of your imagination now those seem
like simple cases of imagination but now the question is
what about you yourself what about your identification with your
body could it be that your identification with your body
and your self-image that these are just as fictional as
you imagining right now that you're sitting on a tropical
beach sipping a piña colada and don't be so quick
to say no because actually it turns out that it
is exactly this and when you start to appreciate and
understand this whoa you get this Wow a moment like
oh well if that's the case then what could be
outside of the voice what could be outside the self-image
what could I actually be if in fact let's just
consider as a hypothetical that the voice could be wrong
and the voice could just be imagining things and that
is the mother of all questions that is the deepest
question you can ask yourself in your life that is
the deepest question to which you can find an answer
in life is to ask yourself what am i outside
of the voice and the answer turns out to be
very very profound and not at all what you expect
I want to go a little bit more about talking
a little bit more about the voice get you a
little better understanding of the voice because this is so
critical to starting to do this work you might wonder
well Leo how does the voice actually construct the self
if you're saying that my sense of self is constructed
by the voice how does this actually happen and it's
actually a very very simple process and I want to
imitate to you right now how the self is constructed
in your own mind I'm going to do a literal
imitation I want to be talking but this talking think
of it as the voice inside your head talking this
is how it talks it says something like this I
am over here this is me I'm leo I'm speaking
right now I'm having thoughts I'm thinking look at this
oh look I'm thinking I'm thinking Leo Leo me yes
me I Here I am I think therefore I am
could this not actually be me but look it's me
how could it not be me I'm really me you
can't deny that this is me I'm thinking who's thinking
this stuff I am this is me I'm leo I'm
hungry I want a better job I want more money
I have these goals I'm afraid of that thing I'm
afraid of this thing I get angry for this reason
I get angry for that reason right now I'm feeling
happy right now I'm feeling sad right now I'm feeling
angry damn it why did that guy tell me that
damn it why can't she just do what I wanted
to do and on and on and on it goes
like that so your whole existence if you start paying
attention to it very carefully is this it's a voice
in your head talking talking talking talking image image image
image image and certain talk and images have the label
I in it and this label I it's just accepted
by you as being you what if it wasn't what
if it was an arbitrary label what if it was
a confusion of the mind if we got rid of
all that stuff somehow and all that was left was
the real you what would that real you be that's
the question also notice that not only do you speak
to yourself but you have images of yourself so right
now as you sit there you might say well leo
okay sure I mean the voice it talks and yes
we label stuff and this is somewhat you know a
human activity that we do we're labeling reality but I
mean still if I get rid of all that I'm
still the body right you're saying I'm not the body
I but I mean I feel like I'm the body
I can feel the body I can see the body
Here I am but who's telling you that the things
that are being felt and being seen are you after
all you're also seeing other objects you're sitting you're seeing
people you're seeing me you're seeing a table you're seeing
a car you're seeing a tree you're seeing the Sun
but you don't identify with those question is why not
you're seeing them to identifying with them you're seeing them
just like you're seeing the body now you might say
well Leo I don't feel a car I don't feel
the tree inside of a tree I only feel inside
myself but what if the things that are being felt
inside yourself inside yourself aren't actually yourself they're just being
felt in the same way that a tree is being
seen and the car is being seen and a bird
squawking is being heard have you ever thought about that
have you ever opened your mind to that possibility seriously
what you're going to discover that you have an image
of who you are you have a literal self image
in your mind a picture so right now you're sitting
there and when I tell you about you and I
point at you you might get a flash of you
sitting there as though there was a camera behind the
body your head and looking down at you like from
the third-person in fact you might have an image right
now of the back of your head because you don't
see the back of your head but you have an
image of it so think of the back of your
head right now now the question is that thing you're
thinking about is that reality or is that a concept
the back of your head is that a real entity
or is that a story in your mind right now
look right now right in the moment go come up
with another theory don't hope with another story because you
just get sucked into more stories instead actually look at
what is the back of your head what is it
metaphysically speaking what is it extant existentially you can actually
sit and look and ask yourself okay so what is
the back of my head what is that oh that's
a image and it's a word back of my head
it's a thought now if you go and you run
to the mirror and take a look at in the
mirror at the back of your head now it becomes
real but until then it's a thought what if the
thing that you think you are was the same way
it was just a thought so the voice likes to
say I am the body I am thoughts I am
the voice the voice likes to say I am the
one that's perceiving life I'm over here everything else is
over there I'm looking at those things I'm also in
control of my body and I'm control of my mouth
and I'm in control of my thoughts and the voice
very sneakily says the following to all of the above
is obvious it's obviously this way it can't be any
other way obvious right not quite so fast why don't
we stop and detain the voice and ask it a
couple of questions why are we trusting the voice so
blindly who's telling you that you can trust the voice
is it the voice are you listening to the voice
telling you that you should trust the voice and who's
actually listening to the voice is the voice listening to
itself or is there an entity listening to the voice
and what is the voice really if we break it
down and we ask ourselves existentially what is the voice
constructed out of and what if the voice is wrong
what if the things the voice says are arbitrary and
aren't actually connected and welded to reality in the way
that we think what if what the voice does is
just label stuff what if the voice is like a
label maker creating label after label after label including the
label that all labels are true and that all labels
are real that's the tricky ultimate label and it creates
the eye label and it also creates the eye is
real label and then it creates the eye is really
really really really real label and then it says the
eye is actually true and then it says everything above
is true and it's like a label machine that keeps
spitting out label after label after label but it will
it cleverly nests one little label in another label and
it kind of interconnects them in where the labels start
to take on a life of their own and what
that creates is that creates the sense of you the
sense of self all these labels and it's a giant
smokescreen and this is a smokescreen that you've never really
sat down and seriously questioned and looked into to find
where does the ultimate truth of this lead if I
get rid of all the labels where does it altom
utley go is it a genius how your voice operates
is it ingenious how its constructed that it believes itself
it's kind of like the ultimate spin doctor believing his
own [ __ ] that's what your self is like
that's what your false self is when you can get
rid of all that you can ask yourself the question
then what is the real self and that's a very
very deep thing and notice that if you get rid
of this the labels then how can you even speak
of the real self you can't speak of it through
the voice because then it just come emboldened the voice
and it creates more labels so it would have to
be a totally different way of accessing the real self
rather than through labeling the mechanism that you're used to
the mechanism of labeling this is how the sciences work
a lot of the sciences the theoretical parts of science
work this way this is how religions work this is
how philosophy works this is how ordinary everyday thinking works
so pretty much 99.9% of our lives our label eyes
and we don't really have much experience with how to
access reality without labels and because of this we assume
that the only way is through labels and that the
best we can do is through labels but what if
there was another way you just weren't really proficient with
it yet and it would take you some learning and
experience to develop this new sixth sense you might say
would that be interesting well in fact that is the
case and you can develop something called mindfulness or awareness
or consciousness and through an expansion of your consciousness you
can see more and more of the truth and ultimately
it's not even a seeing of it it turns into
a being of it which is a really interesting possibility
let's go back to this model of conceptualization right we
said there's the things in themselves there's the perceptions and
then there's the concepts well you might say okay Lia
I know how to get rid of the concepts let's
say I silence my voice then I get two perceptions
I can just perceive the world without thinking or talking
about it or imagining things about it and therefore I
have perceptions but then how do I get to the
actual thing from perceptions how do I go from perceptions
to the thing itself is that possible how can that
be possible it seems ridiculous well remember when we're talking
about the inner and outer world who told you that
there's an inner and outer world is that a perception
is that the thing in itself or is that another
concept what if the inner and outerworld distinction was a
concept and we could break that concept what would we
have interestingly what we would have is we would have
a merging of perceptions and the things in themselves they
would merge into one this disappears this and this merge
into one and become reality itself and then where are
you in this whole paradigm well the you that you
think you were the concepts this can also be dissolved
so when you are dissolved and the inner outer the
stay to dissolve what happens these two things merge you
merge with them and the thing is one and now
this is the brilliance of this the beauty of it
is that you don't perceive the truth anymore you are
it you are the truth you are physically it and
it is one thing it's not partitioned into I'm here
he's over there she's over there is one deep deep
deep deep this goes very very deep the problem though
is going to be pretty difficult for you to dissolve
your notions of the inner outer distinction and is going
to be very very difficult for you to dissolve your
notions of you yourself because you like to think of
yourself as a distinct entity from everything else well this
is not true but even when you save yourself okay
let me see this Leo I want to see it
I want to go along with you how can I
actually see it well the problem is that you've been
living for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years
of your life in this mass delusion you've constructed your
entire life is a is a lie constructed around yourself
so if what you really want is you want to
get this merger of perception and being and you want
to be the thing itself and you want to see
the truth itself you want to be the truth itself
if you want that then what you have to do
is you have to undertake a a very serious deep
systemic disillusion of yourself and your life and this is
not something that most people are willing to do because
the voice will come up with a thousand really good
excuses and reasons for why you shouldn't do this and
because you know nothing but to believe your voice you're
going to believe everything it says so the voice will
lie to itself and believe itself and keep itself stuck
and this is the condition of 99.9 nine nine nine
nine nine nine percent of the human race they're stuck
in this delusion you might wonder well leo what about
the the inner outer world distinction and you're telling me
how can we get rid of this inner outer world
distinction doesn't there have to be somebody that's perceiving the
thing so for example look we've got this orange right
so we've got that orange I'm seeing the orange someone
has to see the orange right what are you telling
me when you say inner and outer merge you're telling
me that the orange exists and there's no one seeing
the orange where am I in this whole thing and
that's a very good question is where are you in
this whole thing what if there was no you in
this whole thing would you be willing to accept that
what if after doing this deep deep deep investigation you
discover that oh [ __ ] I'm not a part
of this thing at all I'm not a part of
reality could that be a realization you could have could
you stomach that well you're going to have to because
that ends up being the truth but it's very interesting
that we assume part of what the voice says the
voice says if there's a perception there has to be
a perceiver and if I'm seeing this orange already look
the assumption is there I'm seeing this orange it's not
possible for there to be an orange and the orange
to be seen without a seat but have you really
questioned that in fact if you sit down a question
that you'll discover that the perceiver perception distinction is not
possible it makes no sense if you really dig deep
why does it not make sense well think about it
like this all right like you've got the orange right
so you're saying okay I have to be here to
see the orange so if you're seeing the orange my
question for you is who is seeing you are you
seeing yourself or is there another entity that sees you
because your claim is that well Leo you can't just
have an orange that sees itself that's ridiculous so someone
has to see it so if someone has to see
it then who's seeing that something does that someone who's
seeing the some thing this is someone see itself if
the if the someone sees itself then there exists in
reality things that can see themselves so basically what you're
claiming is not any different fundamentally from what I'm claiming
if I claim that the orange sees itself and you
claim that no the orange is seen by me but
then I see myself basically what you're doing is you're
taking you're taking it one step back but in the
end you still are seeing yourself which is kind of
weird how can anything see itself I don't know we
only have this one reality kans things see themselves in
reality or can't they what do we have to compare
with it might sound like ridiculous well nothing can see
itself but then how are you seeing yourself you might
say well Leo no there's someone inside me that's seeing
me but then who's seeing that someone trace it all
the way back trace it back not in your theories
but in actual reality trace it back and see who's
actually seeing you we're going to discover that there's not
anyone seeing you because there's not a you what they're
all all the only thing that there is is just
external reality you might say and so you are like
it you are part of it you are being it
and it is being you and these these two things
merge like we were saying so perceivers are not possible
if you really think about that model of perceivers and
perceptions it's not possible once you've got is you just
got a world of options now you might ask well
where do perceptions come from how can this be well
look this goes back to the question of what is
reality and how do you know how reality should be
see people get very confused by this they make this
very big mistake by saying well but this is ridiculous
it's as outrageous reality can't be this way but if
you think about it reality look around reality reality is
like magic it's not any different than magic the fact
that things exist is miraculous we don't even know why
that why does existence exist we don't know what actually
is existence we don't know have we compared our existence
to a hundred other existences to see if it's a
crazy existence or a normal existence no there's only one
existence that we know of so this being the case
what do our intuitions about existence tell us do they
tell us much do they really mean much they don't
mean much in the same way that the intuition of
an ant doesn't really say much about physics or reality
or nature or anything else the ant has a very
limited brain which is capable of very limited understanding in
a very limited context because it evolved for that particular
purpose now the human being is a little bit better
but not much better and we very often forget this
fact our brain can understand stuff but our intuition is
shaped by very basic human everyday needs our brain evolved
to take care of hunger sex shelter food and drinking
and socialization that's basically all that our brain evolved to
do and any kind of scientific understandings we have you
know that's a little bonus that we get but let's
not be so conceited and myopic as to assume that
just because we don't have to gather food and wage
a war and have some sex and do some clever
socialization that now all the sudden we can intuitively grasp
the nature of existence itself it's preposterous to assume this
if it would existence was one way versus another way
would either way be more crazy than the other isn't
the current way existence is already crazy enough I mean
things exist why would they exist in the first place
it's already crazy if you take a look at nature
if you take a look at astronomy cosmology it starts
to blow your mind at how intricate and complex and
also counterintuitive the universe is in fact the history of
science and philosophy and mathematics has just been a a
repeat again and again and again of human beings learning
something thinking that it should be this way and then
that getting all overthrown and us discovering oh wait a
minute our intuitions were all wrong about this thing so
the most basic example this is we believed intuitively we
think that we live on a flat planet but actually
we discover that we live on a round planet intuitively
we believe that the Sun orbits around the earth the
earth is at the center of the solar system and
all the stars but then we discover that actually no
we're just this little ball spinning around a giant Sun
and this Sun is part of a cluster of stars
and this cluster started as part of a giant galaxy
called the Milky Way and that is part of many
other galaxies and many other star systems and there's literally
billions of stars in the Milky Way and then billions
of Milky Way like galaxies throughout the whole universe and
this is just the stuff that we can see through
our telescopes and some of our radio equipment and stuff
and our satellites this is not to even say what
could possibly be outside of the Big Bang if anything
or in some other dimension or whatever and if we
go into the smaller end of scale of physics then
we take a look at some atomic particles and then
quarks and leptons and all the interesting stuff that goes
on there particles and then we take a look at
deeper and we start to get into string theory in
quantum mechanics and their scientists have discovered that our intuitions
completely fly out the window well even logic itself doesn't
apply to certain situations within um within quantum mechanics so
what who are we to say how reality has to
be constructed is there a a reasonable logical way for
reality to be and then some sort of crazy illogical
way actually if you think about it it makes no
sense because there's only one reality and everything else is
couched within the reality so there's nobody to say how
reality should or shouldn't be and the point of all
this is just to say don't be so certain about
what you believe about reality and what you believe is
plausible versus implausible because your notions of plausibility are heavily
swayed by your very limited human intuition and then the
question becomes what is reality and what is you and
what's very exciting to me about these questions is that
these questions can be answered empirically not just philosophically I
spent six years of my life doing very hardcore philosophy
when I was in the in college and I got
disenchanted with it because it turned into this big circle
jerk everyone doing this big circle jerk in philosophy it's
really quite disgusting and then I turned my back on
philosophy for many many years but then when I heard
this idea that it's actually possible for the internet'll rule
to merge and for the perceptions and the truth to
be one for phenomena and newman to become one when
that's really possible as a possibility that is like oh
then there might be a way to do what i
wanted to do with philosophy in reality and that to
me is the most profound discovery that I've made in
my personal not mature is that this might be possible
and it's worth pursuing a little bit further and it's
worth asking yourself what am I Who am I really
alright this is Leo I'm signing off post me your
comments down below click the like button like this video
share it with a friend if you would please and
finally come sign up to my newsletter - lies down
right here it's a free newsletter I release new videos
on self-actualization topics usually but we're also going to be
covering more deep spiritual enlightenment topics and I've got a
lot more videos coming on how to now start to
do this the investigation the empirical investigation here in this
video we laid the groundwork next we're going to start
to move into actually doing some exercises length some more
ground we're going even deeper so it's all really exciting
and cool and you can actually be able to sit
down and start doing this stuff for yourself not just
having to sit here and listen to me philosophize about
it which really is not the proper way to do
it but we have to start somewhere so this is
the foundation that we start with and why do we
want to do all this well because it turns out
that all your psychological problems every block that you have
in your life I don't care if it's in business
in relationships with money with finding your passion in life
with depression with anger problems literally anything anything that triggers
you emotionally all of this stems from your false self
because you believe in this voice that keep telling you
that yourself is real you have all these problems if
you get rid of this voice not only do you
get some sort of insight into the nature of reality
but you get a release from your own mental cage
to own your own mental prison that you live in
and all your drama all the petty [ __ ]
of your life will go away which is another cool
thing about this is that we're not just doing philosophy
but we're doing very practical personal development as we do
this to me this is so profound and so exciting
the possibilities of this are incredible you could not imagine
your wildest dreams that something like this is possible so
for there to even be a chance of this as
possible to me it's worth pursuing and so that's what
I'm doing my own life and I encourage you to
follow along with me on this journey discover for yourself
and one day you may have this enlightenment and this
release from your own mental prison alright go ahead sign
up for all that you
