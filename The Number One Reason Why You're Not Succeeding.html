hey this is Leo for actualize org and today I
want to talk about the number one reason why you're
probably not succeeding or getting the kind of results that
you want in your life so what is this reason
well the reason is very simple you're not taking enough
action you need to take more action and what's really
bad about this problem is that not only are you
not taking enough action your brain is tricking you into
thinking that you are so you don't even realize what's
going on here so let's talk about how this works
you have to make sure that you take action on
whatever it is that you're studying or researching or trying
to get in place in your life there's this tendency
just to do a lot of mental masturbation about it
you're going to read some books you're going to watch
some seminars you're going to talk to some friends about
it you're going to journal about it you're going to
do everything but the thing that you need to be
doing to get the results that you actually want and
in the end the action trumps everything else you can
do all that other stuff and I think that's awesome
I think it's great to talk to a coach about
what you want to do I think it's great to
journal about what you want to do and visualize it
do all the exercises I love doing that stuff I
think that stuff is important but there's also this tendency
to get sidetracked by that and to to fall into
this into this mind frame that doing that kind of
stuff doing the pre-planning phases doing the thinking is enough
by itself and what happens is you get so drawn
into that you invest too much time in the theory
and not enough time in the actual practice and actually
going out there and putting the steps in place to
make whatever it is that you want to come about
actually come about this is very tricky because you have
a tendency to to go into the theory and not
do the action when the action is what brings you
the results and then what ends up happening is you
start wondering and you start doubting yourself and you start
telling yourself well this planning doesn't work I keep I
keep rehashing this stuff I keep reading material I get
more information and none of it seems to work for
me it's all a bunch of marketing none of it
really helps and I seem to be just be stuck
and frustrated with where I'm at right now now there
are a few examples of this and I want to
really go through a couple of examples to make sure
that you're being strict on yourself with your follow-through if
you're not following through then you really have no no
right to expect results so the trick here is to
make sure that you actually are following through for example
let's say you've gone on a diet and you want
to lose some weight and you're going on a diet
and you're going to the gym those are the two
ways that you're going to you've decided to lose your
weight well let's get very real about it if you've
been trying this before if you've been trying in the
past or you're trying it right now and maybe you
say you've been on on it for a week or
two ask yourself is the action there and is the
action consistent when I'm talking about action it needs to
be consistent action especially in something like losing weight so
for example if you really ask yourself you've started your
new diet you're starting your gym regimen well how many
days in a row have you stuck to it interesting
right what's the answer have you stuck to it for
five days in a row ten days in a row
20 days in a row and if you haven't if
you haven't stuck with it for 30 days consistently what
kind of result could you expect other than what you've
got right now and that's basically the way that you
were the status quo if you're going to the gym
let's say you need to be going to the gym
five days a week and you're missing one day every
other day what kind of results could you expect this
sounds very simple and it seems kind of like duh
yeah if you're missing days going to the gym then
you shouldn't be getting results but your mind tricks you
see your mind tells you that well you know I've
really made this commitment to be going to the gym
now and I made this commitment to be eating healthier
but yeah you know I still I still go out
Friday nights and have and knock back a few drinks
and I still have those ice creams once in a
while and I still I still I still go into
the pantry late at night and grab some chips and
maybe twice a week I just I'm I'm too lazy
and I'm too tired and I don't I don't go
to the gym but you know and and then and
then you're complaining that your diet doesn't work and that
you're not losing weight you know somehow I just can't
lose this way yeah no you can't lose the weight
because the action is not there and it's not consistent
you're not you're not being disciplined with yourself about the
action that you're taking how about if you're trying to
quit a bad habit let's say you're trying to quit
smoking well my question for you is if you're trying
to quit smoking or you have in the past and
it hasn't worked for you and you're frustrated about it
Mike my civil question is how consistently have you kicked
smoking so how many days if you're getting smoking right
now how many days have you actually not smoked consistent
five days 10 days 20 days if you couldn't make
it through 30 days of consistently not smoking that how
the hell can you expect any result other than the
status quo which is what you've always had alright if
you're popping a smoke every other day then you're not
going to quit smoking it's just as simple as that
you're not following through on the action no matter how
many seminars you listen to no matter no matter if
you're taking if you have the patch on or if
you're taking gum or whatever you're talking to your therapist
about it none of that matters if you're not actually
stopping the smoke for a consistent period of time and
following through with it what else what about let's say
you're reading a book and you've been struggling with finishing
the books that you've that you've been starting and there
are some books that you want to read but you
you're down on yourself now because it hasn't been coming
through for you well my question is get real with
yourself how many times during the day do you actually
sit down and read and for how long how many
hours do you sit down once a day and read
for one hour and do that consistently are you doing
it every single day have you done that for let's
say two weeks or three weeks or four weeks if
you haven't done that how can you expect to finish
a book do you think that just because you're thinking
about a book and your friends are talking about a
book and you to them about it and you hear
about it on TV and you've journaled about it and
you visualize yourself reading a book and you've talked to
a coach about reading a book that the book is
going to get read without you actually having to read
the damn thing well if you make a consistent habit
of it for a couple of weeks you're going to
find that that book gets read and if you don't
it never will what else how about completing a project
let's say you have some project that you're working on
maybe at work maybe you work for yourself whatever might
be maybe it's remodeling the house or maybe it's a
building your website or maybe it's writing a book any
of those if you haven't been doing that consistently for
at least 30 days at least 30 days working on
that project every day for 30 days maybe you take
the weekends off and you've been working at it a
substantial number of hours every day like at least two
maybe three maybe four maybe five hours every day for
30 days what can you expect what an unfinished project
so if you're frustrated that your projects aren't being completed
maybe it's because you're not planning them correctly maybe maybe
it's because you don't have enough information about how to
how to start that business or complete that website maybe
but most likely the reason that you're failing is simply
because you're not sitting down and putting in the time
on a on a consistent basis what else how about
integrating self-help advice this is a huge one then a
really huge block for me maybe you go into the
store you buy a self-help book maybe you've listened to
some CDs and some seminars and you got some excellent
information from that maybe there's a little gold nugget that
somebody told you and now you when you're reading it
you feel like yeah this this will really improve my
life if I apply it and then a few weeks
pass and you do this again and again and again
over the years you read something a few weeks pass
you kind of play around with it and then you
never really integrate it into yourself you never feel like
it's a part of you and then years later it's
just like as though you haven't even read those books
you got very little from them you know just about
them but you haven't really made it a part of
who you are well in that case it's pretty simple
ask yourself are you actually following through and integrating the
advice are you reading the book multiple times are you
actually going and doing the exercises that the book promotes
let's say we're talking about law of attraction this is
kind of a popular one and I've pulled with this
one myself let's say you read something about Law of
Attraction and a lot of traction sounds great when you
read about it right you're thinking positively thinking constructively you're
not thinking about the stuff you don't want you're think
about the stuff that you do want and when you
read that in the moment you're like yeah this is
a really awesome concept this will really improve my life
in so many areas this can improve my relationships it's
going to prove my business this can improve my health
everything and I'm gonna feel better about myself so you
know what I'm gonna go do this law of attraction
thing then one is up happening is just they're so
excited about it you talk to your friends about it
you read you read the book you listen to the
seminars you spend money on it and then for a
few days you go out you actually apply a bit
of the law of attraction and you actually start thinking
you you start to shift your mind and you start
exerting some willpower and some conscious control over your thoughts
and you start thinking about all the positive constructive thoughts
stuff that you want so I think about the stuff
you do want rather than stuff that you don't want
and for a few days you notice that you're feeling
good you're feeling like there's something to this Law of
Attraction stuff but then you get knocked off track and
you get disenchanted with the whole thing and it's like
a lot of Attraction yeah it sounds great on paper
but it doesn't really work well why does it really
not work let me ask you have you followed up
with consistent action on this or have you just done
some mental masturbation about it very very big difference and
your mind is going to trick you into thinking that
you have taken action when you have it the way
to test yourself is well with all of Attraction have
you actually applied law of attraction for let's say two
to four weeks in your life consistently like I mean
for four weeks you don't have any thoughts about the
stuff you don't like in your life or the stuff
that you don't want you are only thinking about the
stuff that you want four weeks that's freaking hard to
do let me tell you I've try this this is
very challenging so unless you really struggle with this and
gone through that process you're going to know if you
went through it or not and if you didn't go
through it if you just point around for a day
or two and maybe read a book and then talk
with your friends around it and then forgot about it
well what can you really expect from that kind of
action that kind of inconsistent action then what you've gotten
which is again the status quo what you've got so
if you're going to take inconsistent action then I can
predict your results your results are going to be exactly
what you've gotten so far in your life so if
you're happy with that by all means do what you
have been doing and if you're not happy with it
then you need to start taking action and that actually
needs to be serious that action needs to be consistent
above everything else so this is of course why there's
this common common notion out there that self-help doesn't work
and by no means am i saying am I here
to to tout the benefits of self-help with it with
rosy rosy colored glasses on I mean I've been on
this side of the fence for years and I'm still
there I've still struggled with this a lot like I
might no means is law of attraction something that I've
integrated in my in my habits in my habitual way
of being and that is something that I still need
to work on but what I'm what I'm my point
about the self-help is that there's this common notion under
the self-help doesn't work and I think that's total BS
it does work you just need to apply yourself consistently
I think the trick is that a lot of the
self-help industry preys upon the fact that people will are
eager to jump on something but then it's very hard
for them to follow through and the self-help industry I
think where it becomes unethical is when it when it
really plays into that like if someone is selling you
some seminar tapes and or some or some books and
they're offering you a quick quick fix solution they're saying
that this is going to it's going to be a
band-aid it's really easy and all this and that it
can be done quickly and effortlessly and give you massive
results well I think that if you've done enough self-help
that you realize that it takes a lot of discipline
to do it well you have to be methodical about
you have to be kind of slow you have to
be deliberate and you don't want to be buying into
the hype of it even though a lot of those
products actually off that offer are presented with that kind
of hype a marketing a lot of them are actually
really good like Tony Robbins and stuff on some level
it's like super super gimmicky marketing but on the other
hand it's really solid stuff like you can actually go
through his material and apply it it's gonna lead some
amazing results the problem is that 99% of people don't
do that they just buy the book they flip through
it they read a couple things because of what they
heard about Tony Robbins or because of what they saw
on TV about it or because of the promises that
were made on the front cover of the book or
the program and they're excited about it but then they
don't have the sustainability to actually carry it through with
consistent action and this is also why for example motivational
speakers are sometimes disparaged because I've had this experience myself
to is you go to a motivational speech and you
get riled up the guy cites you and you're ready
to get back to work and kick ass or you're
ready to improve your relationships you get fit or whatever
that might be and then the next week all that
stuff fades off and nothing in your life has changed
and after that happens to you a couple times you
naturally just tend to get disillusioned too jaded of course
because you don't see the results from it you keep
going to the motivational speeches they just get you riled
up hyped up and then nothing happens well what can
you really expect from motivational speech if you don't follow
up with consistent consistent action so think about that think
about that if you're frustrated by these things if you're
frustrated by where you are in life and you're kind
of struggling and not getting the results that you want
maybe you go up then you go down you're you're
in this yo-yo then think about how consistent your action
is in fact I want to propose a new rule
in this new rule states that you have no you
have no right to complain about lack of results and
you have no right to be frustrated about lack of
results unless you have a proven track record of consistent
action and the best way I found of doing this
is actually getting a piece of paper making just like
a grid on it making a grid on a piece
of paper putting putting the waste days of the week
on it Sunday through Monday Tuesday Wednesday and all the
way to Friday Saturday make a grid like a calendar
pretty much and start checking it off every time you
do this thing that you need to do so if
it's about losing weight check off put an X through
that that day in the grid where you actually went
to the gym and then the next day put another
X and if you miss it don't put anything or
just write missed and all of a sudden you do
that for a month and you're gonna see what you
have really been taking action on and what you thought
you were taking action on so while you might think
that that whole month you've been doing good on your
on your fitness and following through what you might see
is you might see this Swiss cheese looking grid where
you have a few days to the gym a few
days off few days to the gym a few days
off and there you are now the gym is a
pretty pretty obvious case where this can be used with
the gym is so noticeable when you don't take action
that you can have a good sense of when when
you're not following through there but there are more subtle
things for which this is really powerful for example with
following through on something like integrating law of attraction go
through every day you do law of attraction put an
X through that through that day and every day that
you forget about it or you do a half-assed don't
put an X through it and then after a few
weeks take a look at it and see do I
have a string a consistent string of X's do I
have consistent action in other words and if I don't
well that's the reason that you're not getting your result
so this can be really effective I do it with
Jim I do this with with anything that I really
want to to integrate into my life and any kind
of change that I want to make it that I'm
really serious about is you got to track the consistency
of your action now why is this important why it's
consistency important well this kind of brings me back to
classic Aristotle quote which says that you are what you
repeatedly do and excellence is is ultimately just to have
it it's not a one-time thing you don't just do
a thing once and all of a sudden you own
it and it's yours and that that is now really
part of who you are who you are is ultimately
simply the collection of everything that you do every second
of the day that's who you are there's no whoo
there's no magical ethereal whoo there it's just what you're
doing and if you want to have the identity and
you want to be the person that's fit and that's
healthy and that's going to the gym there's no other
way to do that than to do that as frequently
as possible you're doing it every day then you're someone
who goes to the gym and quite simply if you
stop doing it then you're not no matter how much
you've done that in the past so if you've gone
to the gym for years years in the past and
today you decide to stop and not go for some
reason you're the kind of person that doesn't go to
the gym and as soon as you start going you'll
immediately become the kind of person that's going to the
gym so we don't need to do a lot of
mental masturbation around it either doing it or you're not
makes it really simple and black and white this is
why you're not getting the results that you want trust
me on this there's a tendency to really deceive yourself
which is why it's helpful to use this kind of
chart or some sort of objective metric that will tell
you if you're actually falling through it otherwise you'll tend
to give yourself the benefit out and you're like yeah
you know I did a good workout like yesterday when
in fact you half-assed it all right yeah a pretty
clean yesterday but I also ate a quart of ice
cream like that kind of stuff it just kind of
creeps in there and you're not disciplined enough to to
really enforce it so that's it that's my little spiel
about why you're not getting the results you're you think
you should be getting take a look at your life
take a look at all the areas where you're struggling
you're not happy and analyze how much consistent action you've
taken I think you'll find that if you're struggling you'll
notice that the action has been very inconsistent and the
answer and the solution to all that is to to
start taking consistent massive action and holding yourself accountable for
it you
