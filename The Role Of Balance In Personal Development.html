Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about how balance is crucial
to personal development. I want to start off by telling
you a little story in another land and another time,
there was a father and his young boy, now the
father wanted to teach the boy, the highest lessons of
wisdom about life. So he knew a wise man, one
of the wisest men in the realm. And he wanted
to send his boy there to learn from this wise
man. So he did. And he told the boy go
and meet with the wise man and ask him what
is the secret to happiness. And so the boy went,
and the boy wandered through the deserts for 40 days
and 40 Nights, to get to the palace of the
wise man. Now, the boys were surprised by this, because
this palace was high in the mountains. And it was
this giant, opulent palace. As he walked in, he saw
beautiful women and men, and they were talking and there
was these beautiful tapestries on the walls, and everybody was
busy. And he was surprised because the boy thought that
this was going to be some sort of like, ascetic
saint. And here it was this worldly wise man. So
he had to wait for two hours just to get
an audience with the wise man. And the boy came
up to him and said, My father sent me here.
He said, You're the wisest man in the realm. Tell
me the secret to happiness. The wise man looked at
him, and he said, I'm too busy right now, kid.
Come back in two hours, walk around, make yourself a
guest in my palace. Enjoy the grounds. Come back. And,
and then we'll talk in two hours. And so just
as the boy is going off, the guy says, wait,
wait, wait a minute, take this spoon, and he hands
him a spoon. And then he takes true two drops
of oil and puts them in the spoon. He says,
hold that spoon for me. And when you come back
in two hours, have the spoon and the oil, make
sure you don't spill any. And the boy thought, well,
this is kind of a weird request, but Okay, fine.
And So off he went, didn't bother questioning the wise
man. And so he walked around. And this was a
giant palace with stairs and different floors and different places
to go, and many different rooms and gardens and all
this. But the boy he was walking around, he had
to be very careful not to spill any oil from
the spoon. So he spent the next two hours walking
through the palace, very carefully focused on that spoon. And
then he came back. And so he comes back to
the wise man. And the wise man says, So tell
me what you saw of my palace. How did you
like it? And the boy said, Well, I didn't really
get to see much of it because I was walking
around. But I was always looking at the spoon the
whole time. So I didn't see anything. And the wise
man said, but look, my palace, look at the look
at the magnificent gardens, you know, took 10 years for
the gardener to architect this beautiful garden. And you know,
the animals we have out back and all the interesting
people that are around and the delicious food and the
tapestries and the paintings and the sculptures you didn't see
any of this and the boys like no, because I
was focused on the spoon. And the Wiseman said, Okay,
so here's what I want you to do. Go back
and this time, spend two hours actually looking at all
the magnificence of my palace, and then come back and
we'll talk about that. And so off, the boy went
with his spoon, and he walked around the palace, and
he was amazed at the things he saw. He's never
seen these sorts of things in his whole life. He
saw beautiful animals and sculptures and tapestries and paintings, and
handsome man and sexy women, talking and interesting conversations and
books and libraries. And all this stuff amazed him and
finally he comes back in two hours and greets the
wise man. And the wise man asked him Okay, so
you saw some of my palace. But where is the
oil in your spoon? And the boy looked down at
a spoon and He completely forgot about the oil in
the spoon because he was so bedazzled and mesmerized by
all the beautiful stuff he saw that he just completely
forgot. And so he was a little embarrassed and he
admitted this to the wise man. And the wise man
looked at him and said very well then, here is
the only advice that I can give you. The secret
to happiness in life. You want to know what that
is? You It's to observe and bask in the magnificence
of everything you see around you. All the while keeping
the oil in your spoon. That's the story. That's the
story from Paulo Queloz best selling book, The Alchemist, a
little excerpt from that. I paraphrase it, I'm not quoting
it, I'm just paraphrasing it for you here, I thought
that would be a nice way to start off this
discussion of balance. Because balance really is something that you
will discover is a fundamental component of your development. And
I don't just mean that in the sort of, like,
platitude sense of like, oh, yeah, we all sort of
know that we need to keep our life balanced, keep
everything in balance. And that's just it, right? I'm not
here to give you that kind of obvious advice. What
I'm amazed by as I grow more, and I develop
the quality of my consciousness, and I learn more, is
just how critical and fundamental balances to getting your life,
right. And also how critical it is to understand how
balance really works. And why it works the way it
works. If you're going to be developing yourself, because you're
reading all these books, and you're listening to all this
advice from different people, or from myself or from whoever,
or maybe even you're giving advice to people, you know,
after a while you get good at this stuff, you
start to see things that other people don't know and
try to give advice to your friends, to your family
and so forth. Maybe you even become a coach or
a teacher at one point. That's all good stuff. But
if you don't understand how balance fits into the equation,
you're going to make some mistakes. So what I want
to tell you about balance, is that balance is an
interesting thing, because balance can't be taught. That's what's interesting
about it. And the best analogy I can give you
this for this is imagine if you had a child,
and you wanted to teach that child how to unicycle.
And you were a great unit recycler. Because he spent
a lot of time learning. And so what do you
do you decide like, Okay, I'm gonna sit down, I'm
gonna write all of my best wisdom and advice and
techniques for how to unicycle successfully, I'm going to just
write it down in this big fat book, it's going
to be the unicycling encyclopedia, and I'm going to give
this thing to him. And I'm going to assume that
he's going to become as great a unicycle as I
am. Well, we know that that's going to go terribly
wrong, right, because you can't expect someone to learn how
to unicycle. From reading an encyclopedia, even if you describe
in perfect detail, the full technique for unicycling and all
the do's and don'ts, and you give all the best
advice and guidelines, and you lay out all the dangers
and pitfalls and traps that exist in unicycling, what's going
to happen, as soon as that kid gets on that
unicycle within two seconds, he's gonna fall off, right probably
flat on his face the first time, and the second
time, and third time and the fourth time and the
fifth time, and maybe the 100th time, he'll be able
to ride straight for 10 seconds before falling off, and
he'll fall off again. And so he'll just have to
go through that process. Now, does that mean that reading
a unicycle encyclopedia is useless? No, that can be very
valuable. But with unicycling, the whole trick is in the
balance, it's learning how to balance. And that's how life
works. And that's why personal development is a tricky and
challenging thing. And that's why even if you listen perfectly
to everything I say to all the other teachers and
books and material that's out there, and you take all
the courses, and you go to all the classes, that
you will still have to actually roll up your sleeves
and find the right balance for you in this work
in your life. That's the challenge of this work. But
also that's the beauty of it, because you're doing something
custom for yourself. You're not living a cookie cutter life.
If you're really serious about growing your consciousness, and personal
development. And that's why this work is so hard. Because
someone who is a pretty good unit cycler tries to
give you the hints for how to unicycle successfully. It's
frustrating for the teacher, because it's like, well, what do
I say I want to help you out. But if
I tell you to go left, and you go too
far left, you're gonna fall down. And if I tell
you to go right, you're gonna go too far right,
you're gonna fall down. So it's like I'm damned if
I do and damned if I don't see. And there
is something valuable in giving you some advice. You know,
at some point, you're leaning too far to the left
and you need to go right and sometimes you're leading
to for fault. to too much forward need to go
backward a little bit. So those hints are good. And
there's also general principles to unicycle that I'm sure are
important to learn in order to do it successfully. But
this idea that you can just take advice and apply
it in a rigid manner. And then also just try
to give that advice to everybody else, also in a
similar manner, and expect it to work for everybody. That's
not realistic. And what I want to do now is
I want to, I want to really drive this point
home, because I want to, by giving you some examples,
some concrete examples of what I mean by balance, and
the delicate balancing act that is doing personal development, you
should be noticing if you've been doing this work for
a year, or two or three, whether meditation or working
on your business, your life purpose, try to lose weight,
trying to get success in relationships, or developing emotional mastery,
you should be noticing that the real challenge in this
work is finding that right balance. And not just in
the abstract, but specifically for you, what's the right balance
for you. So let's give you a list of some
of these examples. These I find some of the most
common, some of the most generalizable examples that everybody I
think will face on this path in one way or
another. So the first example I have for you is
the balance, finding the balance between complacency and laziness, versus
being neurotically disciplined. So a lot of people are very
complacent and lazy. And a lot of my advice is
geared to those sorts of people to kind of wake
them up to get them motivated. So some people are
in that boat, right? They can't get themselves to get
up and actually like work on themselves work on their
career work on something that is important to them. They
don't have a sense of purpose or motivation. So that
would be leaning too much to this side over here,
the complacency side. But then there are some people who
are chronic overachievers, maybe they develop that in school, because
their parents put a lot of pressure on them. And
now they have this neurotic need to achieve, to be
successful, to go after money to go after fame to
do this to whatever. And they're very disciplined about it.
And in fact, they're so disappointed, they become neurotic. And
so now they're on this end of the spectrum, and
it's a spectrum. And you got to find what the
right balance is for you. And so sometimes you'll hear
me talking about how people are neurotic. And so maybe
that refers to you. And maybe I talked about how,
hey, you should maybe start to love yourself, accept yourself
a little bit more, because you're overly discipline, your discipline
is forced, your motivations are externalized. So maybe you should
try to get some more authentic motivations, got some intrinsic
motivations. But see, now for the lazy complacent person, that
becomes a problem. Because when that lazy person hears that
advice about the neurotic, he's like, Oh, well, so I'm
lazy and complacent. So I guess yeah, let me follow
that advice, Leo. And let me just accept myself as
I am in love myself for being lazy. And then
you're lazy your whole life is the, or the neurotic
person takes the advice meant for the lazy person. And
he says, Well, if I'm just going to sit around
on my couch all day, and if I'm not going
to work 15 hours a day. And if I'm going
to allow myself a vacation once in a while, then
I'm just going to be like that lazy person. So
I got to stick it to myself and be extra
disciplined. And so you see, in both cases, the person
is misinterpreting the advice, because he's not seeing that he's
on a unicycle here. And his life is this long
journey, this long winding journey that he has to carefully
balance and navigate. And then it goes wrong. By the
way, I find that balance is one of the rarest,
rarest qualities of human beings to have immaculate balancing ability
to know when too much is too much. And too
little is too little. And when it's hurting you in
either direction, and to not be too much to one
side or too much to the other side, which tends
to be the problem with most debates with most arguments,
with most positions people take with most ideologies is that
it's not that the ideology or the position you take
or the belief you have is utterly false. It's just
that it works in certain situations, and it doesn't in
others, and you need to be flexible enough to find
the balance and you need to develop that balancing ability.
Otherwise, your life's not gonna go well. You're gonna fall
into one trap or the other. And there are traps
strewn about everywhere. So that was one example. Let's keep
going. How about finding the right balance between being gentle
with yourself versus being harsh with yourself or with others?
Sometimes you might think like, Well, my kid is not
doing good in school. So what should I do? Should
I be gentle with him? Or should I be harsh?
Should I chastise him and really kick him in the
ass to get great, good grades? Or should I be
compassionate and understanding and give him his space? That's a
tough balance to find. You'd be wrong if you went
with only one approach, or only the other approach. And
you weren't context sensitive, right? Sometimes, the kid might need
a good kick in the ass, if he's just being
lazy, or whatever, and he doesn't see the value of
education, maybe you got to go kick him in the
ass. Not physically, I mean, but metaphorically. So you got
to be able to harsher with him. And maybe if
the kid is really struggling in school, you see that
he's trying, but he's just struggling, and he's still not
doing it. So there's some deeper other kind of problem
there, then you're being harsh with him about that, like,
if he has a learning disability, being harsh with him
is not going to solve it, that's only going to
exacerbate the problem, in which case, you got to be
gentle, you got to understand that your kid might have
limits that you didn't have when you were in school.
So you can't just impose your standards and your abilities
onto your kid. Right? This is a classic problem that
parents face, especially fathers, as fathers can be more harsh
with their kids, and they tend to not understand, you
know, weaknesses that their children might have. So this is
another example. And of course, that's what the kid but
also applied this to yourself, some people are way too
harsh on themselves. And some people are way too lenient
on themselves. So this kind of goes to the paradox
of self acceptance versus growth. Should you push yourself to
grow, or should just accept yourself? Well, really, it depends
on the situation, and finding the right balance for you
heard about finding the right balance between left brain and
right brain. Some people are way too left brain or
super rational and logical to the point where they no
longer have the emotions necessary to really ace life. And
some people are so right brained, that they then lose
track of the facts, and then they become ungrounded. So
that becomes a problem. So finding your balance there between
logic and intuition. That's important. It's very rare to find
a person who is really good at being able to
use both his left and his right brain without being
overly dominant in one or the other. That's quite rare.
And also a person who's good at ramping up the
left brain when necessary for a specific task, like if
you're doing mathematics, okay, ramp up your left brain great.
And then ramping up the right brain, when you are
doing something more intuitive. Like maybe you're in a relationship
to rev up the right brain, or you're doing spiritual
work, or you're sitting down to meditate, at that point,
you shut off your left brain. See, but being able
to be that flexible is a rare thing. And it's
not something that you're just born with, it's something you
cultivate, that's what development is about. That's what growth leads
to is that kind of flexibility. Of course, you can
help by having an open mindset and understanding that this
is what you're trying to do in life is to
develop this balance. How about finding a balance between suppressing
emotions versus expressing emotions? See, some people they're very expressive
with their emotions, as soon as they feel sad or
angry or pissed off, or whatever, they just let you
know about it. And a lot of times in dysfunctional
ways, so maybe they get fits of rage. And then
you tell that person well hold on, don't, don't express
your emotions so much. And then what they do is
they swing the pendulum to the opposite end of the
spectrum, and then they suppress their emotions. Because they think
that, well, if I'm not going to express my emotions,
the only other option is to suppress them. So they
go into suppression mode. And some people are constantly suppressing
their emotions, they've been suppressing their emotions their entire life.
And so they have now problems because they can't even
bring up serious issues in relationships, for example, or at
work, because they're constantly suppressing everything, not just from other
people, but also from themselves. They can't even be honest
with themselves about how they feel. And basically, they've never
even felt different emotions in their body, they don't even
know where hunger is in their body, they don't know
where sadness is in their body. So both of these
are problems, you got to find the right balance there.
For some of you, you express way too much. And
for others of you, you suppress way too much. And
for many people, it's both you do both way too
much. So where do you find that balance? bleah telling
me how to find the perfect balance. But you see
the problem with that question. How am I going to
tell you it's like me telling you, when you should
turn left or right, or leaned forward or backward on
a unicycle? You know, it all depends on where you're
going and what situation you're in specifically, and it's going
to change from moment to moment. That's an ability you
have to cultivate through trial and error. but also through
learning and wisdom, it is possible to learn this stuff.
It's not just all purely trial and error. How about
the next balancing? Issue? Rejecting theory entirely, versus being lost
in theory, this is a balance that a lot of
people get wrong. So a lot of academic types and
scientific type people, they get lost in theory so easily
that, you know, they can spend the whole life reading
books and forget what life is about. That's a problem.
Also, maybe some people in business, they might get so
theoretical about their business, that they forget about the practical
elements of their business. And so they crash their business
into the ground because of that. Their theoreticians. Other people,
on the other hand, they say, oh, theory theory is
all just theory theory is pointless, you know, who needs
theory, it's all about action. Let me go out there,
just take action, action, action, action, action. But if you
go out there and take action all the time, without
knowing some of the theory, you know, the theory is
important. So again, you get the balance wrong, you got
to find the right balance. And a lot of times,
it's a problem with spiritual people, as they say, Well,
you know, Leo, reading all these books, like you say,
and studying all these different traditions and mystical, different mystical
sects and stuff, this is all pointless, it's all just
more theory. You're failing to see the right balance, right.
And also, a lot of times, notice that people will
use this as a cudgel to create straw man arguments,
and create false debates by creating these false dichotomies like,
well, you should never read another book again in your
life. Or like, well, you should only sit and meditate.
That's all you should do. Or well, you should only
do personal development, you know, spiritual work, or you should
only do business, and you should do no other stuff.
Or you should only do this and not do that.
Right. And when you create a kind of straw man,
an exaggerated version, that's what a straw man is, it's
an exaggerated version of the opposite position. That of course,
it looks like, yeah, you can see all the problems
with being extreme. But there's problems with every extreme. There's
also problems with always being in the middle. So I'm
not just telling you to always be in the middle,
that's also not the solution. You see. It's the dynamics
or equilibrium that you're going for. How about career and
life purpose, versus spirituality? Talk about balancing that. So some
of you have taken my life purpose course. And now
you hear me talking about spiritual topics and enlightenment. And
you might be wondering, well, yeah, what should I do?
Should I pursue my life purpose? Or go after enlightened?
It seems like these things can be contradictory at times.
Yeah, in the same sense that when you're on a
unicycle, you know, left and right can seem contradictory. They
pull you in opposite directions. And sometimes you got to
go one way, sometimes the other way. What do you
do? Do you say perfectly in the middle? No, not
necessarily. It's not what I'm advocating, what I'm advocating is
that you find the right balance for you. There needs
to be a balanced struck between business and spirituality, what
that balance is for you, I don't know, that's your
work to find out. And I'm not saying that even
you know what that balance is. Because you can't know
until you start to get in there, roll up your
sleeves and actually do some trial and error and see
what comes out. That's all part of the process of
getting to know yourself self discovery, finding out your authentic
values, motivations in life, the more you understand yourself, the
better you will be able to guesstimate or Intuit what
these balances for you should be at certain points in
your life. Also, another balancing act is pursuing enlightenment versus
personal development. A lot of people who get into this
work get into it for personal development, which is more
success based type stuff, you're working on your health, your
relationships, your career, that sort of stuff. You want to
solve some emotional issue that you have like your depression,
whatever. Okay, great. But then you learn about enlightenment. And
so Leah, what should I do now? Should I do?
Should I forget about the personal development just do enlightenment?
Some people argue that and other people just say no,
forget about the enlightenment, that stuff's not very practical. Let
me just do personal development. Who's right? Well, they're both
wrong if they take extremist positions on this, because if
you only do enlightenment, you're gonna have problems. And if
you only do personal development and have problems, and I'm
not saying split it down the middle half and half
either find the right balance for you. For some people,
at this point right now in their life. They need
to do a ton of personal development, 10 years of
personal development before they can even talk about alignment. And
for some people, they've been doing way too much personal
development. They're focusing on too shallow of stuff, success and
whatever else and they would really benefit from doing some
deep spirituality work and let go of their chasing of
success. So depends, really depends. Another one is a balancing
act. is working on yourself versus enjoying life. You might
have noticed this one, where it's like, well, Leo, you
know, working on myself doing all this personal development, that's
hard work. I find that when I work on myself,
I'm not enjoying life. And when I'm drawing, I'm going
out with my friends and partying and stuff like that
I'm enjoying life a lot, but then I'm not really
growing. So what should I do? One or the other?
will obviously there's a balance there somewhere for you. And
it will probably depend on where you are in your
life. Another balancing act is unconditional love versus being a
doormat. So sometimes you tell people, okay, unconditional love, practice
that. But then they become a doormat. And I think
that being on practicing unconditional love means that you should
tolerate abuse and theft and your friends, calling you names
and insulting you and mistreating you and that sort of
stuff. Of course, that's not what unconditional love is about
at all. But people make that mistake, because they don't
see this whole dynamic as a balancing act. You see.
And then some people are way too assertive, so they
don't practice unconditional love. Because they feel like well, if
I start practicing international law, that's going to that's means
I'm going to turn into a doormat. So I have
to be hyper assertive all the time, I have to
turn into an asshole. So you got to find the
right balance there. Another delicate balancing act is being too
stingy with your money versus being too wasteful. Some people
are way too conservative and stingy, where they won't even
invest $20 into a book that would really help them
to change their life. I see people leaving me comments
on their videos a lot where they say like, well,
$20, I don't want to pay $20 for that I
don't want to pay $100 for this, when that thing
would really really help them, it would pay them back
100 fold. But they're too stingy for that. And then
some people are way too wasteful with their money, of
course, credit cards and all that kind of stuff that
we know about. So you got to find that right
balance for you. Also, with regard to money, there's a
balancing act of chasing money versus neglecting money. Some people
chase after money their whole lives. And that turns into
a huge problem. And then some people do the opposite
of that, which is that they neglect money and say,
Well, money. Money's not important. Life isn't about money. Life
is about art and love and emotions and relationships. That's
what life is all about. It's about spirituality, man. We
don't need money. And then you see this guy, and
then he comes to you next month asking to borrow
money because he can't pay his bills. You see, well,
that was the other extreme, you got to find the
right balance. You got to find a balance between being
pragmatic and idealistic. That's something I've, I've struggled with this
one for many years. How do I maintain my ideals,
all the things that I hold as very important as
my highest values, but also at the same time be
a part of the real world, you know, I have
certain ideals about how money is not supposed to corrupt,
and how I'm supposed to be out there doing my
art and following my passion, all this, but in the
real world has real world obstacles to it to see.
So I have to be able to get stuff done
in business, I have to be able to get stuff
done in my relationships, I have to be able to
get stuff done when I sit down and meditate. And
it's not always the ideal. Find the right balance. See,
most people are either way too pragmatic to the point
where they lose touch with their ideals. And they're just
like husks of human beings. They waste their lives. Because
if you're going to be pragmatic your whole life, you're
basically a robot, you're not a human being. You've wasted
your life. And other people are so idealistic, that yeah,
they have these beautiful ideals. But then when you look
at their life, tangibly, they're not manifesting what their ideals
are, they might believe in free love and abundance for
everybody and all this sort of stuff, but then they
don't have abundance in their life, they're not actually able
to love everyone freely and unconditionally. Those are just ideals,
right? Because they haven't found the right balance. And it's
in the balance that the real work happens. That's where
it's really tricky, might take you 10 years to figure
out that balance for you. And that's just in this
one facet of your life. And there's many facets as
we're exploring here. How about the delicate balance of contemplating
death, versus becoming nihilistic? So I have some episodes that
I shot in the past where I talk about how
it's important to contemplate death. That's very important. If you
want to live a meaningful life, you have to be
thinking about your death. I think about my death, almost
on a daily basis. But now, some people will, again,
take that and misconstrued and go to the opposite extreme.
And then they'll use this to become a nihilist or
to become depressive or to justify inaction. Because now it's
like, oh, Lee, I've been thinking about my death, like
you said, added, I've been doing it and I've been
constantly my death and it's like, Well, life is all
meaningless. So there's nothing to do and it's all pointless,
why should I even develop myself and yada yada yada.
And you know, I'm now I'm feeling depressed because of
this. Again, that's something you have to reconcile. It's something
you have to work on. I've worked on this for
years in my youth, on this specific challenge between nihilism
and the and, and meaning finding meaning in life, and
realizing that life has no meaning. And striking the right
balance between that is challenging. Most people, they don't think
about their death at all. Or they're the opposite. They
think about how meaningless everything else everything is. And so
therefore, they use it to justify inaction. And they're not
passionate about their lives because of that. For me, I
actually think I've reconciled this one pretty good. Because I
spent a lot of my youth gears in my youth
thinking about this when I was a teenager and doing
philosophy. This was one of the core questions I had,
that I really worked on, and I cracked this nut.
Although I still have some more lingering work remaining, but
I mostly cracked this nut to the point where I'm,
I found that balance for me, where I don't need
to concoct or fabricate meaning in order to motivate myself,
in a sense, that that I realized that in the
big picture is sort of meaningless. It's all sort of
meaningless. But still, I can be very passionate about what
I'm doing. Right. So I'm working to figure that out.
That's a facet that I've resolved. And now I'm going
to move on to working on other facets, finding my
balance there. How about striking a delicate balance between being
scientific, but not overly materialistic. Most people, when they become
scientifically minded, now, they use that as an X against
spirituality and religious people. And they expect everything to be
scientific and fact based, with no paradoxes, and everything has
to be super rational. Well, that leads to problems that,
you know, I've talked about in the past. Other people
are the opposite of that. They go down the spiritual
mystical route, except they distort it. And they turn into
a sort of hippie, ideal side type of thing. And
now they're denying facts. They're denying science. And you're using
that as an axe against science. So both of those
are problematic, as you can see. And that entire debate
is purely just a false debate as a distraction, you
got to find your balance point there. How about striking
a delicate balance between art versus marketing. If you're doing
your life purpose, or you're running a business, and you're
an entrepreneur, or maybe you have an artistic sort of
career, then you've probably faced this challenge. And what I
mean here is that, if you're an artistic type of
person, like I am, you're creative. You want to create
beautiful things with your work, then, you really value the
arts, you have these lofty ideals. And a lot of
times you have this tension, this sort of tug of
war between art and marketing. Like you might want to
write this profound artistic book, or paint a painting or
make some music. That's very artistic, and you love it.
But then it's so niche that is very difficult to
market and your customers. There are no customers, because you're
the only one who likes the art. So you got
to sort of like say, Well, okay, yeah, I want
to write this book, that's going to be super weird
and artsy fartsy. But then I'm not going to be
able to market it or to be successful at it,
I'm gonna have no audience. I do want to have
some audience because that's the whole point of me creating
my art is so that I can have an impact
on people. So if only one person reads my book,
that's, that's kind of lame. So you say, Well, okay,
I can go to the opposite opposite end of the
spectrum. And I can say, Well, I'm just going to
market the shit out of my book, you know what
I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go take a poll, I'm
going to do a survey of my friends and see,
okay, what kind of book would they like me to
write? Oh, vampires. Okay, I'm gonna write a book about
vampires. Even though I don't give a shit about vampires.
Just because I know that right now, vampire movies or
whatever are hot. And so you know, people will probably
buy it. And then of course, when you go down
that route, a lot of times what happens that you
write your vampire book, but because you weren't passionate about
it, and you were only doing it to please lowbrow
masses, that your book ends up being crap, it doesn't
sell well anyways. Because usually you need to passion for
something to be good. So you got to find the
balance there. And that's also something that I've really struggled
with for years and years and years. Finding that balance
when I was doing game development, find that balance. When
I was starting my online marketing business where I kind
of swung my pendulum to the marketing side, and then
swung the pendulum back with actualised.org. With actualize that org
I was able to sort of find a balance and
I'm still looking for that balance because even with actualized.org,
even though it's like my passion business, and it is
my art, I think of it as AP, I don't
think of it as just like self help advice. It's
my art. That's what this is. But also, I have
to balance it with marketing. Like certain topics, certain titles,
like come up with for videos, I have to think
about every single title for the video and think like,
well, how many people are going to click on this
one versus that one, this video title is more true
and honest and more artistically genuine, but then that one
there will get me more clicks, more people will see
it more people will benefit from it. So how do
I balance that, I mean, I want to be helping
people I don't want to be just talking to to
chirping crickets. But also, I don't want to sacrifice my
values too much, and I want to maintain my style.
So that's a, that's a really tough one. That'll take
you probably a decade to sort that out in your
career. At least if you're the artistic type. You know,
a lot of people, that's why we get the classic
problem of the starving artists, the stereotype of the starving
artist, what is that that's someone who's completely neglected the
marketing, who just does arts for just the sake of
doing arts. And that ends up being pretty lame. If
you read biographies of artists who looked that way, it's
not a very good kind of life. And then you
know, we all know also about the marketing cocksuckers you
know, the corporate marketing cocksuckers, who will market anything that
has no artistic value at all, just purely for profit,
and it could even be harmful and damaging to people,
they'll still find a way to market the shit out
of it and be, you know, raking in the cash.
But then at the same time hurting people and paying
the cost on the inside. Because those people know that
they don't want to be a marketing cocksucker they want
to be living up to higher consciousness values deep down
inside, they want to do that. They just kind of
sold their soul to the devil to the marketing devil.
here here's another delicate balance that you need to strike
is between rejecting culture and questioning culture. Versus studying culture.
And finding the good and culture. I've ranted about culture
in the past, in general culture can be a very
damaging thing. A lot of negative stuff comes from culture
and from groupthink and from social conditioning. So a lot
of cultural baggage needs to be rejected. And maybe when
you're first starting person development, you need to do a
lot of cultural rejection. But then also you don't want
to develop a chip on your shoulder, where now you
deny and reject all cultures. And now you don't spend
any time studying cultures and developing certain cosmopolitan myths about
you certain worldliness. So how do you not get sucked
into religion but at the same time still understand different
religions? That's a tough balancing act. might take you a
while to figure that one out as well. How about
striking a balance between being brutally honest and being sort
of weak and compassionate? So brutally honest people, you know,
they're very insensitive, they just blurt stuff out and offend
people. And then they say, well, but I'm at least
I'm very honest. And and other people will say, Well,
no, I tell a bunch of white lies. And I'm
kind of weak in yellow bellied. I don't people tell
people what they need to hear. Because I don't want
to hurt their feelings. Finding a balance between that is
tricky as well. How about relationship versus career? So this
is a classic one that we've all seen in the
movies, right? classic problem of guy works too much, but
then neglects his family, or the opposite problem. You invest
too much time in your family and all that kind
of stuff. But then you have a crappy career, finding
that balance is tricky. And different people will require different
solutions to that problem. No, it's not the case that
you just split that that that one down the middle.
How about balance between exploring psychedelics and using it for
growth, versus using psychedelics for escape, or demonizing psychedelics? Right,
so I see a lot of people falling into one
of these two extremes. They either like the idea of
psychedelics and then they get on board and then they
become psychedelic escapist, and they use it to escape doing
personal development work. So there's that group of people. The
other group of people are the ones who have been
sort of brainwashed school about how psychedelics are bad and
evil. So they demonize them. They say, There's no way
that psychedelics have any spiritual virtues. There's no way you
can use them for growth, there's no way they can
help you with enlightenment, none of that stuff would work.
Right? So they take that position. And what's lost is
that fine balance in the middle, which is what I
always advocate was psychedelics finding that balance? How about finding
a balance between cutting toxic relationships versus avoiding commitment? So
this is a one that a lot of you look
at wrong. I've talked in the past about how relationships
can be toxic. And sometimes you got to just cut
people out of your life. Like that guy right there.
He's like a scumbag alcoholic who abuses, you cut that
person out of your life, or he's a gambler, and
he's wasting all your money, cut that person out of
your life, because you're probably not going to fix his
gambling problem for him, you see. So, some people then
use that and they say, Oh, well, as soon as
there any little problem in a relationship, it's like, oh,
my girlfriend, she didn't want to do something that I
wanted to do, she didn't want to go to the
same restaurant as me. So I'm gonna cut her out
of my life. And you know, my mom, my mom,
she said something to me the other day, and I'm
gonna cut her out of my life. And so like,
you can take it to that extreme. You know, successful
relationships do require a commitment. And if your commitment phobic,
it's very easy to for you to take the wrong
advice, and then use it as justification to continue with
your commitment phobia. You see what both sides do. And
this is just the general pattern of how the mind
works. The egoic mind works a low consciousness mind works
this way, is that it goes to extremes. And it
uses the other extreme as the Boogeyman. So it's like,
well, Leo, if I'm going to be cutting toxic people
out of my life, that means that none of my
relationships will have the commitment component. And that means all
my relationships will fail. No, that's not what's being said.
And, you know, somebody else might say, well, Leo, you
know, if I start using psychedelics, that means I'm going
to become some sort of like, heroin user, and I'm
going to, you know, devolve into this and this and
this and that I'm going to stop meditating. But see,
that's the boogeyman, right? You're afraid of the other extreme,
you're creating a straw man argument in your mind, you're
thinking in terms of black and white. And that's not
a very good way to navigate this complex, grayscale world
that we're in. Requires nuance, requires balance, requires careful discernment.
See, how about striking a balance between being focused on
one school or teaching or set of techniques for personal
development or spiritual development, versus being eclectic? i In the
past, I've advocated a very eclectic approach to personal development
and to enlightenment. And then some people criticize me for
that and say, well, Leo, no, that's a problem. You're,
you're misleading people. Because by telling them to be eclectic,
they're going to study all this stuff. They're gonna study
Buddhism, and Hinduism, and Christianity and all this, but they're
not going to actually practice anything, and therefore they will
never become enlightened. And that's true, that is a danger.
There is a danger to that kind of over eclecticism
where you just sample everything in a spiritual marketplace. But
you don't find a set of techniques that you actually
commit to. So that's the extreme there. But the other
extreme is that you focus so much that all you
do is you say, Okay, I'm just going to take
this one technique, focusing on my breath, I'm just going
to use focusing on my breath, I'm going to use
the focusing on my breath to solve all of life's
problems. And I'm going to use it to grow myself
spiritually to the highest levels. Well, you're kidding yourself, if
you think that's going to happen. You could focus on
the breath, and you could become enlightened, just using focus
on the breath as a technique. But there's more, there's
much more, you're not going to become a well rounded
person by just focusing on your fucking breath your whole
life, you see, and so you will be unbalanced. And
there are dangers on both sides. Which is why nuance
is required. Which is why it's very easy to take
any advice that you hear any book, or anything that
I say, and to sort of demonize it by saying,
well, but look at all these problems with it. Look
at all these pitfalls, look at all these dangers. Right.
But there's dangers everywhere. We live in a dangerous world.
And personal development is a dangerous game. Not in the
sense that you'll physically harm yourself. But it's dangerous in
the sense there are many, many traps. And you're always
at risk of falling into some trap. So criticizing some
method or school or some technique or some philosophy, just
based on the fact that there are traps associated with
it. That's not a very valid criticism, because there's traps
associated with everything, including criticism. One of the biggest traps
is criticism. And, of course, what I'm talking about here
with balance doesn't just apply to your personal life. I've
mostly been been giving you personal life examples, but it
applies to your business. It applies to the way society
is run it applies to government. Do you believe that?
government is too big, too bloated, too much bureaucracy, too
much regulation? We need to cut that shit down. Okay,
that's one extreme something ions, that's the case, sometimes government
is too big of a bureaucracy, sometimes there is too
much regulation. But to take that on as an ideological
position is a problem. You also have the opposite end,
right? You might believe, well, government needs to be bigger,
because corporations are running amok, we need a lot of
regulation, a lot of bureaucracy, higher taxes, all this. And
so then that becomes your ideology, right. And then these
people fight together all the time. And they're just ideological,
and they're not seeing the nuance and that in certain
situations, and certain times in history, we need government to
be bigger. In certain situations, in certain areas. In certain
sectors, we need government to be smaller. And it's all
about finding the nuance there. So, I hope you can
start to see the importance of balance here. Balance is
not just some generic platitude as in like, oh, yeah,
everything in moderation. No, that's not what I'm saying here.
Hopefully, you can also start to see now why some
of my advice may have seemed contradictory to you at
times. It's like, well, Leo, in this one video, you
told me that I should be more masculine. And in
this other video, you told me I should be more
feminine? Which one is that you're contradicting yourself? Well, now
you see what's going on there at the meta perspective.
And you might also have run into this problem, if
you're reading a lot of books. If you have my
book list, and you're reading that, you might also notice
contradictions there between different authors, you might read something by
some author, and that contradict something that I say, does
that mean that he's wrong? And I'm right, or I'm
right, he's wrong, not necessarily. I mean, in certain situations,
maybe, maybe I'm wrong. But generally what is happening, if
you take the meta perspective, zoom out a little bit,
you're gonna see that well, he might be emphasizing a
certain solution for certain type of person who has a
certain type of imbalance in their life. And I might
be emphasizing a different solution for a different type of
person who has a slightly opposite imbalance in their life.
You see, and even within what I say, I can
shoot one video here talking about one solution for one
type of person. And then tomorrow, I can shoot another
video talking about another solution for another type of person
with a slightly different imbalance. And they might be opposite
solutions, right? Because these people are leaning too much to
the left or too much to the right. So they
require opposite medicines, in a sense, right, you have to
tailor the medicine to the person. That's one of the
limitations of these videos, actually, if I was coaching you,
if I was doing life coaching one on one, that's
one of the benefits of life coaching, I don't coach
anymore, but if I do coach somebody and I have
in the past, is that the benefit of that relationship
is that we can talk about issues specific to that
person, I don't really know what your issues are, I'm
sort of guessing I'm averaging. Right. And that's what a,
that's what a teacher sort of has to do. In
the end, you're the ultimate arbiter of what advice is
right for you, and what advice is not right for
you, even the most enlightened master, you could think of
can give you a piece of advice, which will not
be right for you. Because he doesn't know you as
well, as you do. See, the Buddha himself could give
you wrong advice, not because he doesn't understand things. But
just because his focus, his priorities, his values, his position
in life is different from yours. And he can't really
anticipate he can sort of ballpark you, but he can't
truly know. Which is why you can never outsource this
stuff to anyone else. Balancing is not an act, you
can outsource. You have to do it if you want
to get the results from it. And what I want
you to see here is that the the real work
in this work, where we're doing the heavy lifting is
when we're learning to navigate all this stuff for ourselves.
And we're struggling with it. We're looking for easy answers.
But of course, there are no easy answers. When you're
learning to navigate. There are no positions to take your
position list, you're confused, you're lost, you're struggling, you're doubting
yourself, you're second guessing yourself. You don't know which device
to follow. Should I follow that book or this book?
Or what Leo said in this video in that video,
what should I do? Accept that. Accept that confusion. But
keep moving forward. Don't stop the mistake when people get
confused that they get paralyzed and they stop. You got
to keep going. So I've already mentioned this point, but
I want to stress it again. Don't mistake balance as
splitting everything down the middle. It's not like that at
all. Balance is you can think of it in two
ways. There is a static form of balance and a
dynamic form of balance. static balance is where you think
like okay, what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to find The perfect balance between my career and
my family life. And when I find that, I'll know
what that is, and that's it, we're done. Problem solved.
Probably not going to work that way, especially if you're
planning on growing throughout your life, as you grow, you
will need to modify that position, even if you've solved
it once, you will need to change it in the
future. So this is what I mean by dynamic balance,
you can never get on a unicycle and go down
some winding road and just coast. That's what people are
doing when they're looking for a static balance, or when
they think of balance as a static thing. It's sort
of like they want to just unicycle down a mountain.
And not consider the context, you know, the terrain that
are going down, you have to keep your eye on
the terrain at all times, and counteract any sort of
obstacles that are there. That's what dynamic balance is about.
dynamic balance means that you know, for the next five
years, you're going to be working on your business. And
then once that's handled, you're going to work on your
love life. And then once that's handled, five years later,
you're going to work on your spirituality. And when you're
working on your spirituality, maybe your business is going to
suffer. Maybe you're even going to quit your business entirely
when you're working on your spirituality. But then you become
enlightened, and then maybe you go back into business, or
whatever, you know, that's what dynamic balance looks like. So
recognize that. Balance is different for different people. But balance
is different, not just for different people. But even for
you it's different, the balance for you will change depending
on what stage of your life you're in. And as
you move from your 20s, to your 30s, to your
40s and your 50s, and so on, you better believe
that balance adjustments will be necessary, big balance adjustments. That
is if you're growing. People who are not growing, they
can stay in one spot. But then you don't want
to be there. This, this tendency to just stagnate in
one spot. This is the worst place you can be
in in life, I think, personally. So what I'm trying
to tell you is that you need to customize everything
you're learning all the theory, to your personality, to your
genetics, to your unique strengths and weaknesses, to wherever you
are in life. How are you feel about life? Maybe
right now you don't feel like starting a business, maybe
you will in five years. But right now you don't
Okay? Well, in that sense, then maybe working on your
business isn't the right thing for you go work on
your spirituality, or whatever else you're interested in, you know,
family life, you generally have to follow your motivations and
your motivations, they don't stay constant your whole life. It's
not like you're just like, motivated by family, constantly, from
your 20s to your 60s, or you're motivated by business
constantly, from your 20s, your 60s, or you're motivated by
spirituality that we know, it's like in your 20s, you
might be motivated by business and in your 30s, maybe
by spirituality in your 40s by family life and so
forth. So it's all about finding what works for you.
And realizing that what works for you may not work
for other people. And what works for other people may
not work for you. Because you are individuals. And the
metaphor that I came up with for this is the
metaphor of the mixing board. Think of life like a
giant mixing board. I have an example here of a
little mixing board that I have that I use sometimes
for audio. I'm not using it right now. But see
what's interesting about mixing boards for mixing audio, this is
a tiny one. If you've seen someone like MTV, they,
they're huge. They have hundreds of these little knobs, right.
And these knobs they just spin around one way or
the other. But what you got to think of is
that your life is like a giant mixing board. Imagine
one of these but with 1000 knobs. And now bounced
does not mean that the knobs are set to zero.
dead center on all the knobs, depending on the type
of song you're composing, depending on what you want out
of your music, you know, is it classical music? Is
it rap? Is it hip hop? What are you? What
kind of song do you want? Right? You got to
twist and turn all these different knobs to different positions
for your specific objective. And so that's what your life
should be like. That's how you should think of it.
When you start to think of your life like this,
and you start to think of other people's lives like
this in this manner. Then you become less ideological, you
become more tolerant. You become more cosmopolitan, because you see
like, hey, yeah, you know, my mixing board is cranked
this way. My child's mixing board is crazy some other
way. And my wife's mixing board will be great another
way and my bosses will be another way and you
know In my community, the city I live in the
country I live in will be tweaked this way. And
some other communities, some other countries, some other races, people
will have it tweaked another way. And that's okay. Because
I realize that, you know, we're different. We need different
things at different times. And we're always playing and fine
tuning and adjusting, at least if we're doing it right.
The problem with most people is that their mixing board,
you know, what happens, by the time they get into
their mid 20s, by age 25, all these knobs that
they were playing with when they were a kid. And
when they were in high school, and in college, they
all get set, they're set in cement, and they never
change again. And then those people become very ideological about
which way their knobs are set. And they want everyone
else's knobs to be set just like them. And don't
you dare touch my knobs is their position for the
rest of their life. And even if you touch that
knob, even just a little bit, they start to scream
and moan and yell and resist, and they can even
get violent with you. And, of course, what kind of
life is that, that's not going to work. So I
want you to be cognizant of differences that people have.
And be careful about criticizing other people's situations and processes.
Some people need to go through a very different process
than you in order to grow. You know, some people
were abused when they were kids. So that person who's
been abused, or raped, or who was growing up in
college, in under a communist dictatorship, or who's whose parents
were tortured, or who lost their mother or their father
in a car accident, or to cancer, or who was
like a military brat, and traveled from military base to
military base for their whole life, or maybe their house
was destroyed in a fire, you know, someone who's experienced
them like that will need to go through a very
different process to grow, to become enlightened, to spiritual purify
themselves to, to be able to be in good relationships,
to be able to hold down a good job, to
be able to have a life purpose, they're going to
need to go through a different process most likely than
you. And even if they experienced similar things to you,
they might still need a different process. Because they might
be more left brain, you might be more right brain.
They might be more intuitive, you might be more logical,
they might be more scientific, you might be more spiritual,
you know, who knows. So keep that in mind. Use
this point to under to really deeply understand this. This
should melt away a lot of the tendency that you
have to debate, and also your desire to engage in
debates or even to listen to debates. So one of
the big reasons that there are debates within personal development,
or even non duality, about which method is best, which
technique is best, should I do this? Should I do
that? Or in politics or whatever, there are these debates,
because people disagree. But they're not really disagreeing on substance.
They're disagreeing on a difference in balance. But they're not
recognizing that what they're disagreeing on is a difference in
balance. They act in the debate as though there's this
one set of knobs, which is perfect for everybody, this
is the right balance we should have, we should have
this exact balance for all of science, or for all
of spirituality, or for the entire country, or for my
entire family, we should have just this perfect balance. And
of course, this perfect balance happens to be exactly the
one that I think is perfect for me. Of course,
that's how the ego thinks, right? Whatever ego likes as
its perfect balance, whatever makes the ego happy. It'll want
to then did that dictate that to everybody else? And
it'll think that there's these significant differences of agreement between
people, actually different people, usually, they don't disagree on the
fundamentals. They disagree mostly on the details, difference and balance.
And that difference in balance is often dictated by their
shit, the shit they have going on their life dictates
the balance. And that's why people get defensive and ideological
because, as you well know, we need less government. The
reason we need less less government is because government was
a problem in my life. And I can tell you
how the government abused my daddy and my daddy's daddy
and my, my great, great grandparents, they were refugees from
a dictatorship. So we need less government. Okay, that's your
background. That's where you're coming from. And so your knobs
are tweaked a certain way. You know, somebody else is
coming from the opposite end of the spectrum. They were
under two lakhs of a government corporations ran amok and,
you know, some corporation poisoned their kids and their kid
died because some corporation didn't have strict enough regulations and
sent them some medicine that wasn't properly vetted by the
FDA or whatever, and their child died. And so now
you're telling this guy that they need to tweak their
knobs to reduce government regulations with the FDA, and they're
going to tell you to go fuck yourself, because they
have a different set of knobs. See? So to really
see this romantic perspective takes a lot of the edge
off of a debate, because you sort of see through
the debate as just a game, it's a game, it's
a distraction from the real work of finding the right
balance for you. And your concern should not be about
other people's balances, but your own. If everyone takes care.
Just think about this, if everyone took care of their
own mixing board, every single mixing board in the entire
world will be perfect. Let's see what we do. Rather
than doing the hard work of dialing in our own
mixing board, we what we do is we we neglect
our own and we say hey, let me play with
your mixing board. I think your mixing board should be
like this, and like that, and like that, and like
this. And we go around doing that. And then meanwhile,
our mixing board is fucked up. And if you think
about it, that strategy, if everybody is working on everybody
else's mixing board and not their own, then that guarantees
a flawed mixing board for everyone on Earth. And so
now you start to see the big picture of what's
really going on and how important balances. Alright, that's it.
I'm done here signing off. Please click the like button
for me, post your comments down below, share this episode
with a friend. And lastly, come check out actualize that
org, this is my website, I've just released and launched
my blog, internet insights, go check that out. There's a
lot of exciting stuff that I'm posting there a lot
of stuff that I can't really share in the videos,
because it's sort of miscellaneous sort of off topic. But
I'm really excited, like I felt really jazzed up in
the last couple of weeks working on this blog, putting
a lot of posts out there, and I have a
lot more in the pipeline. I'm gonna be releasing a
few every week. So if you're really serious about this
work, you'll you'll dig some of those insights and also
check out my forum, check out the life purpose course
check out the book list, all this stuff will take
you deeper into this work. And the most important thing,
though, is that you stay with me commit to taking
action on this work, commit to learning more theory, because
you need the theory. That's the foundation for you to
take the right action based on because a lot of
the theory you learn from your parents and your school
was completely ass backwards. And so you can't even take
the right actions because you don't have the right theory.
So that's what's coming in the future. Deeper episodes, more
of the principles that you need the big picture you
need to understand in order to master your life.
