Hey, this is Leo for Actualized.org And in this quick
self-help segment, in about 10 minutes, Iím going to talk
about what is the purpose of life. This is actually
a super-deep and fascinating metaphysical topic that I actually love
to think about, being a philosophy major. This is something
I delved into years ago in my college days. But
now let me share with you some practical advice that
I have about what the purpose of life is. And
how that relates, and how that actually applies, and influences
your day to day life. How I think it should.
So, of course, this is kind of a controversial topic.
And different people have different opinions. But Iím going to
tell you my side of the story. The purpose of
life is: that there is no purpose. And this is
actually a very deep concept. Iím not saying this flippantly.
This is something that Iíve pondered for a long time,
and this is something that Iíve really studied. The fact
is that life, and reality, is neutral. Right? We have
to understand that there is an external world, so to
speak, and then there is an internal world: whatís happening
in our mind. And meaning only exists inside the mind.
It does not exist in the external world. And the
same goes for other human-type conditions. For example: happiness, sadness,
depression, confidence, anxiety, fear, stress. Any kind of emotion, and
generally any kind of meaning thatís attached to anything in
life, exists only in the mind. Thatís the only place
it exists. And purpose is meaning. And that does not
exist anywhere outside. So, there is no objective, one purpose
to life. It kind of is whatever you make it.
And this really reminds me of the Henry Ford quote,
which goes: whether youíre right, youíre right... ErÖ If you
think youíre right, youíre right. And if you think youíre
wrong, youíre also right. Itís kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
So whatever you feel your purpose is in life, it
is what it is. You make your purpose. So that
means that if youíre a nihilist, and you think there
is no purpose, and that life is pointless, then thatís
what it is for you. And, you will be right
in that. And yet if you think that your purpose
is to go out there, and to do something: to
raise a family, to go out there and build a
business, to make some sort of contribution to society, to
just go travel the world, to explore life, to understand
life, to read a bunch of books, whatever, that will
be your purpose. And thatís pretty much the end of
it. Because hereís the thing, like the Buddhists say, reality
is pretty much neutral to your wishes, to your desires.
Itís totally neutral. We live in a world thatís consistent
with that. That means that people can do and think
whatever they want, and believe whatever they want, and there
is nothing really restricting them from that. I can believe
whatever I want, and if I believe it strongly enough,
thatís going to be my reality. Sure, I canít believe
Iím going to fly and Iím going to fly all
the sudden. Thatís not going to happen. Iím not going
to contradict the laws of physics. But, in general, purpose
doesnít work that way. Purpose kind of stays inside your
mind. It doesnít usually hit up against something physical like
the way flying would, or jumping out of a building
and not dying. You know, that you canít work your
way out of that with your mind. But as far
as purpose goes, itís just whatever you feel it is.
And, you know, even though I say there is no
purpose, that doesnít mean I live my life with no
purpose. In fact, I think Iím more purpose-driven, even though
I believe there is no fundamental purpose, than most other
people out there. Because for me, I feel like life
is short. And I feel that even though I have
a purpose, I understand that itís one of an infinite
number of purposes. And that Iím not saying that itís
the only purpose and that itís the one purpose that
everybody else should have. Iím just saying itís my purpose.
And for me, my purpose is: I want to be
the best that I can be. I want to live
up to my full potential in life. I want to
be excellent. I want to live up to high-consciousness values.
Like, I want to honor beauty, and truth, and I
want to understand life, and I want to experience life.
To me, living a full life is the point of
life. And also, another big purpose for me is to
use my conscious mind to understand life. Because I feel
like we are one of the only organisms, maybe in
the whole universe, but at least on Earth as far
as we know, that has a conscious mind, which means
that we can actually understand the universe. Itís kind of
a cool idea that we, being part of the universe,
is like the universe understanding itself. And I feel thereís
something kind of sacred in that. Not objectively sacred, but
subjectively sacred. To me, thereís meaning in thatÖ just understanding
the universe. Like itís cool that we as humans get
the privilege to understand, like, how gravity works. The laws
of gravity, weíve figured that out. We understand mathematics, to
a very exact degree. We understand certain things in philosophy.
We understand human psychology. We understand how all these things
work. We have all this data, all this knowledge that
weíve built up, and thatís amazing that we get to
be part of this reality. We donít even have a
good definition really of what this reality is. We donít
even understand it, but we understand parts of it. And
to me, that process of understanding it, thatís like an
end in itself. And then of course also, experiencing life.
I think that every organism thatís alive also has this
privilege of having consciousness. So there is like, the kind
of analytical consciousness that only humans have. But then there
is just the experiential consciousness which all animals and organisms
have to various degrees. Even a bacteria has a certain
consciousness that we can associate to it, like it can
feel things, it can register different sensations. And the same
with insects, and birds, and then mammals, and monkeys, and
us. And so, we can experience the richness of life.
We can see it, we can smell it, we can
taste it, we can travel the world, we can experience
all this stuff. And to me, to die, and to
not take in as much as we could have ñ
to not understand as much of the world as we
could have ñ thatís a big waste. And Iím not
saying thatís factually, objectively true. I think that in fact,
if I wanted to, I could totally justify sitting around
on my ass and doing nothing my whole life. And
that would be, in some sense, one path, that I
chose. Carlos Castaneda, in The Wheel of Time, has a
brilliant quote about this. And he talks about the warrior.
He talks about how in the ancient Aztec and Mexican
traditions the shaman and medicine men would train warriors. And
these warriors were different then the laymen of the tribe.
And these warriors would go out and pick a purpose,
and they would dedicate their life to it. And they
would be so committed to that purpose that they would
bleed for it, and they would die for it. And
that gave them direction in life, that gave them satisfaction
in life. But, whatís really fascinating about that is that
in his quote he talks about how a warrior chooses
a path, but, even though he chooses a path with
heart, and heís totally committed to it, as though that
path were the one path, and as though it were
the most important path, at the same time he realizes
that that path is no more meaningful, and no less
meaningful, than any other. Itís just like any other. And
that any path you choose is a valid path as
long as itís a path that has heart for you.
So thatís the ultimate question. Donít go around and look
for the purpose of life in a book. Thatís silly.
Donít get it from a video. Iím not telling you
what the purpose of life is. Iím telling you ultimately
that you have to figure that out for yourself. And
whatever you settle on is what itís going to be.
So thatís kind of the bottom line of it, is
that, take this to heart. And really understand what that
means. That if itís up to you, it really is
up to you. And you can choose to squander this
opportunity, or you can choose to make the most of
it. And also, I think you should understand, that as
human beings, we have certain biological needs and tendencies. And
one of those is the need to self-actualize. Which means,
to live up to your full potential. So, as human
beings, as Abraham Maslow talks about brilliantly ñ the guy
who invented the hierarchy of needs that you might have
learned in psychology class ñ well, heís got the lower-level
needs at the bottom, like food, and survival, and shelter,
and then heís got the highest-level need, which is self-actualization.
And he talks about self-actualization. And what he says about
it, very interestingly, is that self-actualization is a need. Itís
a need! Itís the need to live up to your
full potential. And humans have this need. Itís just like
a vitamin. You can be deficient in a vitamin and
then your body will be dysfunctional. And the same thing
with self-actualization. When youíre not living up to your full
potential. When youíre not living up to that highest vision
of who you know you could be, and youíre not
tapping into your greatest strengths, then as a human being,
because you have the psychology that you do, as arbitrary
as it is we just have this psychology, that when
weíre not goal driven, and weíre not pursuing our edge,
and weíre not living a big life, then we start
to feel dissatisfied. And it starts to rot our soul
from the inside. It starts to gnaw at you, it
starts to rot you. It leads to a mediocre, regretful,
painful kind of life. Do you really want that? Maybe
you do? Maybe thatís the path for you: to be
lazy, or not do anything, or to think that you
can just sit around, or to think that living an
average existence, doing a 9-5 job, is perfectly cool. And
maybe that is the case, but I can promise you
this: even if you do commit to that path, understand
that itís going to be a frustrating road to hoe.
And I would not want to hoe that road. Iíve
done it. Itís soul-destroying. What you want, because you are
a human being, you have this need for self-actualization, is
you want to live up to your full potential. So
that is to me the ultimate meaning and purpose of
life, is self-actualization. That is why I named my website
Actualized.org. Because I want to help people get actualized. Not
enough people understand the deficiency need they have with self-actualization.
I think that so many of us are deficient in
that one area of our lives that we are dissatisfied
and we donít even know why. So, Iím going to
wrap it up there. Go ahead, post your comments. Iíd
love to hear from you. What do you think about
this? What do you think the purpose of life is?
Iím curious. Iíll read and comment. And of course, please
like and share. And then, if you resonate with this
idea of self-actualization, then you will be pleased to know
that you can go to Actualized.org and we have got
you covered on all the self-actualization materials, theory, techniques, strategies
that Iíve researched. And Iíve researched many, many of them,
and I continue to do that because Iím really passionate
about self-actualization. Thatís what Iím about. Go there, subscribe to
the newsletter. A lot of free and amazing content that
you can look at right now that will get you
on that path, get you on that path to get
you self-actualized. You know you want it. I know you
want it. We all want it, because human beings need
it. All right.
