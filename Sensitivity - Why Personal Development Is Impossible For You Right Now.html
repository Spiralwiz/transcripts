hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to share with you a concept that
maybe you haven't thought about before and this is the
idea if you're doing personal development and you really want
to get to that self-actualized point that I keep droning
on and on about what you really need to do
to get this to that point is you need to
develop a greater sensitivity to what your mind and your
body is telling it so I'm going to give you
a few examples so I can really illustrate what I
mean by this and what it really means to develop
what I call a palette for life a better palette
for life so when I started biohacking which I got
into a few years ago I started that because I
heard Dave Asprey the bulletproof exact standard of talking about
biohacking this idea that you can start to get better
performance from your mind from your body by doing things
like exercising in certain ways playing around and testing your
nutrition and then looking at various supplements and other basically
life hacks that you can add into your life and
into your routine to get more performance out of your
body and so I started to ploy it play around
with this I got really excited about it and I
was doing bio hacking for awhile and I still love
to do that but one of the biggest things I
learned from his bulletproof diet and you go to bulletproof
exact comm and see more about what what Dave Asprey
is about but I really got on track I studied
a lot of that stuff got really involved with that
and then branched out into other diets and looking into
other bio hacks but what I learned from that whole
process I think is not so much the specific diet
which I actually kind of backed off of but what
I learned is looking at him as an example of
how he does biohacking and how other biohackers work is
that they have a very keen sense of awareness about
what's happening to themselves right because there's really two ways
to get feedback one way is objective way for example
you can get an EEG machine electroencephalogram attach it to
your brain and you can literally sit and do conscious
thought or do meditation and see it graphed out on
a computer monitor and then you can see what's actually
happening that gives you feedback which allows you to quickly
learn and adapt and to get better results we kind
of want the same thing but we want it in
your in your mind to be happening when you're doing
personal development what I've realized over the years is that
our palate for life has really been blown out by
culture and the media and I'm going to get into
that in a second but just to wrap up my
story with the biohacking in the bulletproof diet what I
learned from Dave Asprey is that he's very sensitive I
don't know if he's just sensitive biologically or whatever but
when you listen to him and you listen to some
of the ways that he does biohacking like he's very
sensitive for example to presence of mold presence of mold
like he'll talk about an example where he's walking down
the subway and you can literally smell the mold and
he sees that the mold has a negative effect on
his cognitive performance personally I can't get I don't have
that sensitivity to mold so it's hard for me to
get that same kind of effect going I don't know
what it is about him but what I've noticed is
that biohackers have to be sensitive because you take a
supplement right let's say you take some fish oil or
you take some other kind of supplement you take some
vitamin C you take this you take that and maybe
you're experimenting with your diet and what's important if you're
trying to get better results is to notice the effect
because when you try something out and it's something that
hasn't been really scientifically validated it's something a little bit
on the edge in the gray zone of whether we
know that it works or doesn't and whether it works
for you you have to have a sensitivity to whether
it's working and the effect that it has and a
lot of these things the problem with them is that
they're very subtle me for example when I started taking
a lot of supplements I got into supplement experimentation right
now taking like 50 different supplements every day but one
of the challenges I had is that I was taking
this stuff but I wasn't really feeling it in my
body I wasn't feeling the effect so it's kind of
just going off of theories that I was reading online
studies research but I wasn't really feeling it and some
of these biohackers claim that they have developed better awareness
so that when you put your attention on these things
you feel a little bit more and I've been noticing
in myself that this is something that you can develop
it's like a sixth sense it's developing a better palette
and it's about taking that supplement and then seeing seeing
what is the subtle effect and a lot of times
that effect can be very very subtle what is a
subtle effect that it has on your workout does it
give you a little bit more juice a little bit
more energy when you're working out does it make your
joints less achy does it make you recover better does
it grow your muscles faster right noticing these very slight
changes does it make you less prone to colds does
it make your cold last long shorter or does it
reduce the severity of them so kind of noticing these
things or maybe when you're working and you're doing something
creative noticing the effect of a brain supplement another thing
that I got into was nootropics which is taking supplements
to enhance brain performance and creativity and there it's also
subtle because a lot of times you'll take these various
supplements like ginkgo and huperzine and and other ones like
that and you're not quite sure if it has an
effect and so you have to sometimes put your will
put a lot of attention on it and try to
develop a bit of an awareness as to whether this
thing is working or not and maybe it's working in
a negative way maybe it's working in a positive way
how much so developing this sense because when you have
that kind of sense it's much easier to do biohacking
and I see personal development as kind of a form
of biohacking it's more like mind hacking it's trying to
get better performance in your life try and create a
more fulfilling life for yourself trying to create more success
by using various psychological techniques and understanding yourself better and
so what I think you need to develop if you're
really trying to become self actualized is more of a
subtlety in how you evaluate the different things that you're
putting in place into your life for example what is
the effect of meditation on your the quality of your
life do you know have you actually tried it out
and if you do try it out you know it's
a subtle effect when you first sit down and start
doing meditation for 20 minutes every day it's not that
long 20 minutes but it's still pretty tough to get
through that what is the effect of that if you
do that for a couple of weeks what is the
effect of it if you do it for a month
two months those effects can be quite subtle and a
lot of people because their palates have been blown out
by media and by society and by expectations unrealistic expectations
what they do is they kind of mist subtle effects
and I'm going to talk a little bit about this
blowing out of the palate in a second but let
me continue on so meditation is one example you know
supplements if you're taking supplements that's basically a form of
biohacking looking at the effects that that can have what
about food though what about your diet do you notice
the effects of diet do you notice for example if
you wake up in the morning and you have a
high carbohydrate high sugar diet like maybe you eat a
bowl of cereal or you'd a candy bar or protein
bar do you notice how that impacts your first few
hours of performance at work do you notice that you
notice maybe that there's an influence on your mood does
it impact your your your tendency for depression does it
make you more anxious does it make you happier you
get a sugar high that you can work off of
really hard but then it kind of crashes you know
what are the effects and I'm not saying that it
it's necessarily all negative there could be positive effects negative
effects I don't know the question is are you aware
of those are you looking for them right and the
other one of course is media like things like television
internet gossip tabloids the news what effect does that have
on your consciousness I think it has a really profound
effect but it can also be quite subtle and there's
a bit of a paradox there and that these things
can be subtle yet they can still have big effects
right because if you're always watching TV if you're always
watching commercials and you're hanging out negative friends and you're
eating low-quality food and you have these negative habits in
place you're not taking care of your body what's happening
is that all that is actually producing a big effect
in your life it's actually dragging your life down it's
dragging your consciousness down it's making you underperform really and
then you don't know why you're unfulfilled but the effect
that can be subtle because it all adds up subtly
all these little things add up and they produce a
big effect there's a bit of a paradox there but
not really because if you think about it's kind of
like that that old example of boiling a frog right
if you take a frog supposedly and you put in
a boiling hot cauldron of water he's going to immediately
jump out if it's already boiling and you just put
him in there because he's going to notice and he
can be very sensitive to the difference the difference between
where he's at right now room temperature and you know
a hundred fifty degrees boiling water or whatever temperature attack
the difference there is gonna be huge and so he's
gonna he's going to jump out immediately but if you
put him in two lukewarm water and then you slowly
crank up the heat over a span of thirty minutes
then the so the story goes that frog is going
to boil he's not even going to jump out even
though the temperature's rising is rising is rising eventually is
going to rot raise to that same hundred fifty degrees
he's not going to notice it because it was subtle
it wasn't that dramatic and that's kind of what's happening
here that's kind of what happens when you go down
this negative downward spiral as I call it of for
example feeding your consciousness your mind with low-grade information so
if you're watching a lot of reality TV if you're
looking at a lot of gossip on the internet if
you're following celebrity news if you're following politics and all
the all the negative stuff that goes on there if
you're fighting following war stories and all the negative stories
of the news if you're doing that then it's slowly
you don't even notice the effect it slowly just kind
of takes you lower and lower and lower and what
actually happens is that the effect in your life though
is pretty big because you're not able to live up
to your dreams you're not able to live that creative
kind of life you're not able to go out there
and achieve as much and so you're just living a
comfortable kind of life and you're just settling and you're
finding it difficult and you're finding yourself frustrated and unsatisfied
and you're not quite sure why that is and I'll
tell you why that is it's because you've had these
subtle influences and you're not really sensitive to them I'll
tell you one thing I cut out TV about three
years ago I don't watch TV anymore especially cable TV
I don't have cable and one of the things that
I'm really sensitive to now that I didn't realize before
because I used to watch TV basically since childhood up
through until three years ago and so I was kind
of immersed in that I was like a fish in
water and I didn't notice the water and one thing
that I didn't notice was the advertising right and people
talk about advertising being pernicious and advertising having this influence
on us and I never got that until I weeded
myself off of cable TV and I totally took myself
out of advertising I don't look at advertising on the
internet I don't look at advertising on television and so
now when I do very rarely see advertising I'm very
very sensitive to it and it's very powerful like a
whoa like this big hit for example I'm at the
gym and sometimes I even try not to look at
the TV monitors at the gym because I just don't
want that influence but sometimes I'll kind of like watch
the news and I'll just read the the captioning or
I'll just read like the headline of the story and
I just notice the like the negative effect of the
news I just see it it's like whoa that's powerful
I didn't notice that before because I was so immersed
in it or I look at an advertising commercial and
I just see this commercial for something for a movie
for some product for some service and I'm like whoa
like that's such a strong influence it's having such a
strong influence you don't even realize it until you're off
of it the same thing goes for example with food
if you've played around with your diet if you've done
any dieting if you've cleaned up your diet if you've
gone through that process you also notice just how bad
mainstream food is and how horrible of an influence it
has on you and yet at the same time you
also realize that when you were immersed in that when
that was your reality and you didn't know any better
then that was it for you and you felt like
that was totally normal and that you didn't realize the
the way that it was draining your energy the way
was making you sleepy the way it was making you
a key the way it was making you inflamed etc
like one thing that I noticed right now after being
on paleo for a long time is I really reduced
my carbohydrate intake for for about six months and I
didn't eat any sugar really or even any like whole
carbohydrates so I was like a - under 50 grams
of carbs per day which is really low but I
kept that up just to see what kind of influence
it had on my on my body fat and interesting
enough what I notice now is when I go out
and I eat at like I'll get you know I'll
get a coffee at a Starbucks or I'll get a
like I'll get a salad at some eat out place
and I don't need out anymore I usually make all
my own food when I go buy food that's made
for like mainstream Americans what I notice is just how
much sugar is ladened into everything even like some Frappuccino
at Starbucks I sip on that I remember I was
sipping on my girlfriend's Frappuccino just took a little sip
of it and it was like BAM just this hit
of sugar and I'm like that was just one little
sip that was like a tablespoon of Frappuccino and this
is a large cup like 2 or 3 cups of
this sugar Laden Frappuccino like damn like think about that
that's sugar and most people that are drinking that because
they drink it every day or they drink it every
week they just get so accustomed to it they don't
even notice it same thing even with a salad you
eat a salad and you take a vinaigrette dressing that
they put on it like some raspberry vinaigrette dressing like
I was eating a salad at Denny's and I noticed
like damn this salad dressing has a ton of sugar
in it you can just taste it and you don't
notice that unless you kind of go through that process
of cleaning yourself up and so that's what I'm talking
about here is that some of these things are subtle
and it's very easy for your body in your mind
to get acclimated to them but then they can still
have a big net result on your life right if
you're eating that sugary salad dressing even though it's a
salad it's got all that sugar in it that's making
you fat that's making you inflamed that's causing you health
problems if you're eating those frappuccinos there's like nothing nutritious
in them at all so same thing goes there right
and if you're watching a lot of television reality shows
stuff that's low consciousness that's putting you in that kind
of mode so you want to be more sensitive to
this stuff because what's happening is that you're being boiled
alive right now we do kind of live in in
a negative environment and we also live in a very
low consciousness environment and that's not the kind of environment
that's conducive to self-actualization or living a really charged powerful
life so one thing to take away from this I'm
going to tell you is of course look at your
diet and look at what you're feeding your consciousness it's
really really important so why is this happening I think
one of the problems is is that media does have
a big influence and that would we grow up what
happens is that our palate gets blown out and the
best example I have of this and the reason I
say palate is because I think about wine tasting I
took a wine tasting course and I by no mean
I'm horrible wine taster I don't even like wine but
I took a wine tasting course and one of the
things that shocked me about why tasting is that people
can develop their palates so much that they can sense
so much more than I would sense if I just
drank a glass of wine right now and in fact
the instructor that I was learning from this was a
teaching company class about wine tasting and I was learning
from this instructor and she was like one of the
top master wine tasters in the country and these people
they have to go through very rigorous training process to
develop their palate so they can identify all the subtle
little flavors and smells within wine to the point where
they get so good that for their final test and
she was telling me about this is for their final
test what they do is they give them like 30
glasses of wine that are unlabeled and this wine taster
for this tester is going to go through and taste
each one and they have to be so good that
they can identify not only what part of the world
it's from they have to identify what country it's from
and not just the country but which region of the
country it's from so not only is this from Europe
and from France but this is some Bordeaux that's from
you know west of the Rhine or whatever the details
might be of that example but like to me that
just blew my mind because when I taste this wine
I had a hard time I remember buying a couple
of different just varieties I bought like a a Cabernet
and it's Avignon right and then like a Pinot and
I had a hard time even distinguishing those three which
two and experienced even a moderately experienced taster would be
like a no-brainer but since I never drink wine for
me it was really challenging it was really frustrating because
people would be drinking this wine and they'd be talking
about all these subtle things and to me it's like
all I get is a big hit of alcohol because
I don't even drink alcohol so for me even alcohol
is very overwhelming but then I also get this bitterness
and the sourness and then that like just like my
palate doesn't handle it it hasn't developed at my brain
literally hasn't wired itself to be sensitive enough to taste
and smell those different things so my palate is underdeveloped
so I think part of the reason is that we
have underdeveloped palates as we're growing up in this culture
that we grew up in because what's happening is that
the media and everything else is telling us that we
should be expecting climax after climax after climax we should
be expecting kind of a lot for a little in
life right and that's kind of like well you go
to your job and at your job you get a
huge paycheck you'd have to put in a lot of
work you get a huge paycheck and when you go
to a movie it should be an awesome movie that
just thrills you and blast you and it's kind of
like a Hollywood blockbuster movie right it's these causing and
we're like when you eat a we need a burger
with some fries like the fries need to be all
greasy the burger needs to be juicy with a bunch
of bacon in it and bold flavors like barbecue sauce
and hot sauce and mayo and and just like overwhelming
flavor right like we want to be overwhelmed as a
culture and we want to be like wowed and like
bam bam bam bold strong exciting and that's all well
and good but the problem is that when you do
get too much of that you start to lose sensitivity
to those subtle things in life for example I had
this with with hot sauce I love hot sauce especially
Cholula and what I would do is for a long
time I would douse all my food with Cholula all
the time especially like breakfast food and then I started
transitioning not only dousing my breakfast food but I would
douse lunch and dinner just food food food with hot
sauce what happened was that literally I was blowing out
my palate because all I could taste was this hot
sauce it was so bold that I liked it but
on the other hand when I started getting into cooking
and I started watching shows like Top Chef and learning
about the nuances of cooking and the different flavor combinations
you could have my palate was blown out because I
was so tempted to just douse hot sauce and everything
but that's not good when you're trying to learn to
cook because there you want the subtle flavors you want
to have didn't a sense of distinction between different spices
like black pepper and white pepper and pink pepper and
some of the other flavors that you can put in
a queue Minh and and some cinnamon and some clove
and all this other stuff so you can create these
rich and complex dishes but what happens when you create
this subtle rich complex dish and you hand it someone
to someone and then they pour half a bottle of
Cholula over it and they scoff it down what happens
are they really appreciating the nuances and the subtlety that's
in that dish no right and that's literally what's happening
with mainstream I think life that's what happens if you're
living kind of the ordinary mediocre life in America is
that you are very much overwhelmed by the the media
you're overwhelmed by the movies that are out there you're
overwhelmed by the commercials you're overwhelmed by what people are
telling you that you should expect out of life and
you know what you're missing kind of the more subtle
aspects of life for example when you do Weiner self
off of that dirty American diet and you put yourself
or on a clean diet then you become much more
sensitive to things like sugar and fat and you become
very sensitive to the effect that has on your mental
performance and the your physical performance and how you look
you become very sensitive to that stuff and then all
of a sudden you get a deeper appreciation you build
nuances you build distinctions you basically build up a mental
palette for food and then the same thing could happen
when you're doing self actualization work and you're doing personal
development work for example with meditation or with things like
journaling techniques like journaling or doing affirmations or visualizations if
you take a normal person who's kind of gone down
that that low consciousness spiral and he's in a low
conscious of state and you tell him you know what
why don't you meditate for 20 minutes every day and
then after that do 10 minutes of journaling and then
do 10 minutes of affirmations and then do 10 minutes
of visualizations so all in all that's like an hour
of work that you're going to do these different techniques
and then see the effect this has on your life
for the first few weeks that he does that if
he even gets that far which most people never will
because they're so low consciousness that even hand their mind
can't even handle that but let's say he goes and
he tries that out what's going to happen he's not
even to notice the effect that this is having it's
not going to be strong enough because his mind has
been blown out by the culture by the media that's
out there he's been overstimulated and so now he's not
even sensitive to this stuff he's not going to be
sensitive to it and you give him some supplements he's
not going to send him to that and you clean
up his diet for a week or two and he's
not even gonna be sensitive today he's going to say
well it's not a big deal I can still go
back to eating the the garbage that I was eating
at before but when you put him on that for
a couple of months and you really wean him off
of it he starts to develop the appreciation that's necessary
to really get those things to be sustainable in your
life right you need some time to develop an appreciation
for what journaling can do in your life and the
effect that it can have because at first it's subtle
but then it also accumulates and the subtlety it incrementally
builds up to something really large and something really profound
and the same thing with meditation and the same thing
with reading books and the same thing with taking supplements
same thing with cleaning up your diet and going to
the gym and eliminating negative thinking right a lot of
the things that we are not aware of is the
thoughts and emotions that we're having day to day and
how that's influencing the trajectory of our lives and the
reason that people do not reach that self-actualized state because
they're always anxious they're worrying they're stressed they're not realizing
how their thoughts and how their consciousness is shaping their
life in their reality they think that life just kind
of rolls along and that they get a lucky break
here they get a lucky break there sometimes they're able
to to make something happen sometimes they're not but really
what's happening is that their thoughts are influencing them on
such a profound level it's a subtle level but it's
also a very big level that they're missing out on
all the gains that could be made there so then
what I tend to notice is that you go into
self development you read a book and you read about
this technique and then you see it and you try
and you're like well I didn't really get much from
it that's why because you haven't developed the appreciation and
the palette and I think this point can be even
broadened out even deeper and even larger is people are
stopping and are not appreciating the beauty of what life
is and what reality is they're like disconnected from it
because they get hooked on something like easy stimulation and
easy source of stimulation like they get hooked on television
and then when you watch a you know like a
blockbuster movie in the comfort of your house eating eating
a bag of oily salty popcorn and you've got all
these this bold stimulation right the flavor of the popcorn
in your mouth and then the awesome movie before you
and they made the amazing special effects and you've got
the 3d sound system and you've got this awesome lazy
chair that you're sitting in and you've got your cold
sugary coke with nice ice in it and maybe you've
got a nice warm blanket around you and maybe you're
sitting there with your spouse or your girlfriend or whatever
and you're enjoying this that's very comfortable this very easy
life right and when you're enjoying that it's very hard
than to say to that person okay why don't you
just go and sit in a corner close your eyes
and meditate for 20 minutes what do you think they're
going to pick right it's a no-brainer no one's going
to want to go to meditate because meditation is a
subtle is a subtle it's like a subtle pleasure it's
not this bold overwhelming sense of like damn awesome this
is awesome it doesn't feel that way even though sometimes
you can get those moments it's like a cleaner level
of pleasure that you get it's a it's a different
type of pleasure it's the same different type of pleasure
that you get when you're tasting a good glass of
wine or you're eating a fine and it's not overblown
with sugar and salt and hot sauce and barbecue sauce
right it's that same it's that same difference and the
same thing goes for when you tell that person to
go and to create a career for themselves or find
a life calling at first they might say well you
know I have to put in all this work and
this work is so hard it's so challenging I just
want like the end result and George Leonard talks about
this in his book mastery is that culture has really
kind of Don hooked us on this idea of of
looking for the climax all the time commercials will promise
us the magic pill right the get-rich-quick solution to whatever
kind of problem that you have but there's there's like
a subtlety to life that is being missed out there
it's that mastery process because when you're in that mastery
process you're going through and you're being diligent about it
and yeah there's hard work and yeah it's not exciting
it's not as exciting as as playing a video game
or maybe going to a party or taking some drugs
or eating a greasy hamburger or watching an awesome movie
it's not that level of excitement but there's a certain
level of excitement which you can make a case is
even more profound and more rewarding and ultimately more fulfilling
when for example going through this mastery process of mastering
your career or when you're doing meditation or when you're
doing some journaling or when you're doing visualization there's like
pleasure there that I feel is really really underrated and
most people are missing out on because of the low
consciousness high consciousness difference most people are just stuck in
too low of a consciousness to experience those higher consciousness
feelings and they're not pursuing high consciousness values there's low
consciousness values like immediate gratification of pleasure you know eating
a nice meal maybe taking a hit of a drug
watching some television or like kicking ass at work and
getting getting some congratulations from your boss or something like
that or earning some earning an extra bonus on top
of your paycheck like those are low consciousness values you
can pursue those and there's nothing wrong with a certain
amount of fat but I think too much of it
gets you stuck in that low consciousness state and then
eventually you get frustrated because you know you're not living
up to your self actualized state to your higher values
and higher values are things like pursuing beauty and appreciating
beauty and pursuing truth and justice and excellence you know
these things and these when you tell someone to pursue
those and to pursue calmness and peacefulness and excellence and
beauty in their life they're going to laugh at you
if they're in a low consciousness state because is comparing
those two values like these are ethereal very subtle values
these are really bold in-your-face immediate values and so when
you're hooked on those you want that that immediate hit
but what you can do is you can retrain yourself
to get hooked on those higher values and that is
just amazing when you do that when you start to
make that transition you slowly go through the process of
weaning yourself off of the low consciousness values and putting
yourself towards pursuing the high consciousness values your life becomes
so fulfilling that's when you start reading reaching that self
actualized state and you start living that kind of it
like really exciting rewarding like deeply fulfilling life that makes
you happy not just in a short term but in
the long term and you're always optimistic and you're always
you're learning more you're living on your edge and that's
just like an amazing feeling that I want for you
it's the feeling that I want for myself and I'm
always trying to see where I can get more of
that feeling in my life but the larger point that
I wanted to expand this out to is that really
people are missing out on the beauty of life right
it's kind of like we have all this stimulation and
we're so numb to it that when we walk outside
and we just see a tree or we see the
Sun not even a sunset just the Sun out in
the sky where we see the stars or we see
we see a car on the street or we see
we look into someone's face as where as we're buying
something at the store right we're not really appreciating kind
of the uniqueness of life that same feeling that you
had when you were a kid and all this stuff
was new and fresh you were very sensitive to it
and you took a certain joy in it just being
in it being in reality right now just looking at
this monitor right now looking at this video right now
how amazing is it that we have this technology that
you can look at it like there's light coming into
your eyes all this stuff is working all this stuff
is beautiful you don't need some special beautiful sunset to
see beauty there's beauty everywhere you can pick up a
leaf and like examine it really closely and just take
a look at the structure of the leaf and the
veins in that leaf and you can see the little
specks of dirt on it maybe there's a little insect
on it and there's a little smudge and just the
color of that leaf the way it feels the texture
of it the way it smells and you can just
look at that leaf and you can see the beauty
in it but how many of us stop and do
that on a daily basis I know I don't I
don't do nearly enough of that but I want to
do more of it because that is where you get
real enjoyment of life because when you're getting yourself overstimulated
by these bold sensations by these bold flavors you can
never get enough and eventually what it does is it
makes you a slug it makes you a slug because
what you want to do is you just want to
kind of sit back and you want to be spoon-fed
really the best of the best you want to be
spoon-fed the best of the best of the sensations in
the world and what happens is that eventually it's like
you get hooked on drugs it's literally like shooting yourself
with heroin every day what happens is that if you
do that for a long enough time then the pleasures
that we normally would like like eating a nice piece
of food or even watching a TV show that is
typically pleasurable or not to even mention those higher pleasures
like watching a nice sunset or having sex any of
that like all of that pales in comparison because you're
so numb from the heroin that now like what is
going to beat that heroin nothing and all you want
is you want more that heroin that's literally what you're
doing except on a more subtle level when you hook
yourself on TV and low consciousness media and low-quality food
and negative thinking you're blowing out your palate and you're
not being sensitive and it's almost impossible to do personal
development from that state so my prescription here is I
want you to be really aware of this first of
all I want you to start becoming more sensitive to
everything that's happening in your life so for example when
you wake up in the morning and you wake up
15 minutes late and you hit that snooze button five
times I want you to now be more aware of
the effect that has on your consciousness and on the
rest of your day it might be a strong effect
it might be a subtle one so what's going to
happen is you're 15 minutes late but not only are
you late in reality like there's 15 minutes of time
that maybe now you have to scramble you're not doing
the stuff you need to be doing before you get
to work but it's also what is the effect on
your mind on your brain does it make you more
stressed making more panicky does that all of a sudden
trigger a chain of negative thoughts to start rolling in
your mind does it kill that sense of peace that
you'd like to have does it make you less fulfilled
or more fulfilled in life I want you to start
asking these questions and just start noticing what that one
little activity does throughout your day how does that connect
that chain of reason and connect it you know if
you have a string of those days and if you
have a whole year like that what is that going
to do to your whole year and then what's that
going to do to your whole life if your whole
life is lived like that you're waking up 15 minutes
late and hitting the snooze button three times in a
row and then that's just one example there's so many
different areas in your life where you can do this
right what is the effect of the lunch that you
have what effect does that have what about the habitual
thoughts that you have what about the thoughts you have
in the shower when you're in the shower are you
thinking about how bad your relationship is are you thinking
about how bad it's going to be to get into
work and and talk to your boss about the new
project that you're working on are you thinking about your
bills and how you're going to pay them and struggling
with those what is the effect of that what is
that effect on your success and what is the effect
on your ultimate fulfillment in life right start getting sensitive
and the best way to start getting sensitive is to
find the sources that are over stimulating that are blowing
out your palate and eliminate them so right now sit
down identify at least three sources in your life that
are putting you in a low cautious of state that
are honoring low consciousness values that you could potentially eliminate
and raise yourself up and clean up your palate a
little bit so what might that be television cable news
internet news internet browsing and internet gossip celebrity news tabloids
negative friends that you might be hanging out with the
food that you're eating the things that you're failing to
do in your life like the positive habits that you're
failing to stay on on top of any kind of
drugs that you're taking any kind of addictive behaviors that
you have consider all those and find the three find
three that are blowing out your palate right now and
what I want you to do is I want you
to commit to eliminating those because what you're going to
notice that if you make an honest commitment and you
really cut those out let's say you cut out TV
you cut out alcohol and maybe you cut out the
worst of the worst food so maybe you cut down
on soda or sugary drinks juices and sodas you cut
all that out do that for a month and just
notice after a month and it still might be a
subtle shift but yeah if you stay sensitive you can
start to notice the effect that this has and what's
going to do it's going to it's going to make
you go up that high consciousness spiral it's going to
put you in a better position to be more sensitive
and appreciative of the complexity and a subtle beauty of
life and it's going to also make you happier it's
going to make you more successful and be in a
position where you can perform much better but ultimately what
I want for you is to use this just as
an example because this is one example I don't agers
do this once this is a philosophy that you're taking
towards life is that you're expanding your sensitivity and you're
making a conscious choice to suppress the stuff that is
honoring the low consciousness values and to elevate the stuff
that's on honoring the high consciousness values this is what
you have to do to get self actualized alright I'm
going to wrap it up here go ahead and comment
I want to hear what you what you think about
this topic also like it share it link to it
spread it around your friends I want this content to
spread around because it's free that's why I make it
free and then of course go to actualised org for
more videos just like this one all right this is
