Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to rant against naive realism and materialism, because
reality is not physical. I was going to speak on
another topic today, but I felt in a ranty mood,
I was a little pissy. And so I felt like
this would be the perfect time for a nice old
fashioned rant. So here we go. Let's define first though,
what naive realism is, and what materialism is, and what
physicalism is, these are all synonyms for the same basic
worldview are the same basic paradigm. And what I want
to help you do here is I want to really
get you to reevaluate some very core fundamental metaphysical assumptions
that you make about reality. Because this can set your
mind free to go and do some much deeper work
and get some amazing results from that. So what is
naive realism, it's basically the everyday normal conception that human
beings have of reality. And this, we might say, is
just something that is a given to us, almost like
our fundamental basic operating system, as a human organism, we
have this operating system that basically tells us that, hey,
we're alive in a three dimensional space. That's how our
sensory perceptions render reality to us, right? It's like a
three dimensional space, there's objects in it. So it's sort
of an objective world, there's objects with distinct boundaries, we
can move them around, stuff happens throughout linear time. And
space, you know, just kind of progresses linearly, we can't
travel backwards in time. And this, we have a very
hard time distinguishing this, from how reality actually is. If
we buy into naive realism, the model this creates for
us as basically of the universe as this giant empty
three dimensional box with with depth and height. And there's
like a bunch of bouncing particles inside or objects, physical
objects, stuff is happening, they're obeying mechanistic laws. And that's
basically what the universe is. This has been the prevailing
notion for 1000s of years, although in the last 100
years, it's really been completely thrown into the garbage shat
upon by a quantum mechanics and various discoveries within science.
But generally, this goes completely on recognized by, by mainstream
culture, and by most modern people, even the scientists who
do some of these studies, right. And there's this very
fundamental assumption that we have, that when we close our
eyes, or we turn our back, the world is still
there, the world is still there behind me. When I
close my eyes, the cameras still there in front of
me. Stuff is still happening. When I go to sleep.
The world is running. And when I die, the world
will continue to run. And before I was born, the
world was running just the way that we think it
does. Because there's stuff behind the scenes, we have this
assumption of stuff behind the scenes, there's really stuff behind
the scenes. And what I have here is just this
kind of phenomenal field of colors, and sensations and experiences.
But this is all subjective. There's certainly an objective stuff
behind the scenes world, somewhere behind the curtain over there.
That's basically the naive realist conception of the world. And
it's really a very deep seated paradigm. It's a set
of belief systems. But even more than that, it sees
them very hard. I think they're hardwired into the human
brain really, set of assumptions. And it's very difficult to
question these assumptions, but also can be very valuable. I
hate to break it to you. But have you ever
thought about naive real to ever bother to sit down
and really question it? As a system to see if
there's like inconsistencies there? Because if you ever do, it
becomes painfully absurd, very, very quickly. It makes no sense
whatsoever on multiple levels. It makes no sense on the
common sense level. It makes no sense philosophically or rationally.
It makes no sense scientifically given new discoveries that we
have from quantum mechanics and so forth, and it makes
no sense experience Actually, from an empirical perspective, if you
go and actually bother to do some serious empirical investigation.
So let's talk about these various factors. First thing I
want you to do right now is just to become
aware that what you have right here right now in
front of you, that you call reality is this collection
of sensations, right? colors, sounds, feelings in your body. And
that's basically it. That is what we call reality. This
is your sensory field. But notice, even on the very
basic, common sense, and scientific level, not even getting into
quantum mechanics, just the very ordinary science, what do we
know, we know that the brain renders this entire thing.
What you call reality, right? Now look at it, look
at this reality become conscious of it. All of this,
not just your body, not just your face, but other
people, other objects, everything. Science tells us, is being rendered
by the brain. So all of this is mine, this
is not physical right here. Look, look, I mean, just
become conscious of this. Look at your hands. They're not
physical, they appear physical. We call them physical, we like
to think of them as physical. This is not physical,
this is rendered right here by my by my brain.
Okay, and this brain could stop rendering this at any
moment. This is just very common sense stuff. But notice
that under the naive realist paradigm, we walk around, and
we treat reality as though this hand is real, as
though that object over there is real, as though that
car that tree, that person is a real physical thing.
Why do we treat it that way? Well, one of
the reasons is, is because even though this is not
a physical, this is not a physical phenomenon right here.
It's so self consistent. That it sure feels like it's
this hard, solid physical object. Because it's so self consistent.
Right? We tend to have this idea that well, if
reality, if this hand is in physical, that means like,
I shouldn't be able to, like, put my hand through
it. And obviously, I can't, or I should be able
to stick his hand in the fire, and it shouldn't
get hurt or something like that. But this is a
really silly notion, right? That has nothing to do with
whether this hand is physical or not. Yeah, this hand
is physical. But that doesn't mean that I can just
like that it's a ghost hand, and I can just
kind of like, put my other hand right through it.
That's not what non physical means. We're certainly living in
this matrix of phenomenon of colors and sensations, and so
forth. And it follows very consistent rules. But don't mistake
that for evidence of physicality. Same certainly feels physical. But
we know that this entire sensory field is just my
brain rendering stuff. And if we take a look at
all the other animals and creatures that exist in abundance
around the whole planet, it's also pretty common sense, both
common sense and scientific common sense that those creatures have
totally different perspectives of the world. So if there was
a rattlesnake right here, in this room, and it was
looking at this room, it would see a very different
version of this room than what I see of this
room, you might have totally different colors, might have totally
different notions of sound, or even other dimensions of phenomenon
that I have no access to whatsoever. And the more
weird or alien the creature is, from a human being,
probably the more diversity and difference there will be between
how that creature sees the world, right? Like very different
try to imagine and try to imagine what it would
be like if you were a bat, or a rabbit,
or a snake, or even something more different than like
a plant, or a bacterium or a worm in the
ground, right? You would see reality in a totally different
way than a human being does. Now, you might say,
Well, yeah, Leo, that makes perfect sense. So what does
this have to do with naive realism though, and the
nature of reality? Well, it has a lot to do
with it. If you recognize this very important and often
overlooked point, which is that the only thing you have
of reality Is this phenomenal field? Let me repeat that,
because this is so fucking significant and so obvious that
is often very much overlooked. The only reason you even
know that reality exists is because you have this phenomenal
field. That's it, there is nothing more that you've ever
experienced of reality. But this phenomenal field. And any ideas
you have, of anything outside the phenomenal field is actually
just a concept within the current phenomenal field. You see,
it's like you're trying to get this, you're trying to
reach outside of your phenomenal field. But no matter how
far you reach, or how hard you try, you can
never escape the phenomenal field. That's all you have. That's
all you'll ever have, even in theory, not to mention
in practice. That's very important to understand to really appreciate
the significance of that. Because what this does, is this
really calls into question this assumption that there's stuff behind
the scenes. We like to think that there's stuff behind
the scenes. What if there is no other stuff behind
the scenes? This notion of stuff behind the scenes philosophically
is very problematic, because it doesn't really answer anything. Because
it leads to this classical cosmological regress problem, infinite regress
problem. There's actually a famous, ancient myth. I think the
origins of it are Indian, but we don't really know
what the origins of it are. Ancient ancient myth. And
it's, it's found in several different cultures. But basically, what
it says is, this is the cosmic turtle myth. So
you know, 1000s of years ago, when you ask the
person, well, what is the world? What's the foundation for
the world? He would say, Well, according to this myth,
we've got a flat earth with a dome. But then
what's the foundation for that? Well, that sits on the
back of four elephants. Well, what's the foundation for that?
Well, the four elephants stand on a giant tortoise, or
turtle, the cosmic turtle? It's like, okay, well, that maybe
that kind of makes some sense. If you were alive
a couple 1000 years ago, might have made some sense
to you. But then it's like, but wait a minute,
what's the turtle standing on? And that's where the myth
ends. There's, there's nothing under the turtle. The turtle is
just kind of floating in empty space. But even that
to say that the turtle is floating is empty space.
Still, that's a foundation itself, the empty space that the
turtle is floating it. That's a sort of foundation, just
a different kind, right? And of course, you see, the
problem here is that dismiss that doesn't really explain anything.
To say that the world is sitting on top of
a couple elephants on top of a turtle. Well, what
where does that really leave you, it leaves you exactly
where you began, you didn't know what the world was
when you started. And when you get to the bottom
of this philosophical, metaphysical inquiry, you're still basically at the
same place, except now you've made up some elephants and
some turtles. Now, this might seem like silly, and you
might say, Well, yeah, Alia, we don't do that anymore.
Actually, we do exactly this. This is exactly what modern
science does. So I like to criticize modern science. On
the, this, this core issue right here. I mean, modern
science is great at creating gadgets and stuff, great. You
can do some sophisticated calculus calculations and predict trajectories of
planets and orbits and launch spaceships. And that's all good
stuff. But metaphysically there's a deep problem here, because modern
science has the exact same philosophical foundation as this cosmic
turtle. Where did the universe come from all from the
Big Bang? And where do the Big Bang come from?
Well, who the fuck knows? We don't know. We can't
say beyond that. I mean, Leo, we're not fucking omnipotent.
We can know everything, or our knowledge stops somewhere. This
is the same problem that people have with the notion
of God, traditional people. So God is a tricky concept,
because there's two different versions of this concept. Right now,
I'm talking about the basic kind of common mainstream notion
of God. If your notion of God is as a
God who sits in the cloud somewhere who created the
universe, you got the exact same problem as the scientists
with the Big Bang Theory, because you haven't explained anything.
Because now you have to explain where God came from.
And that's like explaining where the turtle came from. It's
like, well, the turtle always existed, Well, God always existed.
Well, the big bang just kind of arose out of
nowhere, or maybe it always existed and just keeps exploding
and collapsing slowly. and collapsing some some notions like this,
right? The problem here is that the mind is playing
a trick on you, when you engage in the sort
of philosophical, metaphysical, hand waving, that's what it is, it's
hand waving, you're ignoring the core issue, and that you're
not tackling head on this assumption of stuff behind the
scenes. That's the core problem that needs to be faced
here. If you look at your phenomenal field, very carefully,
for a long period of time, you will come to
the inevitable conclusion that there is no stuff behind the
scenes, and that the stuff behind the scenes is actually
in the scenes, the scene is all there fucking is.
And that no stuff behind the scenes has ever been
found. Nor will it be found even on principle, it
will not be found, because the stuff behind the scenes
is already in the scenes. And it's a concept and
you're not seeing that it's a concept. Which means that
it's an illusion that's fooling you. So the first thing
you got to do is become mindful enough to see
that stuff behind the scenes this concept. And this is
a paradigm, this is a very deep seated assumption that
you have about the fabric of reality, which is completely
and utterly groundless. There's no evidence for it, no scientific
evidence, and it doesn't even compute. Logically, it makes no
sense. How this could possibly be, because you're facing the
mind body problem. The classical philosophical problem of the mind
body problem, you know, how can mind arise out of
body? What's the possible connection between mind and body. And
this is a very deep problem hasn't been solved for
1000s of years. And the reason it hasn't been sold,
it's because it's based on very flawed, existential premises about
what reality is, right? It assumes stuff behind the scenes.
And this is an assumption that you got to start
to question. And when you really get mindful, and you
really spent a lot of time just observing, the only
thing you have of a reality, which is your phenomenal
field, it's possible to realize, in one giant epiphany, that
the stuff behind the scenes, in a sense, it is
existent, its existence as nothing. This is a very interesting,
paradoxical sort of twist the stuff behind the scenes. It's
there, and it's not hidden from you. It's just nothing.
It's literally nothing. That's what the stuff behind the scenes
is. But that's how you hold reality. When you walk
out the door of your house to go to work.
And you think back, you're like, oh, yeah, my house
is still back there. Right? You're not actually perceiving at
it for what it is, which is literally nothing. In
that moment, or a concept could be an image in
your mind. That's fine as a concept, right? It's important
to get mindful over all those things, so that you're
not sucked into the illusion. Here's the really deep truth
about this assumption of stuff behind the scenes and why
it's so difficult to let go of it. The mind
has a really hard time stomaching the unpalatable truth, that
appearance, has no origin, but itself. It's like, we're the
person in that myth, who's looking at the world, sitting
on top of a couple elephants sitting on top of
a turtle. And we just cannot stomach the idea that
there can just be a world without a elephant and
a turtle underneath it. Right? The elephant in the turtle
makes us feel good about our model of reality. And
the same problem is happening with scientific people who cling
to naive realism. And to everyday people who basically believe
in naive realism without even understanding that they're believing in
naive realism. Right, the default position. If you say you
don't believe anything, the default position is that you're buying
into naive realism. You see that? You're not escaping the
problem by saying Oh, Leo, I don't do philosophy. That
doesn't solve your problem. You're still completely absorbed in naive
realism. It's really difficult for the mind to just accept
that appearance can exist out of thin air. Appearance is
the existence it's the bond line, right, we don't need
an elephant underneath it, and then a turtle underneath that.
And another thing underneath that. And another thing underneath that,
to explain appearance. Here's the thing that really boggles the
mind is when you admit that the appearance is the
reality, and that there's no cause for it. There's no
mechanistic explanation for it. The mind really hates this idea.
Right, really hate this idea, because what it has to
do then is it has to admit that all of
reality is fundamentally unknown, and mystical, rather than physical and
mechanistic. So another assumption that you have is that the
world is mechanistic. And that for something to to be
or to exist, it has to come from something else,
there has to be a cause to it, this cause
and effect thing. And there has to be a mechanism.
But what's the mechanism for the mechanism? Another mechanism? And
what's the mechanism for that another mechanism? And what's the
mechanism for that and other mechanism? Where does it end?
What's the fundamental fucking existential mechanism of all the mechanisms?
There isn't one. Which is why I like this quote
by Arthur C. Clarke. Arthur C. Clarke has this classic
quote that science fiction, nerds love, which is basically that
a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable to us from magic.
And that makes sense. Maybe in 10,000 years, humanity will
get to the point where if you were just dropped
10,000 years into the future, they would have such crazy
technology that it would just blow your mind, you wouldn't
even be able to believe that it's real. I mean,
think about if we took a Greek and ancient Greek
from 2000 years ago, and just kind of plopped him
into the year 2000 and showed him the internet and
cell phones and nuclear weapons and all this crazy stuff,
electricity, you know, it would blow his mind, he probably
have a psychotic breakdown, from seeing all this technology would
be unbelievable to him. Well, the same problem is happening
on an even deeper level with reality itself. Right? reality
itself really is indistinguishable from magic. It is mystical. And
it will always be mystical. And there will never be
a mechanical explanation for it. Because it is it this
is it's being right. It's being there's nothing underneath being
and if there is anything underneath being there's nothing underneath
that thing, right. It's got to end and nothing. A
lot of atheists think that that's what they already believe.
And they might think, well, Leo, yeah, you're just you're
just like arguing for atheism here. No, no, no, no,
no, no, the typical atheist is in complete denial of
what I'm saying. Right? The typical atheist is a naive
realist and a physicalist and believes in causal mechanical explanations.
This is a no go right? This is completely irrational,
it just it makes no sense whatsoever, if you really
investigate it. What's your actually doing as an atheist, who
believes in physicalism, is that you're actually running away from
the obvious, obvious fact, that existence must be mystical and
cannot possibly be any other way. That's what you're running
away from, you're sweeping this under the rug with mechanical
explanations. Your mechanical explanations are good for helping you to
manipulate reality, nothing wrong with manipulating reality. That's a useful,
utilitarian sort of thing. We need that. But what we're
interested here is not in how to manipulate reality. But
what reality is. And what I'm claiming is that it's
possible to actually have a direct empirical understanding or consciousness
of what reality is. And when you have that consciousness,
you'll realize that it's non physical, and that it's 100%
mystical. And you're going to have this oh my god
moment. This massive oh my god moment, when you realize
that the very stuff you've been looking at the whole
time is complete magic. It's just pure magic. That's what
it is. It's just magic. That's what being is it's
magic. And you're never going to explain it away. And
that any attempts you're making to explain it away A
are really your psyche, not willing to humble itself to
this, oh my god experience. That's what you've been running
away from your whole life as an atheist. And that's
actually the thing you have in common with the typical
religious person. That's what you've got in common is that
you're holding yourself back from saying, oh my god, the
typical religious person believes in oh my god, but hasn't
experienced Oh my god. And then the third level of
person is the one who's actually experienced, oh my God.
And so everything I'm saying here is only just to
bully you into accepting and humbling yourself to go out
there and find the Oh my God, and to get
rid of all the bullshit that's in the way of
you finding the Oh my god. And what is that?
Well, it's all your beliefs, it's all your assumptions about
how reality is, it's all your religious training and indoctrination.
It's all your ideas about God and not God, and
atheism and, and science and, and all the ideologies you
have, and all the beliefs you have, all of that
is in the way. And so what I want you
to do is to undermine all that stuff. Get rid
of all these assumptions, to open yourself up to the
mystical nature of reality itself. That's a very beautiful and
amazing thing to actually experience and it can be experienced.
So that's the philosophical critique I have of naive realism.
There's also of course, the just very plain, quantum mechanical
problems with naive realism. For the last 100 years, our
most advanced physicists and scientists have started to understand and
have basically debunked naive realism and physicalism. Quantum mechanics tells
us that there are no such thing as particles, there
is no such thing as matter. There's not even such
a thing as energy. Modern Physics is basically founded upon
fields, what are fields, fields are infinite. And non physical,
conceptual constructs, with values distributed in infinite directions, in, you
know, in infinite ways, and this is a field and
we have multiple of these fields that science posits. And
we treat these fields as though like, oh, yeah, we,
we understand the electric field, the gravitational field, the magnetic
field, the whatever other kind of field, the Higgs boson
field, but all these fields are just a, you know,
it's just like hand wavy, it's it's like, oh, yeah,
it's a field. I mean, they're What's the fucking difference
between a field between God and between? Nothing, that's there's
no difference. People get really caught up on these words,
like, oh, yeah, well, it's a field, it's a field.
So it's not God. Or it's like, well, it's God.
So it's not a field. What's the difference? You're using
words and explanations to hide the fact that you don't
really fucking know what the thing is, which is that
it's mystical. And that you'll never know, because you can't
know. Because it's not physical, it's not mechanistic. See, that's
an assumption that might need to be questioned and dropped.
Now, I'm not going to get into all the technical
details of quantum mechanics, because that's a very complex field.
And it's easy to botch up that field and to,
to use it to rationalize all sorts of stuff. And
people in the New Age Movement have done that they've
used quantum mechanics to justify things like law of attraction,
whatever. And I'm not a big fan of that. But
if you go actually study the works of some of
the deepest quantum physicists. You see that the discoveries they
made have really shaken their epistemic, I mean, metaphysical foundations
of what reality is, like, it's really changed how they
see the world. But that hasn't really percolated through mainstream
culture, because it's so radical. And it seems so far
fetched. And naive realism is so firmly rooted in the
brain and in the psyche, that we just can't seem
to let go of it. And it might take another
1000 years before it really percolates through to mainstream culture,
to the point where everyone that you meet on the
street is like, oh, yeah, I understand the ramifications of
quantum mechanics. But anyways, that's enough quantum care. I'm not
going to go into the details there. Maybe I'll shoot
an episode in the future about quantum mechanics. Let me
address a couple of objections. So you might be listening
to this. You might think, well, Leo, so sounds like
instead of realism, what you're arguing for is here idealism
right? In philosophy. There's this thinks between realism and idealism.
And so what you're just saying is idealism, right? So
am I supposed to now believe in idealism? No, I'm
not arguing for idealism. What I'm arguing for is that
you prove to yourself that reality is mystical. And that's
possible to prove. You can prove it with psychedelics, you
can prove it with meditation, you can prove it with
self inquiry. Prove it to yourself, have the OH MY
GOD moment. So that you can realize once you have
that, Oh, my God moment that, oh, yeah, I've just
been running away from it. I've been trying to sweep
this Oh, my God moment under the rug. And when
you have that, Oh, my God moment, you understand why
you've been sweeping it under the rug? There's some very
good reasons for why you were doing it. It's not
an accident. Now, another objection is you might say, well,
Leo, isn't this just semantics? So you're saying that reality's
not physical? But what's the difference? Whether I believe reality
is physical or non physical? What difference does it make
sounds like this is just philosophy, just words, right? No,
actually, there is an important difference. Because when you believe
that reality is physical, and mechanistic, then you treat it
as such. You live your life in that manner, your
values, and your priorities are materialistic. When you start to
open yourself up to the fact that reality is non
physical, that it's consciousness, your values start to change, your
priorities start to change, your view of Death starts to
change your view of what you're here to do, when
life starts to change, your understanding of the meaning of
life starts to change, your mind radically opens up to
studying new fields that you would never otherwise study. to
even make the shift from physical to non physical, you're
gonna have to undermine a lot of the very core
deep existential assumptions you have about reality, and that in
and of itself, will hugely free your mind and open
you up and create this very powerful, radical open mindedness
in you, which will then create a very great foundation
from which you can go out and do the deep
research you need to do and start to discover that
there's a lot of amazing phenomenon, non ordinary, non mainstream
phenomenon that is possible with personal development and with spiritual
development. You cannot be open to those things. As long
as you believe that reality is physical. And one of
the most important things that I've been doing over the
last year is really systematically undermining my paradigm. That reality
is physical. I'm just like most people, right? I come
from this strong paradigm that reality is physical. And I
still largely have it, it's totally I can just undermine
this, this paradigm at will. It's so deeply rooted in
my psyche that I can't, I still largely feel that
reality is three dimensional, and that it happens linearly across
time. And that when I close my eyes, the room
I'm standing in, still exists out there, right? I still
largely believe all these things, but I have been systematically
undermining it. And it's been opening me up so much.
And, man, this is the thing you got to do.
If you're really serious about personal development. This is the
thing that most people dismiss this philosophy, but which is
absolutely vital, if you want to get to the advanced
stages of personal development, beyond the shallow Tony Robbins sort
of stuff, where you're just like, shooting for success, right?
In your relationships, in your business. And in your career,
if you want to go beyond that. You got to
get existential, gotta get metaphysical, got to question these very
core assumptions. To recap, let me just be very clear
about what I'm saying here. case, it's not clear. What
I'm saying is that space does not exist, time does
not exist, matter and energy do not exist, these things
are not real. These had to be created. You see,
you can't take this shit for granted. You can't you
can't take for granted that the world is occurring within
space, whereas space occurring in you can't take for granted
that the world is occurring within time, whereas time occurring
in this stuff had to be created. And I don't
mean that it was created by some sort of God
out there somewhere. What I mean is that your mind
can add it, your mind created space, your mind created
time, your mind created energy and matter. And the whole
concept of a physical world, your mind created all this,
but you take it for granted. It's extremely eye opening,
when you undermine when you successfully undermine all these core
assumptions, and you look upon the world. And you realize
as though you just woke up from a day, it's
like, oh, my god, I can't believe I ever took
these assumptions for granted. They're such silly assumptions. But they
were so deep and so central to my entire perspective
of the world, that I had no idea they were
assumptions until I really dug deep and undermined them. It's
very important that you undermine your physicalist paradigm if you're
going to do any kind of serious consciousness work. And
what that means is that you undermine the notion that
reality is three dimensional, undermine the notion that reality is
linear, and occurs through time, undermine the notion that you
are a conscious entity within a physical body, undermine the
notion that you have a physical brain, which renders this
phenomenal field. That's not how it works. It's rather the
other way around, is that the brain is rendered within
the phenomenal field. Now, you might ask, well, Leah, what
renders the phenomenal field? And now you're asking the turtle
question, you know, what's the world sitting on? Well, should
I tell you that is sitting on an elephant and
a turtle? Or are you going to be mature enough
to say that, you know what, we don't need the
elephant and we don't need the turtle. Let's face the
thing head on. The phenomenal field is what it is,
it's what it is. It's reality. That's what reality is,
and your job is to surrender to what's true. You
see, the whole problem here is that you don't want
to accept what's true. What's true is so fucking incredible.
That you can't accept it. That's the whole problem. It
requires very deep surrender. You can't just will yourself to
accept this shit. Because it's utterly radically life shattering stuff.
What I'm talking about here, this shit will completely transform
your entire life. If you ever get to the bottom
of this. It's not a little like, oh, yeah, yeah,
I know, reality is not physical. Let's go to the
movies sort of thing. It's not like that. It's like,
no, it's like a fucking Oh, my fucking God. This
means that everything I've ever known about reality is completely
wrong. And what the fuck am I even doing here?
It's more like that. It's a very emotional thing. It's
not a rational, intellectual thing. It's a very deeply emotional
thing. And you have to really undermine this idea that
the stuff like when you close your eyes, that you
think that there's stuff there. And that the way you
see the world, like, if I'm seeing objects, that that
means that there actually are objects, the world has these
boundaries that its objective and, and like it's out there
somewhere. And it's physical, and it's solid. And there's like
real stuff. There's little molecules floating around everywhere. Those molecules
are making up me and they're making up my family
members, and they're making up my car and my house
and that whole thing you have to undermine. So you
stop seeing reality that way, like, just stop it. Stop
seeing reality that way. That's only one way to see
reality, and it's completely illusory. There's nothing true about it.
It's utterly unnecessary. And it's not scientific either. If you
think you fancy yourself a scientifically minded person, drop all
that shit, because none of that is scientific. Science has
never proven the existence of the external world. Never. And
it never will. It can't not even in principle. That's
not what science is. To appreciate what science says I'm
not throwing science under the bus here. Science is important.
To appreciate what science is, though, that's a, that's a
another deep rabbit hole that I can't get into here,
right? But there's good stuff in science. Definitely good stuff
in science. But it's very easy to take that good
stuff in science and then misinterpret that and then create
this sort of metaphysical foundation for science, which just has
nothing to do with reality. Science is actually the best
when it's highly pragmatic. When it ignores metaphysics. That's good,
but that doesn't mean that metaphysics should be totally ignored.
The way science often likes to say science like to
say that all Well, science is all that's important. Because
you can't do metaphysics because science is limited to only
the pragmatic stuff. That's true science is limited to that.
But that doesn't mean that there's nothing valuable to be
gained from doing the metaphysics. So how do you undermine
this paradigm? Well, you question the hell out of it.
And if you want, for the time being, what you
can do is you can actually adopt the opposite beliefs.
Is this a good strategy, right? I'm not telling you
to believe and take what I say here on faith,
that reality is non physical, it doesn't really do you
much good, too stupid to now walk around believing all
reality is not physical. Except in that it can be
a little bit practical. Because if you're so bought into
believing that reality is physical, that you can't shake that
paradigm, what you can do is you can adopt some
opposite beliefs. And apply a lot of skepticism to this
paradigm, just so that you can kind of jostle it
and break it free, break it loose, and nullify it.
Which is very different from just blindly believing what I'm
telling you here. Right? You would really do yourself a
disservice. If you said, Well, yeah, okay, Leo, I agree
with you, fuck physicalism reality is non physical, okay, let's,
let's go live life that way. Now. That would be
a deep mistake, what I'm telling you to do is
to really investigate your most core metaphysical assumptions about reality,
air them out, really air them out, really undermine them
to such an extent that your mind starts to free
up. And you don't know what to believe anymore. And
you're so confused, and you're so lost, and you're so
disoriented, that maybe just maybe for the first time you
look upon the phenomenal field, and see it for exactly
what it is. And not all the shit that you
think it is, and all the interpretations that you've had
about it your whole life. So basically, this is a
form of removing the filters, removing the interpretations, the little
hidden, sneaky, very subtle assumptions that you've been making about
reality, with the ultimate aim of setting your mind completely
free. And having this oh my god experience, when your
mind becomes totally free, you will have this oh my
god experience, it will be the most important experience of
your life. It'll shake everything you think you know about
life and death and people and things and yourself and
consciousness and reality and personal development and spiritual development and
what's possible and what's not possible, and so on and
so forth. And that's the only thing that I really
care about is getting you to that point. So everything
I'm saying here, be very careful not to mistake it
for ideology. When I do one of these rants, I
hope you can appreciate that I do these rants, mostly
for entertainment purposes, not because I'm an ideologue. Don't mistake
a forceful communication, a clear and direct forceful communication and
taking a stance on something as me now being an
ideologue. I don't hold these as beliefs too seriously. I'm
just sharing with you some insights that I've had over
the last year that have been very helpful for me
in a very utilitarian sense to set my mind a
little bit more free, and allow me to have more
direct experiences, more higher consciousness in my everyday life. And
when you get a taste of that, you'll see the
benefits. The deep mistake would be to take this as
a new ideology for yourself, that would have the exact
opposite effect. So be very careful about that. All right,
that's it. I'm done here. So please click like button

This my newsletter. I've got some cool resources there. Check
out the forum. We have cool discussions there. I personally
answer many questions on the forum, give people advice where
I can, and so do many other of the members
there. So they could help you out. If you're just
getting started on this journey and you have some weird
questions or you feel confused. That's a good place to
go check out my life purpose course check out my
book list a lot of the deepest topics that I'll
be talking about in the future, you will not be
able to understand if you don't read some of the
books on my book list. It's very important that you
invest a little bit more to this process than just
watching videos, watching videos good place to start, but you
need to put a little bit more skin into the
game. If you're really serious about seeing the the profound
results that are possible with this work. I am not
an ideologue. I am not here to preach a philosophy
and ideology to you. I don't care about that stuff.
Anything that I preach to you It is done in
a very utilitarian sense. It's just for didactic purposes, it's
a teaching aid. That's all it is. It's partially entertainment,
and partially just bring stuff to your awareness. And then
you got to do the hard consciousness work yourself. And
you got to read between the lines, and not get
lost in the personality, the entertainment of it, and, and
the words in the language, all this stuff is just,
it's stuff. It's communication, communication is imperfect. This is how
it has to be. Every communication is a metaphor. You
might wonder why I don't directly talk about enlightenment all
the time. You might wonder like, well, Leo, why don't
you just turn this channel into a channel about enlightenment?
Just talk about enlightenment all the time. Well, the reason
I don't do that is because actually, I don't feel
like there's much to say about enlightenment. Enlightenment is unspeakable.
The only thing to say that's worthwhile to say about
enlightenment is techniques to help you to achieve it. And
any kind of motivation or inspiration to help you to
get off your fucking ass, stop being complacent and do
the fucking work. That's the only value in talking about
enlightenment. Frankly, it's not even that interesting to me to
teach enlightenment, because there's nothing to say about it. If
you care about enlightenment, go fucking do the work, do
the self inquiry. By the way, on the forum, I
have a whole guide, Leo's Practical Guide to enlightenment, go
follow that guide, and become enlightened. I don't need to
say anything more about it, there's like not much to
say, you either will fucking do the work and you
will become enlightened through it or you won't. And to
me, this, this notion of being a teacher who just
talks about enlightenment over and over and over fucking again,
it doesn't make much sense. To me. What's more interesting
is actually talking about the other important aspect of your
life, which is beyond enlightenment, which is personal growth, developing
the quality of your consciousness, its mastery of yourself, which
extends far beyond enlightenment. The Enlightenment is important. But there's
a lot more interesting topics to talk about within self
mastery, which is what I call self actualization. I love
talking about that stuff. I actually, I do love talking
about enlightenment too. So we're gonna have a mix of
all these things together in the future. Stick around for
deeper topics to come. If you know what enlightenment is,
and you understand it, then go do the fucking work.
You don't need me to be up here telling you
what to do about enlightenment. It's very fucking simple. Sit
down and do the self inquiry and everything else is
a distraction. So if you care about alignment, do that.
And if you don't care about alignment, well stick around,
maybe what you need is you just need some more
inspiration. Maybe you need me to preach to you, and
to say these interesting things, these philosophically sounding interesting things
about what absolute infinity is, and various psychedelic tricks trips
that I've had and other cool things that I've discovered.
And then maybe, at some point, it will quickly and
be like, oh, oh, I can experience it for myself.
And I'm just distracting myself with all this fucking theory.
Well, I guess I guess it's time to buckle down,
sit down and do the the dirty work that I
didn't want to do that I've been avoiding for the
last three years. Okay, well, maybe it'll take you three
years to get there. And that's fine, too. Right? This
is the process. Everyone's at a different place in this
process. So I'm not here to judge you know, wherever
you're at is where you're at. Just realize what my
communications are, and what my communications are not. Alright, that's
very important. Some people lose sight of that point. But
anyways, that's it. Stick around for more in the future,
and I'll see you soon.
