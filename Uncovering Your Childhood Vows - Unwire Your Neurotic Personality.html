hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about uncovering your childhood
vows [Music] Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays I know I
was feeling like I was missing out on the Christmas
spirit this year because I've just been like working a
lot meditating a lot working on stuff to get ready
to go spend some time with my family so just
kind of getting prepared for all that and I didn't
really have any time to like go to stores do
shopping or any of that kind of stuff so I
thought I put on this hat just to get myself
in mood you know it's funny this hat I got
it last year like a couple years ago I was
looking for like the perfect Christmas hat and I went
all around Vegas I went to like all these costume
stores we have some like amazing all year round costume
stores cuz Vegas people party here so they sell like
Christmas stuff like year round 365 days of the year
and I was looking for the Hat and like they
have just like bad hats that didn't fit my head
coat pretty big head if you hadn't noticed and I
just couldn't find a hat that I liked and at
the end of the day I just gave up you
know looking for the damn Hat and then finally I
just go to a supermarket just to go buy some
food or whatever at the end of the day because
I was hungry and then I'm checking out and I
see oh my god they have hats right there at
the like at the checkout counter and it was like
the perfect hat and that's what I'm wearing right now
so anyways I hope you're gonna have good holidays I
hope you're keeping your eye on the ball for 2017
and all the opportunities that that brings to you all
the new stuff that you can be doing how you
can be growing yourself and developing your consciousness but what
I have for you today is actually a very practical
episode you know some people have been whining ever since
I shot that sage video becoming a sage and put
that out there as a vision for you some people
been whining is like Oh actual eyes that works not
practical anymore all these esoteric mystical topics that I don't
want to hear about well look there's still a ton
of practical stuff that I'm gonna share with you I'm
excited to share hundreds of practical topics but also you
got appreciate that just because something's not practical for you
right now doesn't mean that it's not super valuable the
most abstract wisdom and advice is the most powerful it
has the most potential to transform your life but I
understand that you do have to work up to it
right so we're going to throw you a bone here
for those of you who like practical stuff here we
go what we're going to talk about here is this
concept that I've kind of just come up with for
myself that I discovered I don't know I'm sure other
people have discovered it too uh is called childhood vows
and basically what this idea is referring to is that
throughout your childhood as you were growing up and I'm
defining childhood very loosely here from birth till about 25
years old so basically your entire young adulthood and teenagers
are included as you were growing up there a lot
of deep attitudes were cemented in your childhood and in
your teenage years and they are locked into your mind
and your brain they're wired in there and I'm not
just talking about the obvious stuff which is social conditioning
of course we know that the human mind gets filled
with all sorts of social conditioning cultural baggage religious baggage
schooling and all this kind of stuff and a lot
of those beliefs are negative and harmful and limiting okay
we know that we can discuss that elsewhere and I
think I already have but I want to talk about
something else let me point out to you that what
you did beyond just getting socially conditioned is that you
yourself played a big role in shaping your own attitude
in your own orientation towards various facets and situations in
life and that's what we're going to talk about here
so when I talk about vows I mean the vows
that you made the decisions that you made and it
will become very clear to you as I keep going
what exactly I mean by this so what I mean
is is that there were if you can recall there
were moments in your life which were like Forks in
the road and these could have been huge epic decisions
or huge catastrophes and traumas or they could have actually
been and most of them probably were very minor insignificant
situations that happened and then you probably never thought about
them for 10 or 20 years but nevertheless there were
these Forks in the roads some of them were very
major some of them were just very minor but you
made decisions and basically you formed an ideological core based
on which fork in the road you chose did you
choose to go left or right and largely you're not
aware of these choices that you've made and so now
you take it for granted and you have a certain
personality you have certain emotional buttons and triggers you have
certain ways in which you are ideological you have certain
preferences you have certain values and principles which you uphold
or which you move away from and that you react
against and what I want to show you is that
you are paying the cost for this still for these
little sometimes minor Forks in the road decision that you
made you created vows around these situations and that now
this has kind of rigid lied and ossified you turned
it into bone as it were and it's made you
rather inflexible and for this you pay the cost right
now in your life and let me give you some
examples of how just this might work I want to
give you a lot of different examples in here I
want to play a little bit of a trick on
you I came up with a list of examples both
from my personal life some of them are and also
just random examples that I came up with because one
of the ways I like to teach if you haven't
noticed yet is that I shower you with examples because
most teachers actually don't like to give you examples and
then it's very hard to figure out what the hell
they're talking about based off the different abstract concepts it
seems like philosophy so here's a bunch of examples but
the reason I playing this trick on you is I'm
not going to tell you which of these are from
my personal life and which of these are just random
that I came up with why because I keep noticing
this problem of people projecting stuff on me like I
share something that people like oh now all the sudden
I understand Leo's motivation I understand why he does what
he does her I understand what he said and why
he said it and I understand his ego and I
understand his mind and all this and what I want
to make you aware of is that you're projecting a
lot and you're assuming a lot and I understand that
that's fine I do that with teachers too but I
don't want to give you I don't want to make
your job too easy right because some people get cocky
about and then they write me an email or someone's
like oh Leo I know I know this about you
and I'm very confident that you're this way and I'm
like thinking no I'm not I mean you seem to
think so but that's not how it really is because
honestly through these videos you know very little about me
so be careful about assuming what you think you know
about me what my motivations are why I do what
I do and why I say what I say alright
so here are some examples and the first one I'll
give to you this is actually true from my life
when I was probably ah like five years old back
in Russia with my mom and we were like in
a sort of outdoor bizarre place and there was a
man there standing there eating a like a croissant or
some sort of pastry and this was like early in
the morning and I was standing I just took a
little kid with my mom and my mom she made
fun and she sort of judged or criticized this man
for the way that he chewed his food so that
was the situation right that was the event that occurred
and then what did I do I created a vowel
around that and my val was that I will never
chew food in that manner myself and that was it
that was the end of it that was the whole
vow extremely minor thing right you would think like oh
this doesn't have a large bearing on one's life does
it I mean our lives had thousands of these kinds
of situations but what I want to point out to
you is that I'm not just talking about every situation
in your life where you have to make it soon
I'm talking about specifically those situations where you actually made
a decision to be a certain way you made a
decision to have a certain attitude towards a certain thing
and there's a lot of variety in this formula which
I want to trait by giving you more examples right
and the importance of this is that it you then
become ideological about it and you want to stick to
that vow right and then of course you can become
self-conscious you can become guilt ridden you can become judgmental
of others or yourself and so forth so I'll talk
about more of that when we finish with the example
so here's another example here's an event hypothetical a kid
goes to school he needs to speak up in front
of the class to give a speech or a presentation
or something and he gets humiliated that's the event and
the vow might be he might vow that from now
on I'm gonna keep my mouth shut when I'm around
a large group of people that might be his vow
now he didn't have to make that vow there were
a hundred other possible vows he could have made based
on that exact situation or he could have not made
any vows at all he could have just kind of
like brushed it off his shoulder and just said oh
well yeah I got humiliated so wet and just moved
on and then it wouldn't have been a big big
deal but thirty years later this kid who now grows
up and now maybe is um working as a manager
in some big corporation he might still be living down
this vow that he has to keep his mouth shut
when he's around a large group of people and you
better believe that effects how he feels how he interacts
with his coworkers and so forth and in fact it
might become such a big problem that he has to
go to therapy spend thousands of dollars to get therapy
just to discover that when he was um 13 years
old in middle school or whatever that he made this
vow and he might have totally forgotten about it right
because it was such a thing like yeah I got
humiliated but it wasn't like some catastrophe or some huge
trauma so you just kind of escapes your mind let's
do another event another hypothetical let's say that someone was
cheated on this was a guy let's say a guy
was dodon in college by his sweetheart girlfriend this was
his first girlfriend he got cheated on got his heart
broken so then what does he do he makes this
vow he says I'm never going to be loyal to
another woman and then that's how he lives and that's
how he interacts with all future women that he gets
into relationships with do you think that's going to create
problems for him in his life yeah you better believe
it you better believe it and some people might think
well leo yeah of course you know if I got
cheated all by my heart by my college sweetheart or
whatever then of course I too would have made that
vow no that's not the case at all that is
not always the universal reaction to when you get cheated
on is to make a vow that you yourself will
now cheat on others there are a dozen other potential
vows you could have made or again you could have
not made a vow at all it's very important understand
that point all right let's consider another hypothetical let's say
the event is that you're a kid in school and
you get chastised by your teacher for being messy let's
say you're in elementary school maybe you have a messy
desk a messy backpack the teacher sees this she chastises
you for it and the validus this kid makes is
from now on I'm going to be a good little
boy or a good little girl and that's his vow
can you imagine how that can shape his life how
significant that can be that one vowel such a broad
sweeping statement as I will be a good boy or
a good girl from now on that's a huge thing
and you might say well Leo but what's the problem
with that I mean here he's saying that yeah he's
going to be good or she's going to be good
so isn't that a good thing what's wrong with that
well this goes back to the problem of shoulds and
moralization which I've talked about in the past you should
go check out those episodes my rant against morality and
moralizing specifically because the problem here is that when you
put up this valve I will always be the good
boy or the good girl I hope you can see
how many problems that can create in business in relationships
in your interactions with people for example you might now
avoid confrontation for the rest of your life because you
want to be a good boy or a good girl
or you might guilt yourself anytime that you make a
mess you might spill the milk as an adult and
then you feel guilty about it because you made this
vow that you're always going to be good and in
your mind spilling the milk well that's just you being
messy again and now you have this neurotic reaction in
your life where you need to be hyper vigilant about
any kind of messiness everything needs to be spot spot
clean and perfect and then of course when you get
into a relationship with somebody and they don't have that
same kind of vow now you've got conflict in the
relationship because you're this anal neurotic about everything not being
messy but your partner might be a little bit more
messy than you are and then you have conflict and
then you break up and this pattern can continue for
decade and decade and decade and decade see how this
works here's another hypothetical let's say you have a kid
who doesn't really know much about life and he's watching
some movie let's say he's watching Star Wars and in
Star Wars there's like Darth Vader and Darth Vader and
and Luke Skywalker our fighting forces of good and evil
and the kid sees this can you know the movie
is quite emotional maybe it stirs up some emotions in
him maybe even makes him cry a little bit whatever
and then at the end of that movie he says
you know what that Darth Vader he was really evil
I will never be like Darth Vader I will never
join the dark side and now imagine that this kid
will live for 50 60 70 years with this vow
lodged in his brain of he will never join the
dark side he will never do anything that might resemble
the dark side now you might say well Leo that's
good that's what we want we want to teach our
kids not to join the dark side I mean are
you say that what he should have done the opposite
of that no again you have to be careful here
here's the problem with moralization is that when you feed
a kid who isn't very experienced about life this idea
that he should never do anything resembling the dark side
on the surface that sounds great but also now he's
going to be guilting himself for his whole life worrying
about whether the choice he's going to make in his
relationship or in his business or wherever else might resemble
something superficial that he saw in a movie and that
he might think oh well if I say that thing
there if I confront this person here if I need
to have a frank conversation with somebody about some thing
that maybe that's like me joining the dark side and
I don't want that and then that screws him up
and he needs to go to therapy and pay thousands
of dollars and spend years trying to find the source
and the source might be something just as innocent as
this try to get it okay good now next hypothetical
let's say you have an uncle favorite uncle of yours
as a kid and he gets sucked into some sort
of religious cult and then you find out about it
through the grapevine and your family okay that's the event
what's the vow well your vow might be you know
what my uncle got so screwed over by this cult
that I vowed to defend atheism and rationality I'm going
to be a skeptic I'm going to become a scientist
I'm going to defend everything that's rational and logical now
you might say well that sounds great what's wrong with
that but again every time you make a rigid vow
like that it creates problems because now you're going to
be a rationalist Crusader that's what you're going to be
and you're not going to have an ability to to
connect with people who maybe are not cult leaders and
you have no risk of getting sucked into a cult
but as an adult you're going to be around all
sorts of people with different beliefs different religious traditions and
so forth and now you're going to hold all religions
as evil and something to crusade against because of why
well because of this one rash judgment you made based
on one specific circumstance of your uncle getting sucked into
some nasty evil cult you see and you over generalize
you went too far your thinking became black and white
and now actually what happens is that you commit the
very same evil that that cult committed with your uncle
because now you're sort of stuck in a cult of
atheism we reacting against religion and if you don't think
that atheists do this oh boy you haven't seen some
of the bloodthirsty atheists and rationalists out there who are
more bloodthirsty than many religious people can be a scary
thing so watch out here's another example for you hypothetical
let's say that you're a kid and you're maybe you're
like fifteen years old and maybe you're interested in like
starting your own business or something so you're starting a
business maybe there's like somebody you want to contact on
the internet maybe some mentor you look up to and
you contact them and you write them an email you're
like oh yeah I want to maybe become a business
partner with you let's do a joint venture and here's
my idea here's my proposal for what I can do
for you I want to work for you something like
that right and then what do you get back you
get back a rejection email that says no thanks kid
not interested boom or maybe even worse than that you
get back silence nothing at all and so what you
do is you make a vow you say this was
so painful to me because it hurts you right it
hurts when you get rejected so this rejection by emic
via email was so painful that I vow to never
reject anyone as cold-heartedly as this person rejected me and
you might say well that's good that means the person
is now going to grow up to be this nice
compassionate good human being oh no oh no no that's
not how it's going to work how it's really going
to work is that this person will now be neurotic
and now be putting up a fake front of compassion
so for example let's say somebody applies to his list
he grows up now he's like 40 years old and
somebody applies to him now for a job writes him
an email hey you know sir I would like to
work for you yeah yeah yeah right now he reads
this email and he thinks back and this has happened
on a subconscious level he thinks back - uh when
he was 15 years old this happened him and he's
like well this this person isn't right for my business
like he doesn't have the qualifications I'm reading his email
he's clearly not qualified he's not a good fit for
my company anymore but I would feel so bad if
I rejected him I wouldn't want to tell him no
so oh I think I can give him a try
let's give him a try let's hire him anyways even
though I can't afford to hire him and even though
he's not a right fit I'll just hire him anyways
because I I mean I'd rather do that than break
my vow I vowed to never reject anybody as harshly
as he rejected me you know thirty years ago and
so then this leads to all the problems that that
leads to see see how it works it's very sneaky
- this stuff can be very subtle here's another example
hypothetical as a kid you're in your car and your
parents are driving and then you see a homeless man
a bum on the street corner and then you ask
your dad like hey what's that what's that guy doing
there it's like oh yeah it's a bum that's what
happens to you we don't get a good job and
then at that point you vowed to yourself I will
never become like that bum I must have a good
job can you see the kind of problem that creates
now you're going to be neurotically stuck on this notion
of having a good job and that's going to be
a pattern throughout the whole rest of your life that
can create all sorts of problems and complications here's another
hypothetical your mom's company let's say screwed her over and
decided not to cover her medical expenses with insurance when
she has some sort of like serious disease and so
this created some strain in your family right and there
was some anger in your family at the company because
they were supposed to pay for it but they didn't
because of some technicality okay and you're a kid you're
just listening to this you don't really understand the whole
situation and you just see that anger directed towards the
company and then you vow to yourself I will never
work for a corporation ever because those corporations are evil
look at what they did to my mom I will
never work for operation and then when you grow up
think of all the problems that will cause you think
of the kind of resentment and it's little subtle passive-aggressive
attitude you're going to have towards business in general towards
corporations that's going to create problems for you and you're
not going to be open to the possibility of maybe
a corporation who's actually doing good in the world and
offering you a position they might offer you this sweet
position and you're what you're gonna do you're going to
reject you're saying no that corporation is an evil corporation
just like that corporation who screwed over my mom they're
all the same and why are you saying that well
because when you were young you created this vow this
vow is based on very limited world experience and so
it led to this kind of black and white dichotomy
and now you're using that filter as an adult in
a much more complex grayscale world where black and white
doesn't apply so well and that creates problems for you
and finally I like this example hypothetical let's say your
dad was a someone in the community where you grew
up who had a lot of status and good reputation
maybe he was a very successful business person or just
a very successful community leader in your church or something
something like that right and you grew up you're a
kid you were looking up to your dad and you
made a vow because maybe there was some moment where
your dad got an award or maybe he got mentioned
in a magazine a journal something like that and you
know your dad was proud of it your mom was
proud of your whole family was proud of it maybe
you went to celebrate it and then you made a
vow and you said you know what when I grow
up I'm going to be just like my dad in
fact I'm gonna have more status and more reputation than
my dad bit because when you're a kid you think
very simplistically about the world and you think like well
status and reputation sounds are a great thing what could
be wrong with seeking status repete you have no idea
about that all the problems and evils that can happen
with seeking status and reputation you just see the smile
on your dad's face and you think you know what
if my dad is so happy with status and reputation
from getting his picture posted in a magazine article that
I'm going to do the same thing and then as
an adult you could use that to justify any kind
of evil [ __ ] like you might screw over
a bunch of stockholders just to make a good quarterly
report doing some sort of shady you know accounting to
get a good quarterly report so that then you can
get your picture posted in a magazine so you have
the status and the reputation even though the way that
you acquire that status reputation was a um less than
ideal and leads to all sorts of internal conflicts and
a breaking of integrity you see or maybe you're just
spending the rest of your life chasing status and reputation
um Donald Trump alright so anyways you know you see
how this works right so what is a vow the
way that I'm defining a vows is follow it's a
choice that you make about how you will act because
the world is a certain way a choice you make
about how you're going to act in the future because
the world is perceived by you to be a certain
way you have to understand that this notion that the
world is a certain way there is no such thing
it's always a perspective it's always an interpretation it's never
the case that the world that you know the way
the world is and then that then justifies you acting
a certain way those are all interpretive highly subjective highly
dependent upon your emotions at a time and your opinions
and your ideology you see so what's really important here
is I want you to actually go back into the
past and recall as well as you can the moments
that shaped your life the most and sometimes it's not
the most catastrophic stuff sometimes is the little stuff that
shapes your character and your personality now you should already
start to see what the problems are with having strong
vows but let me make it very explicit the problems
are fundamentally that they are mechanical as opposed to conscious
they are inflexible they tend to be very simplistic and
black-and-white which does not work well in a nuanced grayscale
world especially the world of adults especially the world of
high-functioning individuals right black and white thinking works when you're
doing very simple mechanical jobs when you don't have a
high ambition we don't have a life purpose mechanical then
can sort of work fine although it still leads to
problems black and white thinking can soar to get you
by but if you want to be a high-performance individual
you want to be highly successful you want to be
sort of a superstar or a rockstar in your career
you want to have a strong life purpose you want
to be a leader you want to be a visionary
you want to innovate you want to change the world
black and white thinking is not going to work it's
going to stop you dead in your tracks it's also
founded upon very limited experience these vows as an adult
you have a lot more life experience you understand that
as an adult when you have one of these kind
of Forks in the roads you don't make a strong
Val the way you did as a kid I mean
you still can but not nearly as strong because you
have more life experience as a kid it's very easy
to misinterpret the most innocent of things right for example
a kid writes an email to his favorite role model
his role model doesn't respond but the kid doesn't know
that hey Dad like if I wrote an email to
Barack Obama as my role model as a kid right
the kid doesn't know that Barack Obama gets like a
billion in a lad a from everyone you know from
terrorists that want to kill him to like thousands of
school kids so he can't personally respond to all these
emails it's not possible right so the kid gets no
response but he reinterprets that is like oh that must
mean Barack Obama secretly hates me or he rejected me
simply because he doesn't understand that the President had to
say he's a very popular guy he's probably not going
to respond to your email see so that's the kind
of stuff I'm talking about and what this results in
emotionally speaking a lot of emotional problems come from so
a lot of therapy I think stems from this very
issue of talking about the need for therapy rather because
when you start to feel guilty stressful when you start
moralizing to yourself into others you have conflicts with people
you become judgemental you create all sorts of rationalizations and
justifications in your mind for why the world has to
be a certain way this closes you down and it
basically just gets you stuck in life because you just
kind of like when you're a kid you're this like
amorphous blob of water you're very liquid you can move
you're very flexible and then as an adult slowly you
know that water's like the you're putting that water into
a freezer it just kind of freezes congeals solidifies and
then just like turns into rock solid stone and then
you can't budge it for the rest of your life
and then people from their 20s onward are just like
these rocks these stone golems who don't have the requisite
flexibility the requisite variety or creativity necessary to be highly
a highly effective creative individuals who are able to really
solve problems and work around complicated nuanced obstacles so that's
the problem now our goal in this work self-actualization and
consciousness work in general spirituality is to have liberation liberation
from all these rules and strictures and to use consciousness
instead rather than mechanical rules or mechanical vows or habits
and to be flexible that's our goal and to also
not be reactive to not be living our life in
reaction against something you know if someone hurt you in
the past you have to let that go you can't
live with that [ __ ] for the rest of
your life is going to destroy your life and all
the potential that you have it's not going to do
anyone any good not to that person not to yourself
so this is where forgiveness is a good is a
good principle to practice right because so many people are
just living their current life their current life what it
basically is is just a collection of reaction responses knee-jerk
reactions mechanical reactions habituated overtime against all the bad [
__ ] that happened to them that now they're trying
to avoid that's how most people live their life and
that's a terrible terribly unconscious and terribly a limited way
to live your life you don't want that so what's
the solution simple its awareness and understanding and for this
I got a very practical exercise for you so here
it is I got an assignment it's your homework assignment
for this episode you're going to set aside 30 to
60 minutes in silence you're going to sit down with
several sheets of paper or a small notebook and you're
going to try to recall every single decisive moment or
situation that occurred to you from your birth up to
up until maybe 25 years old right from birth to
25 and you're just going to make a list you're
going to brainstorm them sort of in chronological order as
well as you can and just get it all out
and you don't need to write paragraphs just like short
little phrases of like oh um my teacher chastised me
for farting in class okay that was one and then
another one might be um you know I got rejected
by my high school sweetheart okay that's another one another
one might be I got an F in math class
okay you got an F in math class and then
another one might be you know I got rejected from
my favorite college okay write that one down you know
another one might be you know I order some food
and it made me sick okay that's another one right
and so just kind of just brainstorm them spit them
all out you probably have a hundred or more of
these just make a nice long list and keep it
short and don't mention what the vows were yet because
that is where you're going to apply my worksheet I
have a worksheet for you click the link down below
download the worksheet there there's questions that you're going to
be applying to this list that you generate so generate
the list first then apply all these questions and there's
two parts to the to the worksheet so do all
that and you will have some amazing insight into why
you are who you are where personality came from where
a lot of your attitudes and habits came from and
just that awareness alone can start to release you from
the bondage that all these vows and rules have been
keeping you enslaved under alright that's it I'm signing off

that I'm providing to you here is potentially life transforming
and what's really difficult for me to communicate to people
is just how life transforming it will be if you
just stay on board with this process you take action
you do the [ __ ] assignments you watch every
single week and don't make excuses about it and just
keep going keep going don't let any obstacles or doubts
stop you this is a very practical matter if you
disagree with things that I say just keep [ __
] going you don't need to accept everything that I
say but you do need to keep going you need
to keep educating yourself about the potential that you have

next year and more as I'm releasing content as I'm
showing you not only the techniques for how to actualize
your potential but even more importantly which very few people
share with you is your full potential very few people
even in the self-help field who can give you amazing
techniques will actually show you the full scope of your
potential as a human being that's extremely rare and one
of the reasons is because they don't know even people
teaching you enlightened stuff they still don't [ __ ]
know what your full potential is see my passion is
life is finding what the full potential is of things

about life that will blow your mind just absolutely blow
