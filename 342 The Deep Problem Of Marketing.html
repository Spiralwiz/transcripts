            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Cimu22wuJ1U' target='_blank'>The Deep Problem Of Marketing</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Deep Importance of Marketing</b>: Leo Gura explains the far-reaching influence of marketing, highlighting its effects on not just business and sales, but also reality, culture, beliefs, and individual and collective self-actualization. 
</li><li><b>The Challenges of Spreading Truth</b>: Gura points out that truth is hard to discover and even harder to permeate throughout culture due to resistance to new ideas. People instinctively judge new teachings against their cultural upbringing, and new ideas require significant resources and time to gain acceptance.
</li><li><b>Our Materialistic Culture</b>: Gura argues that most people wrongly perceive contemporary culture as perfect due to scientific and technological advancements. He criticizes the deep-rooted materialism in our culture, which has spread globally. 
</li><li><b>Culture, Knowledge, and Reality</b>: Gura explains that our reality is largely constructed by our culture, marketing, and business interests. He emphasizes the battle over what information is exposed to the majority of people, with power over information channels equivalent to power over knowledge.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Propaganda</b>: Gura discusses how subtle propaganda is utilized in education systems to shape individual thought within a specific paradigm, with those in power seeking to maintain dominance and sell consumer goods. He notes that mere rationality and science cannot combat this propaganda.
</li><li><b>Power-Driven Agendas vs. Truth</b>: Gura explains that those interested in power and their own agendas often overlook truth, while those with truth and consciousness seldom seek power. He points out that power-driven agendas manipulate people's values and desires through marketing, selling easy answers and manipulating emotions. 
</li><li><b>Modern Marketing's Lack of Consciousness</b>: Gura sheds light on how marketing is scientifically engineered to manipulate people. He criticizes its lack of ethics, prioritizing sales over truth, health, and humanity, and particularly its damaging role in advertising unhealthy or addictive products.
</li><li><b>Low-Quality Media Influence</b>: Gura criticizes low-quality, time-wasting media and how it distracts people from higher consciousness activities. He also criticizes the profit-driven bias of mainstream news, emphasizing that marketing goes beyond simple advertisements to capture and influence people's attention.
</li><li><b>Irresponsible Marketing Practices</b>: Gura brings to light the societal issues such as obesity, addiction, and inequality that are audaciously fueled by marketing. He alleges that modern marketing promotes fake solutions to real problems to ensure consumers continually engage with their products, thereby maintaining a materialistically focused paradigm instead of promoting higher human values. 
</li><li><b>Role of Employers in Perpetuating Unconscious Marketing</b>: Gura states that even individuals not directly involved in marketing contribute to unresourcefulness if their company uses such tactics. 
</li><li><b>Empowered Individual Control</b>: Gura encourages individuals to take control by being discerning of media they consume, businesses they support, and what marketing they engage with to shape personal and societal evolution.
</li><li><b>Marketing Beyond Mainstream Channels</b>: Urging individuals to actively seek out information and experiences beyond mainstream marketing, Gura emphasizes that responsible marketing should prioritize improving the users' lives, not just selling products.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Unmarketed Knowledge</b>: Gura suggests seeking out unmarketed resources, books, seminars, retreats, and workshops, also proposing government intervention and funding regulation and promotion of conscious marketing.
</li><li><b>Responsible Use of Wealth and Power in Marketing</b>: Gura explains the significance of using wealth and power responsibly in marketing in shaping societal beliefs and culture, and recommends promoting high consciousness ideas and products.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Conscious Marketing</b>: Gura acknowledges the difficulty and fears of transitioning from a well-paid, low-consciousness job to a high-consciousness occupation, yet insists it is necessary for personal growth and self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Abandoning Unconscious Security Blankets and Behaviors</b>: Gura recommends individuals let go of unconscious behaviors or attachments, such as toxic relationships or jobs, that may hinder progress towards higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Discovering and Sharing Knowledge</b>: Gura speaks about his excitement to share what he learns through extensive research and his dedication to the continuing discovery of books, techniques, and resources. He promises to share even more valuable insights in the future.
</li><li><b>Importance of Marketing for Influence and Reaching Audiences</b>: Leo explains that without active marketing, even valuable ideas and profound wisdom could remain unseen and unheard due to obscurity. He notes that individuals only know about things that are significantly marketed to them.
</li><li><b>Power, Control, and Influence over Knowledge</b>: Leo elaborates on how those in power have controlled the spread of information throughout history, starting from kings and dictators to the church, using such control to maintain their power. He highlights that this phenomena doesn't end with the past and still persists in modern times, albeit in more subtle forms such as state censorship or business agenda.
</li><li><b>Business Influence on Science and Academia</b>: He discusses how science and academia are being influenced by modern business and profit maximization, focusing more on technologies that can be sold, patented, and marketed. This creates a bias against research and knowledge that doesn't support business interests.
</li><li><b>Manipulation and Control of Reality and Culture</b>: Leo argues that businesses, academia, and those in power manipulate and control what is considered reality, filling society with their preferred ideas, desires, and fears. These manipulations serve to maintain their power and promote their profit-driven agenda.
</li><li><b>Education as Propaganda and Brainwashing</b>: Leo labels education as a form of propaganda that indoctrinates individuals to think within a set box and accept a certain paradigm. He notes that there's an ongoing battle over what information should be included in educational curriculums, with those in power preferring material that sustains their power and incites consumeristic doctrine.
</li><li><b>Rationality and Science as Not Immune to Propaganda</b>: He refutes the notion that rationality and science will naturally supersede propaganda, explaining that they often become unwitting servants to power agendas due to their inherent need to promote themselves and their fields above all else.
</li><li><b>Conflict Between Power and Truth</b>: Leo suggests that power and the pursuit of truth, reality, and consciousness are largely antithetical. Those interested in truth and consciousness often resign desires for power, while power-seeking entities prioritize their survival and promotion above the exploration and dissemination of truth.
</li><li><b>Scientific and Business Agendas</b>: He explains the agendas of science and business  science aims to further itself above all else, whereas business exclusively focuses on profit and self-enrichment. Neither field prioritizes truth above their primary agendas.
</li><li><b>Science's corruption by business agenda</b>: Science is heavily influenced by business interests given its dependent on the funding it gets from them. Projects that are likely to produce marketable outputs often attract more funding, which unintentionally encourages research that caters to humanity's unconscious instincts for the sake of profit.
</li><li><b>Subjecting reality to marketing's influence</b>: Modern marketing methods go beyond selling unnecessary products to manipulating mindsets and determining reality. Not only does marketing shape values, desires, and pursuit, it also influences how satisfied, content or passionate people feel about their lives.
</li><li><b>Psychological manipulation by marketing and science</b>: Modern marketing uses scientific principles and research to influence people's buying behaviours. The approach lacks consideration for ethics and prioritizes monetary gains, leading to promises of easy solutions which creates consumerist behaviors.
</li><li><b>Huge investment in marketing strategies</b>: Companies are spending billions of dollars in fine-tuning their marketing strategies. This includes testing every single word of an advertisement to ensure emotional responses are triggered in consumers, driving them to spend on low consciousness products that may not necessarily contribute to their ultimate well-being.
</li><li><b>Damaging influence of marketing on popular products</b>: Irresponsible and reckless marketing practices have profound damaging effects on the health of consumers. Particularly in pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and technology industries, false promises and manipulation lead to large-scale addiction and adverse health effects. The industry's relentless pursuit of profit has led to numerous legal suits regarding unethical marketing practices.
</li><li><b>Society's silence on ruthless marketing practices</b>: The harmful effects of ruthless marketing are rarely discussed or dealt with, despite the problems being well-known. This silence is maintained by influential sectors including media, popular culture figures and business moguls, because acknowledging the issue would disrupt the status quo of the society.
</li><li><b>Impact of low consciousness marketing</b>: Indiscriminate and unethical marketing practices have destructive effects on societies beyond just consumer behaviors. Pharmaceutical companies have been known to peddle addictive medications instead of promoting cures, and countless gadgets are marketed as essential to modern life when they are merely luxury or unnecessary.
</li><li><b>Need for reform in marketing practices</b>: Marketing practices today are largely focused on sales and profits, with little regard for the consumers' best interests. This has created a consumer culture that emphasizes short-term gratification while ignoring real solutions to problems. Reforming these practices to prioritize higher values like health, consciousness, and reality is crucial. 
</li><li><b>Emphasizing conscious marketing over unconsciously perpetuating harmful practices</b>: People contribute to low consciousness marketing practices indirectly by consuming or working for companies that harm human consciousness. Disrupting this cycle would require conscious efforts, awareness, and an unconventional approach to conducting businesses. 
</li><li><b>Promoting conscious consumer behaviors</b>: Consumers have the power to stop relying on society for health and truth by becoming aware of the businesses they support and the marketing manipulations they may fall victim to. They should gravitate towards businesses that engage in high consciousness marketing and align with their values.
</li><li><b>Asserting the importance of addressing the limited exposure problem in marketing</b>: People's knowledge and opinion can often be confined to the marketing channels they are exposed to. There is a need to seek out information and experiences beyond mainstream marketing, and focus on genuinely helping and elevating the consumers rather than just selling products. 
</li><li><b>Promoting responsible marketing</b>: Responsible marketing concentrates on enhancing people's lives, offering permanent solutions to their problems and helping them to grow beyond the need for advisory services. People should aspire towards personal growth and self-actualization rather than being passively fed truth.
</li><li><b>Encourage exploring unmarketed knowledge and resources</b>: An abundance of unmarketed but invaluable knowledge and resources are often overlooked in society. These materials can provide vital insights to personal growth and development, and it is our responsibility to discover and share them with others.
</li><li><b>The role of wealth and power in conscious marketing</b>: Wealth and power should be used responsibly, especially in the field of marketing. As marketing can strongly influence cultures and beliefs, it should be conducted with a high level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Transitioning from low consciousness jobs for personal growth</b>: High consciousness work often requires giving up well-paying, low consciousness jobs. Whilst this transition may be daunting, it is essential for personal growth and reaching higher levels of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing and renouncing unconscious behaviors for personal growth</b>: One needs to let go of unconscious behaviors and practices that are limiting their personal growth, such as toxic relationships or unsatisfying jobs. Making the right choices in such scenarios could greatly contribute to personal advancement.
</li><li><b>The visionary approach to personal development</b>: Acknowledging that research is a fundamental aspect of personal development, one should not rush in sharing their findings. Realizing that understanding various topics and discovering the best techniques for personal development requires time and patience is crucial for growth. 
</li><li><b>Continuous learning and discovering the unknown</b>: Acknowledging how little one knows compared to the unknown can be a humbling experience and fuels the desire for constant learning. This quest for knowledge and sharing the findings with others could lead to significant breakthroughs.
</li><li><b>Marketing of Religion</b>: Leo discusses the marketing of religion, stating that even though it may not seem like conventional marketing, spreading the word about various faiths is a form of influence or marketing. He points out that marketing can be used for positive or negative outcomes, on anything from earning money, pitching a religion, or creating a cult.
</li><li><b>The Real Solutions to Problems</b>: Leo criticizes the lack of discourse about real solutions to societal problems on popular platforms like TV or social media. He states that modern marketing offers fake solutions to real problemssolutions designed to keep consumers dependent and coming back for more. 
</li><li><b>Marketing's Contributions to Major Issues</b>: He attributes a range of societal issues such as obesity, heart disease, economic disparity, addiction, and even war to marketing. He suggests that modern marketing maintains a materialistic paradigm, focusing on fulfilling basic human desires rather than promoting higher values like creativity, consciousness, beauty, truth, and love.
</li><li><b>Marketing and Unconsciousness</b>: Leo discusses how the needs and desires of people are marketed to them in an unconscious manner, which creates a vicious cycle. He indicates that even those not directly involved in marketing contribute to its influence if they work in an organization that practices unconscious marketing. 
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility for Marketing</b>: He suggests taking personal responsibility, by being conscious of the media one consumes, the businesses one supports, and the marketing one engages in. While it may be challenging to find conscious work as most work feeds into unconscious marketing, breaking this cycle necessitates conscious efforts and an evolution through stages of higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Bed for Conscious Marketing</b>: Leo calls for responsible marketing, which prioritizes elevating the users and not just selling products. He encourages people to actively look for information and experiences outside of mainstream marketing channels.
</li><li><b>Evolution Through Responsibility</b>: Leo underscores the importance of taking control of one's own life, becoming independent from society's spoon-fed truths, and developing personal growth and self-actualization. He states that responsible marketing should seek to improve lives and offer permanent solutions to problems.
</li><li><b>Role of Marketing in Personal Development</b>: Leo points out the role marketing can play in personal development. Individuals are encouraged to actively search for books, seminars, teachers, retreat programs, and workshops that can help them grow, as these resources often go unnoticed due to lack of marketing. He suggests marketing should aim to aid the spread of knowledge and aid personal development. 
</li><li><b>Wealth and Power in Marketing</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of responsible use of wealth and power in marketing as it can heavily influence people's beliefs and culture. He urges those with influence to feed people with positive and enlightening information, empowering individuals to make better decisions for their lives and contributing to global improvement. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of Conscious Marketing</b>: Leo highlights that conscious marketing is challenging, and there might be temptations to sell harmful products for profit. He urges individuals to choose a high consciousness route even if it may involve transitioning from a well-paying, low consciousness job, as such a decision is crucial for personal growth and enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Unconscious behaviors and Security Blankets</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of recognizing and letting go of unconscious behaviors and security blankets holding us back from change. He shares his personal experience of realizing the misalignment of his business with his higher goals and consciousness and encourages viewers to make informed choices. 
</li><li><b>Future Plans for Sharing Knowledge</b>: Leo shares his excitement about discovering new techniques, books, and resources and his plans to share them. He acknowledges that due to time and energy constraints, the sharing process may take time, but assures viewers that he will continue to provide valuable insights in the future.
</li><li><b>The Distorted Perception of Marketing</b>: Leo Gura elucidates that people tend to have a distorted view of the world by considering the things they are being marketed as the entire range of possibilities. He condemns this mindset as a gross misjudgment of the actual possibilities out there, far beyond mainstream marketing.
</li><li><b>Effort to Discover Unmarketed Knowledge</b>: Leo encourages people to actively seek out unmarketed knowledge instead of waiting for it to come to them or believing only in what is heavily advertised. He argues that the real gems of wisdom and growth are often found outside mainstream channels and require effort to discover.
</li><li><b>Real Purpose of Responsible Marketing</b>: According to Leo, responsible marketing places the elevation of the user's experience and consciousness as its primary motive. The goal is not to make a profit but to genuinely improve people's lives and lead them towards self-actualization, to the point where they no longer need the product or service.
</li><li><b>Marketing Leading to Self-Obsoletion</b>: Leo puts forth an interesting concept of marketing leading to its self-obsoletion. The ultimate aim of responsible marketing is to guide and empower individuals to a point where they can themselves discover truth and wisdom, and won't require external advice or marketed products to self-improve.
</li><li><b>Notice, Discern and Act</b>: Leo urges people to discern between healthy and unhealthy marketing and to objectively assess what information is being marketed to them, and whether it helps to elevate them or is detrimental. He advises people to get proactive in their pursuit of higher consciousness ideas and growth.
</li><li><b>Importance of Marketing Reformation</b>: Leo emphasizes the necessity to reform our marketing system, believing it to be a significant source of societal corruption and a hindrance to the collective elevation of consciousness. He advocates for government intervention and funding to set standards, regulate marketing practices, and promote higher consciousness values.
</li><li><b>Transitioning from Low Consciousness Marketing</b>: Leo urges marketers to transition from low consciousness marketing and warns them of the consequences of continuing to sell unhealthy or unnecessary products. He prompts marketers to self-reflect, improve, and prioritize the elevation of user consciousness over profit.
</li><li><b>Individual Responsibility of Marketers</b>: Leo reminds marketers of their responsibility in shaping ideas, influencing minds, and impacting culture. He urges them to consider their role in shaping the future generations and calls upon them to contribute to making society more evolved.
</li><li><b>Wealth and Power</b>: Leo stresses that those with wealth and power have a responsibility to reform our marketing system rather than further corrupt it. He urges these influential individuals to spread high consciousness information to the masses, which would empower them to take charge of their lives and affect global improvement. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of Conscious Marketing</b>: Growth of consciousness often requires making difficult choices in one's career, such as transitioning from a high-paying, low consciousness job selling harmful products to pursuing a business that promotes high consciousness and personal growth. Leo insists that despite potential financial sacrifice, the latter path leads to enduring fulfillment and happiness. 
</li><li><b>Disconnect Between Enlightenment and Low Consciousness Jobs</b>: Leo underlines the inherent contradiction between pursuing enlightenment and working in a low consciousness job. He warns that an individual's growth of consciousness can become stunted if they continue in jobs that sell harmful or unnecessary products. He emphasizes the need for letting go of unconscious behaviors, toxic relationships, and jobs that do not align with personal growth and higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Transforming Marketing through Personal Growth</b>: Leo shares his personal experience of leaving a successful but low consciousness business upon realizing the incongruity between its operations and his personal development goals. He encourages his viewers to make the right choices in such situations to further their consciousness.
</li><li><b>Leo's Role as a Researcher</b>: Leo sees himself primarily as a researcher who explores a diverse range of topics to find the best techniques and ideas for personal development. He is committed to sharing the valuable lessons he learns from his extensive research with his audience. However, he acknowledges the constraints of his time and energy and promises even more valuable information in the future. 
</li><li><b>Future Visions</b>: Leo discloses his aspiration to spread knowledge on various topics, including metaphysical, epistemic, spiritual, non-dual, and psychedelic things. Despite the challenges and time-consuming nature of research, he stays driven by the excitement of significant discoveries that can contribute to personal development and a more satisfying life.
