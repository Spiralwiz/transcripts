[Music] how to get laid part one do you suck
with women are you a virgin or totally inexperienced with
women do hot women intimidate you do you fear approaching
women do you not understand how women work and what
they want are you shy insecure a loner or socially
awkward are you deeply introverted do you hate socializing do
you believe that no attractive woman would ever sleep with
you if any of these apply to you then this
multi-part series on how to get laid is exactly what
you're going to need this is going to be a
no [ __ ] highly practical guide of field tested
advice not just theory but what it really takes to
turn this situation around for you in your life because
i've been where you've been and i've faced those challenges
and i've overcome these challenges to a large degree and
so i can help guide you into what it really
takes to do this this guide is not going to
be some magic pill solution or some sort of cheesy
pickup line that you use this is the deep changes
that you need to make to yourself into your lifestyle
in order to turn yourself into an attractive man and
to get the kind of results that you uh would
be happy with when it comes to dating this guide
is of course for straight heterosexual men who are interested
in attracting beautiful women i'm assuming that uh if you're
looking for some sort of other kind of advice then
i don't have experience in that i'm going to be
talking about the sort of heterosexual masculine feminine polarity perspective
that's what i have experience with so what is my
experience and qualifications for giving you this advice well actually
quite a bit because as i've said i've struggled with
this a lot in my life and the reason i
struggled with it is because i'm a very intellectual person
i'm deeply deeply introverted and so for me one of
my greatest weaknesses in life has been the socializing aspect
uh being social um doing a lot of small talk
being in extroverted situations being in bars and clubs like
these sorts of environments i didn't even go to a
bar or a club for until i was like 26
years old uh because i had no interest in that
kind of stuff like that aspect of my life um
in a sense i put that on hold because i
was very focused on my life purpose i was very
focused on philosophy i was very focused on my career
and on business for the first 25 years of my
life to the point where i deliberately decided not to
go into dating into socializing that sort of stuff because
to me it's a giant waste of time but of
course the problem with that is is that when you're
neglecting that social domain of your life then it's very
difficult for you to get laid and it's also very
difficult for you to develop the skills you need to
get laid so we'll be talking about that a lot
more but anyways so what happened with me is that
after i was successful with my life purpose and my
business and my career and my finances and all that
and i felt good about all that and also my
education i got all that down then i felt like
okay now it's time to handle this social aspect of
my life the dating and romantic aspect of my life
and so i delved into pickup for a few years
i did thousands of approaches and i basically started the
process from ground zero so that's what's so interesting about
my perspective versus other people because like a lot of
dating coaches that you can find on youtube and so
forth uh first of all a lot of them are
very extroverted naturally that's their personality type uh they're not
logical and they're not very intellectual to begin with so
that makes it a lot easier a lot easier to
get laid when you're not super logical um like for
example i i studied engineering i was very into math
and science so like very very heady logical type of
stuff you know programming a lot of you guys who
are programmers or engineers or maybe doctors are facing this
sort of problem where like you were so career focused
that you neglected the social aspects um of your life
and so anyways uh i went on a multi-year journey
i actually stopped work for about a year to focus
exclusively on this aspect of my life uh basically learning
pickup learning how to talk to girls learning how to
socialize i traveled around the country to different cities did
various kinds of 30-day challenges i did 2000 to 3000
approaches cold approaches i've hung out with winged with and
gotten coaching from some of the best guys in the
world guys who have slept with hundreds of girls guys
who are able to pull girls like every other day
um i've been in some of the best nightclubs in
the world and i've had some uh success now of
course i don't claim to be some sort of master
at attracting women in fact i would consider myself sort
of at an intermediate level my game is it's decent
it's not that consistent i could make it a lot
better i could make it a lot more consistent if
i really wanted to the problem though was that i'm
still very focused on other aspects of my life i'm
more interested in spirituality honestly i'm more interested in psychedelics
i'm more interested in my life purpose i'm more interested
in art than i am in uh in really attraction
uh but at the same time like i've spent thousands
of hours doing cold approach and i've spent thousands of
hours studying the theory behind it in fact the reason
that i first got into pickup was i was more
interested in the psychology behind it understanding how it actually
works more so than i was actually going and talking
to girls or getting sex i didn't get into it
for the sex although of course that's a nice a
nice bonus but you know for me it was about
the understanding and in fact that's how i got so
interested in self-help and ultimately self-actualization ultimately discovering spirituality is
through this sort of this avenue of pickup and so
i'm going to be sharing some of my experiences and
stories about this as we keep going but anyways those
are my qualifications i've paid for boot camps i've studied
pickup theory very well i have a very deep understanding
of like the the theoretical foundations of game and also
what it takes to actually start getting results i've spent
a lot of time studying the differences between guys who
get massive results and those who don't and what they
do and what they don't do so that's where i'm
coming from now i could share lots and lots and
lots of crazy stories with you that i've had in
my pickup journey i mean like obnoxious graphic scandalous things
that i have experienced that my friends have experienced like
crazy stuff stuff that probably shouldn't even be talked about
in public or on youtube maybe in the future i'll
release that episode i don't know um i still have
to think about you know how that's going to be
perceived but like crazy [ __ ] has has happened
and i that i've experienced that have completely uh changed
my understanding of sexuality and how women work how men
work because you have to understand that a lot of
these aspects about how to get sex how to get
laid um these come with a social stigma and so
in mainstream culture it's not polite to talk about these
things there's a taboo about it because people get jealous
because people get very protective of their sexual partners and
who's dating whom like humans love to gossip about this
stuff and humans love to hide who they're having sex
with how many times they've had sex how they get
sex i mean there's a lot of like shady stuff
that goes on and i'm not just talking about pickup
here i'm talking about just sex in general right there
are many myths and fairy tales about how sex actually
works and what's nice about cold approach is that when
you do a lot of cold approach you learn the
the true mechanics behind all the myths and the fairy
tales so i'll be sharing some of those with you
now a warning here some of this stuff can be
graphic some of this stuff can be offensive and some
of this stuff can be uh triggering and the reason
that is is because people are very protective of sexual
value because it's central to our survival right and everyone
in a certain sense is scheming and manipulating to increase
the sexual value that they get from their potential partners
and mates women are doing this men are doing this
now a lot of men and women both lie about
how they do that a lot of them are unconscious
about how they're doing that they're playing games but they're
not even conscious that they're playing games and so to
bring some of these truths to the surface and to
make them explicit and conscious can be very controversial and
so just uh you know a trigger warning some of
the things i say here you might might not like
how it sounds or it might seem obnoxious to you
it might sound misogynistic to you so if uh if
if you're kind of squeamish about that stuff then don't
watch now i've struggled with this aspect of my life
for a long time because i was very introverted and
so basically what had to happen for me to start
getting decent results with women is i started to have
to rewire how my entire mind operated in the social
domain how i thought about socializing developing a sense of
humor and various other aspects of me had to change
in order to start getting success and results so deep
interchange had to happen it wasn't just a couple of
pickup lines that i learned now you might wonder well
leo but why cover this topic at all this is
so unspiritual of you aren't you supposed to be above
this isn't this beneath you isn't it just some sort
of like click baity uh video series that's supposed to
like lure desperate guys in actually not at all because
you see as we've talked about in the past there
is a hierarchy of needs maslow's hierarchy of needs that
exists for for humans and basically for the human mind
to evolve towards caring about higher spiritual truths and metaphysical
stuff and you know things like god and love and
consciousness and meditation yoga to care about these things psychedelics
to even start to care about these things one first
usually has to meet their deficiency needs you need shelter
you need security you need some financial stability and yes
you need to satisfy some of your basic sexual cravings
and cravings for intimacy because if you don't get that
part of your life handled the rest of it is
going to be in one ear and out the other
and if there are ladies watching this and wondering you
know leah why are you talking about this stuff i
don't think you ladies quite appreciate what it's like to
be a guy in his 20s and 30s unable to
get laid just like for you ladies it's not the
same thing for a guy who's not able to get
laid for years this becomes an enormous problem more so
than it is for women for women the act of
getting laid is actually pretty easy you can just go
to a bar or club guys will hit on you
you pick which one you like and it'll happen you
don't have to really work hard for it for guys
it's quite different we have to be proactive we have
to take initiative on this stuff and also sex for
us guys is more important than it is for you
women and it's more difficult for us to procure it
um especially if we start from a from a very
kind of like ground zero position where we're socially dysfunctional
or clueless and so forth and so there's millions of
guys desperate guys who are very thirsty very needy who
have not had sex or might be virgins or whatever
and these guys need a healthy solution they need a
healthy way to resolve this situation their life this the
situation is not just going to solve themselves itself you
can't just tell this kind of guy like oh yeah
just be yourself be cool and you'll get laid no
it's not going to work these guys need a whole
lifestyle change they need a makeover both externally and more
importantly even internally there are certain mindsets that they have
there are a lot of toxic ideologies that are popular
right now um like the in cell ideology the red
pill ideology the black palladium this is very very toxic
stuff so what happens what you need to understand ladies
is that if men are not taught how to be
successful with women in a cool responsible way and how
to meet their sexual needs responsibly then it's not like
they're just going to sit around and enjoy their life
playing their video games and doing whatever else spirituality and
stuff and just be cool with it they're not going
to be cool with it they're going to be deeply
frustrated they're not going to be able to really learn
spirituality because they have this thorn in their side which
is dominating their psyche and it's actually going to start
to if if they ignore that it's going to become
harder and harder as they age they're going to become
more bitter more resentful they're going to subscribe to these
very kind of toxic ideologies which will become very dysfunctional
and these guys even if they do get lucky once
in a while and get a girlfriend or something they're
gonna be bitter resentful very jealous very creepy very socially
awkward and those relationships are gonna be bad for the
guy and for the girl for you ladies and even
they're gonna be uh more widespread societal and political consequences
to this kind of thing and right now because we
are in the internet age where everybody is online everybody
is playing video games and all this sort of stuff
and we're not socializing face to face the way that
our ancestors did for hundreds of thousands of years um
this is making us making sort of our social skills
atrophy that muscle is atrophying and guys are really struggling
with this issue by the millions and so uh i
think that actually showing guys a healthy way how to
of how to meet these needs for themselves is imperative
for the health of society and if we don't do
this this will lead to bad things it'll lead to
rape it'll lead to molestation it'll lead to abuse it'll
lead to toxic fascistic political movements it'll lead to cults
and radical ideologies and um and it's going to lead
to suicides many suicides and many mass shootings they've already
been happening in the news you've seen some of them
and so actually this is a very important topic and
i feel like this talking about this topic can literally
save lives which is why i want to talk about
it and because i have experience in this so uh
yeah it's just guys are either going to pursue sex
in a healthy way or in an unhealthy way there
is really no third option where they don't pursue sex
at all and they're just great guys that's that's not
that's not in the cards that's not gonna happen all
right so now let's get to the meat of the
topic you want to get laid of course so let's
think about this very practically we can count almost on
one hand all the ways that you can get laid
so let's do that and let's talk about the pros
and cons of the different approaches so first there's cold
approach or pickup we'll get back to that then there's
social circle that's the other way most people probably get
laid through social circle then there's your work then there
is celebrity and status then there is online game through
various apps and websites and then the sixth method would
be using money and basically stuff like prostitution and so
forth all right so that's that's basically it there's not
that many different ways to get laid so let's cover
the pros and cons of all these so first we
have cold approach cold approach is basically a pro approaching
a stranger that you don't know a girl that has
never met you before striking up some sort of conversation
in a flirty way and then getting phone numbers getting
dates and getting her into your bed so there's that
approach you can do it during the daytime you can
do it during the night time you can do it
at malls you can do it on on the street
you can do it at cafes you can do it
at bars you can do it at clubs and basically
wherever there are attractive women this is the approach that
i'm going to be mostly talking about and the reason
is because that's the approach that i've have the most
experience with and also in a certain sense this is
the most hardcore the most direct approach if you really
want to understand the mechanics of attracting women and you
really want to build up that skill set this is
the most direct way to do that and you do
it by approaching thousands and thousands of women failing many
many times but also learning and then getting better and
better and better and this is how you really learn
amazing game in a certain sense it's one of the
most flexible approaches here because it works all around the
world uh it works in every major city it works
regardless of language or culture pretty much there are some
variations you know if you're in the middle east and
saudi arabia maybe it doesn't work as well um but
hey even in the middle east they have night clubs
and so forth um but for the most part it
works around most of the world and all you really
need to do to make this approach work is to
move to a large city you do need a large
city that's one of the downsides if you live in
a small town with a thousand people then a cold
approach is not going to work very well for you
so you need you do need to move to a
large city that has millions of people in it uh
but as long as you've got that and there's a
decent nightlife in your city or a decent day game
opportunities in your city with cafes and streets and stuff
like that then you've got a lot of practicing opportunities
and what's great about this approach perhaps the best thing
about this approach is that you can you can completely
suck have z absolutely zero skills the way that i
did when i started and you can learn and it
doesn't matter if you're failing because you have so many
opportunities and there's so much volume that's what's so amazing
about this approach is that the volume you're not in
scarcity you can be in abundance because even if you
screw up one interaction with one girl there's going to
be another interaction with the next girl in five minutes
or in an hour and so it's okay so there's
cold approach uh the other the other thing about cold
approach is that you can get a lot of lays
from cold approach i know guys who have triple digit
lay counts from cold approach uh who have developed such
consistent game that they can pull every other night it's
pretty amazing what can be done there um the next
option is social circle social circle is how most people
get laid this is just from their social circle of
friends um but the downside with this is that first
of all social circle is more geared towards extroverts in
the sense that to run a social circle you need
to be a social person and you got to be
like constantly following up with that and it takes quite
a bit of work to do social circle because you
got to be texting your friends all the time arranging
dinner parties arranging after parties arranging outings to bars into
clubs and like doing all that sort of stuff and
schmoozing and kind of being very indirect so social circle
is more indirect you're building a circle of friends and
you're only going to be sleeping with a small percentage
of the people in your social circle and the one
of the problems with with social circle is that you
have to be very social you have to enjoy doing
that kind of stuff it takes a lot of maintenance
uh one of the downsides is that if you move
cities then you're going to lose your whole social circle
that's a huge downside and you might have to move
for work or just because you want to change the
city that you're living in so social circle can really
tie you down with cold approach you can move to
a different city and you're going to be getting great
results the very next night you go out you can
move to a new city you can even travel around
the world to different cities every week and you can
be getting great results if your game is good enough
no matter what city you travel to you can't do
that with social circle it's very geographic uh also a
social circle to truly have the kind of abundance and
quality of women and dating partners that you would probably
want to have if you have high standards like i
do is that you would need a very massive social
circle of hundreds of people and so just think about
the work it takes to manage that and that's not
just something you'd you can kind of like turn on
and turn off with cold approach for example you can
go this weekend do some cold approach and then let's
say you get a girlfriend and then you can just
stop doing cold approach for a few years with until
you lose your girlfriend then you come back come can
come back now of course your skills will be rusty
but still you can kind of turn it on and
off with social circle you can't do that it takes
a a long time to build up a social circle
and then you have to maintain it because if you
stop maintaining it then your friends will float off and
do other things you'll lose your social circle and then
you'll have to build it all back up again um
there is one huge advantage to social circle which is
that actually if you want the most attractive women as
they say the nines and tens um then it's actually
going to be quite challenging to get those from cold
approach you can get it from cold approach but realistically
what you have to understand about the most attractive women
if your standards are really really high and you want
to date a 10 this girl these girls are so
attractive that literally they can make an entire career simply
from their beauty these girls are usually models or strippers
or um actresses or in other kinds of positions where
like for example guys will give them free travel free
vacations free tables at the best clubs free drinks free
adventures free camping trips free restaurant you know trips and
all this sorts of stuff because these women are very
rare they're very attractive and the guys with the most
money and the most status are chasing after these women
and so if you want to attract this kind of
woman realistically it's not enough just to do a cold
approach on her because when you're doing a cold approach
all you're basically offering her in terms of value is
your self the opportunity to date you you're not offering
her anything more this can work for less attractive girls
who are single it doesn't tend to work so well
on the nines and tens because the nines and tens
they get hit on all the time these girls are
so attractive they get hit on like 20 times a
week so there's a lot of competition for these girls
so it's not enough just to offer the opportunity to
date you you have to offer status you have to
offer value you have to offer social value and these
girls are usually very social and so one of the
best ways to attract these girls is to build us
a giant circle of attractive women mostly women in fact
more than men and then bring in new attractive women
into the social circle and really you're bringing them in
not to have sex with you you're bringing them into
the social circle to be part of the value of
your social circle and then from there since you're the
leader of your social circle of course the most attractive
women will naturally gravitate towards you as the leader because
they're attracted to status we'll get to that in a
minute about what women are really attracted to because there's
a lot of misconceptions about that i'll give you a
whole list here but anyways yeah so so in that
sense when you're the center of your social circle um
you're offering these beautiful women a lot of social value
and you're placing yourself at the center of everything as
a leader and so that's a very reliable way to
attract these women but that takes quite a bit of
work now of course cold approach also takes a lot
of work and so one of the downsides of cold
approach that i forgot to mention is that it takes
a massive amount of practice it's extremely challenging the the
learning curve on cold approach is very very steep and
brutal to the point where most guys can't handle it
it's very emotionally difficult that's probably the biggest downside for
most guys is that they just can't handle the brutal
learning curve another element here of social circle is throwing
parties so you can actually sort of position yourself to
be a guy who throws parties let's say once a
month these big parties uh and you using your social
circle and new people that you meet all the time
that you network with you invite more and more people
to your parties and then at these parties again you're
the leader of this party people are having fun there
it's private parties and so there it becomes very easy
for you to get laid from that i consider that
part of social circle but like you can have like
low levels of social social circle and then you can
have like elite levels of social circle where you're putting
a lot of energy and even money perhaps into throwing
these parties and get a lot of women coming there
and then from that you can get incredible results but
i personally don't have a lot of experience in that
and i'm not so interested in doing that honestly because
i don't like playing social games that much like i
said i'm introverted i have other interests so i'm not
going to be spending most of my time you know
building out a social circle and planning all this sort
of stuff to me it's just it's i prefer a
more direct approach but for those of you who do
like that kind of stuff consider that option and then
you can find others from whom to learn how to
do that the next option for getting laid is through
work in fact i think a lot of people get
laid through work the problem though is it can be
very risky and dangerous and limited to get laid through
work it really very much depends on the kind of
work you have the problem is that a lot of
us have work where we're working from home or working
in a cubicle or working in a very male dominated
company where you're not going to get laid and there's
not very attractive women anyways like if you're a programmer
or an engineer the chances of you getting laid from
your work are very low on the other hand there
are certain kinds of work where you can get laid
a lot for example there was a one guy i
was talking to on my forum and we were talking
about cold approach and he said oh leo i don't
need cold approach i get laid hundreds of times anyways
i'm like well how the hell do you do that
and he says well i work at a women's shoe
store and then i just talk to all my women
customers who are cute and then i just get their
numbers and in this way i've had sex with hundreds
of them and i'm like well yeah of course because
in in essence if you have that kind of job
where you're looking at a you're you're working at a
high volume women's shoe store you're effectively being paid to
do pickup eight hours a day five times uh five
days a week that's essentially what that guy had going
and so yeah of course he slept with hundreds of
women that way the problem though is that that's a
very specific kind of work most jobs aren't like that
there are some jobs that do allow you to network
with lots of people maybe even women especially if you
can get that kind of job then great i mean
like bartenders for example bouncers club promoters if you're doing
large public speaking events if you're doing seminars if you're
doing business conferences and networking events where you're talking to
hundreds of people yeah that that can be a pretty
decent way to get laid um but most work is
not like that and the problem here is that it's
not you're not going to like change your whole career
just to get laid for example if you're a doctor
or a lawyer or an accountant or a science researcher
or an engineer or a programmer you're not going to
quit your your entire line of work just to go
get laid working at some usually low-wage job for example
at a shoe store right so that doesn't work so
well or you're not going to become a bartender it's
not worth it you need some other strategy and the
other problem with work is that of course it's risky
with work because you're mixing work with sex now this
can get very problematic and you know now with the
me too movement and so forth you have to be
very careful about not abusing your position of power at
work for example if you're a boss you can't just
be hitting on your female employees this is not going
to go well for you uh and i don't recommend
that as a dating strategy it's it's a terrible dating
strategy it's also an abuse of power um you know
if you're hitting on your customers that can also backfire
if you're hitting on your clients that can backfire so
see this is very tricky and problematic and then what
happens if you're dating somebody from your work or at
your work and then your relationship breaks up as they
usually do and then what happens there might be a
lot of sour feelings it might get very weird and
awkward you still have to work with with this woman
or maybe she's an important client of yours and then
it just it gets very messy very quickly and so
usually it's not good to mix work with sex and
with your romantic life um uh but but still a
lot of people just meet their husbands and wives through
through work so that's an option it's not a very
good option in my opinion the next option is actually
the best option which is status and celebrity status and
celebrity is the ultimate way to get laid the ultimate
way the problem of course with it is is that
you need to be a a real serious celebrity you
need to have serious status in order for this to
work and so the problem is that just very few
people will actually have that level of status and celebrity
necessary in order to get laid easily and i've actually
had a little bit of experience in this field as
well sometimes people say well leo you're this famous youtube
or you've got a million subscribers so surely you get
laid simply from your celebrity but what you have to
understand is that you guys know me and like my
work but my work is very narrow and niche and
it's very nerdy and it's very technical and so the
bottom line is that actually very few people recognize me
or know me sometimes i get recognized on the street
but it's not enough to make a strategy for getting
laid not to mention that i'm very careful about not
abusing my position of power and whatever celebrity or status
that i do have i have to be very careful
especially because i teach spirituality i teach higher consciousness things
i have to be very very careful not to abuse
that i certainly could do that if i really wanted
to push that but i deliberately again don't want to
mix my work with romance and with dating with sex
too much because that can also again backfire and create
all sorts of problems ethical problems integrity problems and so
forth so i have to be very careful about that
but honestly to be honest with you um while you
might think that i'm some sort of big celebrity i'm
not my celebrity status is basically a zero right um
when i'm talking to a girl she usually doesn't give
a [ __ ] what i do or the fact
that i created actualized work it usually doesn't matter to
her now if she's a fan of mine okay maybe
it does but see i have to be very careful
about dating fans that can also be very toxic and
problematic and create ethics problems um but the bottom line
is that even the celebrity status that i have it's
really not enough to to create a solid strategy for
getting laid occasionally maybe once every couple of years i
could get laid simply from my celebrity status but that's
that's not enough to to really um create a good
dating life for me it doesn't give me enough options
it doesn't give me enough abundance it doesn't give me
the kind of quality of women that i want and
so forth um now if i was a real celebrity
like a hollywood actor in movies or a dj or
a musician or a really famous author or you know
somebody who's really really well known yeah now that can
work if i was a comedian doing giant you know
events with thousands of people watching me yeah that could
easily work and that is the easiest way to get
laid that's why rock stars are some of the most
laid people on the planet and they do the least
work to get it what's also nice about this is
that if you're you can kind of kill two birds
with one stone here because you're combining your life purpose
perhaps with um your dating strategy in such a way
that just by for example being a great artist or
a great musician or a great dj or a great
actor or whatever you're doing that and while you're doing
that at the same time you're creating dating opportunities for
yourself because you're building your status and your celebrity that's
really really efficient a very efficient use of your time
because you don't have to do two separate things um
but again the problem is are you a celebrity do
you have more status than i do because you would
have to in order to get laid effectively and to
be satisfied with your dating life because i'm telling you
even a million youtube subscribers is not going to be
enough to really um create a viable dating strategy out
of that so if if you want i mean i
encourage you guys like those of you who are really
serious go for it build your status become a real
celebrity by doing something big in the world um become
a great entrepreneur become a famous author become a famous
musician or artist become a famous youtuber whatever um you
know blow up become big and then you won't have
a problem getting laid but now you know that's probably
going to take you five 10 20 years to achieve
that what are you going to do in the meantime
how are you going to get laid in the meantime
you see the problem so by all means pursue that
if you want but how many of you are going
to actually achieve that very few therefore i'm not going
to really cover this strategy and also you still have
to be careful as a celebrity you have to be
careful especially now in the metoo era if you're going
to be hitting on your fans and uh and and
playing that kind of game that can also be unethical
and that can also create uh sort of abuses of
power you can definitely abuse your status and your celebrity
to prey on your fans i would uh discourage you
from just treating that flippantly that's that's something you have
to be very very careful and ethical about otherwise it'll
go horribly wrong for you as it has for certain
celebrities the next strategy is online game so this is
tinder okcupidmatch.com and other websites and apps like this i've
i've researched this quite a bit i've experimented almost scientifically
with this method as well so what i've discovered about
online game is that basically there is no online game
online game boils down to your photos and your looks
so it's very much like a pyramid scheme the whole
online game system because see online game is designed for
people who are extremely lazy who don't want to do
any work who just want to click a few buttons
and get laid and since everybody is lazy everybody goes
to online game they want an easy solution to this
problem and and there it doesn't matter what you write
in your profile picture or in your profile description it
doesn't really matter what kind of messages clever messages you
send to girls they're judging you on your photos and
on your looks fundamentally and i've actually split tested this
a b tested this to to confirm for myself this
is absolutely true if you want you can create fake
profile accounts on these websites and actually split test using
different photographs from different fake people and you will see
that looks is 90 of online game it doesn't matter
what you write and so there's no way you're going
to trick beautiful women to sleeping with you if you
don't have the kind of classic handsome masculine looks that
are required i would say that if you're not in
the top 20 of physical appearance in terms of guys
then you're not going to have great results with online
game it's going to be very frustrating you're going to
waste a lot of time you're going to get depressed
and miserable basically the way online game is designed like
it's like a pyramid scheme that is designed to funnel
money from the siphon money basically from the bottom 80
percent of guys the dating app will suck up all
their money um they will hardly get any quality matches
and then all the all the matches will basically go
to the top 20 of handsome looking guys and um
and then those few matches that the the bottom eighty
percent get they will be very low quality girls not
the kind of girls that you would want to seriously
date or have a um serious relationship with and so
online dating especially if you have high quality standards the
way that i do online gaining for example for me
it just it doesn't work it's not effective at all
and for most guys i think it's not going to
be effective for some of you it will so feel
free to try it if you're in the in the
top you know 30 percent let's say of guys in
terms of physical appearance feel free to try it you
might get some decent results um but still you're not
going to be pulling nines and tens from online game
that's not going to happen so uh just keep that
in mind and it is possible to waste a lot
of time on that put a lot of hope into
it and then it's not going to work basically online
game is designed for suckers who are too lazy to
actually go and socialize and meet women face to face
because that's risky that's scary that's difficult so you know
if you want something easy then expect to be fleeced
for that and to pay a cost for that and
then the final option is with money if you have
tons and tons of money of course you can use
money to find gold digger women you can you could
buy prostitutes and escorts you could you could even set
up a strategy where you're paying women for example if
you want to do like a porn to actually do
porn you can be in porn like there's these sorts
of options but this is like the probably the worst
option for getting laid because what you really want is
not just to get laid but you want uh deep
intimacy with a woman you want her to love you
for you you want her to be genuinely attracted to
you and money is not going to do that prostitution's
not going to do that porn is not going to
do that so i i recommend you just forget about
that strategy entirely and that's about it i mean what
other ways are there to get laid if there are
other ways by post a comment down below let me
know but these are most of the ways for how
people get laid so now we're going to be moving
on um i'm going to be teaching you about cold
approach especially in part two of this multi-part series um
i'm gonna be giving you all the tricks and techniques
and all the outer game all the mechanics that i've
learned um but before we get into that first we
need to tackle the the foundation we got to talk
about some of the mindsets some of the limiting beliefs
that you have some of the bad inner game that
you have some of the misconceptions that you have we
have to talk about what it's really going to take
for you to get good with women because if i
just give you the techniques they're not going to get
you laid the techniques only work when you have the
right mindset and then you have a larger framework within
which those techniques are are placed so be patient here
we have to build up to it now there's a
huge misconception about pickup or cold approach which we need
to clear up in mainstream culture there is this sort
of straw man version of what pickup is which is
that it's a bunch of corny fake pickup lines that
you use on women to trick them to sleep with
you that's not really what pickup is that's a very
silly childish version of pickup it's extremely ineffective and actually
you won't get laid from that you're not going to
get laid from any pickup line i'm not going to
be teaching you any pickup lines here instead what i'm
going to be talking about is developing genuine attraction by
turning yourself into a high value genuinely attractive man not
by tricking any woman but by actually genuinely transforming yourself
into a man that most women would find extraordinarily attractive
relative to other guys who have not done this work
there's also a sort of a misconception or perception of
pickup as being very creepy and what i would say
about this is that uh as creepy as pickup might
seem to you you know what's really creepy truly creepy
is guys who have no game they're the most creepiest
guys who are in cells guys who are totally inexperienced
guys who have never approached a girl guys who have
never learned the theory of attraction guys who have not
had a lot of deep experience these are the creepiest
kind of guys these are the most socially awkward kind
of guys and for you ladies who might be thinking
like well leo isn't it unethical to teach guys how
to manipulate women into sleeping with them that's that's one
way to look at it but another way to look
at it is i'm not going to be teaching guys
how to manipulate you girls into sleeping with them i'm
going to be teaching the guy how to actually transform
himself to be somebody who you would actually consider like
high quality boyfriend material or husband material and somebody who
would actually make you wet somebody who actually is good
in the bedroom somebody who has a sense of humor
somebody who's playful and fun and emotional rather than just
some logical boring nerd who you don't want to [
__ ] so we have to make a distinction here
between fake signals of attraction versus genuine attraction i want
to teach genuine attraction not some sort of gimmick and
this is going to require some serious personal development and
this is what ties this topic in with all the
other topics that i teach because see i'm not going
to be just teaching guys how to get into a
woman's pants i want to teach guys how to become
more confident stronger better leaders and men how to get
in touch with their masculinity how to develop a sense
of humor how to be highly social in a genuine
way not using some sort of pickup lines and then
that guy will also go on to do personal development
to self-actualize to follow his life purpose to develop a
career to develop financial stability to develop emotional mastery and
other skills like that to meditate and to do spiritual
work and do psychedelics and to achieve awakening right so
we want to combine both of those things such that
we're taking aspects of that sort of classic alpha player
stereotype a lot of whom those guys are rather scummy
and don't have much to offer to women other just
than just pure raw um you know sexual charisma we
want to take that sexual charisma and combine it with
the sort of solid qualities of the provider guy the
guy who you would actually want to marry or make
your long-term boyfriend the guy who actually has a stable
career and other great things going for him who's psychologically
stable who's not going to you know abuse you or
manipulate you who's not a narcissist and so forth whose
interpersonal development who's into spiritual development combine those two together
and that in a certain sense creates the ideal man
and you ladies you know how hard it is to
find the ideal man who has both of these qualities
either you tend to sleep with players and [ __
] boys who don't offer you anything more than just
sex and won't commit to you or you sleep with
the sort of needy uh nerdy committed provider guys but
then they don't make you physically aroused and emotionally uh
stimulated the way that these narcissistic players do and so
um for you ladies it's difficult for you to find
something in the middle and so well the reason that
is because that something in the middle has to be
developed you're not just born with it you have to
develop it thousands of hours of work have to go
into developing it a lot of theory and then a
lot of practice so i'm i'm i'm very excited about
teaching the theory of this because this is ultimately what
we need we need strong men society needs strong men
and what is a strong male is uh is getting
lost these days there's a lot of toxic masculinity that
is being taught to men these days which is not
really what it means to be a strong man being
a strong man also means being deeply loving being able
to commit being able to do deep intimacy in relationships
and so for you ladies you might be wondering like
well leo why are you just talking about getting laid
why aren't you talking about relationships and teaching us how
men how to do that well i will i'll have
episodes in the future that just focus exclusively on long-term
relationships and building deep intimacy and communication skills we'll talk
about all that stuff conscious relationships that's an amazing topic
and i'm very passionate about that as well but the
reality is is that for guys there cannot be an
intimate deep long-term relationship until he can first get laid
and it's not even enough to get laid you have
to also be able to keep that girl around because
you can sleep with an attractive girl and you'll lose
her because the guy is ungrounded he's not confident enough
he's insecure a lot of guys have just deep insecurity
about themselves because of their physical appearances or other problems
that they faced in their life and that insecurity is
is going to toxify the relationship and there is no
relationship until the girl is attracted and she has sex
so we have to start at the beginning and all
and most guys think about this problem in terms of
how to get laid rather than in terms of how
to get a relationship so for you ladies for example
for you getting laid is not a problem for you
finding the guy who will commit to you in his
high quality that's the problem for guys it's the opposite
for guys the problem is not so much a long-term
relationship for guys the problem is how to get laid
to be honest a lot of a lot of guys
also face problems with being intimate and um and committing
to long-term relationships we'll talk about that in a separate
episode all right so now let's talk about perhaps the
most important lesson from this whole episode which is i'm
going to give you a list of the top reasons
why you're not getting laid as a guy and let's
begin with reason number one the most important thing can
you guess what it is what do you think it
is this is pretty counter-intuitive but also at the same
time very obvious once you hear it what is the
number one reason why you're not getting laid it's not
what you think the number one reason why you're not
getting laid is because you're not being social enough that's
it that's truly the answer a lot of guys think
oh i'm not getting laid because i'm not tall enough
or i don't have a big enough jaw or i
don't have facial hair or because i'm bald or because
my dick is not big enough or because i don't
have enough money no it's not that the number one
reason you're not getting laid is because you're not social
enough it's impossible to get laid unless you are social
that's the bottom line this is the entire foundation of
game all the tricks and techniques in the world are
not going to help you if you are not social
enough and what i mean by being social enough is
that you need to be coming into contact with new
attractive women on a weekly monthly basis in a relatively
large quantity new ones so let's try this get a
piece of paper and i want you to write down
a number this number is approximately how many new attractive
women have you come into contact with face to face
in the last month write down a number how many
what i want you to understand is that this number
is the key to you getting laid this number is
the problem for most of you guys this number is
zero and that explains why you're not getting laid and
if it's not zero then it's some sort of single
digit number like five or nine that's not enough for
you to get laid so the number one thing you
can do to get laid is not some clever pickup
line and it's not to get plastic surgery or a
hair transplant or whatever the number one way for you
to get laid is to increase this number from a
single digit number to a triple digit number that's it
this is the foundation of all game if you don't
do this you're not nothing else will help you and
if you do do this everything else will be a
nice bonus but it won't even be necessary if you
were meeting 200 new attractive women every month at least
a few of them would start to flirt with you
themselves and that would lead to dates and more just
it would spontaneously happen but see if you're living a
very anti-social lifestyle where you're on the internet all the
time and you're playing video games and you're not going
out then you simply aren't meeting new attractive women very
often and therefore it's impossible for you to get laid
so the number two reason why you're not getting laid
is because you're not going out you're playing too many
video games and you're spending way too much time online
on your computer or in your cubicle working or in
your office working rather than being social you need to
be social you have to understand that humans we come
from a deep lineage of socializing face to face with
each other in our tribal ancestral times we would go
and hunt together or we would go pick and gather
berries together and do a little bit of work but
then we would come back and at night we would
all have a party around the campfire and we would
have a feast and we would dance and we would
pray and we would have fun with each other and
we would drink alcohol and take mushrooms and this sort
of stuff and it was a very social face-to-face kind
of environment and in that environment it's easy to get
laid you don't need a lot of game to get
laid in that environment but today when you're playing hundreds
of hours of online games every week and every month
then yeah you're not getting laid that's the problem so
what is the solution to this problem the solution here
fundamentally is to change your lifestyle you see there's no
pickup line that's going to help you here you have
to change your lifestyle you have to realize that wait
a minute i've been living for the last decade a
very anti-social cloistered lifestyle and now i need to do
something to change that otherwise i'm never going to get
laid i'm going to stay a virgin forever i'm going
to suffer from this forever so you need to reach
a pain point where the pain of maintaining your deeply
introverted isolated lifestyle virtual lifestyle that that is more painful
than the pain of going out there and starting to
socialize and changing your lifestyle the third reason why you're
not getting laid is that you're not approaching even if
you're coming into contact with attractive new women you're not
approaching the fourth reason you're not getting laid is you
have no flirting skills and you're way too logical with
women you're not communicating with them in a romantic manner
you're communicating with them in a friendly business manner and
that makes it very difficult for you get laid and
that's why you get friend-zoned the fifth reason you're not
getting laid is that you don't understand what attracts women
this is a deep problem which we're going to correct
in this episode i'll give you a list here in
a minute the next reason you're not getting laid is
because you have a deep victim complex you have many
limiting beliefs and excuses and deep insecurity about yourself you
doubt yourself about your ability to get laid you believe
it's impossible and you have many beliefs like this for
why you think attractive women wouldn't sleep with you and
so correcting that victim mindset that that's the inner game
is very important no techniques will help you so long
as you have this kind of victim mindset and it's
going to be impossible for you even to go out
and to start socializing into approaching women if you have
this kind of victim mindset because what's the point leo
why would i approach women when i already know that
they're going to reject me and they're not going to
sleep with me you see it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
and the final reason why you're not getting laid is
you're not willing to work hard to grow yourself into
the kind of man that women would find attractive you're
so entitled you believe that hot women should just come
to you naturally and like you as you are the
slob the juvenile immature boy that you are sitting there
playing video games in your mother's basement um this slob
you think women should just like you for being that
way no if you want attractive women you're gonna have
to work for them so what i recommend is that
you stop looking for easy solutions like some pickup line
or some new online app or some online dating protocol
that will get you all the hot women the secret
message you can send her on tinder that will get
her to sleep with you no there's no such thing
it's not going to work all that is [ __
] people who are selling you those kinds of ideas
they're fleecing you they're actually using your own pain and
your own victim mentality and your laziness against you to
steal your money you need to bite the bullet here
and you got to attack the root of the problem
everything that i teach throughout my work is always based
on that it's not based on any kind of magical
solution easy solution to anything it's all about attacking root
problems and really fixing them which usually takes years and
takes thousands of hours of work that's why my content
is so niche i could have millions of more followers
and i can get a lot more dates and lays
from my followers if i was peddling you easy solutions
i don't do that i want you to tackle solutions
i mean to tackle problems at their root so what
is the root here the root again is that you're
not social enough and that you're not good with women
and this problem will not go away it will not
solve itself so drop your magical thinking stop hoping for
some woman to land in your lap just by happenstance
just through pure luck it's not gonna happen you have
to be proactive about this you as the guy have
to take responsibility for your dating life to make it
as abundant as you want it to be to make
it as high quality as you want it to be
and the more work you put into it the more
abundance and quality you're going to have so the obvious
solution here is to change your life to become much
much more social and then on top of that you're
going to add proper understanding of attraction theory and then
you're going to do approaching and other things like that
which we'll be talking about so your objective here is
not to get one woman your objective is to become
a strong man and to become good with women in
general a lot of guys sometimes they see a cute
girl at work or in the social circle that they
really like they have a crush on and say oh
you know leo tell me he you know i know
susan from work and you know she seems to be
giving me good eye contact you know what do i
tell her to get her to date me and then
she'll become my girlfriend and then in this manner i
will solve this problem for myself no this is not
going to work you're not going to solve this problem
in that way forget about susie she's probably already friends
then you friend zoned you months ago because of the
way you started off the interaction what you need to
do instead is again bite the bullet and become good
at socializing in general become charismatic and fun become good
at flirting become strong become confident become a secure man
understand what it means to be a man understand what
masculinity is get in touch with your masculine energy also
get in touch with your feminine energy too you're gonna
need both of them to be at your strongest as
a man position yourself near attractive women become more authentically
yourself and not just fake learn how women think learn
what attracts them learn what repels them and also learn
to deal with the common obstacles that come with dating
women there are many many obstacles many areas where even
once she decides to date you you will screw it
up you will screw it up with the way you're
text messaging her you'll screw it up with your neediness
you'll screw it up with the way you set up
your dates you'll screw it up with the way that
you use your uh you know obnoxious sexual humor and
other things like that and she will give you all
sorts of excuses and she'll throw you curveballs too and
you got to be able to deal with those which
requires experience so i recommend you really reframe how you
think about this problem you're not thinking about it about
how to get laid per se you're not doing this
for the sex you're doing this to become a strong
attractive guy and ultimately you're doing this for deep intimacy
and love in the end what i teach is love
what you really want with women is you want love
you don't just want one night stands or a bunch
of sex with a bunch of women although there's nothing
wrong with that per se and that can be very
helpful as part of your journey to maturing towards deep
love but ultimately want what you want is deep love
but to get it first you gotta build some game
and you gotta understand what attracts women you also have
to deal with your victim complex see your mind in
this process of learning to get good with women your
mind is gonna be one of your greatest enemies because
your inner game is awful it's awful you have low
self-esteem issues you have crippling self-doubt you don't believe you
can do it you don't believe you have value you
don't believe you're lovable as you are you believe you
need to be somehow different you believe you got to
be fake you can't be genuine and authentic you believe
all these things you have all these sorts of beliefs
that you got from watching in cell ideology or red
pill ideology or black pill ideology about how women want
this and they want that and they don't they don't
want what you have or you think they need money
or you think your dick is not big enough or
whatever all of these limiting beliefs need to be slayed
and that's a whole ordeal that i can't explain to
you in this episode but we're going to tackle a
little bit here we're going to tackle some of the
limiting beliefs in a minute here um another problem is
that you don't believe part of your inner games that
you don't believe that you deserve or that it's possible
for you to get hot girls you think hot girls
have more value than you fundamentally you don't feel entitled
to hot girls that's a problem if you don't feel
entitled to a girl then you're not gonna be able
to maintain that girl or probably even a tractor to
begin with and also part of your uh inner game
problem is that you're too scared to start taking serious
action you're stuck in paralysis by analysis or you're stuck
making excuses you have so many different excuses for why
you can't get better with women and why you shouldn't
start taking action so all of that is going to
have to be fixed before you can really get great
results with women all right now let's start talking about
how attraction really works because you see your misunderstanding of
attraction has actually warped your mind into making the attraction
of women a lot harder than it really is because
you think they're attracted to something that they really aren't
attracted to so the problem here is that there's a
deep asymmetry within how men and women are attracted to
each other us men were extremely visual and really what
we're attracted to is physical beauty this is just the
truth it's a bit brutal but it's the truth and
so uh we want the hottest most beautiful women as
guys and then we tend to assume that women look
at men in the same way they want the hottest
hunkiest most handsomest beautiful men too but this is actually
a mistake because what you have to understand is that
there is an asymmetry between the masculine and the feminine
and what it needs to survive so really this goes
to the heart of survival so why are you mating
or relating with the opposite sex at all you got
to think about this and you got to think about
it a bit from like the survival evolutionary perspective right
like what is the man's function and what is the
woman's function biology and evolution has differentiated us and has
given us different functions the man's function classically speaking this
is a stereotype but the man's function is classically to
be the hunter the provider the defender the leader the
protector of the woman and her children the woman's function
is to of course give birth to the children take
care of the children and to have the kind of
nurturing energy that is necessary to love those children so
they grow up to be healthy adults that's the fundamental
division of labor that hundreds of thousands of years ago
evolution has decided that we're going to have and it's
rather a beautiful division of labor if you think about
it but also to play these two different roles you
need different strengths and but the strengths come with various
weaknesses so for example what is the strength of the
man what is the function of the man in in
this situation the man's function is to be a good
provider to be a good leader to be confident to
be decisive because a leader needs to be decisive and
to have a position in the tribe because the higher
your position in the tribe the more status you have
in the tribe the easier it is for you to
survive because it's easier to survive in a collective than
it is as an individual so that's what the man
provides the man also provides physical strength that the woman
lacks in order to raise children uh the woman provides
more of like the mother the motherly qualities she's not
as physically strong she can easily be dominated or raped
by other men in the tribe or from outside tribes
um she's not very good at warfare she's not very
interested in warfare but what she's really good at is
she's good at social skills she's good at being social
she's good at people skills she's good at being compassionate
nurturing motherly loving and she cares about raising the children
taking care of the child all that stuff right she's
good at that so that's the mask that's the feminine
versus the masculine now what the masculine wants is that
which the masculine is lacking see the masculine is not
lacking in assertiveness confidence strength status therefore the masculine isn't
looking for that in the woman the masculine is lacking
the beauty and the femininity and that the feminine energy
of the woman that's what the masculine wants that nurturing
loving motherly energy because it it's lacking that men are
oftentimes lacking in empathy and compassion and and love uh
so they want that from the woman therefore they're looking
for the most beautiful the most feminine woman now what
does the woman want from the man does she need
the same thing does she need beauty from the man
is that what she needs the man for no for
the woman's survival she doesn't need beauty from him what
she needs from him is she needs leadership she needs
status she needs strength she needs assertiveness she needs confidence
you see this is actually great news for you men
because it's a lot easier to develop leadership qualities and
confidence and assertiveness and strength than it is to change
your physical appearance now of course if she's presented with
all of the those qualities and very handsome features you
know physical features great of course she'll take it but
rarely do you get everything you want in a in
a potential mate usually you have to settle for things
you don't get everything you don't get the perfect ten
and so if she has to settle for something she's
gonna she's gonna settle for those things which are highest
priority which means the things she needs the most to
survive she her and her offspring which is something more
akin to leadership and to strength than it is towards
uh you know a handsome face for example so men
and women need opposite and different things from each other
and it's actually worse for women because for a woman
if she doesn't happen to be lucky and win the
genetic lottery and be born very beautiful and attractive physically
then it's it's more difficult for her because there isn't
some easy solution for that to change your physical appearance
and you know to turn yourself into a perfect ten
whereas for the man it's easier in the sense that
the man can work really hard i mean you have
to put a lot of work in so in that
sense it's not easy but the man can work really
hard and actually develop qualities like leadership skills and confidence
assertiveness and these kinds of qualities that that women find
very very attractive you can do that and that's exactly
why game works for men and why game doesn't work
for women why do women not do pickup have you
ever wondered this because it wouldn't work for them if
pickup worked for women they would do pick up it
doesn't work for them it doesn't get them what they
need but it does work for men so you have
to understand this fundamental asymmetry within attraction because if you
don't understand this then your mind is not even going
to allow for the possibility that you can turn yourself
into an attractive man i think the biggest inner game
problem that i see today is that guys who think
that just like well i'm not an attractive guy and
there's nothing i can do to change that because the
only qualities that are attractive are my jaw shape and
my muscle size and my dick size and my height
and that's it that defines you know maybe my face
that defines everything that is attractive about a man and
that just is what it is and i can't change
it and therefore i'm stuck well i got great news
for you actually i got some good news and bad
news the good news is that you can change that
the bad news is that um i mean i don't
mean they're you can change your face i mean you
can you can change the fact that you're not attractive
as a man you can change that you can make
yourself attractive the bad news is though that it's going
to be a lot more difficult than you believe and
uh it's going to be emotionally painful to do that
because you're attached to being the kind of loser and
unattractive guy that you have been for the last 10
20 30 years your you're attached to that lifestyle and
i'm telling you you have to change you're going to
significantly change your lifestyle and you don't want to do
that so that's the bad news but the good news
is that if you bite that bullet and do it
then you'll become an attractive man all right so now
let's get to the list of the top limiting beliefs
that guys have about attracting women of course number one
on the list is that i'm not good looking enough
i'm too fat i'm too ugly i'm too short i'm
too bald i'm too asian i have too much acne
i'm too young i'm too old i'm too hairy whatever
so what i was just explaining to you is that
the woman needs something from you much deeper than your
physical features the woman needs masculine energy she needs strength
from you she needs leadership from you and these are
qualities you can develop so people get way too hung
up on their physical features and i know because i
when i started this whole process i was very hung
up on my lack of the right physical features and
in a certain sense i still have insecurities about my
physical appearance i don't consider myself particularly good looking physically
and so that has held me back a lot in
terms of my inner game in terms of my confidence
but see what you have to be careful about here
is you have to ask yourself is it the fact
that i'm short is that the reason why i'm not
getting laid or is it that i'm short but then
i feel now inferior and insecure because i'm short and
therefore the reason i'm not getting laid is not because
i'm short but because i'm insecure about being short and
that's the real reason why i'm not getting laid ask
yourself how would you know the difference between those two
now a lot of guys here would say no leo
it's because i'm actually physically short that's why don't be
so sure about that for example i'm six foot two
and you might say oh well leo you're so tall
therefore of course you don't even know what it's like
to be short but i've had a lot of wings
i've had a lot of amazing wings almost all of
my wings were shorter than me and they got way
better results than me in fact one of my best
wings this guy just blew me away was a short
pakistani guy in dallas texas he was about five foot
five very short very small guy but this guy he
grew up in like a royal family he was basically
part of royalty he was explaining this to me and
he had this just king-like sense of entitlement literally he
believed that every woman in the world who was his
personal property now this is a bit this is a
bit narcissistic and and over the top as an example
but hey i mean this was the mindset he was
raised in as royalty as part of a royal family
you're just taught that you know the whole world is
[ __ ] yours belongs to you so this guy
had incredible confidence incredible assertiveness incredible leadership qualities and this
guy was a [ __ ] beast he was a
beast and he got laid way more than me and
i'm a tall white guy this guy's a short brown
guy this guy did crazy ballsy approaches where he would
walk up to a group of girls like at a
club it was their birthday like 10 girls he would
just start instantly making out with the birthday girl she
would [ __ ] slap him reject him he would
start making out with her friend she would slap him
reject him he would start making up with her next
friend right like this guy just didn't give a [
__ ] and he got laid a lot because sure
he got rejected a lot but then he also got
a lot of success too he was a very polarizing
guy because he just saw what he wanted he had
no qualms no hesitations he sees a girl he likes
he doesn't care if she's with guys if she's with
a boyfriend she doesn't care he just goes straight to
her and starts hitting on her now sometimes that gets
you in trouble but then a lot of times it
works and women can find that extremely attractive because that's
what she's really looking for she's looking for a guy
who knows what he wants and is not afraid to
pursue what he wants and he's not ashamed of it
at all he feels completely entitled so that's just one
example for you another top limiting belief is something along
the lines but leo studies and science shows that you
know women prefer men with a perfectly symmetrical uh you
know facial features and with a with the you know
sculpted jaws and this kind of you know torso ratio
and this this size of muscles you know this is
all scientific and objective what you have to understand about
so-called scientific studies is that these are very narrow unholistic
isolated situations that are very artificial yeah if you take
a couple of women and put them into a laboratory
environment and you take a couple of guys you know
you take a short fat guy and you take a
a giant tall muscular guy and you bring them out
in front of these women like hunks of meat and
you give the women crushed questionnaires like which of these
guys uh you know uh makes you want to go
on a date and which one makes you wet and
which one would you like to you know give a
[ __ ] to it like you you give a
questionnaire like this and she's going to sit there and
logically decide these answers yes you will get your sort
of scientific results that will show you that she doesn't
like the short you know fat guy um but you
have to understand that this is this has nothing to
do with how attraction actually works in the real world
if you're at a bar a club a mall at
a cafe if you're within a social circle with your
friends and you're flirting with a girl attraction works in
a totally different manner yes if you present women with
simply photographs of guys they have nothing else to go
on they will choose the most handsome guy just based
on on the photograph because that's all they got to
go on but the beauty of face-to-face in-person interaction is
that it's totally different you can exhibit charisma you can
demonstrate leadership qualities you can have status you can dress
in a certain way you can you can flirt you
can be humorous and all of these things are very
important to women and women respond to these things very
well when they're done correctly and also you have to
understand that when a woman is choosing a mate she's
not like choosing from a million different options she's only
given very few options and then she has to choose
one of those let's say a girl is single and
she's kind of interested in dating somebody well who is
she gonna date it's not like she's gonna flip through
a catalog of all the dudes on the planet and
choose the hottest one she's going to like um you
know maybe she's using online dating and then she'll flip
through some of those or if she's not doing online
dating then it's even worse for her because basically the
first guy or handful of guys that approach her she's
going to pick one of them and go date that
guy and how many guys have the balls to approach
a woman quite quite few and how many guys have
the ability to do it with some skill and to
really be emotional with her and build a deep connection
with her and to excite her very few guys have
that kind of ability right so let's say she gets
hit on by five guys well she's gonna select one
of those five so you have a one in five
chance and if your game is good you have a
way better chance than that of getting her out on
a date assuming she's single all right so you have
to be very careful with these sort of narrow unholistic
scientific studies they don't properly capture what attraction is really
like when i'm talking about attraction getting results with women
we're talking about a holistic situation here real world situation
where you go into a let's say a coffee shop
you see a cute girl sitting there reading a book
you approach her open her she's single and you you
know you do a little bit of game on her
bam she's interested in you she gives you a phone
number then you go on a date and then you
hook up and then she becomes your girlfriend right um
your scientific studies do not apply in this situation uh
other top limiting beliefs girls only want the alpha extroverted
guy the chad the so-called [ __ ] chad the
reality is that girls love all sorts of different types
of guys and guys like different sorts and types of
girls right so one of the mistakes that i think
guys make is that they tend to want to be
attractive to all women in general and this is silly
you shouldn't want this at all the reality is that
only maybe 10 of women that you approach and talk
to will actually find you attractive either physically or given
your personality or your energy or whatever or just your
type or given even your race and so forth all
right let's say 10 of women find you attractive anyone
say oh 10 that's so low actually 10 is very
high that's not low at all um and so this
is actually a good thing because that means that even
though you don't fit every woman that means that women
have all sorts of different types of guys and that
means that it's actually good for guys to be talking
to lots of different girls and girls to be talking
to lots of different guys because that presents more opportunities
for us to find the right fit for each other
you see there are women who love nerdy guys who
love very intellectual guys there are women who love like
edgy guys sporty guys bodybuilder guys but not necessarily there
are women who like skinny lanky guys who like tall
guys who like you know short um sort of like
um beefy guys there's different kinds of trade-offs and so
just trust that whatever type you are there are women
who like the type of guy that you are and
whatever race you are whatever ethnicity you are there are
women who will like that but you shouldn't want even
the majority of women to be attracted to you 10
is more than enough remember you're not trying to sleep
with every woman in the world you're only trying to
sleep with a handful of them and even better than
that really what you really ultimately want is you want
one really good woman that's really all you want one
[ __ ] one out of like four billion women
you want one or let's say you want five or
let's say you want ten ten out of four billion
that's doable right that's that's not something crazy that's not
something impossible that's very very doable another top limiting belief
is that girls want big muscles and a big dick
um of course it's nice to have big muscles well
first of all recognize that muscles are something actually you
can grow and develop so if you really think that
women want such big muscles then go go for a
few years do some weight lifting put on some weight
develop those muscles what you'll actually discover is that of
course it doesn't hurt to have big muscles but you're
not going to get laid from your big muscles that's
what you'll discover you'll discover that actually learning these other
deeper principles learning the principles of game for example developing
your sense of humor will get you laid 10 to
100 times more i guarantee you that no matter how
many muscles you build if you have a good sense
of humor and that can be developed and also your
leadership ability your confidence level your assertiveness this will get
you laid 10 to 100 times more than your muscles
so muscles are are are very much down the list
of things you need to be worried about they're not
even the top 10 things that women are interested in
um and then about the big dick what you have
to understand is that the woman has no idea the
size of your dick uh until already she's deeply attracted
to you so what you'll notice if you start talking
to lots of women is that you'll notice them getting
attracted to you it's very clear the distinction between a
woman who is not attracted to you versus one who
is and so usually that attraction will trigger within the
first five to ten minutes of your interaction with a
woman if you're interacting with her properly man to woman
i'll teach you about that in part two um but
um but see what you'll notice is that you'll start
to notice when you go out and talk to lots
of women that very attractive women will actually get attracted
to you now that doesn't this doesn't necessarily convert to
them sleeping with you because there's a lot of obstacles
that come in the way but she'll get attracted to
you and you'll notice that and you'll realize that she's
getting attracted to me and she has no idea the
size of my dick and so the truth is is
that the only person in the world who really cares
about the size of your dick is you i don't
care about your dick other guys don't care about your
dick and she barely cares about your dick because what
she cares about is the emotions you give her not
your physical characteristics so much women are very very emotional
creatures it's how you make her feel and even when
you're having sex with her your big dick is not
really what's making her feel amazing emotions it's the bond
the intimacy you build between you two not any physical
manipulation you do in the bedroom that will really turn
her on and make her fall in love with you
the next top limiting belief is that hot girls requires
you to be rich attracting hot girls requires you to
be rich uh you can easily shatter this limiting belief
by going out a lot talking to lots of hot
girls and you will see that they get attracted to
you without any knowing anything about your net worth or
even your job in fact if you want you can
kind of play this trick go out talk to hot
girls specifically at night clubs and bars and so forth
and give them a fake net worth tell them you're
broke tell them you're homeless tell them you work at
walmart tell them you work at mcdonald's and you will
see these girls will still sleep with you and get
attracted to you despite the fact that they know you're
not rich in fact a funny story about this i
had a friend when i first moved to vegas had
a friend who was a wingman of mine we would
go out and hit on girls here in vegas at
the nightclubs and actually the first two girls we pulled
um there were these nurses and um and my friend
my friend was we were both kind of having fun
you know when you're gaming you're trying to have fun
and so um his thing was that he was actually
a dentist and he earned six figures you know uh
very sort of classically attractive you would think to a
woman right so you would think that this guy would
be like telling women that he's a dentist and he
makes six figures and that would get girls to sleep
with him right and by the way this guy was
really good he had really good game better game than
me he was short he was shorter than me he
got laid way more than me but you know what
he did he would tell when women asked him what
he what he does for a living he would tell
them that he works at walmart as a box boy
this was like an in-joke and he but he he
would he would tell it seriously such that the woman
would actually think he works at walmart then after she
sleeps with him um i remember because we all slept
in the same bed once um er that's a story
from the time uh sort of an obnoxious story yeah
but we were all sleeping in the same bed once
um and then uh in the morning we all woke
up and and and his girl asks him like so
you work at walmart and he's like [ __ ]
no i'm a dentist and she's like what you're a
dentist why did you tell me you worked at walmart
it was so funny we were all laughing about it
but basically she slept with them thinking he worked he
worked as a box boy at walmart so yeah you
don't need to be rich and in fact what you'll
discover is that if you try to go out and
talk to hot girls and you start to brag about
how rich you are you'll actually discover that this this
loses you attraction bragging loses attraction it doesn't gain you
very much um because what women are really attracted to
are emotions not logical qualities about you like your net
worth now maybe some women who are actually looking for
like a sugar daddy will be attracted to that but
those women you don't want that kind of kind of
woman anyway so it's nothing is lost another top limiting
belief is that i'm too much of a nerd a
geek or an introvert to become good with women i'm
not naturally funny or charismatic well look this is a
huge problem that i faced and what i can tell
you about this is that by going out a lot
you can retrain and rewire your mind from that nerdy
introverted mindset to become more extroverted and to develop humor
and charisma these are things you can develop and you
can actually become way more funny way more charismatic and
extroverted than you think than you ever imagined that you
could this just takes quite a bit of practice another
top limiting belief is that pickup is a scam all
those videos on youtube of guys picking up girls these
are all just pranks or they're just fake or the
women were paid to talk to these guys and to
give them their numbers or whatever let me assure you
pickup is not a scam um i know many many
guys dozens of guys that i've met in different cities
around the country um who have amazing results have slept
with beautiful gorgeous women um and and i've had results
from pickup as well i'm not a dating coach or
anything so one of the nice things about learning this
stuff from me is that you know if you're trying
to learn this from a dating coach sometimes you don't
really know like is a dating coach because you know
he teaches this stuff he has a financial incentive to
you know sell me a boot camp or to sell
me a course or something that the guy might be
you know kind of bullshitting me about pickup but i'm
not selling you any kind of course about pickup i
don't teach boot camps i'm not dating coach or anything
so just from my own personal experience it's not a
scam now of course on youtube you can find many
sorts of prank videos and maybe some youtubers do pay
women to you know to flirt with them and to
give them numbers and stuff but um you can easily
find wings who you can go out with and you
can see them gaming girls and you can see how
good they are and you can see the reactions that
girls give them and you can see them pulling girls
out of the club at the end of the night
so you can easily demonstrate to yourself that this is
no scam and that it really works uh another common
top limiting belief is that oh leo it's just all
a numbers game it's all a numbers game you have
to talk to hundreds and thousands of girls and of
course if you do that one of them will randomly
sleep with you a couple of points about this first
of all it's not purely a numbers game i mean
it is a numbers game yes to a certain degree
but then again all dating is like that all sales
is like that too by the way even making friends
is like that in a certain sense like you're not
gonna make friends with everybody of all the people you
meet only a few of them will be your friends
if you want a lot of friends then you need
to meet a lot of people that's just how it
works likewise if you want a lot of clients not
all people you meet are going to become your clients
you got to go through a lot of people to
find the clients who will be your best clients well
it works the same way with dating too so of
course as you increase your numbers you're going to increase
your results and you're going to increase the quality of
people that you meet your chances of meeting a really
high quality person and you know clicking with each other
and having chemistry together of course numbers are important um
but it's not purely a numbers game because your skill
matters a lot so there's a big difference between a
total noob who doesn't know how to approach versus a
you know a master who can approach easily and flirt
and have humor and confidence and all this that guy
you know he can be hooking like 60 percent of
his of the girls he talks to whereas the guy
who's a total noob and clueless he could be cooking
you know zero out of a hundred so skill matters
a lot um but also just because it is a
numbers game doesn't mean that this is a problem or
a reason not to do it in fact it's actually
a reason to do it the fact that it's a
numbers game is great because it means that if you
go out enough and you have just a bit of
skill you'll still get some success 100 girls will still
want to sleep with you that's good take that why
don't you want to take that and then as your
skill improves that number will become better and better and
better you'll get a better ratio of course it's never
going to reach 100 it's never even going to reach
50 percent it's never even even gonna reach five percent
you're not gonna have sex with even five percent of
the women you talk to that's not a problem because
you're gonna be talking to a lot of women you're
just gonna get very good at talking to women you
can talk to 30 women in one night you don't
need to sleep with all of them one of them
is enough another top limiting belief is but leo i
will only be able to get fat ugly girls this
way no you'll be able to get uh incredibly hot
girls like crazy hot girls hot girls that you you
don't even understand how hot these girls can be until
you've done this you can get girls as hot as
you see in porn you can get models you can
get actresses you can get strippers you can go get
go go go dancers i've i've i mean i've attracted
these kinds of girls um you can get like ridiculously
hot girls of course the hotter they are the harder
it'll be the rare they will be but you can
still get them another top limiting belief but leo it's
not fair because it's so easy for girls to get
sex and it's so hard for us guys you're telling
us guys we have to work for thousands of hours
and for years to get laid whereas a girl can
just go to a bar and just get laid any
night she wants to there is some truth in that
but again you're misunderstanding the situation there's a deep asymmetry
between what you need as a man and what a
woman needs as a woman so even though yes it
is easy technically speaking for a girl to get laid
if she wants to any girl basically can get laid
any night she wants to just by going to a
bar and just kind of being receptive but you see
that's not the girl's survival need her problem is not
getting laid the girl's problem is getting commitment from a
quality guy there are many risks and dangers for a
girl just getting laid randomly it decreases her value so
um the idea that it's that somehow dating and sexuality
and relationships are easy for girls but hard for guys
this is nonsense there are so many challenges that girls
have that you guys don't even fathom they have challenges
and problems with getting raped molested abused sexually many many
girls maybe even a majority of girls have had issues
with sexual abuse at one point in their life um
you guys can't even even imagine sometimes how horrific that
can be um and they have problems finding high quality
guys they have problems with guys [ __ ] them
and then dumping them they have all sorts of additional
risks that come with pregnancy [Music] physical danger that they
put themselves in by sleeping with a stranger that they
don't even know so because the guy is more physically
powerful than she is can overpower her um can hit
her can kill her i mean so um don't think
that girls have it easy girls do not have it
easy and also you tend to think of like the
hottest girls yeah the hottest girls often times do have
it much easier in terms of dating but you have
to understand that the majority of girls are not hot
girls so a lot of girls actually struggle to find
quality guys because they're not the hottest girls so be
careful with the bias with which you you try to
like portray this and you try to like blame girls
or to say that girls have it easy they don't
have it easy in fact us guys in a certain
sense i think have it easy because we can work
on ourselves more we have more opportunity to grow ourselves
as men and therefore we can increase our attract we
can do more to basically improve our attractiveness and that's
actually an amazing thing even though that takes work it's
amazing that we have that kind of flexibility girls are
not as flexible she can put on some makeup she
can get fake tits she can wear high heels she
can put on a great dress that will all increase
her physical attractiveness but still that's not going to increase
percentage-wise her physical attractiveness as much as i can increase
my physical attractiveness by working really hard on my game
and really developing myself as a man i can i
can do way more i can increase my attractiveness like
fivefold or tenfold whereas maybe she can increase her attractiveness
by let's say 50 percent if she gets great hair
great makeup great dress fake tits and all this she
can maybe do it by 50 i can do it
by 500 percent if i work on myself and so
can you as a guy another objection that's related to
this is like ah but but leo but other guys
don't have to work this hard some guys are just
naturals why do i have to work so hard whereas
that guy over there that chad he's got it so
easy he didn't have to work for a thousand hours
look the reality is that human beings are born with
different genetics some of us are more lucky than others
we have different intelligences we have different personality types we
have different sizes different heights different genetic diseases and things
like that some of us will live much longer than
other people so yeah luck you know genetic luck is
involved um and some guys are just more naturally extroverted
as a personality characteristic as a personality type and therefore
they have it easier with women some guys just started
very early with women they were in a certain social
situation where they were um you know learned many of
these skills naturally and they have sort of natural game
but i certainly didn't i started at zero so don't
let that stop you sometimes you're gonna have to work
hard at something especially if it's a weakness of yours
this particular aspect of of of my life is one
of the most challenging things that i've ever worked on
because it's like one of my greatest weaknesses my natural
strengths lie in other things they lie in spirituality they
lie in my intelligence they lie in my you know
sense of life purpose and motivation other things i'm i'm
really good in certain areas and i'm i'm weaker in
other areas this is a weakness of mine and so
um [Music] yeah some of you will have this as
a weakness if you have it as weakness you'll have
to work harder but you know what i've been blessed
in other ways so i'm not sitting around here complaining
about all you know woe is me and how how
poor i am because uh this is a you know
socializing and and being flirty or being extroverted is somehow
you know a weakness of mine uh because i have
other strengths to compensate for that you can't just look
at one narrow facet of someone's life you know those
guys who are naturally extroverted and very good with with
women naturally and have have that part easy well you
know those guys they have weaknesses of their own in
other areas in their life for example they might have
horrible careers they might have no work ethic they might
have shitty motivation they might not be very spiritual they
might have low consciousness they might not uh have great
finances and they might really struggle in all those other
areas they might have a a shitty you know emotional
life they might be sex addicts or whatever drug addicts
alcoholics so you have to look at the totality of
a person not just one narrow thing that they're good
at and that means it's okay for you to have
weaknesses and it's also okay for you to have a
weakness and then to work hard on it to improve
it now does that mean that you're ever going to
turn that weakness into your greatest strength no it's never
going to become your greatest strength being social and extroverted
is never going to become my greatest strength but i
can work on it and i can get decent results
and that's all that you need another common limiting belief
is that feminists and social justice warriors have emasculated men
and that's the real problem that's why i'm not getting
laid is because of the feminists no that's that's not
the problem that's an excuse you're just blaming some political
situation for your lack of taking action and turning yourself
into a strong man if you want to become a
strong man no one is going to emasculate you and
no one is going to hold you back more than
yourself another limiting belief is ah leo but me too
the metoo movement has made a you know cold approach
impossible and i'm going to get cancelled for this no
uh that's not what the metoo movement is about um
it's possible to flirt with women and to approach women
in a socially calibrated responsible ethical manner where you are
not being obnoxious you're not being creepy you're not being
rapey you're not forcing these women to do anything you're
not lying to these women you're not trying to trick
these women into whatever uh you're genuinely going to try
to attract them and if they're not attracted you say
thank you have a nice day and you know what
when you approach a woman and you compliment her about
how beautiful she is or how much you know you
find her attractive and she says oh i have a
boyfriend or no thanks i'm not interested and you say
well okay have a nice day you know how good
you make her feel by hitting on her in a
socially calibrated way not in a creepy way but in
a calibrated way you know you hit on her that
makes her day that makes her feel good sometimes women
will just say thank you for you know thank you
for talking to me because i was bored or because
i'm single or because today i wasn't feeling very good
about myself you know even a lot of beautiful women
are very insecure so when you come up to her
and say oh you know i loved your dress and
i love your style and i think you're cute even
if she doesn't sleep with you for whatever reasons um
she's still gonna be very flattered by that you've made
her day you didn't hurt her by doing this of
course you have to do it in a socially calibrated
way that's something you're going to learn another top limiting
belief is that girls are [ __ ] liars cheaters
and gold diggers it's this sort of very um toxic
stereotype of what women are and in a sense i
feel like guys stereotype women this way they portray women
this way because they're actually envious and jealous that they
can't get women and so therefore they have to demonize
women this is very very twisted and wrong actually what
i've discovered by talking to thousands of women is that
the majority of women are not [ __ ] they're
not liars they're not cheaters they're not gold diggers it's
the opposite of that most women actually are careful about
who they have sex with they don't just have sex
indiscriminately uh most women are fairly honest when you talk
to them um most women will not cheat on their
boyfriends you know how many women i've talked to who
had boyfriends and i tried to like push it a
little bit just to see how far they'll go and
usually it doesn't go very far be precisely because they're
not cheaters and most women are not gold diggers in
the sense that you know sometimes i will try to
like dangle a little bit of like uh how wealthy
i am or something like that or the fact that
i own a house or the fact that i run
my own business you know i try to dangle these
things in front of women just to see you know
how much they bite and a lot of times they
just ignore it it doesn't really help me to get
laid so you can test this stuff out for yourself
and you'll you'll see that actually most girls are pretty
sweet they're pretty honest they're pretty loyal too [Music] another
top limiting belief is that there are too few good
girls out there it's just they're too rare you know
leo i had my one dream girl and then she
rejected me and now i'll never find one like that
again you only believe that because go back to that
number that you wrote about how many new women you
meet every every month that number is so low that's
why you think there's too few good girls if you
go out and you meet hundreds of new attractive women
every month you'll realize that there's so many amazing girls
out there there there's like the abundance is actually crazy
there's a crazy abundance of of girls out there you
just need to go out there and start meeting them
another common limiting belief is something like leo but i've
tried to pick up and i failed it doesn't work
for me i've proven it doesn't work guys who say
this usually say it because what they've done if they've
done 10 approaches they've done 50 approaches they've done 100
approaches and they didn't get any sex from it and
therefore they think they failed what these guys fail to
understand is that you need way more than 100 approaches
usually to get your first lay from cold approach and
that's because the learning curve is so ridiculously steep it
took me 450 approaches somewhere around there to get my
first lay from cold approach now you might look at
that you may say oh my god leo that that's
ridiculous that's crazy you mean i have to approach 450
every time to get just one lay no what i
mean is that was the that was the very beginning
of the steep learning curve your skills will become exponentially
better as you do more approaches and so while your
first one might take you 450 uh the second one
will come faster and the third one will come even
faster and the fourth one will even faster and faster
and faster and faster and starts to snowball and it
gets exponential and then you can actually be having so
much sex that you're gonna get tired from the sex
it's gonna be too much sex you're gonna have too
many girlfriends so um you just have to understand that
that's what it means to have a very steep learning
curve in some sort of thing that you're trying to
master so if you've tried it and you failed that
means you probably don't didn't do it correctly you didn't
understand something you misunderstood something you were doing it in
the wrong locations the wrong city the wrong place you're
going about it the wrong way and that explains why
you failed for you guys i recommend giving it a
second shot but taking it much more seriously and being
much more persistent about it uh the next um common
limiting belief is that there's no place to meet girls
in my area well the solution is to move to
an area where there are girls it's a little bit
of a pain in the ass to move but it's
worth it and you can move and i've done that
i moved from dallas to vegas precisely because i wasn't
satisfied with the quantity and quality of girls in vegas
in dallas compared to vegas and you can move and
the final limiting belief is it's too late to start
what i would say about this is that it depends
upon your age if you're 50 years old i would
say yeah cold approach is not for you you should
probably at age 50 you should probably start thinking about
social circle in other ways some of those other methods
of finding girls but um but if you're in your
20s 30s and maybe even early 40s then i think
it's not too late to start especially in your 20s
and 30s you're going to be totally fine so don't
worry about that if you're above age 40 it gets
a little bit more challenging um so there you might
have to think about you know what's kind of realistic
for you because when you're going to bars and clubs
you're going to be hanging out with girls who are
in their 20s and 30s you're not going to be
seeing a lot of girls there who are going to
be in their 40s or 50s um and so you
do have to con you know take that into consideration
so what really holds you back the most is your
bad inner game more so than your looks you are
negative you're depressed you're resentful you're envious you're whiny you're
arrogant you're close-minded you're overly rational you're lazy and you
misunderstand what women need that's what mostly holds you back
not your looks now let's talk about what women are
attracted to so this is something you can know definitively
this is 100 known and field tested guys have figured
out exactly what women are attracted to so here's the
list and basically all women are attracted to the same
thing don't let women fool you that like oh but
i'm a special girl and i'm only attracted to this
thing and not to that thing i'm i'm different i'm
not attracted to what all the other women are attracted
to [ __ ] all women in all cultures are
basically attracted the same stuff it's very fundamental women are
attracted to masculine energy first and foremost strength confidence charisma
charm humor cocky funny wit they're attracted to fun adventure
and romance they're attracted to highly social guys they're attracted
to playfulness and to positivity and to emotional stimulation to
drama even for a woman it's not so much about
experiencing just positive emotions actually it's experiencing a wide range
of emotions and the delta between the emotions so the
way you attract a woman is take her through an
emotional rollercoaster where she feels the the lows and the
highs the ups and the downs this is what attracts
women women are attracted to strong personality and passion if
you're passionate about something and you can communicate to her
with charisma she will also become excited by it she's
attracted to a guy who was able to express himself
in an unpremeditated way spontaneously and exhibits a strong personality
authentically regardless of what that personality is you can have
a nerdy personality uh introverted personality or an extroverted personality
um you can have a wide variety of interests you
can be very high energy or you can be very
low energy and there will be girls who will get
attracted to all of that but what they fundamentally want
is for you to express your personality clearly and strongly
assertively without being ashamed of it and without holding back
and that's a lot of what learning game is about
is about finding your authentic personality and then being able
to project it without any hesitation because mostly in our
lives when we were younger society has sort of taught
us to hold back our true personality and not to
express it with emotion you're not allowed to do that
at work you're not supposed to do that at school
you're supposed to sort of fit in and you're supposed
to just be kind of like square and normal and
just kind of vanilla well women don't want vanilla they
don't want the boring guy they want a guy who
will like express his his sort of masculine persona and
penetrate her spirit with his spirit if you want to
put it in a sort of a poetic way they're
very attracted to leadership into decisiveness and you can develop
those qualities they're very attracted to authenticity vulnerability and deep
intimacy so it's not just about spiking her emotions and
being funny and charismatic it's also about doing some of
that to get her attention and then it's about it's
about building a deep rapport with her sharing your life
stories finding out about her deeply learning about her and
building a bond between you two women are deeply attracted
to balls edginess and boldness women are deeply attracted to
high value status reputation and celebrity and social approval so
if you have a lot of friends with you and
you have a lot of women around you who hold
you in high regard that woman that you want to
attract she will become automatically more attracted to you just
of because of all the other social validation that you
have around you because she sees you as the center
of your social circle or as somebody who's important within
society and that just automatically means you're a high value
guy and that she should sleep with you now don't
get this wrong she's not sitting there and calculating this
in her mind she's like oh she's not doing this
she's not saying like oh well this guy has a
lot of friends and he seems to be very high
status and therefore he has a lot of value and
therefore i should sleep with him no no no it
doesn't work like that it's all subconscious and it's all
automatic she's just gonna naturally find you charming and handsome
and and and amazing she's not even gonna know why
but the reason it will be is because you are
a high status guy and you have a lot of
social validation around you and she's just naturally going to
gravitate towards that and find that juicy and appealing women
are very attracted to strong eye contact eye contact is
huge we'll talk about that in part two they're attracted
to guys who are detached and have a sense of
life purpose where the life purpose for the guy is
more important than the girl as soon as the girl
becomes more important than your guy your your life purpose
as a guy she's going to start to lose attraction
for you and women are attracted to guys who are
well groomed sharply dressed clean and fit and smell nice
and all of these you can work on you can
control all these factors now what repels women the number
one thing that repels women is neediness desperation and attachment
to her when you put her on a pedestal as
you're precious the most precious and important thing in your
life when you start supplicating to her and treating her
as a queen she will immediately lose attraction for you
another thing that repels women is being too nice that's
part of what i was just talking about really it's
sort of a sub component of that another thing that
repels women is fear insecurity meekness shyness and lack of
balls in a man if you are insecure as a
man this this is killing your results with women another
thing that repels women is when guys are explicitly sexually
vulgar and give sexual compliments so if you just met
a woman and you start talking about how you want
to have sex with her explicitly this is going to
immediately turn her off she's going to blow you out
within seconds you're going to turn her off by doing
that and related to that point is that women are
repelled by being desired only for sex or if you
make her feel or look [ __ ] if you're
talking to a girl and she gets the feeling that
you're only interested in her for the sex or you
make her feel [ __ ] by going home with
you then she won't go home with you and she'll
lose attraction for you very fast another thing that repels
women is trying to impress women trying to be macho
or cool trying to put on a fake front of
like you're stronger than you really are you're much much
better off admitting a weakness than you are trying to
fake a strength another thing that repels women is fakeness
or being too gamey trying to game her too much
it looks unnatural and this is where some of the
stigma and bad stereotypes about pickup come from is that
early pickup was very very gamey and fake and that
reputation is sort of stuck around but um there are
different kinds of pickup there's different qualities of pickup so
the very early like mystery method stuff was very gamey
and sort of artificial but sort of modern versions of
pickup have overcome many of those limitations another thing that
repels women is bragging about yourself never brag about yourself
to a woman this is in fact you should do
the opposite usually what i would do is to do
self-deprecation you know tell a woman you're homeless um tell
a woman you have no job tell a woman you
have no money tell a woman you suck your own
dick you know whatever you know tell her stupid things
about yourself that actually sort of disqualify you disqualify yourself
rather than qualify yourself another thing that repels women is
boring logical talk or serious guys this is huge women
want to relate with you romantically in an emotional way
not in a logical way so don't be business business-like
with women you're trying to date another thing that repels
women is forcing her to lead when you ask her
oh where should we go where should we eat you
make the plans when you tell her that that is
a huge turn off you lead you make the plans
you tell her where you're going you set up the
date you do that stuff you handle the logistics that's
part of you being a leader don't make her lead
another thing that turns off women is being ungroomed having
bad hygiene sloppy dress and no style so make sure
you trim your beard trim your body hair brush your
teeth wash yourself shower uh put on some cologne dress
nice and sharp and have a sense of style this
will this will do a lot for you and uh
just in general one of the biggest things that turns
off women is creepiness creepiness and women will tell you
this if you're creeping on them and they feel creeped
out they will tell you that you're creepy and you'll
see it it immediately it immediately turns them off so
a huge part of game actually is learning how to
be very smooth and non-creepy when it comes to stuff
like sex and physical touch and you learn how to
do that very smoothly to make her feel comfortable and
not awkward women hate being put in position where they
feel awkward so a lot of game is just learning
how to be socially calibrated so she doesn't feel awkward
because her friends are there they're looking at this like
she doesn't want to be put in a position where
you're asking her to to come home with you and
all her friends are looking at her now you made
her look like a [ __ ] if she says
yes to come home with you even if she wants
to she looks like a [ __ ] in front
of all her friends this makes her feel very awkward
or if you're touching her in a creepy way this
makes her feel very awkward and will immediately blow you
out now you might be saying well leo sure it's
easy for you to sit up here and talk about
how you know how you've done all these approaches it
sounds like it's easy for you you're very successful you're
famous you're a youtuber you're tall you're white you're fit
you're charismatic and so for you it's easy but i'm
not like that leo i'm not i'm not as successful
as you i'm not as famous as you i'm not
some youtuber i'm not tall i'm not white i'm not
fit i'm not charismatic so how am i going to
make this work well look what you have to understand
is that i used to be fat i was fat
for the first half of my life i was 65
pounds overweight if you're fat you can change that but
also even if you're fat women will still have sex
with you as long as you have good game so
don't let that stop you but fat is something you
can change now about me being famous i already told
you that it's even with my level of fame it's
very difficult for me to get laid just from my
fame alone uh because i'm not i'm not as famous
as you think but also have to understand that when
i was learning game the majority of my approaches i
did when i wasn't famous at all i didn't have
a youtube channel i did two to three thousand approaches
before i even started a youtube channel nobody knew who
i was i was a nobody and most of my
wings there they were nobodies nobody knows who they are
they can still get laid hundreds of times you don't
need to be famous for this to work in fact
you might be shocked at how little fame helps you
um you would think it would help you more i'm
surprised i don't get laid more from my fame i
mean i wish i wish it worked better it doesn't
work that well um i also used to not be
very successful again you're kind of looking at it now
that i'm a successful youtuber like oh leo but again
when i started game i didn't have youtube success i
wasn't very rich so and and most of my wings
who get great results way better results than me they're
way less successful than me i'm probably the most successful
person of many of the wings that i've hung out
with just if you look at just pure you know
business success and money and stuff like that um but
they get way more results than i do so it's
not the success also i'm not classically good-looking i don't
get good results for example on online game where good
looks are very important so i don't have that going
for me i used to have social anxiety i used
to be very very like ridiculously introverted like i can't
tell you how introvert i was i used to be
so introverted that i would even be scared to have
a conversation with like a a cashier at the grocery
store or when i used to go to to the
to get a haircut you know and i was sitting
there getting a haircut i wouldn't even know what to
say to the to the lady cutting my hair i
was so scared and so socially awkward and shy that's
how i used to be see now you see me
when i'm talking about spiritual topics that i'm very passionate
about i can be extremely charismatic it seems like i'm
so charismatic here right but you have to understand that
this is me in a very narrow context when i'm
in my you know talking about something i'm very passionate
about i'm not this charismatic usually if i'm just going
about my day or even if i'm talking to a
girl i'm usually not this charismatic it takes a while
it ha i have to train myself to be this
charismatic if i'm talking to a girl because with a
girl i'm not talking about deep topics like if i'm
at the club and i'm hitting on a girl i'm
not talking with her about enlightenment and god and love
and all this [ __ ] she doesn't know any
of this stuff right what am i talking about i'm
talking about small talk [ __ ] we're just talking
[ __ ] and it's hard for me sometimes to
to be interested in that i had to force myself
to be interested in that um and so and that
charisma and also have to understand that this charisma that
i exhibit here with you this is part of what
i learned from years ago by doing game it taught
me to be a better public speaker it taught me
to have a deeper voice it taught me to be
more expressive it taught me range in my tonality it
taught me even confidence in the things that i say
so a lot of times i'm talking about a topic
in a very confident way and sometimes people perceive that
as i'm being narcissistic or i'm being arrogant or i'm
even being closed-minded or i'm being like a cult leader
it is partly it is it partly what that is
is just i learned through game that when i'm talking
to somebody the most effective way to do that and
to be charismatic is to be definitive about what i'm
saying not to be wishy-washy and i used to be
very logical hypological and i still am very logical some
nights when i go out to a club i'm so
stuck in my head because i'm so logical because i
spent the whole day thinking about [ __ ] god
or about consciousness or about you know some metaphysical [
__ ] that when i'm at the club now i
don't feel like just having fun it takes a while
for me to like let loose sometimes so my point
being is that i had to do a lot of
work to get to the point where i'm at so
don't just think that i was born this way right
what you see here you don't know how much work
i went through to get to where i am right
here so that you see me being all charismatic and
and smiley and fun like i literally had to teach
myself how to smile on command because i needed to
for game see like i can do a genuine smile
like i can just go from zero to just like
a genuine smile where like i'm i'm genuinely happy not
because i'm doing it like a that would be like
a fake smile is like this see that that's a
fake smile or i can do like a genuine smile
when i need to because if i'm approaching a girl
i need to do a genuine smile like on command
like like actually make myself happy from the inside that's
part of what game teaches you so here's the ultimate
solution for you getting laid five steps step number one
envision yourself attracting cute girls step number two study the
principles of attraction you need the theoretical foundation step number
three go out and socialize every week if you don't
do this nothing else works now you might say leo
i don't know where to go it doesn't matter find
a place research it but leo i don't know what
to say it doesn't matter say whatever comes to your
mind you'll get better as you keep going but leo
i don't have the skills it doesn't matter i had
zero skills just go and start practicing and you'll start
learning the skills this is going to take a lot
of trial and error number four work on your victim
complex and all of your limiting beliefs you have to
question them and question them and question them until they're
all destroyed some of this work you can do just
by yourself sitting at home questioning beliefs but a big
component of questioning your limiting beliefs and breaking down your
victim mindset is actually going out talking to girls and
as you're talking to girls you will get contradictory evidence
to your limiting beliefs for example you might believe that
no hot girl will ever get attracted to me but
if you go out and you start talking to a
bunch of girls one hot girl at least will get
attracted to you and then that will be counter evidence
to your limiting belief or you might believe that girls
require you to have a fast car and lots of
money and muscles and then you go out and you
discover that hey i get plenty of girls who get
attracted to me even though i don't have muscles even
though i don't have a fast car i don't have
a lot of money that means my belief was wrong
and step number five is be tenacious and do not
quit keep going until you get the results you want
here's what you'll discover if you do this that your
looks don't matter nearly as much as you think they
do they matter to some extent but not as much
as you think and you can still get decent results
uh you'll also discover that money doesn't matter at all
what you'll discover is that if you chat with 30
new girls every week for one year you're almost guaranteed
to get a girlfriend from doing that so 30 new
girls every week times 52 weeks that's 1 500 girls
at least a few of those will sleep with you
and at least a few of those will want to
become your girlfriends as i said it took me 450
or so approaches to get my first girl you might
say well that's a lot of work and i don't
like that number that doesn't sound like a good number
leo you were so bad at game actually no um
some of the best coaches that i know who have
done like 10 000 or 20 000 approaches and who
just get amazing results these days when they first got
into game it also took them about 400 approaches to
get their first girl so it's not because i was
particularly bad it's just this the learning curve is incredibly
steep and remember uh it's not always going to stay
steep eventually you'll you'll break the back of the of
the learning curve and then on the on the second
half of it you're going to get lots of results
for relatively little effort but the first step in doing
all this is believing that you can do it if
you don't believe you can do this if you're not
110 percent motivated and excited to go out there and
start trying this it's never going to work for you
this takes serious motivation you have to have like a
crazy belief in yourself because at the beginning you're not
going to be getting great results and if you think
you can talk to 10 or 20 girls and one
of them will sleep with you you're fooling yourself the
first 10 or 20 girls that you talk to they're
not going to sleep with you in fact they're probably
going to be horrible cringy interactions very socially awkward but
from that you will learn although you know funny story
funny story is that when i got into pickup back
in like 2012 um my brother also struggled in this
department and he also kind of got interested in it
a little bit not as much as i did but
he went out and you know i i basically shared
some of the insights that i had and some of
like the courses that i was taking with him he
listened to like one audio product that i had back
then that i bought he listened to it it was
like a day game approach course he listened to it
he went out to like the local barnes nobles where
they have a little cafe area just to you know
practice and approach he did his first approach talked to
one girl sitting at a coffee table and she became
his girlfriend first approach right so of course of course
you can get lucky even on your first approach you
can get lucky but i wouldn't count on that see
and because because really what determines your success in game
is is your your tenacity and your persistence i don't
even want you to get success on your first 100
approaches because if you do you're going to get sort
of a bad lazy mindset you're going to expect that
you should get more results for you know too little
effort you got to be really willing to work on
this so here's what i would like you to do
if you're serious about this if you really want to
change this aspect of your life and you want to
get good with girls you need to make the following
commitment i commit to chatting with 30 new girls every
week all right say this with me make this commitment
right now if you're serious i commit to chatting with
30 new girls every week and you count them everyone
you talk to you count them now where do you
find 30 new girls to talk to you don't know
yet and it doesn't really matter you'll figure that out
you'll go to cafes you'll go to malls you'll go
to bars you'll go to nightclubs figure out where you
can find 30 new girls every week and if you
can't find them in your city because you live in
a town with a thousand people in it then you
say to yourself okay part of what it means for
my to honor my commitment for chatting with 30 new
girls every week is that i'm moving cities to a
city where this is actually possible you see also i
want you to commit to going out of your house
three times per week at least three times a week
three nights a week you go out to a bar
or club and you socialize and when i talk about
socialize it's not necessarily that you need to need to
like flirt with girls just learn to socialize just socialization
alone will solve a giant chunk of your problem see
your problem is deeper than not having game for many
of you guys your problem is simply a lack of
socialization it's not that you can't socialize with girls you
don't even know how to socialize with guys go to
a bar or a club forget about the girls to
begin with just befriend some guys talk about sports talk
about video games talk about whatever guy stuff you want
to talk about cars or whatever joe rogan or some
[ __ ] talk about that have fun enjoy yourself
if you can't do that then how can you how
can you talk to girls and then i want you
to commit make a commitment to yourself that you're going
to find your dream girl through this process that's all
ultimately what you're after is your your dream girl whatever
that is for you now i want to issue some
final um warnings about how to do this sort of
like the ethics the ethics of this process i want
you to be very careful about toxic ideology stop demonizing
women stop demonizing feminism stop listening immediately to red pill
black pill and incel ideology and youtube channels and stop
reading subreddits and forums that's the most toxic and destructive
thing you could ever do to yourself when it comes
to getting better with women you cannot have a healthy
relationship with anything you demonize resent or hate stop hanging
out on online forums on reddit on 4chan on youtube
stop playing video games stop looking at social media stop
binge watching tv and netflix this [ __ ] is
killing you you've been playing video games your whole life
it's time to grow up and set that aside forget
about video games for the next few years you don't
need them channel all that time and energy into learning
game and talking to girls and being social and get
out of your [ __ ] house you're spending way
too much time in your house get out to where
people are face to face will grow you by itself
now you might say oh but leo i thought you
were against pickup didn't you release a video some years
ago where you ranted against the pickup community yes i
did and i still stand by the things i said
in that video but that video was nuanced if you
go back and watch it what i said in that
video is that i have a problem with the pickup
community and some of the ideology that is common within
pickup that i find to be toxic what i also
said in that episode is that there's nothing wrong fundamentally
with socializing approaching girls flirting with girls dating or with
sex so here's what i'm against just to be clear
i'm against the following aspects of the pickup community aspects
that have to do with building an ego or an
identity around being a pua and various forms of selfishness
that come with that and narcissism that comes with that
and egotism that comes with that i'm against creating an
ideology of chasing women or some sort of pickup ideology
i'm against manipulating lying and cheating with women these need
to be minimized as much as possible i'm against burning
through women and causing a lot of collateral damage which
a lot of pwas do in a selfish narcissistic way
to try to just increase their lay counts i'm against
counting your lay counts and trying to maximize your lay
counts as though this will somehow fulfill you in life
at all it won't i'm against blaming women and blaming
feminism i'm against demonizing women as [ __ ] and
[ __ ] and cheaters and gold diggers i'm against
abusing women and treating women poorly which many puas will
do i'm against turning sex into a lifestyle and sort
of a form of hedonism where you are chasing after
more and more new women thinking that somehow this will
fulfill you it won't i'm against avoiding relationships and intimacy
which a lot of puas do and i think that's
very immature and dysfunctional i'm against getting stuck in spiral
dynamic stage orange or even red which many puas do
i'm against sociopathy and narcissism and i'm against a lack
of ethics and empathy when it comes to dating you
need to have ethical standards you need to have integrity
in how you go about this and so one of
my biggest critiques of the pickup community is that there
was almost zero emphasis on ethics empathy compassion love consciousness
there was just an emphasis on getting latest as much
as possible and doing whatever it takes to do that
so i think ethics are very important and i'll talk
more about that in part two i'll talk more about
some of the uh ethics and principles you need to
set for yourself as you go about interacting with women
because there is potential to cause collateral damage here and
you want to minimize that but at the same time
it's also possible to approach women in an ethical way
which doesn't really take anything away from them you're not
going to trick them you're not going to lie to
them you're going to be as honest and authentic as
possible with them and you're going to take the burden
off of the woman and put it on yourself in
the sense that you're not trying to trick the woman
into liking you you're trying to change yourself into a
person that is generally more likable and not just for
women but even for men even for your friends even
for your family even to your clients and co-workers for
everybody become a better guy and combine that with personal
development and spiritual development and with your life purpose and
your passion and your love for life and with consciousness
and now this creates what i would say is like
the ideal situation the ideal guy that a girl would
be thrilled to meet and to date and ultimately to
turn into a boyfriend and a husband potentially all right
that covers the foundation here now stay tuned for part
two where we will talk about the outer game which
will have all the mechanics the principles the techniques the
tricks all the very practical stuff there will probably need
to be a part three as well to this series
i don't yet know how many parts there will be
because there's a lot of material to cover it takes
longer than i anticipated even this episode is two and
a half hours and i feel like we're just getting
started there's so much to say and maybe even in
the future i will do a whole course on this
because even after these few episodes there will still be
so much more that i could teach you that i
just don't have time to to fit in all the
details um and the reason there are so many details
is actually because i'm speaking from like a deep base
of experience i've practiced this stuff a lot and so
i have a very nuanced understanding of like everything you
need to know to be successful in this and all
the ways you're going to [ __ ] this up
and that you're going to fail in this process the
final thing i want to leave you with is just
be careful not to underestimate the importance of inner game
inner game is hugely hugely important and the more advanced
you become the more experienced you become the more reliant
on inner game you will become as opposed to outer
game for a newbie outer game seems to be like
the trick that will get him laid but actually as
an advanced practitioner of this you realize it's the inner
game that's really foundational to getting you laid and this
ties in with the deeper theme that i always talk
about with actualize.org is basically how your mind is constructing
reality people who are stuck in red pill black pill
in cell ideologies and to a certain extent even in
pickup ideology they don't appreciate the extent to which the
mind is constructing reality because usually these people are stuck
in sprawl dynamic stage orange this sort of materialistic very
materialistic mindset and they think that reality is this scientific
logical objective material thing it isn't reality remember is a
universal mind and therefore the beliefs you hold about yourself
and about women and about sex and about dating these
all play a crucial role in your ability to have
healthy relationships with women a healthy dating life a healthy
sex life and so you gotta you gotta go very
deep on the inner game on your limiting beliefs and
really take a look at maybe what's holding you back
from getting the kind of results you want here is
not the women and it's not feminism and it's not
your physical appearance but what it is is it's it's
a really bad inner conditioning of your mind because of
how you were raised that can be difficult to accept
especially if you're a very materialistic person you tend to
think that all the all the real problems in the
world are out there they're not in here they're like
leo how could my inner game cause me to not
get laid you might wonder well the only way you
can really discover that is by going through this process
but for now just trust me on it i guarantee
you that your inner game is is is preventing you
from getting laid and getting the kind of results that
you want um but at the beginning you don't quite
see how that could be the case well if you
studied some of my other work where i talk about
how the mind constructs reality as you become more conscious
as you become more developed you realize more and more
how much your mind is constructing your reality that reality
is not really material it's a mental system we're dealing
with a universal mind here and this universal mind whatever
it tends to imagine tends to become its reality i
teach that in other episodes that's some deep stuff um
but i'm trying to sort of draw a connection between
that and something very practical here with with learning game
uh one of the things that game will teach you
very poignantly is is just how much you were holding
yourself back how much your mind was holding you back
from getting the kind of material results that you want
with women and with relationships and with love and it'll
completely shatter your your paradigm because you thought that all
those problems existed out there in the world and then
you're going to come to realize after doing lots of
approaches and lots of game you're going to realize holy
[ __ ] almost all of that was my own
internal [ __ ] my own internal filters and the
way i look at the world my own paradigms and
all the you know [ __ ] programming and ideologies
that i've absorbed in my life um that's what was
really holding me back and if only i had if
only i had cleared that stuff up earlier i could
have been getting laid for the last decade think of
all the opportunities that i missed getting laid because i
had all these limiting beliefs all of this self-doubt all
this insecurity all all this stuff and so um [Music]
pickup is actually a great way to demonstrate to yourself
how much your own mind limits you and of course
that's not just true within pickup that's true all across
the board in every domain of your life but with
pickup it'll it'll really force you to to see that
to look it in the face and then you can
say well holy [ __ ] if if this is
happening with with my dating situation where else is this
happening is this happening in my business oh probably it
is and is this happening in my spiritual pursuits oh
probably it is is this happening with my finances is
this happening with my you know depression and my emotional
life probably it is and so ultimately what i hope
is that you're going to use this series that i
have for you here to start to get your dating
situation handled and then once you get that handled and
you're not so thirsty anymore then you can say ah
okay leo now i'm ready i can i see what
you've been pointing to now that i got that need
met i've burned through that karma now i'm ready to
move on to greater things what else can you teach
me and then i got a lot of stuff to
teach you come back and look at all my other
you know deep metaphysical epistemic stuff and then we'll take
you to to whole new levels of development that's what
i'm really excited about you
