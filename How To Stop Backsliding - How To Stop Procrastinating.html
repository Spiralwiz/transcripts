hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the concept called
homeostasis which is the reason why you keep backsliding in
your life there's a thorny little problem that sticks in
our side when we try to self actualize and that's
the problem of backsliding which is you know when you
try to make that change in your life that you
really get excited about making and then you make that
change and it looks like it's working for a while
and then what happens you slide back to your old
ways and then you make that change again again excited
this time redoubling your efforts and then a couple months
later you're back in your old ways and this just
keeps going on and on and on and not only
is it extremely frustrating but it also makes you very
pessimistic about the possibility of creating change in your life
and this is why sometimes people like to rag on
self-help or personal development is because they've been trying to
make changes but then really they haven't been able to
make any changes stick and they're just fed up with
this whole backsliding process so it's a very real problem
it's a very big problem you're going to encounter a
lot of backsliding on your way towards getting somewhere far
and high with your self-actualization work so to help you
along though and maybe ease of that frustration make the
path a little bit smoother for you I've got some
ideas for solutions to this problem backsliding and also I
think it's important understand why this backsliding happens which is
actually part of the solution is just understanding what is
really going on here because most of us are usually
blind to this stuff unless we've kind of studied this
in depth and I'm going to lean on the work
of George Leonard here who wrote a beautiful little book
called mastery which if you know me is one of
my top books of all time little book but you
could read it a dozen times and not suck out
all the wisdom that's in it it's brilliant for advice
or how to put your life together basically it's like
a philosophy of putting your life together but you know
he has the main concept of mastery and he has
a lot of little concepts kind of sub concepts I
call him in that book and one of them is
homeostasis he has a really great discussion about homeostasis and
he offers some solutions I'm gonna present some of his
solutions here along with some of my additions to what
he said so homeostasis what is this this is a
word this is used in the field of cybernetics and
also in biology cybernetics is a very interesting field and
it's the field of studying how systems work systems it
turns out are very interesting things and you know we
have biological systems we have mechanical systems all sorts of
kind of systems these days we build a lot of
complex systems but one of the interesting aspects of a
system is that a system is a collection of items
that are interlinked together into a complex web of feedback
loops and when you have something like that which creates
some sort of cohesive whole like a individual human cell
or human body or a tree or a computer system
or whatever then what you get is you get that
the system has a center of gravity to it you
might say and this center of gravity is it's homeostasis
this is the place that it likes to gravitate towards
and stay at because this is the safest place for
it to be and because here there's been a track
record of proven safety one of the biggest challenges that
systems face in our reality is that they're not really
natural to come about and to exist and there's a
lot of elements that run against the system a lot
of threats to the system's survival you might say so
the system has to get very good if it comes
into existence at all of maintaining itself in a place
where he can keep surviving and reproducing and so that's
where homeostasis comes in specifically in your own body there's
a lot of homeostatic processes that are going on all
the time you're not even aware of them so your
blood pressure is being regulated too low it's a problem
too high too problem has to be somewhere in the
middle there's a perfect kind of Goldilocks zone there likewise
with your body temperature too low it's a problem too
high it's a problem in the middle somewhere Goldilocks zone
it's just right and so on it goes with a
lot of other systems that you probably haven't even been
aware of or read of or heard of or even
thought of or maybe that science has even discovered yet
but the body has thousands of these going on at
the same time it's very very complex it's really fascinating
just how much balance the body has to maintain it's
like you're it's almost like you're walking on a on
a high wire in the circus right a hundred stories
above the ground and you're at the danger of tipping
over to one side or the other side or forward
or backward at all times and then you're dead and
so you always have to be watching out for this
except you're not doing it it's like your body and
your unconscious mind your brain stem is doing it all
for you and see this whole process all it really
cares about is your survival and it cares about keeping
you going at what's always worked before in your life
now these are like very low-level processes that I'm talking
about but then there's higher-level processes these are the ones
that you care about changing so for example when do
you wake up when do you go to sleep or
how do you behave in a relationship or what's your
work ethic like what kind of food you put in
your body all right all these things potentially you might
want to change what are your study habits like how
much do you exercise how do you perform at your
job these are all things we try to improve but
interestingly enough our subconscious mind tends to pull us back
to where we were and the reason it does this
is not because it's you know it's not terribly smart
it just does what's always worked and in kind of
the evolutionary context what's worked before is nice to want
to work again so it's kind of like your brain
is biased towards keeping you in the same place simply
because it's been proven already because if you're alive now
it's at least been proven that the thing that is
working right now has worked in the past right because
if it didn't you'd be dead so just by that
very simple logic it's like okay well what we've got
works the problem though is that your unconscious mind doesn't
really distinguish between what works kind of well and what
works really well and what's actually dysfunctional but still keeps
you alive and there's a big difference between those right
so we don't just want to be alive and breathing
we also want to be like thriving and self actualizing
so if we're trying to get to those kind results
well then we have to sort to understand how those
unconscious mechanisms work and really your mind is like a
thermostat thermostat a thermostat tries to keep a certain baseline
temperature wherever you set it and if it goes too
high the AC kicks in and if it goes too
low the heater kicks in and so you've got these
feedback loops that keep you stuck that's exactly what happens
in most of your life with almost every habit or
behavior that you have so for example let's say you
want to leave a relationship a relationship that you know
isn't good for you maybe you're in a toxic relationship
with some guy and you're a girl and you don't
like how this guy's treating you and you think you
can do better but you're just stuck and your conscious
mind knows that this guy's for you but yet somehow
every time you plan on leaving you have an argument
to fight with him in the end you just kind
of come back anyways and maybe you even leave but
then the next week you come back anyways cuz he
you want that love and that affection and after all
he wasn't that bad I mean there's a lot of
even bigger dick holes out there than him so how
bad could it be maybe we can make this work
or maybe you have a career and you're working on
some career but then you have some business idea and
you're really excited bout this new business idea and you're
thinking maybe about changing career here like well I don't
really like this career anymore so let me go start
my own business but I got to work on this
you know I got to do the research I got
to lay the groundwork for starting my own business before
I can drop this career so you're doing that and
you're excited because you have this new business project and
you're working on it and let's say you're working on
it on the weekends and you're working working for a
couple weeks maybe a month goes by and then after
a month what happens the homeostasis kicks in and your
emotions pull you back and you start saying stuff like
like this to yourself you're like well you know I
have been working real hard for the last month and
you know it is kind of like I'm working two
jobs now it's like I have my old career now
I've got this thing I mean I'm really stressing myself
I should give myself a little break right let me
go play some video games let me go relax with
my girlfriend or whatever and then that business project just
kind of gets forgotten gets left on the sidelines and
you never pick it up again and it just collects
dust or what about when you try to wake up
earlier let's say you got this habit of waking up
at noon I've had a problem with that and then
you want to be waking up at 6:00 a.m. how
do you make that change you tell yourself all right
from now on I'm really serious about this I'm changing
my life I'm gonna be waking up at 6 a.m.
every morning Eva the weekends and then you go in
it and you do it for a couple of weeks
and then what happens you start the backslide and you
start to say yourself well but I'm working so hard
I should get a little extra time to sleep in
and it's like I really I really worked extra hard
last week so that that allows me to get a
bit later and then later and later and then later
and then later and then before you know you're waking
up at 3:00 p.m. how about eating cleaner ever try
that cleaning up your diet man do I even need
to go into the details of how that works I
mean it's all the same thing right yeah get excited
about eating clean and you do it you do it
you do it do it and then you start creeping
back back back to your nasty old habits because your
friends pull you back in your mind starts telling you
well I've been real good the last month you know
with my diet I should allow myself that cookie right
there cookie looks good I mean what's one cookie out
of a whole month of clean eating one cookies nothing
right so eat that one cookie and then what happens
a couple months later we look at you you're back
eating all the [ __ ] junk you've always been
eating in your life and nothing's really change so you
see where all these examples are going right and I
mean you can fill in the details there you've got
hundreds of these examples in your own life whatever you
try to change why ever you do personal development but
what's going on here basically is that your emotions keep
pulling you back to the center that's kind of what
they're designed to do is they're designed to keep you
stable but stable isn't necessarily always in your favor a
lot of times it is and it's a really amazing
and beneficial mechanism but then it can also buy this
in the ass because these emotions they sabotage us and
also not just emotions the thoughts we have thoughts that
sabotage us too and this creates problems and this is
interestingly why why you will never find a real magic
pill for creating a fulfilling rewarding life never not unless
we rewire the the neurons in your brain like in
a surgically rewire them because you have to emotional labour
to make change happen in your life that's the bottom
line of it you have to exert that emotional labor
emotional labor happens when you resist the homeostasis so homeostasis
pulls you back to center you have to now exert
willpower to move off center and reset the center point
which is possible to do you can reset the center
point I mean big change is possible it's not like
you can't clean up your diet I mean come on
you definitely can and it's not like you can't be
waking up early in the morning sure you can you've
probably done it in your life or any of the
other stuff you can do it it's just that it
takes a little extra work and it takes a little
extra craftiness then most people apply to the problem so
we're gonna get into some solutions here but before we
do just a final reminder also notice that not only
does this apply to the individual you who is obeying
homeostasis but also there's homeostasis in groups within your family
there's homeostasis there's a center of gravity there within your
social circle of friends there's a homeostasis their center of
gravity same thing with your colleagues at work with your
corporation as a whole with maybe your church group or
your spiritual group and even with your you know local
community or your entire city that you live in there's
a homeostasis point and even with your country that you
live in there's a homeostasis point there within the political
climate and all that and organizations you know if you
talk about government organizations or nonprofit organization they all have
their own homeostasis points so it's very important to recognize
that these um this problem it does just apply to
you but applies to a lot of different systems out
there in the world that we want might want to
probably change at some point to improve them so that
our world functions better so it's good to learn about
this right there's a lot of ramifications from knowing how
to deal with homeostasis but here's some solutions I want
to give you a list and most of these are
from George Leonard also with a couple of twists that
I put on so basically here the first one is
be aware that homeo exists and be aware that it's
both the positive system and a negative system really it's
a lot to your benefit that there is homeostasis because
it keeps you alive so just appreciate that and when
you go into new situations that you try to change
understand that homeostasis will be kicking in it's like a
law it's like gravity it's going to kick in so
the question is then how do you navigate around that
force which is there just awareness of homeostasis already will
increase your odds of successfully changing and shifting your center
of gravity substantially because most people when they try to
lose weight or they try to start a business or
whatever they're not even thinking about homeostasis they're completely oblivious
and because of that they have a very high failure
rate they're not even able to ship their first product
or do their first in a milestone meet their first
milestone because the homeostasis already has and by the balls
so the next point is set very proper expectations for
your self realistic pragmatic expectations I'm really big on this
because I discovered in my own life when I didn't
set pragmatic expectations for how my business was going to
go or how some creative project was going to go
or whatever change I was trying to make then that
change would never happen I would be so far off
the mark and it seems like a very simple thing
you know an expectation and expectations like this just this
very nebulous flawed in your mind it's not even something
tangible and yet it has a very big impact on
whether you're going to succeed or not in making this
change so how do you set a proper expectation well
remember always remind yourself that the mind will resist when
you try to make a change the body will also
resist when you try to make a change and people
around you will resist when you try to make a
change especially if we're talking about an organizational change that
you're trying to make but even if you're just making
a personal change it's very weird how that works you
know sometimes people leave me it's insane stuff like leo
I'm learning all this stuff and I'm trying to share
with my family and they're telling me to stop meditating
because it's stupid and to stop doing this person about
my stuff because it's a scam and all this nonsense
they don't care about this the way that I do
I know it's good information but they don't care right
because they're in homeostasis and they don't even know that
they're homeostasis so that's why you have to expect that
expect that your mind will resist by coming up with
all sorts of crazy thoughts and stories and millions of
rationalizations and excuses for why you should go back to
where you were so the mind will play tricks on
you and very interestingly the body will even play tricks
on you how does it do that well you get
psychosomatic stuff what's called psychosomatic that means that it's like
it's almost like a hallucination you kind of make it
up but then your body actually starts to feel it
so like maybe you start going to the gym right
let's say you start a new gym routine and you
start going you're very excited and you know going great
for a couple of weeks and then two weeks into
it you BAM all of a sudden it feels like
you're catching a cold and you're like oh man I
just started now I have to stop for a week
to get rid of this cold but really it's not
like a real proper cold it's like a [ __
] cold it's some psychosomatic little sniffle you got a
little sore throat you know some [ __ ] like
that which your mind is actually kind of creating very
freaky that your mind can do this that your mind
is creating these physical like symptoms that seem real to
get you doubting yourself and falling back into your comfort
zone it's amazing how deceptive and tricky your mind and
your body as a combination are and then when the
people in your environment come into play and pin you
down into your center of gravity within that social circle
man it's like you know it's like you're destined to
stay in the same place no wonder it's hard to
make change no wonder you've not gotten results from self-help
so what do we do about this well one of
the things that George Leonard suggests I think is great
advice is be prepared for serious negotiation and he says
be prepared for serious negotiation what this mean well this
means that you can't just bowl your way through the
problem sometimes we try to do that it's like okay
I'm going to the gym no matter what every single
day for an hour I'm going to go and I'm
going to do it for the next six months and
you're kind of approaching it that way but then we
starts to happen like I said is that you know
two weeks in you start feeling that cold and you
start second-guessing yourself and doubting yourself you start feeling tired
and your body feels achy and it's like oh man
and you know you don't know how this is going
to fit with the rest of your schedule in your
life like now you can't go to work on time
and all this stuff so everything starts going to hell
and at this point if you're not able to negotiate
with yourself then what happens is that you're going to
break down and quit and fall back into your center
of gravity negotiation means that you know when to ease
off the gas pedal a bit so that your body
doesn't just violently overreact or your mind isn't just violently
overreact and then you also know how to press on
the gas pedal when you know that there's a little
bit more room to grow and you can push yourself
a little bit more so it's kind of knowing when
to push yourself and when not to and being smart
about it and so maybe when you start to feel
that sniffle coming on feeling that cold you could say
to yourself instead of saying no you know what I
have this cold I still have to go to the
gym and you go to the gym and you go
to the gym you go to gym and basically then
you actually do catch a cold because you're so exhausted
and you overwork yourself well the smart person has to
kind of say okay what's going on here let me
negotiate so part of my brain is telling me that
I'm going too hard part of me is telling me
that I'm not going enough let me find that sweet
spot in between so maybe tomorrow I'll go but then
I'll take the weekend off so I can recuperate and
not get sick for real something like that right so
that negotiation and this is I found like one of
the most challenging aspects of personal development is the emotional
labor that goes into the serious negotiation because as you're
negotiating you're not sure you're uncertain you're kind of doubting
yourself and your mind is having this tug-of-war going on
inside of it and you have to stay with that
and persevere through that get some resolution of it and
come out the other end and not quit and that's
what I mean by emotional labor and this is why
most people don't have powerful self actualize lies is because
they're not able to cope with this emotional labor so
that's that point a couple other points develop a support
system so the people around you are important some of
the things that are really difficult to do have classic
support systems already established in society so if you want
to lose weight there's like Weight Watchers and other programs
if you want to get off of alcohol there's a
Alcoholics Anonymous there's rehab programs this programs and communities that
will help you to get better at dating plan your
wedding start a new business whatever other aspects of your
life you might have right there's communities for it and
these communities can be very very helpful because they're like
a support system they support you emotionally that's the most
important thing emotional support camaraderie powerful another thing I recommend
is have a meditation habit in place what I found
is that putting a meditation happen in place is like
the ultimate number one habit which then allows you to
draw energy from that to build new habits why is
it so powerful because meditation gets you more awareness of
all the emotional [ __ ] that's going on in
your brain so basically you're able to see and be
more aware of the homeostasis as it's happening and you're
able to see and negotiate better because you're more aware
of the backlash that your mind creates I recommend you
meditate daily I think it's the most important habit if
you're into personal development and I have videos on that
that can teach you how to meditate I think also
another very important habit is the visualization habit I have
a video on visualization that will teach you how to
set up a habit there and how to do visualization
properly but basically you want to do a little bit
of visualization on a daily basis like 5 10 20
minutes of visualization towards your goals and specifically the thing
that you want to try to change so whatever you're
trying to create in your life you know this this
move away from homeostasis because if you can visualize it
in your mind that helps your mind buy into it
and be on board with it in a way that
it wouldn't otherwise just very simply if we have you
some you know do some tasks tomorrow let's say tomorrow
and you go do the laundry you're much more likely
to go do it if we just have you close
your eyes right now and for five minutes visualize doing
the laundry tomorrow but do it right now visualize yourself
doing the laundry right now in your mind if you
do that for five minutes you're going to have at
least double the chances of doing your laundry successfully tomorrow
than you normally would so think about the ramifications of
that throughout your whole life pretty powerful worth implementing another
point is make sure that thing you're trying to really
change is the right thing a lot of times we
try to change superficial or stupid stuff in our lives
I mean you have a lot of choices you could
probably change a hundred different things about your life and
really only effectively you can change one or two at
a time so big mistake that people make is they
trying to change more than one or two things at
a time really focus just on one at a time
because even two will get you much worse results than
just one so pick the right thing the thing that's
really going to make a meaningful difference for you what
I found is that if I pick the wrong thing
kind like a yeah that'll be nice but I can
kind of take it or leave it then it'll never
be changed there's just not enough willingness on my part
to overcome the emotional labor and resistance that will be
involved so it's not even worth starting make sure you're
really doing the right things this goes to having a
life purpose to knowing what your purpose is in life
to knowing and understanding your top ten values when you
understand your own values understand yourself on a very deep
and authentic level then you know how to choose the
right things and that's a magical thing and in fact
I'm working on a life purpose course right now I
want to release in the coming month which will help
you to figure all that out there's so much material
there that we need to cover but anyways that's off
topic the other thing I recommend is that I recommend
that when you do find the right things to change
very strategically picking the right thing and then what you
got to do is you got to make 100% commitment
super-important 100% commitment no excuses no wiggle room I found
this really works well for me because if you make
like a ninety five percent commitment that five percent wriggle
room wiggle room will kill you in the end too
many excuses will come into play your mind will just
rationalize it away and bring you back to homeostasis so
you know one of the areas in my life where
I used the hundred percent commitment which was worked really
well for me is with my meditation habit which I've
been doing now for about one and a half years
and in that time I haven't missed a single day
of meditation at all ever and I've meditated for one
hour every day for that whole time so that's like
over 400 days I believe I haven't counted them lately
400 or so days straight how was I able to
do that I'm kind of surprised that I was able
to do that because you know I like to slack
off on stuff but um the reason I did that
is because I just at one point in my life
I just said oh I see that this is so
[ __ ] important to my life into my results
this is really the right thing for me I saw
very clearly that this was the right piece of the
puzzle for me so that I'm like okay if it's
that right then 100 percent commitment because I know that
if I skip even one day of meditation I'm going
to be skipping days here and there and everywhere pretty
soon so I just said you know what no matter
what even if it kills me even if I'm in
the hospital no matter what no matter where I am
who I'm with holidays breaks Christmas this that whatever I'm
doing my meditation and I've really stuck to that and
it's worked really beautiful I'm surprised how well it's worked
so I'm going to keep going because that one's working
for me I recommend that you apply that with whatever
habits you want to build a couple of remaining points
just reminders for you this is stuff you got to
remind yourself of over and over again remember that failure
this time does make it easier next time so if
you're trying to lose weight and you failed once well
the second time will be easier if only a little
it will be easier and the third time will be
a little easier again and so will the fourth because
you're you're learning stuff even as you're failing so this
can be a little consolation prize even if fail right
and most people very interestingly enough here's why this is
important is that most people grossly underestimate no sorry they
grossly overestimate how much they've attempted something specifically making a
change so most people if you ask them let's say
you ask a fat person oh how many times have
you tried to diet and lose your weight and they'll
think about they'll say yeah you know throughout the last
ten years I've probably tried it like 15 times and
every time is failed but then if you actually sit
down with that person and actually forced them to tell
you the dates of when they tried their different diets
and you look and you see the facts of the
situation you'll you'll realize oh actually it wasn't fifteen times
it was more like three times three fifteen versus three
big [ __ ] difference right your mind grossly overestimate
s' these things you try it three times it's like
oh yeah it's like I've seen it I know fifteen
times kind of like with movies sometimes you have that
effect with movies have you have you noticed that it's
like how many times have you seen Star Wars and
you might say okay I've seen it 20 times in
reality though if you think about it like how many
times have I seen Star Wars single-digits really single digits
even though I like to think of myself as like
I've seen it so many times I know it front-to-back
know you've only seen it a handful of times at
most unless you're like some real [ __ ] nerd
so your mind tends to do that right so why
is this important well because your mind tends to make
the obstacle bigger than it is it's like well I've
tried 15 [ __ ] times to lose this way
it has never worked so it's never going to work
but really you've only tried three times right how about
a little more effort if you tried it 15 times
for real I bet you'd figure out how to make
it work and also the last reminder I want to
give you is um don't discount how powerful just one
change can be just one change sometimes we look at
all this and we get very overwhelmed with personal developer
can we tell ourselves well like I need a meditation
habit I need a visualization habit I need to get
my business habits I need to get my health habits
and my diet habits and all this all these habits
I need 25 habits look you're thinking way too far
ahead you're overwhelming yourself just one change can be a
very transformational change to your life it can significantly make
a big dent and have the whole trajectory of your
life right the key is to choose those powerful changes
so for example one of those might be a meditation
habit if you could just see into the future 10
or 20 years from now what even 20 minutes of
meditation a day could snowball into you would be baffled
it would also and what's possible with 20 minutes of
meditation for 20 years straight your life would just completely
revolutionize the problem is though that me telling you this
doesn't actually get you to believe it it's like you
have a little inkling of an idea but you don't
really understand what I'm talking about and so because of
this you don't give proper weight and value to putting
this one little change into your life if you saw
what this meditation habit could do for you 20 years
down the road you would be doing meditation religiously like
your life depended on it every single morning but you
don't do you probably not why well because you discount
the power of just one little change so it really
takes vision on your part you have to be a
visionary of your own life you have to see how
the little changes can snowball into massive qualitative explosions of
change in the future so reminders of that so when
you're feeling overwhelmed just tell you some okay what's the
one thing I got to put into place right now
that's really going to make a huge difference 20 years
from now if I just do it every single day
find the answer to that question is usually pretty simple
it's not rocket science and then you give it the
value that it deserves and you say [ __ ]
this is really [ __ ] important I better do
this 100% commitment this is really important and that will
help you a lot so take all that to heart
incorporate all those ideas and go make some big changes
in your life don't succumb to the gravity of homeostasis
