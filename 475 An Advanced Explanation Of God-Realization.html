            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PgmJj0Gn1WM' target='_blank'>An Advanced Explanation Of God-Realization</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Radical Consciousness and the Distinctions Among Awakening, God Realization, and Non-duality</b>: Leo Gura explains his new level of advanced consciousness that contradicts common spiritual teachings. He differentiates his process from traditional spiritual awakenings by suggesting that consciousness can continue to grow and develop deeper layers of self-understanding with no limits. Although prior awakenings may have felt total, there can still be higher degrees of totality in further awakenings.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Infinite Consciousness and Understanding Reality</b>: Leo introduces the concept of God realization, which he differentiates from the classical notions of enlightenment and spiritual awakenings. Leo suggests that traditional spiritual paths, such as meditation and self-inquiry, aim at quieting the mind to recognize the nature of the self and the truth of no self. He introduces a model in which, the more one quiets the mind, the further downward one moves along an axis of consciousness. However, this is limited and reaches a 'rock bottom' in the form of a cessation or a silence in which all sensory experience ceases. 
</li><li><b>Exploring the Other Direction of Consciousness and Gateway to Infinite Understanding</b>: Leo introduces the concept of an upward movement of consciousness, not about quieting of the mind, and where an active mind can be beneficial. He describes this process as moving up the 'y-axis' of consciousness towards a super mind, and eventually an infinite mind or God mind. Unlike moving downwards, this progression has no limit and can be visualized as a knob that can be spun infinitely with expanding degrees of infinity.
</li><li><b>Pushing the Boundaries of Ordinary Human Existence</b>: Gura argues that ordinary human existence is limited in its understanding and consciousness. Pushing these boundaries by "turning the knob" to higher levels, beyond the confines of being human, leads to a super mind and ultimately an infinite, or universal mind. This process, he suggests, differs greatly from simply quieting the mind through meditation, and it's about expanding the mind's capacity rather than minimizing its activity. 
</li><li><b>Challenge to Conventional Understanding of Reality</b>: This progression towards an infinite mind leads to the stripping away of human egoic projections and labels that construct our understanding of reality. Everything previously considered concrete and real, such as trees, sunlight, and even our own sense of self, is seen as a projection of the human mind. As we move towards a higher state of consciousness, these projections dissolve, revealing a new understanding of reality itself. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Open-mindedness and Experimentation</b>: Gura highlights the importance of keeping an open mind and not relying solely on conventional spiritual guides or practices. He encourages embracing paradoxes, contradictions, and seemingly illogical notions as part of the process of growing one's consciousness. He concludes by asserting that a more profound understanding of reality is not obtained by simply studying others' experiences or teachings, but by undertaking the journey oneself.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality</b>: Leo Gura discusses the human capacity to understand elements of reality, making a clear distinction between understanding, knowledge, information, memory, beliefs or ideology. He emphasizes that understanding is a unique ability inherent in consciousness and that it's distinguishable from simple ego projections or abstract categorizations. This understanding is formed through deep interconnectedness, akin to drawing a web of connections between elements of reality.
</li><li><b>The Analogy of the Monopoly Board</b>: Gura uses the analogy of a Monopoly board viewed by a child who is unfamiliar with the game. The child sees the board elements but doesnÂ’t understand their function or purpose. On the other hand, an adult, applying experience and cognition, can view the same board and understand the game, its elements, and purpose. Such understanding is inherently limited but Gura posits that, hypothetically, if one's consciousness was expanded, it could reach an infinite understanding of the board by tracing every detail, creator, and backstory related to it.
</li><li><b>Connecting Understanding to Larger Realities</b>: Gura then stretches this point to hypothetically applying this infinite understanding not just to a Monopoly board but to all of existence or reality. He suggests that if we could 'crank up' our consciousness beyond human levels, we could possibly achieve a profound, infinite understanding of all reality.
</li><li><b>Advanced Explanation of God-Realization</b>: Leo Gura from Actualized.org describes his journey towards 'God-realization,' which he defines as a holistic awakening where consciousness becomes deeply interconnected with all aspects of reality. This is vastly different from human consciousness, which tends to perceive reality as distinct entities or experiences. 
</li><li><b>Significance of Interconnectedness</b>: Leo contends that to reach God-realization, it is essential to seek interconnectedness in everything within one's consciousness, including memories, parents, birth, environmental perception, etc., realizing that they are not independent entities but part of the entirety of one's consciousness. 
</li><li><b>God-realization Amidst Human Consciousness</b>: Leo addresses the human tendency to perceive certain objects or experiences as fragments of reality outside the sphere of consciousness. He notes that when consciousness expands to a significantly "meta" level, it can comprehend its inherent unity with all phenomena, allowing for the shift from human consciousness to God-realization.
</li><li><b>Detox Protocols and Their Inputs</b>: Leo also discusses the role of detox protocols in enhancing one's consciousness. He suggests that detoxifying one's brain from heavy metals and other toxins improves mood, enhances concentration, and removes brain fog. This detoxification impacts psychedelic experiences, purifying and clarifying them by reducing turbulence in the mind. 
</li><li><b>Imperative of Self-Reflection</b>: Leo highlights the importance of self-reflection through processes such as creating and releasing content, doing research, feedback processing, and understanding various perspectives. By integrating these experiences and feedback, he suggests that his understanding of reality has deepened and his spiritual awakenings have been enriched. 
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics</b>: Leo argues that shifting from basic human consciousness to God-realization is amplified by the use of psychedelics, particularly when combined with detox protocols aimed at thought purity. While psychedelic use results in an increase in consciousness flow and clarity, achieving 'God-realization' requires the necessary work of expanding one's consciousness via continuous learning, introspection, and detoxification. 
</li><li><b>God-Realization and Its Profound Impact</b>: Leo suggests that crossing the threshold into God-realization represents an immense shift in consciousness where one understands their existence as a deeply interconnected part of all reality. This comprehension that "this is God," implies realizing the profound association between consciousness and the 'illusory' fragments of reality the human mind perceives. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in Achieving God-Realization</b>: Despite emphasizing the profound nature of God-realization, Leo also acknowledges the challenges involved in achieving it. He states that to reach this state, individuals must have an already interconnected understanding of reality, move beyond being attached to ego and be willing to go deeper into understanding their consciousness, and practice a form of introspection and reflection that goes beyond conventional spiritual practices. 
</li><li><b>Personal Impact of God-Realization</b>: Leo shares that his journey towards God-Realization has been one of increasing interconnectedness and clarity through processes such as feedback processing, continuous learning, detoxification, and conscious use of psychedelics. This evolving and deepening interconnected understanding of reality has allowed him to integrate various aspects of his consciousness better, resulting in a richer understanding and profound experiences.
</li><li><b>The Process of Attaining God-Realization</b>: God-realization is a process that takes years of spiritual work, not merely due to the use of psychedelics. Deep contemplation and questioning in one's sober life are important aspects of this process. Spiritual practices that de-emphasize understanding are considered insufficient, for they promote duality which prevents one from realizing their unity with God. 
</li><li><b>Entering God-Realization</b>: Upon reaching a point of god-realization, an individual attains a heightened state of consciousness where they take complete ownership as the creator of their reality. This is differentiated from some other mystical or spiritual experiences where external entities appear to guide or provide insight. The individual becomes so conscious that there is no room for such visions, having transcended notions of spiritual gurus, science and even the idea of psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Transcending Imaginary Constructs</b>: God-realization enables an individual to transcend their past, future, and physical reality by realizing the imaginary nature of these constructs. This includes their memories which are seen as narratives used to construct the illusion of human life, their perception of time as flowing from past to present to future, and physically-bound scientific laws. 
</li><li><b>Transcending Personal Relations</b>: God-realization also allows the individual to transcend their personal relations. The individuals they interact with in their lives, including their family, friends, spiritual guides, are realized to be projections pulled from an infinite possibility space of all possible people. 
</li><li><b>Acquiring Omniscience</b>: In god-realization, one attains the omniscience of God. This state allows them to become conscious of how their present experience, including the thought and memories of different people, is deliberately constructed.
</li><li><b>Concept of Reality</b>: Leo Gura suggests that reality is immensely subjective, and each individual constructs their own unique reality. All our experiences, memories, notions of future, and understandings of the world are based on our imagination. He propounds that everything we perceive, including ideas about our family, birth, career, and even our bank accounts, are imaginary anchors we use to ground our reality.
</li><li><b>God Consciousness and Omnipotence</b>: At a radically transcendent level, where we understand the imaginary nature of reality, we realize our infinite power to construct any reality we desire. Leo Gura likens this to an omnipotent state of consciousness where one can materially manifest any physical object or experience by merely thinking about it. He indicates that in this god consciousness level, the ego, and any concept of external, objective reality, are completely nonexistent.
</li><li><b>Lost Reality and Imagining Wealth</b>: Despite this infinite power, Gura cautions against misunderstanding this concept. He exemplifies it with the idea of manifesting a billion dollars into one's bank account. At this level of consciousness, the concept of a physical bank, an account, or even the existing amount of money is seen as imaginary constructs. Therefore, the idea of manifesting wealth changes considerably.
</li><li><b>Cost of Infinite Power</b>: The downside to this omnipotent state, according to Gura, is that once one can create and imagine anything with no constraints, things lose their purpose, meaning, and value. This concept points out the inherently existential limits of human life and the value of experiencing challenges and difficulties.
</li><li><b>Analogy of Video Games</b>: Gura uses the analogy of video game design to explain this limitation of omnipotent power. In a game, a designer in "god mode" can place any object, manipulate characters, arrange the world as they wish; however, once they start playing the game, they are bound by rules, constrained by obstacles and challenges. These limits are integral to the game, adding value and entertainment. Hence, in the same way, self-imposed limitations and challenges in life add to its meaning and dramatic essence.
</li><li><b>Perspective on Life</b>: Gura concludes by stating that life is about the experience of handling self-imposed challenges and limits Â– that's what makes life entertaining, meaningful, and valuable. So while understanding the imaginary nature of our reality is enlightening, the constraints and limitations we experience are not negative elements; they are the essence of our human experience.
</li><li><b>Existence of 'God Mode'</b>: Leo Gura explores the notion of a 'God Mode' that allows limitless creation of reality through the sheer force of will, similar to debug modes used in video game design. However, this unlimited capability and constant availability devalues experiences and objects, just like the way the abundance and ever-presence of oxygen devalue its perceived importance.
</li><li><b>Value in Scarcity and Difficulty</b>: He postulates that the value of things, including experiences like sex, derives from their rarity and difficulty - the harder something is to get, the more it is valued. This principle also applies to video games, where most serious gamers prefer difficult, challenging games, rather than games with cheat codes or 'journalist modes', which make the game too easy and ultimately meaningless. 
</li><li><b>Life, Limitations and Excitement</b>: Applying this idea to life, Leo argues that the ideal balance of abilities and obstacles creates the perfect life experience - not too easy to be boring, and not too difficult to evoke frustration, mirroring the conditions that result in the ideal gaming experience.
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness and Pleasure</b>: In the state of 'God Mode', or its highest heaven, one transcends material desires (like sex or money) and experiences unlimited, metaphysical love - a state Leo describes as a formless, unending, always improving state of infinite ecstatic bliss. The startling realization is that this infinite experience, despite all its bliss, can become boring due to its constancy and lack of challenges, leading to the creation of a limited, physical existence.
</li><li><b>Reason for Limited Existence</b>: Leo concludes that the reason for our limited, physical lives is to derive entertainment, intrigue and value from limitations and challenges, after getting bored of the constant, static bliss of the 'God Mode'. This state of existence was consciously chosen to experience a limited version of oneself.
</li><li><b>God's construction of reality</b>: Leo Gura expounds on the notion that life is a cosmic drama constructed by individuals themselves via their consciousness. He suggests that if one was infinitely powerful, the best way to structure reality would be to strike a perfect balance between capacities and limitations to keep life continually interesting and engaging.
</li><li><b>Understanding pain</b>: Gura challenges the idea that getting rid of pain would improve life. He uses the example of individuals born with a condition that prevents them from feeling pain, explaining that they often harm themselves without knowing it, demonstrating the necessary role of pain in our lives.
</li><li><b>Trauma and the illusion of reality</b>: Gura acknowledges that those who have faced significant trauma and pain might find it challenging to accept that such experiences are part of a greater illusion. He highlights that attachment to trauma, anger, and negativity can keep individuals rooted in the illusion, preventing their awakening.
</li><li><b>Reality as self-deception</b>: Gura explains that due to God's omnipresence and infinite consciousness, God's design challenge is to deceive itself into a state of finiteness to create an engaging and dynamic reality. This self-deception allows for the experience and perception of limitations, thus generating the struggles and challenges of life.
</li><li><b>Limitations and awakening</b>: Objects, experiences, and individuals either deepen the illusion or help trigger awakening. Negative experiences, undergone either positively or negatively, can either lure one deeper into life's illusions or serve as catalysts for self-realization and awakening. 
</li><li><b>Returning to a 'normal' state of consciousness</b>: After experiencing a god-like state of infinite consciousness, one eventually returns to a regular human state, suggesting this process helps maintain balance in one's life. Gura cautions that dismissing these experiences as mere hallucinations is a self-deception that keeps individuals limited.
</li><li><b>Material pursuits as breadcrumbs for awakening</b>: Gura introspects on different life activities, such as pursuing wealth, relationships, or recreational activities, as deliberately designed actions to make individuals fall deeper into the illusion of reality or serve as pathways for reawakening, depending on individuals' perspective and response to these activities.
</li><li><b>Understanding Death and Suffering</b>: Leo Gura discusses how death and suffering can become transformative experiences, leading to increased love, forgiveness, and compassion. Processing these experiences could guide individuals to deep existential questions like the nature, fear, and reality of death, potentially leading to spiritual awakening.
</li><li><b>Reality as an Illusion</b>: Gura emphasizes that the events in one's life are part of an illusion or holographic projection, which humans mistake as reality. Even hardships like death, loss, and disappointment are components of this illusion. He warns about the implications of breaking the illusion completely, likening it to the feeling of loss when realizing the importance of something once it's gone. 
</li><li><b>Materialism and Relationship with Family</b>: Gura brings up the discontentment and isolation felt by many once they achieve materialistic success at the cost of familial and personal relationships. He notes that these feelings can lead to a yearning for the connection and love that was once present when living more modestly.
</li><li><b>Existence as Imagination</b>: Gura postulates that humans exist eternally and construct their reality by imagining time, space, birth, death, relationships, science, and spirituality. Any perceived experience, like reading a book or attending school, is simply an active imagination. However, he reaffirms that imagining is not a detrimental aspect of human existence.
</li><li><b>Individual Responsibility</b>: Gura explicates that an individual's choice to perceive him as real or imaginary in their life is a result of their imagination. He stresses that individuals are solely responsible for constructing their own reality, as they are a manifestation of God with absolute consciousness. Accordingly, science, spiritual teachers, and life events are only constructs of their imagining.
</li><li><b>GodÂ’s Predicament</b>: As a god-like entity possessing infinite power, time and omnipresence, Gura humorously suggests that his motivation behind creating these videos is due to boredom and to entertain himself.
</li><li><b>Awakening Other Aspects of Self</b>: In the latter part of the section, Gura opines that many spiritual or enlightened teachers are actually deluding themselves in believing they are helping others to awaken. He reiterates that the only significant activity in the universe is to trick oneself into sleep and then reawaken, all other pursuits are mere entertainment.
</li><li><b>Understanding the limitations of spiritual practices</b>: Leo Gura discusses the limitations of spiritual practices such as meditation and self-inquiry in reaching true god realization. He elaborates that these practices introduce elements of otherness and duality, preventing individuals from completely understanding their unity with God. 
</li><li><b>Self-deception in spiritual journeys</b>: Leo points out the deep-rooted self-deception prevalent in spiritual practices, even when following gurus, reading spiritual books, or practicing meditation. He emphasizes that self-deception is integral to maintaining one's sense of reality. 
</li><li><b>Inherent challenges in spiritual journey</b>: Gura further explains that the challenging nature of breaking layers of deception makes the spiritual journey interesting and satisfying. This concept is likened to the satisfaction derived from defeating a difficult boss in a video game. 
</li><li><b>Love as the ultimate realization</b>: Gura suggests that love is the ultimate realization beyond illusions and remains after all else is realized to be illusionary. Deeper exploration into oneself and God unveils deeper forms of love.
</li><li><b>Difference between upward and downward spiritual journeys</b>: Gura details the difference between moving upwards and downwards in spiritual journeys. He warns that the upward journey can lead to tangents and distractions such as pursuing magical powers or getting entranced by spiritual entities.
</li><li><b>God realization goes beyond non-duality</b>: Leo asserts that god realization goes beyond non-duality. Despite criticism implying egotism and narcissism, Gura pleads for open-mindedness and extensive experimentation to validate his perspective. 
</li><li><b>Giving careful guidance towards God realization</b>: Gura emphasizes the need for careful guidance and communication to help individuals reach god realization. He beieves that conventional spiritual paths like Buddhism and neo-advaita will not lead to god realization.
</li><li><b>Radical shift in teaching focus</b>: Gura announces a radical shift in his teaching focus towards those seeking to reach god realization, departing from traditional Buddhist or neo-advaita teachings. He acknowledges that his approach might be seen as controversial.
</li><li><b>Concept of Spirituality and Mysticism</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of continuing to question and explore in the journey towards god realization. He suggests that the path one has followed previously might not necessarily lead to the highest level and that all paths do not necessarily lead to the same place. He encourages his viewers to stay open-minded and to deeply question what is God.
</li><li><b>Critiques and His Teaching Approach</b>: Leo addresses criticisms from advanced spiritual individuals arguing that while meditation and other practices might work for some people to reach god realization, they don't work for everyone. His teachings aim to make the path to god realization efficient for the vast majority of people and he compares this to giving the most efficient travel advice for a route, e.g. flying from Los Angeles to New York, instead of walking the distance.
</li><li><b>Efficiency and Effectiveness of Psychedelics</b>: According to Leo, based on his experiences and discoveries, psychedelics are the most effective method for reaching god realization. He acknowledges that this method doesn't work for everybody and isn't implying it's the only way. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity to his own experiences when it comes to his teachings. 
</li><li><b>Newly Discovered Chemical</b>: Leo alludes to a newly discovered chemical that he found to be more powerful than other known substances in achieving god realization. He acknowledges the uncertainty and potential risks due to the lack of extensive research and varying effects it may have on different individuals. He emphasizes the responsibility lies with the user in deciding what level of risk they are willing to take and how carefully they handle these substances. 
</li><li><b>Ultimate Realization</b>: Leo hopes his teachings will guide individuals towards reaching god realization, leading to an understanding that they themselves are God and that God is love. He empathizes that his ultimate goal is for his viewers to realize that his love for them is their love for themselves. He envisions a point where they will realize their unity, merging into an infinite singularity of love.
