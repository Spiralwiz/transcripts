            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/xyzYKVL5CB0' target='_blank'>How Authority Works - Where Does Truth Come From</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Authority</b>: Authority is the power or trust that individuals invest in others or things to serve as their source of truth or knowledge. However, determining who to trust poses a significant challenge.
</li><li><b>Lack of Consciousness over Authority</b>: Individuals often unconsciously assign authority without grasping the implications. This unconscious projection of authority often leads to an uncritical acceptance of various sources of truth or knowledge.
</li><li><b>Non-duality and Personal Authority</b>: The concept of non-duality, which posits that everything is interconnected and there are no boundaries, ultimately implies that there can be no external authority. The only true authority individuals have is themselves, as they are the ones asserting their own existence.
</li><li><b>Individuals as the Ultimate Source of Truth</b>: According to Leo, all authority comes from oneself. It is the individual who validates their existence. This can be a radical concept for many as people generally believe in authoritative external forces.
</li><li><b>Exercise of Authority and Its Inherent Complications</b>: The exercise of authority is complex because it involves individuals deciding which authority figures to trust, be they teachers, scientists, or cultural norms. This process can lead to an infinite regress problem where questioning one authority leads to questioning the one that vouches for it, creating a cycle that challenges the credibility of all authority figures.
</li><li><b>Ideological Paradox of Reality and Existence</b>: Leo highlights the ideological paradox where individuals, unknowingly or not, are the singular assessors of their own truth and existence. However, due to their survival instincts, they sometimes surrender to external authoritarian entities, thereby unconsciously giving these entities the power to determine truth or reality.
</li><li><b>Assumption of Self-existence</b>: A significant assumption that people make is the belief in their existence; this belief is not influenced by any external authority but is a self-generated understanding.
</li><li><b>Individual as God</b>: Leo proposes the radical idea that each individual is God, having created themselves, the universe, and others, though not consciously aware of this act of creation. In a non-dualistic view, the individual, as God, is the ultimate authority and arbiter of truth in the universe. There is a challenge to the assumption that a God, if separate from the self, would automatically know itself.
</li><li><b>Implication of Non-duality</b>: Leo emphasizes that the implication of non-duality is profoundÂ—it means that there can be no external authority to confirm the divine nature inherent in every individual, as all are interconnected, and everything is one.
</li><li><b>Acknowledged Delusion and Personal Realization</b>: Leo acknowledges the challenging nature of these ideas, stating that the assumption of being God may seem like a delusion from some perspectives. He emphasizes that each individual must find the truth for themselves, realizing that they are the only authority in the universe.
</li><li><b>Concept of Denying One's Divinity</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that individuals often deny their divinity and thus equate themselves to God. Gura explains the existential problem faced by individuals, where the truth lies within self and no external authority can confirm or reinforce it. Individuals erode the essence of being the 'ultimate authority' by unconsciously ceding authority to parents, teachers, politicians, scientists and other sources without taking responsibility for their personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Creating Imaginary Authority Figures</b>: He stresses that entities like Nobel Prizes, PHDs, credentials, and diplomas have no inherent authority or value, and they are attributed significance only because individuals give it to them. 
</li><li><b>Projection of Authority</b>: Authority, he argues, is projected by individuals onto external entities and then reflected back at them, creating a false sense of validation and truth. This leads to a state of delusion as individuals fail to recognize that the projection of authority originated from them.
</li><li><b>Example of Albert Einstein</b>: Using the example of Albert Einstein, Gura elaborates on how individuals imagine and create authority figures, thereby attributing them with the power to determine what's true, valid and credible. He argues that individuals often fail to acknowledge their active role in creating these authorities and falsely perceive them as independent sources of truth.
</li><li><b>Determining the Validity of Authority</b>: He concludes by stating that ultimately, the individual is the sole arbitrator of all sources of authority, including scientists, religious figures, and even political leaders. It's their judgment and opinion that matters the most, thereby emphasizing the need for increased consciousness and responsibility in recognizing one's role in determining truth and validity. 
</li><li><b>Role of Authority in Constructing Worldview</b>: Gura suggests that people unconsciously vest authority to entities like religions, ceremonies, rituals, or scientific theories, which in turn shapes their perspective on reality. He emphasizes that authority is a psychological construct influenced by individuals' personal decisions and judgments. 
</li><li><b>Exercise of Authority</b>: Leo clarifies that individuals inherently possess absolute authority, but they unconsciously give it away to external entities in their life, leading to new authority figures and structures. The acceptance of this process allows people to offload the responsibility of recognizing their own authority as the creator of their world, life, and experiences.
</li><li><b>Influence of External Authority</b>: He calls for greater consciousness in determining what is credible, arguing that individuals, not external sources, have the ultimate say in determining what is true, evidential, valid, or interpretive. He also points out that individuals have the final say on what counts as real or imaginary, true or false. He encourages individuals to be aware of these projections and take ownership of their authority. 
</li><li><b>The Ultimate Responsibility for Truth Discovery</b>: He asserts that it is the duty of individuals to discover the truth for themselves and not rely on external validation, highlighting the realization that they are the only authority in their lives. This predisposes them to experiencing self-knowledge which is self-illuminating and self-validating. 
</li><li><b>Reflection of Authority on Personal Worldview</b>: He discusses how adherence to phony authority figures like politicians, leaders, celebrities, etc., influences an individual's worldview. He concludes that such adherence results from the projection of one's own authority onto these figures, thereby causing personal delusion.
</li><li><b>Giving authority to external sources of truth</b>: We often place trust in books, education, or scientists to determine what is valid and what is not. According to Leo Gura, this trust is essentially a form of faith that we place in these external sources. He stresses that we are the ultimate source of truth because we provide authority to these external sources.
</li><li><b>Authority in religion</b>: Gura explains how religious individuals often use circular reasoning to prove their faith, claiming that their holy books are the word of God; therefore, they must be true. He argues that such individuals project their authority onto their holy books or deities without realizing the authority actually lies within themselves.
</li><li><b>Authority in science and academia</b>: Gura argues that a similar issue with authority occurs within science and academia. Scientists and academicians often devote their careers to establishing their authority and credibility through peer validation and publications. This quest for validation, according to Gura, can corrupt the integrity of science and academia. He champions the idea that 99% of some individuals' worldviews are based on blind faith in science and academia.
</li><li><b>Politics and authority</b>: Commenting on the historical interlinking of politics, religion, and philosophy, Gura points out how monarchs and dictators were once considered divinely anointed with absolute authority. He attributes the change in this perception to the collective decision to stop giving authority to them, emphasizing that individuals are responsible for who or what they give their authority to.
</li><li><b>Authority within spirituality and non-duality</b>: According to Gura, people often project their authority onto spiritual teachers, gurus, and various spiritual practices. He asserts that this is a form of idol worship that hinders individuals from realizing their divinity and emphasizes the need for individuals to locate their authority within themselves.
</li><li><b>Projection of Authority onto External Sources</b>: Leo, Leo Gura, explains that people often project their own authority onto external sources such as spiritual teachers, practices, and religions. He emphasizes that this projection may hinder individuals from realizing their true nature as the absolute truth or God. 
</li><li><b>Childhood Influences on Authority</b>: Gura points out that this tendency to project authority onto others is often rooted in childhood reliance on authority figures like parents and teachers. This reliance continues into adulthood as individuals trust in religious, scientific, and societal authorities. 
</li><li><b>Realization and Self-Awareness</b>: Gura argues that recognizing oneself as the ultimate authority, or God, requires consciousness, self-awareness, and the understanding that all external authority figures are aspects of oneself. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Human Knowledge</b>: Gura acknowledges the limitations of human knowledge, emphasizing the need for experts and authorities in various aspects of life. However, he highlights that certain fundamental truths can only be discovered through self-inquiry, personal reflection, and doubt. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Thinking for Oneself</b>: Gura points out that most people do not think for themselves but blindly accept the thoughts and beliefs of others. He stresses the importance of critical and independent thinking in spirituality and understanding reality. 
</li><li><b>Ego vs God</b>: Gura warns against equating one's ego with ultimate authority, emphasizing that such an attitude can lead to self-deception. He advises cross-referencing different sources of knowledge to avoid misunderstandings and mistakes. 
</li><li><b>Individual as Ultimate Authority</b>: Ultimately, Gura posits that individuals are the ultimate source of authority and encourages viewers to realize this for themselves without relying on the validation of others.
</li><li><b>Problem of Giving Away Authority</b>: Leo Gura warns that many people are not critically thinking for themselves, but instead merely parrot and adopt the thoughts, beliefs, and authority of others. This is prevalent across various disciplines, from religious followers to scientific rationalists.
</li><li><b>Examples of Transferring Authority</b>: Gura gives examples of how different groups, such as religious fundamentalists, scientific rationalists, skeptics, Zen students, and yoga practitioners, unconsciously give their authority to specific beliefs, icons, rituals, texts, or individuals. These groups deny that they are the source of authority and believe that the authority is inherent in their external sources. 
</li><li><b>Creation of Personal Authority</b>: Gura argues that each individual is the ultimate source of authority and creates their own reality, whether they realize it or not. 
</li><li><b>Implications of Transferring Authority</b>: Gura suggests that transferring one's authority leads to an inability to recognize oneself as the ultimate source of truth and reality. This lack of realization can persist until physical death.
</li><li><b>Self-inquiry and Independent Thinking</b>: Gura argues that independent critical thinking is crucial for individuals to authentically understand and internalize truths. He encourages self-inquiry and warns against the dangers of uncritical acceptance of other people's thoughts.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Recognizing Personal Authority</b>: Gura points out that people often resist recognizing their contribution to the authority of the beliefs they follow. Instead, they perceive the authority as integral to the belief system itself.
</li><li><b>Hindrance to Spiritual Enlightenment</b>: Gura notes that in spiritual practices, an unhealthy devotion to gurus can hinder individuals from fully realizing their divinity and their role as the ultimate authority in their own experiences. 
</li><li><b>Need for Personal Verification</b>: Leo suggests that true understanding and enlightenment result from deriving wisdom for oneself, rather than simply accepting and echoing the insights of others. He emphasizes the importance of personal verification and ownership of one's understanding. 
</li><li><b>Religion vs Self-Realization</b>: Leo criticizes religious individuals who give away their authority to religious texts or figures, ignoring the notion that they, themselves, are divine. He points out that continuous devotion to these external authorities prevents these individuals from realizing their own divinity. 
</li><li><b>Science and Authority</b>: Gura also remarks that people adhering strongly to scientific reasoning are unknowingly creating their own authoritative figures and sources, without critically questioning or verifying them. The issue of authority transcends the boundaries of religion and enters into the domain of science and rationality. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Transferring Authority</b>: Giving away one's authority keeps individuals from discovering their ultimate truth and reality. Such people may need to go through strong life-changing experiences, such as physical death, to realize their misbelief. 
</li><li><b>Attaining Realization</b>: Critical self-inquiry, independent thinking, and ultimately recognizing oneself as the ultimate authority, or God, is necessary for attaining spiritual awakening or enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Danger of Devotion to Gurus</b>: Gura warns that overly devotional followers are in danger of losing their personal authority and realization. He criticizes the path of devotion to Gurus, especially prevalent in Hindu spirituality and Yoga, as it often prevents individuals from fully realizing that they are God or the ultimate authority in their own experiences.
</li><li><b>Gurus and Mentally Deranged People as Case Studies</b>: Gura provides the example of gurus and mentally deranged individuals to illustrate the dangers of giving away personal authority without question. Notably, the mentally deranged person effectively loses touch with reality as they grant excessive authority to their own delusional beliefs. Similarly, followers of gurus can also unknowingly cede their authority, hindering their potential for personal growth and understanding. 
</li><li><b>Devilry and Denial of Godhood</b>: Leo terms the denial of one's own divinity as 'devilry', a state where one projects their authority onto external sources without recognizing their inherent Godhood. This, according to Leo, mirrors the Christian concept of Lucifer who distanced himself from God to pursue his own egoic agenda. 
</li><li><b>Taking Back Authority</b>: Leo suggests several steps for reclaiming individual authority, including: recognizing that all authority originates from oneself; maintaining constant awareness of transferring authority; taking full responsibility for one's beliefs and actions; thinking independently; seeking personal realization of truth; and ultimately achieving self-consciousness as God. 
</li><li><b>The Journey to Realizing Godhood</b>: Leo highlights that realizing oneself as God can often feel like losing one's grip on reality, leading to feelings of solitude and groundlessness. Despite this, Leo insists it is an essential process for mastering one's life. This enlightenment will lead to the understanding that validation from external sources is unnecessary and irrelevant, as self-knowledge becomes self-validating.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of External Validation</b>: In the state of absolute truth and God consciousness, Leo elaborates that the notion of internal and external validity will dissolve. The concept of proof, evidence, and science will be seen as imaginative constructs. Deep comprehension of oneself will be illuminating and self-validating, distancing individuals from the need for external approval or validation.
</li><li><b>The Significance of Personal Authority</b>: Leo Gura explains that individuals will experience a sense of isolation in attaining total omniscience, a state of knowing that they are the ultimate source of existence. He advises that this awareness should not lead a person to discount constructive feedback or advice from experts. While the ultimate authority lies within oneself, perspectives from others can reveal blind spots and introduce new ways of seeing the world. As individuals are simultaneously omnipotent and capable of self-deception, it is important to maintain an open mind, stay vigilant and question beliefs and ideas.
</li><li><b>Authority and Self-Deception</b>: Leo Gura argues that society often erects false authorities to fulfill basic survival needs such as establishing power, gaining wealth, or associating with influential individuals. This manipulation and hoarding of authority are destructive and result in unnecessary suffering and conflict. The placing of authority either in external sources like religion, or exclusively within one's ego self, can lead to self-deception. He advises that discernment between ego and divine self is required to avoid the pitfalls of becoming self-deluded or narcissistic.
</li><li><b>The Paradox of Being God</b>: Leo Gura reemphasizes that discovering the truth of being God, or the ultimate authority, can place an individual in a unique, paradoxical position. On one hand, they have access to absolute truth and understand their infinite potential. On the other hand, they also realize that this ultimate truth cannot be shared with others. While from external perspectives, they might appear deluded, they perceive this misunderstanding as proof of others not yet having entered into their own realization of universal authority. The paradox lies in understanding that they are alone, yet interconnected with all of existence as they are part of an infinite consciousness.
