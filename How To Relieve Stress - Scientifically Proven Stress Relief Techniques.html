hey this is the leo 4 actualize org and in
this video I'm going to talk about how to relieve
stress okay welcome back how to relieve stress alright so
let's get into this stress all of us are stressed
right who is not stressed in this modern crazy world
with all the stuff that we have on our plates
we are living a really twenty-seven hour a day cycle
in only 24 hours and we're trying to cram it
all in there we're so overwhelmed our boss is driving
us mad our clients are driving us mad our spouse
is driving us mad our girlfriend or boyfriend is driving
us mad or kids are driving us mad our task
list and our calendars are driving us mad our emails
our phones are blowing up how do we get peace
in this life okay it can be hard right especially
now when everything is on everything's interconnected we've got the
internet we've got cell phones you literally are always at
the beck and call of somebody else 24/7 right whether
it's your parents or your business your career boss somebody's
always nagging you for something so how do we relieve
this stuff and how do we also relieve ourselves with
the pressure that we put on ourselves from these lofty
goals that we have you know especially if we're out
there and we're living ambitious kind of like the kind
of life that we're here Ashley has that org is
pausing you know the charge kind of life where you're
not just sitting back on your couch watching television all
day or your life is about going out there and
living something bigger it's about contributing your greatest gifts to
about fulfilling your full potential it's about learning and challenging
yourself and living on your edge I tend to find
that when you're doing that you tend to get stressed
sometimes right you get stressed from the gym workouts you
get stressed from the meditation sessions you do you get
stressed from staying on your diet you get stressed from
pushing your business forward so I feel all that myself
so it's good to have some techniques so what I'm
going to give you here is some techniques and I'm
going to give you some understanding about what is causing
your stress so you can start getting handle on this
alright so first of all the most important point if
you take away one thing I want you to take
away this is that stress even though it feels like
it's coming from the world it's actually coming from yourself
you are putting stress on yourself all of your stress
I don't care how bad it is is it's all
self created this is actually a deep point this is
an advanced self development point that I'm sure most of
you will not be able to appreciate if you've been
doing personal development though and if you've been following along
with my videos and you've really been thinking about this
stuff then you're starting to get a sense of this
inner outer world distinction that I talked about and you
start to get a sense that really it's not the
circumstances that are creating the feelings in your life but
it's your reactions to those circumstances this is something that's
been echoed literally for millennia from Western old-school ancient philosophy
from stoicism to from the ancient Stoics to ancient Greeks
and ancient Romans Eastern philosophies modern self-help gurus if you
study this material you start to understand that there's something
to this idea and at first it kind of just
dawns on you that you know maybe there's something true
to this and then as you start to actually take
responsibility to take ownership of what you're feeling in your
life taking ownership of your feelings and your thoughts and
you just commit to taking full responsibility for it and
not blaming anything outside yourself and you start to become
more conscious and you start to get more aware throughout
your day of really what is going on what are
you thinking what are you feeling why is this happening
it dawns on you that you are creating all of
it your ego is creating all of it the struggle
you're facing in your life is being created by a
need to uphold your self-image to live up to your
ego and that this is entirely avoidable if you go
through the personal development work that is necessary so right
now maybe you're just getting introduced to this idea and
seem a little bit like whoa I don't know what
he's talking about this doesn't apply to me first of
all I guarantee you that it applies to you'd apply
serve a human being because we all have the same
basic biological psychology but the deeper idea is here I
want you to start to say to yourself okay maybe
there's something to this just open your mind to it
and start to be a little bit more aware of
how you are responsible for the stress that you are
creating in your life and you will responsible both for
the good and for the bad and by responsible I
don't mean that you're guilty and that you're blameworthy and
that you need to be judged for the stress you're
creating in life just the fact that you are creating
it or allowing it and this is a big big
shift to make in your mindset because up to this
point you probably have not been very conscious of how
much you have been responsible not blameworthy responsible for the
stress that you've been creating that means that if you're
stressed at work realize that okay you are putting yourself
into that environment you chose to work there you chose
to take those projects on you chose to start that
business you chose to be in that relationship you chose
to be in this marriage all of these things are
conscious choices or maybe unconscious choices but you made these
choices right and you always have the option of backing
out of them or tinkering with them to make sure
that they're working better for you and so you might
be saying well yeah sure I chose to be in
my marriage but I didn't want my marriage to be
as stressful as it is right now okay granted but
take responsibility you got to stop this making of excuses
where you say well I did choose this but I
didn't choose the bad parts of it no you chose
that thing and it comes with the good and the
bad and in fact that good and bad that distinction
doesn't exist in the external world it only exists in
your mind so the reason I'm hammering on this idea
and I'm going to go into more practical techniques that
you can use to reduce your stress is because this
is hitting at the root at the root cause I
don't want to just give you little band-aids over this
wound this wound is coming from the fact that you're
not recognizing the cause once you start taking responsibility for
these things then you're going to start to see opportunities
opportunity is going to open up for you windows you're
gonna open up for you're gonna see like oh maybe
I shouldn't be working at that job so much maybe
I should be taking on that new project because actually
what I want is I want some peace time with
my family I want some time to myself I wanted
some time to go fishing I want to some time
to go read that book that I wanted to write
to read or maybe that book that I wanted to
write whatever maybe start that blog that I've been dreaming
of starting you know starting to realize that maybe you
start to realize that that relationship you're in that marriage
you're in it's not really healthy for you and that
it's too stressful for you that it's time to to
change it there's nothing wrong with making changes so start
to realize that start to realize how you're creating your
own stresses so as far as actually how to reduce
your stress and how to relieve it here are some
ideas another distinction I wanna introduce here is that there
are good ways to relieve stress and bad ways what
is this pain a good way is a healthy way
it means it's a way that's going to empower you
it's going to enrich you and it's going to put
you into a stronger position than you were before a
bad way is a disempowering way which is basically a
crutch that is maybe relieving stress in the short term
but it's actually robbing you of your life and your
potential and your energy in the long run and maybe
it's creating even more stress down the road on a
long-term basis so bad is kind of like using a
credit card to pay for that impulse purchase that you've
got right it might be fulfilling at the beginning but
it's really not smart long-term so this is what I
mean by good and bad here are some good ways
all right number one exercise physical activity sports this is
huge so going to the gym great way to relieve
stress whether it's strength training cardio then sports whether you're
doing sports the gym team sports getting involved in sports
somehow is a great way I actually find that you
know after high school and college we kind of tend
to fall out of the whole sports scene but it's
a good way to get yourself back and into doing
something that's like really fun and stress relieving is to
get yourself into some sort of league sport you know
whether it's soccer maybe a softball team or even just
maybe mentoring kids and being out there being out in
nature and fresh air moving your body this is important
this starts to release chemicals in your brain that actually
start to make you feel better start to relax you
just the fact that you're moving your body puts you
in a flow state gets you out of that self-consciousness
mode even simple things like going for a walk or
taking a hike taking just kind of a lazy bike
ride those can all be great ways to unwind another
one is reading reading books read something high-quality another one
is meditation yoga oh man I'd probably put this at
the top of the list if you get involved with
meditation at the beginning can be tough to build that
practice but the long-term benefits of that are just amazing
right now about six to eight weeks into my meditation
practice where I'm doing meditation every day for an hour
and the effects I'm seeing on stress relief there are
just incredible incredible so I highly encourage you to get
involved with meditation if you've never if you're well even
if you've tried it but if you haven't built a
habit of it I really encourage you to build that
habit and I have other videos that will tell you
how to do that all right next listening to music
is a great way to unwind slow your mind down
another great way is family time create some quiet time
with your family whether it's around the dinner table playing
a board game just having a conversation going for family
walk going to you know the baseball games some sort
of family activity whatever that is just having time to
do that so that you're not bothered by this stuff
that can be really rewarding it's going to increase your
happiness relieve all your stress and if you have some
sort of creative hobby that you engage in or think
about picking one up whether it's learning how to play
the guitar how to play the piano maybe arts and
crafts maybe you've got some sort of writing project that
you want to work on maybe you've got your car
you want to work on your mechanical tinkerer type of
person you want to get your hands dirty you know
whatever that is have some sort of hobby in your
life at least one that you like to engage in
and that you're building skill in this is going to
be a great way to relieve stress for you so
those are some good ways now let's talk about some
bad ways these are ways that you do not want
to use one gambling do not gamble whether it's online
or here in Las Vegas or anywhere else don't gamble
this bad way to relieve stress it's also not very
smart for you financially shopping compulsive shopping this has been
a problem actually for me is that sometimes I will
get compulsive on my shopping and go on Amazon store
buying [ __ ] up that I don't need stop
that stop buy stuff the buying is not making you
happy in the long run right it's just a short
little little stimulus little excitement but it's not doing anything
for you a positive long run smoking drinking drugs any
kind of chemical addictions or abuses that you're partaking in
definitely cut those out those are not helping your stress
in a healthy way they're also destroying your body which
is going to start to show and manifest itself in
all sorts of bad ways as you age and grow
older so get that out of your system right now
video games not a good way to relieve stress it's
kind of a low consciousness way to do it internet
browsing also not good television also not good if you're
addicted to watching negative news cable news can be very
addicting even reading the newspaper just being too plugged into
that kind of stuff being plugged into gossip get that
get that off get that off your whole radar this
is preventing you from living that kind of extraordinary life
that you are capable of living so stop all that
stuff and it's actually probably creating more stress down the
road for you because that smoking that you're doing those
drugs you're taking that over eating that you're partaking in
you know that compulsive shopping that internet watching that TV
watching it might relieve some stress right now in a
minute in the hour but it's it's actually building ups
other stresses like guilt procrastination laziness lack of productivity all
of that is being built up over days and weeks
and years and that is that is destroying you that's
creating more and more stress right it's creating a lower
quality life for you so those are my ideas on
how to relieve stress pretty simple these have been documented
well documented a lot of these ideas aren't sharing with
you have actually been scientifically proven with studies that have
been done so go ahead and right now commit to
taking some action number one I want you to identify
what is causing you the most stress in your life
just be conscious of it don't judge yourself for it
just let's identify it is it your work and what's
specifically at work is it your relationship and what's specifically
in your relationship identify that and take responsibility for it
don't blame it on anyone else even at work don't
blame it on your boss in your relationship don't blame
it on your spouse or your girlfriend or boyfriend take
responsibility for it so that's number one number two is
I want you to commit to one thing that you're
going to do that's going to start to relieve your
stress what is that going to be for you are
you gonna have to start playing some sports do you
want to do some exercise do you want to maybe
read some more set aside some family time set aside
some time for listening to music pick up a creative
hobby that you've been dreaming of picking up but you
just haven't taken any action on commit to one of
those whatever is going to fit with your personality and
your life right now and then the last thing is
I want you to really look and identify one bad
thing that is a crutch that you're using it's one
of these bad stress relievers that you really need to
pull yourself out of so gambling shopping smoking internet television
identify one of those and commit to pulling yourself out
of it for most of you I can bet television
is something that you can pull out right now cut
out and that's going to give you a huge quality
life improvement so try television if you don't know anything
else or if you have something else maybe drugs shopping
that you're addicted to pull yourself out of that all
right so those are gave me some great ways for
you to start to get a handle on your stress
