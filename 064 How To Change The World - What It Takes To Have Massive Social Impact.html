            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/hLJygQbyzWI' target='_blank'>How To Change The World - What It Takes To Have Massive Social Impact</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Interest in Making a Social Impact</b>: There's a growing trend among individuals towards making a positive impact in the world beyond pursuing personal comforts and security. These individuals have a deep understanding of their desired effect on the world and are passionate about devoting their energies towards creating a significantly better world in their specific ways. 
</li><li><b>Ways to Make an Impact</b>: There are diverse ways to make a notable change in the world, whether subtly by being a role model for compassion, passion, and love, influencing others through routine interactions, or dramatically like starting a global green company. Ultimately, the kind of influence one wishes to have is a personal decision. 
</li><li><b>Fulfillment from Changing the World</b>: Making a positive difference in the world provides a deep sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. It's not just about making a positive change, but also the joy derived from seeing the impact of one's actions on others and advancing humanity.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Self-Mastery for World Change</b>: The biggest hindrance to making a significant impact in the world is the inability to master personal thoughts, emotions, addictive patterns, self-sabotage, finance, fitness, health, and relationships. Inability to handle these basics makes the individual unfit for the struggle associated with changing the world. 
</li><li><b>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and World Change</b>: According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is the peak of the pyramid, implying that making a positive change in the world follows meeting basic needs, establishing social connections, and belonging to a larger community. To effect this change, one must overcome the inherent resistance due to the world's status quo, a task requiring enormous personal strength.
</li><li><b>Mastering personal motivation, vision, and resources</b>: Several personal factors will determine the ability to make significant change and overcome obstacles. These include motivation, having a clear vision, being financially secure, maintaining good health, and possessing the necessary technical and communication skills. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of mastery</b>: Many people struggle to make significant change due to not being able to rise above fundamental logistical challenges such as paying bills or maintaining relationships. Health issues and addiction to things like television, food, alcohol, drugs or negative thoughts can also hinder progress. 
</li><li><b>Importance of starting with oneself</b>: Before aiming for massive impact, one should first aim towards self-mastery. This includes mastering personal health, relationships, finances, career, and overcoming addictions. A solid personal foundation is required to withstand the societal pressure and barriers that come with an attempt to make significant change. 
</li><li><b>Benefits of reading and acquiring skills</b>: Reading books about psychology and studying the psychology of success is beneficial for personal growth and self-mastery. Acquiring skills enables one to shape their environment and opens the doors for creating change.
</li><li><b>Need for Long-Term Commitment</b>: Aiming to change the world is a long-term commitment and cannot be achieved within a short period of time. One must prepare for the journey by making necessary personal changes and acquiring vital skills.
</li><li><b>Offer to assist others in self-mastery</b>: Actualized.org offers resources for individuals interested in mastering themselves. The website provides exclusive content and a free newsletter to guide individuals on their mission to self-awareness and self-mastery.
