            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/nvaPmKQVIuQ' target='_blank'>What Is Truth - The Definitive Answer</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misconceptions about truth</b>: People often incorrectly define truth as a belief, concept, philosophy, knowledge, theory, or model. They might think that it is subjective, must be logical, can be written in a book, can be proven, or is irrelevant to everyday life.
</li><li><b>Types of truth</b>: There are two types of truths, relative truth and absolute truth. Relative truths are conceptual, they exist in the mind and can change based on circumstances. Examples include statements like "the sky is blue" or "one plus one equals two". Absolute truth is true under all circumstances; it's not conceptual but actual.
</li><li><b>Relative truths</b>: Examples of relative truths include statements such as "the sky is blue", "the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France", "a human hand has five fingers", "one plus one equals two", "squirrels like to eat acorns", "World War 2 happened", "objects are made out of atoms". All these truths are relative because they depend on concepts, symbols, language, interpretation, and thought.
</li><li><b>Understanding language</b>: The ability to understand language has a strong correlation to understanding and interpreting relative truths. The statement "the sky is blue" is a linguistic truth that requires specific interpretative functions in the mind. These functions are unique to beings with a certain level of consciousness and intelligence, such as humans. Donkeys, for example, cannot comprehend language, therefore cannot distinguish truth from falsehood.
</li><li><b>The relative nature of specific statements</b>: The statement "the sky is blue" can be seen as relative based on different variables such as 
</li><li>- Which sky? Are we talking about Earth's sky or some other planet's sky? 
</li><li>- What time of day? At nighttime, the sky is not blue. 
</li><li>These examples underline that "The sky is blue" is a relative, not an absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Prevalence of human-centric perspective</b>: Many assumptions about truth are often human-centric. There's often an assumption that all consciousnesses and beings are humans or that humans are the highest level of consciousness and intelligence in the universe. According to Gura, this perspective can limit the understanding of truth. 
</li><li><b>Nature of absolute truth</b>: Absolute truth transcends all concepts, beliefs, and interpretations. It's not an idea or a subjective perception, but the actual state of reality as it is, independent of any observer. Gura claims he had a realization of this when standing and pondering on the question "What is Truth?", and in that moment of deep questioning, he experienced truth as nothing more than the entirety of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Interpretation of simple truths</b>: Leo notes that even simple statements like "The sky is blue" require interpretation, and even then, they are not universally true because different creatures perceive colors differently. Leo argues that this is due to the relative truth being a contingent truth based on a correspondence theory of truth - wherein the human perception of reality is considered "truth."
</li><li><b>Correspondence theory of truth</b>: According to this theory, human truths are believed to be that which corresponds with reality. Leo argues that this theory is problematic as it limits truth to only symbols, concepts, and our cognitive understanding. It's important to differentiate between the raw existence of an object and our mind affirming its truth.
</li><li><b>Importance of cognitive function in truth determination</b>: The mind's ability to unilaterally determine and affirm truth is emphasized using the example of a donkey, who may see the sky as blue but would lack the cognitive function to affirm this observation as truth, highlighting that the affirmation of truth is a second-order function of the mind. 
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth</b>: Transitioning to the concept of Absolute Truth, Leo explains this as being the consciousness, or awareness, of existing reality. Here, the truth is not contingent upon the mind's understanding or affirmation but is based solely on its existence or occurrence. 
</li><li><b>Experience as a form of Absolute Truth</b>: Leo suggests that consciousness of real and existing conditions and objects, defined as experiences, are also Absolute Truths. However, he notes that experiences may not necessarily reflect what individuals believe they signify and may carry different meanings. 
</li><li><b>Truth as equal to existence</b>: Simplifying the definition of truth, Leo states that truth is "that which is." Thus truth is in the existence of something. The understanding of existence or "isness" is parallel to understanding what truth is. Regardless, Leo acknowledges the difficulty in defining "isness" or existence, and thus truth, indicating it may seem like an impossible task. Despite this, he assures that it is possible and imperative to understand.
</li><li><b>Understanding Truth and Reality</b>: Leo notes that truth is the actual state of reality, encompassing all points in space and time, and isn't confined to our knowledge of it. He posits that there's a self-reference problem when it comes to knowledge, as it's part of the reality we're attempting to define, akin to trying to use a finger to point back at itself. He uses the analogy of a computer hard drive, where bits can be on or off, to describe reality, but asserts that reality has an infinite number of bits. The truth, in this analogy, is the present state of all the bits, regardless of which are on or off.
</li><li><b>Reality is Made of Truth</b>: According to Leo, reality isn't made out of atoms but from truth. When exploring what reality's very substance is, he acknowledges that self-reference problems and paradoxes arise at the most fundamental level. Despite these, he believes it is still possible to understand the truth through a new state of consciousness, epiphanies, or awakenings. Leo emphasizes that what everything is ultimately made of is truth.
</li><li><b>Absolute Truth Encompasses All</b>: Leo goes further to propound that truth includes everything that could ever possibly be - all past, present, and future states. From God's perspective, the entire state of all creation would be the absolute truth. Each little picture of reality adds up to the big picture.
</li><li><b>Interpretation of Symbolic Equations</b>: Leo presents the equation 1+1=3 to illustrate a deeper level of understanding truth that exceeds symbolic interpretation. He attests the equation as truth, not in the sense that it's factually correct, but in recognition of its existence or "isness" which is part of the ultimate truth.
</li><li><b>Important distinction between knowledge and isness</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that even falsehood and non-existence are part of the truth because they exist as concepts in our minds. As such, there is no actual falsehood or non-existence in reality. They are second-order, relativistic phenomena, not first-order ones. The truth is everything that exists, with no opposite.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of non-existence</b>: Gura discusses how the concept of non-existence, even while it doesn't exist in actuality, is projected onto reality by our minds, essentially creating the idea of non-existence that actually does exist as a concept. He explains that our experience consists only of existence, not non-existence.
</li><li><b>Concept of death under the impossibility of non-existence</b>: Gura suggests that if non-existence isn't real, then our understanding of death as a cessation of existence could be flawed. He proposes the possibility that death might not be as final as we think it is.
</li><li><b>Defining truth</b>: He emphasizes that the truth cannot be explained because it is already present before us, intertwined with our being and consciousness. Language, logic, and our human comprehension limits our ability to ultimately describe it. Recognizing the truth requires a deep, self-determined understanding that goes beyond these limitations.
</li><li><b>The role of awareness in understanding truth</b>: Leo urges maintaining continuous, intensifying awareness towards existence itself, wholly involving oneself in recognizing what is happening around them. This process could potentially lead to a revolutionary elucidation of what existence, or isness, is.
</li><li><b>The challenge in communicating truth</b>: Leo highlights the difficulty in elucidating the concept of truth due to its intimate interweaving with one's being and consciousness. It's like trying to explain a reflection to a donkey: the understanding can only come from a direct epiphany. This comparison underlines the difficulty of getting a person to understand truth unless they experience a profound awakening. 
</li><li><b>Truth's nature of being inescapable and absolute</b>: Leo posits that the truth would still exist even in an imagined scenario where the entire universe is destroyed. This is because the truth reflects whatever is the case. Even a hypothetical scenario lacking truth would, paradoxically, show the truth being that there is no truth. Therefore, truth's existence is independent of the details of the universe and is inescapable. 
</li><li><b>Realising truth requires change in consciousness</b>: Leo asserts that to know the truth, a fundamental change in one's state of consciousness is required - a transformation beyond thinking.
</li><li><b>Truth transcends times, space, and the universe</b>: Leo indicates that truth exists prior to every other thing, including all physical objects, time, space, and the universe. He suggests that various elements such as energy and matter are simply facets of ultimate truth. 
</li><li><b>The concept of experience and perception</b>: Leo argues against the existence of experience or perception. He asserts these concepts are illusions of the mind that allow us to believe that we exist as real human beings in time and space. He suggests that upon ceasing to believe one's existence, the colors and emotions that were thought to be subjective experiences would still exist, and only the subjectivity would disappear, driven by the disappearance of the perceiver.
</li><li><b>Existence of the self and the universe</b>: According to Leo, we imagine ourselves as individuals or as real human beings, which is a self-involved fantasy, but in reality, there are no humans or any biological entities. What exists is the objective, absolute, ultimate truth, which gives a sensation of living as humans, animals experiencing feelings, emotions, et cetera.
</li><li><b>The elimination of subjectivity</b>: Leo suggests that absolute truth can be accessed, and we can move from subjectivity to objectivity by letting go of the belief in our existence or our imagining of ourselves as subjects. He indicates that once this belief disappears, subjectivity will also disappear, and what will be left is pure objective absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Emotional reactions in relation to truth</b>: According to Leo, fear, anger, criticism, and any adverse emotional reactions triggered by the concept of truth serve as defense mechanisms, distracting us from understanding the truth.
</li><li><b>The unification of metaphysics and epistemology</b>: Leo proposes a concept that truth unifies all dualities, including metaphysics and epistemology. He explains that the perception of being the experiencer or the perceiver of perception and experience is eliminated to arrive at pure, absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Paradoxical nature of absolute truth</b>: Leo defines absolute truth as infinite, singular, utterly paradoxical, and illogical, that evades scientific proof, symbols, and mathematical equations, is unable of being communicated or taught due to its contradictory and dual nature. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness as pure existence</b>: Leo suggests the nature of consciousness is the awareness of pure existence, pure isness, or pure truth. Despite its lack of form or quality, consciousness possesses all qualities, forms and even the ones devoid of it, thus making it paradoxical. He advises placing one's consciousness on their awareness and realizing that there's nothing there - symbolizing pure existence, pure truth.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Aspects of Truth</b>: Leo highlights that truth is a multi-dimensional concept that might take years to understand. It is consciousness, God, love, uncaused, self-created, eternal, sentient, and good. Truth exists outside of time and space and includes all dualities and distinctions. It is unchanging and a solution to all human problems. Leo emphasizes that everyone is a truth in their own right and truth is directly experienced.
</li><li><b>Infinite Nature of Truth</b>: Truth did not originate from anywhere, it is timeless, existing forever, being both everything and nothing at the same time, embodying form and formlessness. God, as eternity, encompasses infinity, which is the same as truth or life itself, that is experienced by all beings.
</li><li><b>Delusion and Understanding Truth</b>: Leo discusses the possibility of being deluded, admitting that truth is fundamental and cannot be entirely explained. He asserts that each person must use the techniques provided to access the truth directly in their own experiences, rather than relying on external validation. 
</li><li><b>Truth beyond Conceptual Understanding</b>: Leo emphasizes that truth cannot be placed within a conceptual framework and must be directly experienced. Though it may seem like there could be something beyond absolute truth, this assertion arises from a conceptual understanding rather than a direct consciousness of the absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Relation to Science</b>: The lack of validation from science doesn't negate the truth of the teachings, as truth cannot be validated, it can only be directly experienced. The issue of acknowledging truth is the prevailing delusions about what constitutes truth. 
</li><li><b>Origins and Validation of Truth</b>: Truth doesn't have an origin or an end and it's impossible to validate truth from an external perspective, it's validation is within individual direct experience. Leo mentions that people deny or don't understand this because of the prevalent delusions about truth.
</li><li><b>Dependence on human validation for understanding truth</b>: Absolute truth can only be accessed individually, regardless of external validation from science, religious figures, or other authorities. This approach negates the need to rely on external sources of validation in the pursuit of truth.
</li><li><b>Differentiation between relative truths and absolute truth</b>: Relative truths encompass useful and practical information employed to manage reality. Whereas, absolute truth represents infinite, overarching knowledge that does not necessarily require its recognition to engage the world. Although both are interconnected, the finite nature of relative truth cannot capture the full expanse of absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Addressing the supposed duality of relative and absolute truths</b>: While it may seem helpful to separate relative and absolute truth for the sake of comprehension, Leo asserts that there is no true separation. Rather, the role of relative truths is to assist in manipulating reality, much like separating and manipulating the different 'ones' and 'zeros' in a hard drive to create complex structures.
</li><li><b>The practicality and use of absolute truth</b>: The question of the importance or practicality of absolute truth is paradoxical. It is simultaneously completely impractical given its all-encompassing nature, and utterly essential as it serves as the foundation for all existence, including the concept of usefulness itself. 
</li><li><b>Personal motivation for pursuing the truth</b>: The pursuit of truth need not be compulsory. One's pursuit of truth should be driven by personal interest or curiosity rather than a sense of compulsion. However, realization of truth significantly reduces human suffering.
</li><li><b>Techniques to recognize absolute truth</b>: Techniques include practicing meditation, yoga (especially Kriya yoga), using psychedelics in a cautious and mature manner, practicing self-inquiry and contemplation, reading books on truth, spirituality, non-duality, and consciousness, and watching Leo's videos. 
</li><li><b>Painful and extreme techniques to reach truth</b>: Although techniques such as "Vision Quest" - intense experiences of deprivation in harsh environments - can lead to the realization of truth, they are not advisable due to the physical pain and potential harm involved.
</li><li><b>Concluding guidance on truth exploration</b>: The individual is encouraged to commit to the hard work of exploration and self-discovery rather than depending upon others. The final suggestion is to pursue truth for the beauty and love of it, rather than merely trying to escape suffering.
</li><li><b>Baptism as a Spiritual Technique</b>: Leo suggests that baptism, when done authentically (submersion in water until near asphyxiation), can be a spiritual technique that leads to the awakening to truth. He warns, however, of its inherent dangers.
</li><li><b>Knowing the Discovery of Absolute Truth</b>: He reassures that while it is possible to delude oneself in the pursuit of absolute truth, a genuine awakening will be self-evident and does not require validation from anyone else, as you become the truth. 
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics in Unveiling Truth</b>: Leo asserts that psychedelics can reveal the absolute truth, irrespective of their chemical composition or neurological effects. He holds that the proof of this lies in personal experiences and that an awakening will demonstrate why it works (despite seeming inexplicably so to those who have not experienced it).
</li><li><b>Truth and Love</b>: Leo denotes truth, love, and consciousness as identical, describing love as the substrate of existence. He lays emphasis on the need for an awakening to comprehend this nexus and that such understanding is distinct and requires a different enlightenment stage from the comprehension of truth.
</li><li><b>Absence of Multiplicity of Truths</b>: He negates the possibility of multiple truths for different individuals, positing that though interpretations, conceptualizations, and communication means may differ, the absolute truth in itself is singular.
</li><li><b>Truth Not Equating to Speaker's Words</b>: Leo notes that he does not consider his words in the video as an absolute truth but uses them to suggest the truth, provoke thought, and induce a personal quest for the truth in the viewer. 
</li><li><b>Implying Knowledge of the Absolute Truth not Egotistical</b>: He contends that professing to know the absolute truth is not egotistical if one genuinely experiences it. He encourages listeners to explore the truth personally instead of relying on his words.
</li><li><b>Warnings about Pursuing the Truth</b>: cautioning against those claiming to know the truth, Leo stresses not to perceive truth as a mind or brain property. He recommends viewers to be skeptical about his words and validate everything by themselves. He also warns against equating the truth purely to formlessness or cessation, as that is a part of the absolute truth but not the entirety of it. 
</li><li><b>Constant Evolution of Understanding Truth</b>: In the end, he admits that while his understanding of the truth is sufficient to share it, he doesn't claim it to be the ultimate understanding and believes there are further depths to explore.
</li><li><b>Cessation of Experience and Absolute Truth</b>: Leo discusses that even a complete cessation of experience is not a prerequisite for the realization of absolute truth. Truth is equivalent to the reality of the present moment and is unchanging, no matter the situations life brings. He elaborates that while some awakenings might lead to the realization of self as an illusion, it is not equal to understanding absolute truth; deeper exploration is required.
</li><li><b>Altering Your State of Consciousness for Truth</b>: Leo suggests that truth cannot be accessed by mere thinking; rather, a change in the state of consciousness is needed. He proposes methods to induce this change such as psychedelics, yoga, intense concentration, and meditation retreats. He underscores responsible and careful use of such methods, particularly psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Connection between Psychology and Truth</b>: Leo establishes a connection between the pursuit of truth and therapy. He states that every individual essentially needs therapy as it involves "strengthening oneself to bear more truth". The disconnection from truth leads to various emotional problems and suffering. He emphasizes the need for fulfilling oneself by being conscious of absolute truth, realizing our true nature. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Inquiry and Thinking Less of the Teacher</b>: Leo discourages listeners from treating his teachings as religious or absolute truths. Instead, he suggests seeing his teachings as something that inspires the audience to engage in serious self-inquiry and rediscover the truths for themselves.
</li><li><b>The Function of Actualized.org</b>: He describes his website, Actualized.org, as a set of contingent mental scaffolds to guide individuals towards understanding themselves and life better. He highlights the practical nature of his content to motivate and inspire individuals to learn new ideas and engage in practices. Leo discourages worship of his content, and suggests it as a tool to be discarded when no longer needed.
