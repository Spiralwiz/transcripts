    <li><b>Psychological Aspect of Energy</b>: Leo suggests that the overlooked psychological aspect of energy involves having a clear purpose, which can lead to an enhanced energy level. Following a purpose towards which one is truly committed and passionate can lead to increased motivation and energy.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Experience with Energy Levels</b>: He admits to experiencing his own struggles with maintaining energy, as an introvert facing the draining tasks of socializing and public speaking, aside from working around the clock. Despite these challenges, he has found that aligning himself with his life purpose gives him the excitement to continue to perform tasks despite exhaustion.
</li><li><b>Importance of Life Purpose</b>: Leo asserts that without something significant to fight for, our bodies will only produce enough energy for an unchallenging day. A strong life purpose can drive you to overcome the typical limitations and perform beyond your body's regular capacity. Leo exemplifies this through his own experience of recording multiple videos for his site, even past midnight, fueled by the need to contribute to his long-term vision.
</li><li><b>Role of External Factors in Energy Levels</b>: Despite the importance of having a life purpose, Leo acknowledges the necessity to maintain a balance between internal drivers and external concerns like health, fitness, and attending to any medical conditions. He assures his viewers that he will cover the physical components of energy in other videos on actualised.org.
