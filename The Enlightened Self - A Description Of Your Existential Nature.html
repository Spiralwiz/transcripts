hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the enlightened self otherwise
known as the true self to give you a really
accurate description of your existential nature this is an advanced
episode that's intended to help those people who are already
on the path towards enlightenment and are doing self inquiry
work and I want to use the information that I
want to give you here for you to cut through
all the crap when you're doing self inquiry and get
right to the root and find yourself as quickly as
humanly possible because it's very easy to waste years and
decades of your life searching for yourself somewhere out there
and be totally lost in fantasies and delusions of grandeur
and all sorts of mystical concepts of what you actually
are and in giving you these tips you're going to
develop a much stronger conceptual framework of how to do
enlightenment work and this conceptual framework even though it is
just conceptual and we know the danger of concepts it's
still very important because if you have a weak or
misguided conceptual framework when you're on this spiritual journey you're
going to fail miserably and you're going to get lost
in many cul-de-sacs and traps and you're going to waste
a lot of your time and a lot of your
energy and you're going to become very very frustrated so
let's cut right to the chase so just as a
quick little introduction to ground or conversation what are we
really talking about here about this thing called existential nature
what do you mean by existential nature Leo well basically
I'm talking about what are you actually existentially what are
you to most people this question doesn't even become relevant
until they've gone quite far down the personal development journey
because the answer that question is of course I'm I'm
me I mean Lia who else could I be I
mean I'm I'm this thing right here I'm standing here
I'm sitting here I'm listening to you what else am
i what else could I be uh so what this
is called is called identification with the body and the
mind if I ask you who do you believe you
actually are you would say I am this body and
this mind called Leo and I live in this body
and when this body is going to die and this
mind is in this brain is going to stop functioning
then that's the end of Leo and that's what I
am and I was born that way and I'm going
to die that way now that's one possibility another possibility
is that actually you're not a human being the first
possibility was basically you being a human being the other
possibility is that you're not a human being you're just
a story that thing you think you are that I'm
pointing to right now that's occupying space physical space in
that body that's living inside the skull that thinks it's
like the ghost in the machine the one that's perceiving
all of reality that thing including the body that it
thinks it owns what if that was just a story
what if that was a belief that was fed into
your knowledge graph from such a young age that you
never questioned it you were literally indoctrinated with it to
such a degree that you can't even fathom the possibility
of it being false that's a second possibility now what
I would suggest to you as an empirical statement an
empirical claim a fact is that you can actually demonstrate
that the second option is is true and that the
first one is false so what you are is you're
actually not a human being that's something you falsely identified
yourself with in the same sense that imagine that an
insane person instead of believing that he was his body
he believed that he was the coffee table for whatever
silly reason he just believed he really believed like no
I'm the coffee table don't hurt my coffee table you're
gonna hurt me if that coffee table is destroyed I'm
gonna die seems kind of silly no why would he
do that well you could just imagine something's wrong in
his mind right he's very confused very confused he thinks
he's a coffee table the man who thought he was
a coffee table that could be like the title of
a book um so just yeah just a little thought
experiment for you right so if we came up to
that person we said hey man you're not a coffee
table dude you're the body maybe you know with enough
talking to him about it we could convince him that
actually he's not the coffee table well what's possible is
to have that same kind of discussion with you you
who thinks that they are the body and to eventually
have you come to the realization that you're not the
body and you're not the mind and that you're something
else and that you are as much the body in
the mind as you are your coffee table literally I'm
not just being hyperbolic here I'm not just being poetic
I mean literally you are your body as much as
you are the coffee table that's in your house how
is that possible well go check out some of my
spiritual alignment videos I have some more introductory videos that
talk about all this stuff this video is more advanced
it's just for the people already on board with me
here and now they need some tips for how to
really go far with their self inquiry so if you
did watch my earlier introductory videos which explain this stuff
in a lot of depth for you newbies then what
you've heard is you've heard me talk about the no
self this idea that this self dispersed '''l self that
I think that I am this leo this entity called
Leo where is this entity well the no self concept
tells you that the self doesn't really exist it doesn't
exist there's no such thing as a Leo it's not
real it's an illusion that's what no self means but
it's very easy to misinterpret what no self means even
for people who have been doing self inquiry for a
long time so what I want to do here is
I want to clear up this misconception what does no
self really mean well this is a concept that comes
from Buddhism in Buddhism they call it anata anata this
is the no self it's important to get this subtle
point clear here when I say no self I don't
mean that there is no self at all that you
don't exist that's not really what I mean sometimes it
comes off that way what I really mean is that
the personal separate self that you think you are this
ego the thing that has a name this thing we
call Leo or whatever your name is that that thing
is an illusion but there is still a self which
is radically different from this self that you currently think
you are which is not the body not the mind
and not some kind of ghost but something very very
different this is called in various books and traditions they
call it by different names they call it the true
self the higher self versus the lower self so there's
this kind of distinction that's made you know false versus
true self lower syllabuses higher self they make a distinction
in the Hindu traditions of atman and brahman they make
a distinction also sometimes if like the small self and
the big self they also make the distinction sometimes of
the self spelled with a lowercase s and then the
self spelled with a capital K s like the big
self so what we're going to talk about here is
we're going to talk about not so much the little
self the little self is an illusion that you can
break but then when you break that illusion you get
to the true self the higher self what is really
that because that's actually what you are that's your existential
nature the trick though is that it's very difficult to
talk about this because this thing is so paradoxical and
so counterintuitive and cannot be grasped by the mind so
we are going to make our best attempt you in
fact do exist you exist not as a human being
and not as a personal entity but you exist as
nothingness you might think like well if I exist as
nothingness that means I don't exist no this is a
radical thing I'm asking you to consider consider and imagine
the following that you in fact do exist but you
exist as nothingness now you might say well leo nothingness
doesn't exist no consider the possibility that nothingness does exist
not only does it exist it's the only permanent thing
that exists has it ever occurred to you that everything
in your surroundings is changing all the sensations and phenomena
and experiences of life are always constantly changing colors are
changing sounds are changing feelings emotions thoughts are changing all
the time even your body is changing your body is
not what it was ten or twenty years ago so
if everything is changing you got to wonder what's the
only thing that doesn't change is there such a thing
turns out that there is although it's not a thing
it's not a thing nothingness not a thing kind of
mind-bending I'm going to continue talking about it as we
go on here I'm gonna give you some really clinical
descriptions of what this nothingness really is this true self
but before we go there I just want to give
you a practical tip about how you're doing your self
inquiry so hopefully you have a habit of doing self
inquiry every day or every other day whatever while you're
doing it self inquiry can also sometimes be called self
observation I sometimes refer to it as consciousness work enlightenment
work all these terms are synonymous in my mind even
meditation although meditation is different a little bit from self
inquiry it could still be classified as part of this
process so when you're doing any of this self inquiry
work if you're hung up on this idea that there
there is no self and the self doesn't exist you
might be sitting down and and trying to prove to
the self doesn't exist that can be helpful but what
I would suggest to you is if you've been doing
that for a while for a few months stop doing
that instead drop this whole notion of no self that
you don't exist and now start looking for the true
self so your attitude should be okay I exist I'm
just not clear as to what I actually am what
am i if I'm not the human body or the
mind or any of the sensations that I'm experiencing what
could I then be and then investigate that question really
deeply and really self honestly what could I really be
if I'm mistaken that I'm the human body could it
be possible that you're just mistaken just like that man
who identified himself with the coffee table he was just
mistaken could it be possible that you're equally mistaken now
this doesn't mean that you don't exist it simply means
that you could be something radically different than you presently
think you are requires radical open-mindedness because as it turns
out the thing that you actually are the true self
is so different from anything you've ever experienced in life
that you just simply assume it's not possible it would
never even occur to you in a million years that
this could be possible so your job is to sit
down and start to look and my job is to
help to kind of convince you that there's something worth
looking for so let's talk now about what this something
is I want to give you a description of the
true self now this is a dangerous thing to do
because once I describe the true self your mind is
now going to have more ideas and concepts and I
fantasies about what you are and this can distract you
and can get you really lost because we're going to
try to do is are going to try to go
find that thing that I told you about when actually
that thing I told you about is just an image
in your mind and not the thing you're really seeking
so you got to be very careful there but the
reason I think if there's value in talking about this
you know some teachers don't even talk about this it's
really difficult to get in really enlightened teachers to even
talk about this stuff because in their mind is just
going to confuse you but I think that it's worth
talking about because firstly it can get you motivated to
do this this seeking which is important a lot of
you lack the motivation secondly I think there's a greater
danger of not talking about it because if I don't
at least give you some hints as to what the
true self is you're going to be so clueless that
when you get on this journey even if you decide
to get on this journey you're going to sit down
and do that self inquiry work and what you're going
to discover is that you have all these fantasies about
what this true self could possibly be and they're going
to be so wrong just so wrong not even in
the same ballpark of where you should be looking that
you're going to spend the next decade or two of
your life chasing your tail around in circles and you're
not going to make any real serious progress and there
are many people in spiritual practices that do just this
so I want to help you to minimize that now
does this mean you're still not going to get lost
no you're still going to get lost you're going to
get lost in lots of concepts but hopefully we can
reduce that being lost from a couple of decades to
just a couple of years which will be a big
savings for you so here we go what is the
true self this is the best description that I found
and I've studied many different descriptions for many different traditions
for me this one's been the most helpful I think
it's the most practical and the most useful because it
gives you something to to help you ground yourself inquiry
work the true self is pure transparent empty awareness pure
transparent empty awareness this is what you are existentially you
are not a human being you are not software in
the mind you are not neuron activity you are not
made of atoms what you actually are is this empty
awareness there are many different terms that are synonymous with
empty awareness consciousness is another term we can use here
that's identical to it another way people describe it as
presence presence and a really popular term is spirit that's
where we get the word spiritual spirit is an interesting
word because spirit derives from the old ancient languages Greek
Latin and Hebrew languages and what it means in those
languages is this is a definition is it means either
breath air or wind and this is what you actually
are you are not an object you are not a
thing what you are is you're sort of like empty
space empty space is what allows stuff to exist in
the first place you need empty space so that stuff
can occupy it and then all the stuff that occupies
this empty space that's the stuff we know everyday stuff
you know trees tables cars people so on and so
forth colors sensations emotions there's a lot of different stuff
both kind of rock solid material stuff you know like
a car it's a physical object but also we have
immaterial objects such as an emotion or a thought these
are still kind of objects and they're occurring within space
but actually it's even more radical than this they're not
just occurring within space they're occurring within awareness they're occurring
within you what you are is not something that's inside
of space you are what contains space and time and
everything else you are sort of the container that's what
we mean by pure transparent empty awareness there are many
interesting features to this awareness that are super counter intuitive
and very mind-boggling and quite frankly unbelievable it sounds like
science fiction it sounds like hocus pocus religious stuff but
let me assure you that it's not it's something you
can become directly conscious of this awareness that you are
is a really interesting thing it's transparent and it's empty
in the same way here's a really good analogy is
if you take a cup like a mug in your
coffee cup and instead of defining the cup as the
object the matter that it's made up of let's say
we define the cup as the gap between the walls
of the cup that's really the essence of a cup
the essence of a cup is to hold liquid now
to do that it has to have this kind of
like emptiness to it well the essence of awareness is
to hold experience and all of reality everything you experience
is experienced within this empty awareness there needs to be
a space for it to occur in so to speak
space is not identical to awareness but it gives you
a little taste of it so what I'm actually talking
about here is imagine that one day you woke up
and instead of believing that you're the human body that
you presently think you are you just realize one day
like oh I am actually space itself think about how
mind-blowing of a paradigm shift that would be for you
your whole world would be turned upside down imagine right
now you're not the body but you're just empty physical
space how can this be that's so weird and yet
as weird as that is the reality is even weirder
you're not actually empty space you're emptier is an empty
space you are nothing zero absolute zero that's what reality
is composed of that's the source of reality this absolute
zero is a very tricky thing very very tricky and
I want to explain some of the features of this
absolute zero you know one thing that really sticks in
my mind is uh I was at a consciousness retreat
about a year ago during the summer and I had
the good fortune of sitting across from a man who
just became enlightened he became enlightened right there not in
front of my eyes but he became enlightened like a
couple hours before and so the enlightenment was still fresh
for him and so he was sitting there and I
was his partner and what we were doing we were
doing a formal exercise his job was to communicate to
me what enlightenment is from his direct experience now that
he experienced it so this was not just a formal
chitchat that I was having with that I was sitting
there and I was sitting there for several hours throughout
the course of this workshop listening to him explain this
and some of his descriptions were really haunting and beautiful
and profound and also helped me personally to ground myself
in this work because until I heard some of his
descriptions I was kind of all over the place and
I had all these fantastical ideas about the no-self and
nothingness and this and this net uhm which are all
nonsense but his descriptions were really helpful for me so
here's some of the stuff he told me and his
instruction was to actually close his eyes and to to
feel and to become aware to get into like direct
contact right now with what he actually is and then
to just report it to me as scientifically and clinically
as he could and this guy was really good with
language he was really precise so some of the stuff
he told me went like this he would close his
eyes he would go inside and he would spend 30
seconds getting a sense of himself and then he would
open his eyes and you would say I am pure
presence just this rock-solid presence this empty transparent presence this
eternal presence it's just there I get this image in
my mind of a of a giant heavy black bowling
ball this rock solid object and this presence that I
am is like that it's more solid than a granite
black bowling ball you can't shake it it doesn't move
it doesn't change it's just there it's so empty it
doesn't draw any attention to itself all the attention goes
to the stuff that's occurring within it all the sensations
and experiences that I'm having these are all grounded and
rooted in my presence this rock solid presence it's completely
unshakable and he just went on and on with these
kinds of descriptions which was really amazing one of the
most poignant things I remember him telling me was this
this point about what this awareness is and what it's
designed to do is it's designed to shine light so
to speak metaphorically this just metaphor to shine light on
everything else this presence is so humble that it just
quietly sits in the background and it reveals everything else
except itself and therefore it's kind of hidden and it
goes unnoticed it's not really hidden but it appears to
be hidden because think about this to actually become aware
of something you kind of have to shine the light
of awareness on it in the same way they've a
flashlight you take a flashlight in the dark and you
shine it on an object that object becomes visible but
the flashlight itself it's difficult to get the flashlight itself
to shine light on itself because that's really not its
function its function is to just give itself completely away
to the surrounding environment so if we ever ask ourselves
what is the flashlight really I want to get a
good look at a flashlight in the dark how would
we do that that would be difficult because most flashlights
are not flexible enough to turn it on themselves see
and this is really what's going on when you're looking
in the self inquiry process when you're looking for your
true self is your like that flashlight that's trying to
look in on itself but you can't because you're too
rigid see the mind is not flexible enough to be
able to be aware of awareness awareness has to become
aware of awareness and what is this awareness this awareness
is complete nothingness it's zero it's just a blank it's
blank err than a blank how do you become aware
of a blank of zero how do you come aware
of something that's transparent and empty and has no form
in no shape and no location now you start to
appreciate the difficulty of what we're doing here with self
inquiry we're being asked to do something that almost seems
impossible to the rational mind this is impossible yet there's
something outside the rational mind namely nothingness which can do
it I think the most profound thing that I've ever
learned in all of my life is that nothingness exists
and I have it actually direct experiences yet but I
learned that at least there is the possibility my mind
is open to the possibility that nothingness can exist it's
not the case that nothingness doesn't exist it's the case
that nothingness does in fact you might say it's the
only thing that truly exists it's the thing that grounds
somethingness something this is grounded in nothingness this nothing is
identical to this transparent awareness I've been talking about now
what are some features of this awareness it has no
shape it has no form it has no physical location
it has no dimensional component within time its eternal it
doesn't change it doesn't move it doesn't get destroyed or
created that's what eternal means it's outside of time time
occurs within it it's also infinite which means that not
only is it nothing it's everything the nothingness is so
total and complete that nothingness goes full circle and flips
back around into everythingness and that's the paradox of enlightenment
and that's why the mind can't grasp this stuff because
this stuff is literally ungraspable to the human mind the
analogy I like to use is think of space-time you
know Einstein came up with space-time and he said that
really we're living in a four-dimensional universe and we have
the XYZ dimensions but then also we have dimension of
times of space-time and then gravity warps this space-time that's
what general relativity tells us and that you know every
object that has mass creates sort of a depression a
dip in the fabric of space-time and then what they
discovered astrophysicists as they started studying the you know the
outer reaches the university discover stuff called black holes and
then black holes what is that that's just an object
that's so supermassive that it creates this dip in the
fabric of space-time that's so deep that ultimately it tears
a hole a singularity a little tiny hole completely through
the fabric and we don't even know what the hell
goes on inside of it lots of speculation and theories
but we've never really been able to verify through experiments
you have what's inside and where does it lead and
how does it even work how is even possible seems
completely absurd that you could have a rip or a
hole in space-time and yet um that's what black holes
are this is almost analogous to what you are X
essentially you are like that black hole because if you
sit down and sort of question what is existence what
is non-existence eventually what starts to happen at the rational
mind and all your thoughts about existence don't do that
they just sort of crumble in on themselves truth crumbles
in on itself just to such a degree that just
like a hole is torn through your psyche and this
hole leads to nothingness and it also leads to infinity
it leads to the source of all reality which is
a mind-blowing beautiful and profound if you have enough courage
to open your mind to this because the ego is
very frightened by this possibility very very frightened so this
this nothingness is what you are I've personally experienced this
awareness it's kinda like a field of awareness to me
it's almost like when I experienced it when I had
my little short enlightenment experience it felt like like the
entire world is encased in glass and I am the
glass that the whole world is encased in it's like
omnipresence you feel omnipresent you feel like God not in
the sense that you can see what other people see
you can't see through the people's eyes so don't get
that illusion all you see is what's in front of
you right now and you recognize that that's all there
is there's nothing else but what's in front of you
right now but also you recognize that you're not really
the things that are being seen you're this empty vacuum
within which all this stuff is occuring and this vacuum
it's not like this dead lifeless vacuum it feels like
a like this bright alive vacuum it feels like a
vacuum that's just like um I like to describe it
as a three-dimensional camera you know a traditional camera has
a point in a cone that kind of shoots out
kind of looks like a pyramid and that's kind of
how we think we are we think like we're this
cone looking at it the world actually what you discovers
that you're not a cone at all what you are
is you're an infinite field like a imagine a camera
nationally camera sense I know how this could be possible
but imagine someone created a camera sensor that's not just
like like this flat piece of chip on which the
the image is rendered but it exists in all three
dimensions and it's infinitely large that's what you are and
of course it has no shape has no location has
no color has no feelings has no emotions it cannot
be sensed you cannot even experience it because experience presumes
and experiencer and there really isn't one or you could
say the experiencer is this awareness but this awareness is
not an object see not only can you not see
it or feel it or sense it you can't even
think about it and this is where the danger comes
in because everything I'm telling you is just thoughts and
ideas just believes but you cannot think of nothingness try
try thinking of nothingness anything you think of is not
it all your ideas of nothingness are not nothingness see
this is why so slippery and so difficult what's also
weird about this whole thing is that this self this
empty field of awareness it's not separate from objects so
the way I've been describing up to now it seemed
kind of like well okay so there's just like transparent
field within which everything is happening yes in a sense
but also in other sense it's not separate this field
is not separate from what you're currently experiencing and all
the objects that you know and love right now as
you're sitting here listening to me these sounds that you're
hearing and if you're looking at me or if you're
looking at objects around you in the world all of
that right there is happening within nothingness it's encased in
this infinite field of nothingness this pure empty awareness and
if you want you can train your mind to actually
focus in on that with the eventual conclusion that you
will actually break through and you will become aware of
awareness itself right now in your life unless you've had
an enlightenment experience awareness has never become aware of itself
yet right now awareness thinks that it's a human body
living inside the skull this thing you call you but
imagine that's not the case imagine that you're not a
thing that's the hardest part about this whole thing is
that you're not a thing and our minds can only
work with things have you noticed that nothing that you've
ever thought of in your entire life or experienced has
not been a thing cars trees people are all things
but even ideas mathematical ideas philosophical ideas colors sounds tastes
these we can also call things they're just more like
immaterial they're more like ethereal things they're still things and
your mind can deal with abstract ethereal things what your
mind can't deal with is nothing can't do it not
possible which is why it's not possible to think your
way into enlightenment and which is why it's not possible
to conceptualize enlightenment you cannot get a mental preview of
enlightenment not really you can just get stories and ideas
and fantasies and all of them are ultimately false you
have to be wise enough to to intuit that you
have to be you have to be so wise not
to get trapped up in all this conceptualizing business so
wise if the read between the lines very very every
move you make every thought you have is just there
to trick you because it's not what you're looking for
it's not nothing is so how do you find yourself
well the paradoxical thing is that you're not hidden one
big trap that I fell into and I still fall
into as I do self inquiry I'm continuing to do
this process is uh you try to look for yourself
as some kind of hidden thing it's like well where
is this nothing let me find this nothingness it's kind
of like you're looking for an easter egg it's like
what is this nothingness let me go find it or
like maybe I'm this energy I'm like a ball of
energy or like a field of energy maybe I'm this
like thing that lives inside my head let me go
find it let me look inside where am I am
i this am i that am I located in space
if I'm not in the skull maybe I'm in the
chest or maybe my mind throat or maybe I am
I am out there somewhere somewhere right here in front
of me maybe I'm here you play this game for
a long long time and the problem is you can't
win this game you'll never find yourself because you're not
located anywhere the human mind is addicted to objects and
it's addicted to space and visual imagery so whenever we
talk about something you have an image of it you
think it has a location a shape you give it
some kind of shape even if we're talking about something
abstract I can talk about the number two and the
only way you can make sense of the number two
is because you have some kind of mental image of
what two means to you maybe have an image of
two dots or image of a number two like this
or something like that to cats whatever you somehow represent
the number two you know in a very tangible way
in your mind it's like an image it's an idea
but see this doesn't fly with enlightenment you can't do
this with enlightenment can't any idea you have of enlightenment
isn't it how do you get to it quite challenging
the only way is through some kind of process like
self inquiry or some really deep meditation work so that's
my description of the true self that's what you are
be careful not to take this dogmatically be careful not
to turn this into just another belief it does no
good for you to believe me it does no good
for you to go and tell your friends about all
this or your parents it does no good to sit
down and tell yourself oh now I know what I
am somehow this this idea that I'm nothing this is
now going to help my life it doesn't help you
at all in fact now what I've done is I've
introduced to you ah a potential trap that you can
fall into which is thinking that you know what you
are so what do you do about all this well
step number one is you must do the work all
this conversation is pointless you have to sit down and
do the self inquiry work so commit to doing that
develop a habit maybe once every day for 30 to
60 minutes you sit down you do this that's what
I do you can do it for longer maybe carve
out a whole week where you sit down for eight
hours a day and do nothing but this if you're
really serious alright so stick to that habit and just
keep in mind that what I told you here was
designed to help eliminate cul-de-sacs and dead ends and your
self inquiry so let me quickly recap the dead ends
that I want you to avoid firstly stop for objects
you are not an object you will not find yourself
as an object any idea you have an above an
object you will not find that that's not you so
get that out of your mind right now secondly stop
trying to see or feel yourself you cannot see or
feel yourself stop trying to experience yourself you cannot experience
yourself because you are not an experience you are the
thing within which experience occurs that'll save you a lot
of time you can do that thirdly stop trying to
locate yourself am i here am i in here am
I here am i out there somewhere that's all spatial
thinking that's mind activity recognize it for what it is
and remember that that's not what you are you are
not located you are the thing that allows location to
even be a possibility a location really occurs within you
so to speak fourthly open yourself to the possibility that
you're not a human being for me personally this was
very important in fact when I have my enlightenment experience
this is one of the things that broke me through
is that I actually had this kind of little epiphany
moment come up and I recognize like wait a minute
this whole idea that I'm a human being who told
me so why do I believe that it's just a
stupid belief it's just a story story that's been fed
into my mind but my parents and by everybody else
around me in life and I never occurred to me
even to question it why would I be a human
being why like why would I even think that it's
stupid it's really stupid if you sit down and look
at it it's really [ __ ] stupid you're not
a human being your reality itself so it helps to
sit down and really think about that to generate a
lot of doubt because as long as you're fully identified
with this human body here man you can't do a
proper self inquiry you're so stuck with this identification that
nothing you consider is taken seriously by your mind you
have to reach a point of like oh maybe I'm
not this Oh what what the [ __ ] how
could that be who could I be then who could
I be that's the point you want to reach that's
where true self inquiry begins until then you're just doing
mental masturbation also open yourself to the possibility that you
are not an object this is really hard to do
because even if you think like well okay maybe I'm
not the body maybe I'm some energy spirit thing I
have some kind of aura or I'm a software in
the mine or whatever you're still thinking of yourself fundamentally
as objects see you're just substituting one object for another
object what's really radical is to say maybe I'm not
even any of that maybe I'm in a completely different
domain from objects what could that domain even be cuz
all I know is objects there's no other domain I've
ever experienced how do I access this new domain I
have no idea good now you're exactly where you need
to be keep going down that road and lastly just
remember that nothing is hidden this has been very helpful
for me because sometimes I sit down and it's like
it feels like I'm looking for something you know some
secret Easter Egg where is it and then I remember
all wait a minute nothing is hidden this thing I'm
looking for myself me this empty field of awareness it's
here right now right now as I'm talking to you
it's here right here I'm talking about it right now
it's occurring right now it can never not occur it
doesn't matter whether you're in a meditative state you're having
a good day a bad day whether your mom died
or whether you lost your foot in a car accident
it doesn't matter in all those situations you're still there
the true.you is still there the true.you is always there
it was there before you were born it'll be there
when you die when your body dies that's how permanent
it is but it feels kind of hidden because it's
very humble this thing is very humble it doesn't draw
a lot of attention to itself and your mind is
filled with so many delusions about it so many fantasies
and ideas that you really have to let all that
stuff go through a gradual purging process which is what
self inquiry is designed to do so when you get
lost and you think something is hidden just remember it's
right there in front of your nose your it always
