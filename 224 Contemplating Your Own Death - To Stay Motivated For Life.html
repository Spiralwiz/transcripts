            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jK1EqqHIOqw' target='_blank'>Contemplating Your Own Death - To Stay Motivated For Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Contemplating Death as a Motivation Technique</b>: Leo Gura from Actualized.org discusses how contemplating death can be a motivator for many to live life fully. He believes it is essential for effective self-actualization work to understand the shortness of life and the absence of a second chance. 
</li><li><b>Historical Examples</b>: Leo provides historical examples where contemplation of death served as a learning tool, such as Marcus Aurelius and the Buddha. Marcus Aurelius, a Stoic philosopher, frequently pondered the brevity of life, using it to ground himself and dismiss petty concerns. The Buddha, on contemplating the finiteness of life, began a quest to find something that could transcend death, leading to his enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Life as a Singular Round of Golf</b>: Describing life as a singular round of golf, Leo emphasizes that every stroke counts, and there's no redo. He warns against relying on the idea of an afterlife because it can breed complacency and lead to individuals wasting their 'first chance' at life. 
</li><li><b>Living Fully</b>: Leo emphasizes the need for individuals to make the most of their life and participate in diverse experiences. He recommends considering one's mortality when making plans and decisions in life. 
</li><li><b>Distractions from Death</b>: He argues that many people avoid contemplating death by distracting themselves with things like food, television, sex, relationships, family, business, career, etc. 
</li><li><b>Role of Self Honesty and Self Actualization</b>: Leo promotes self-honesty and self-actualization and recommends a seven-day exercise. Every morning, one should remind themselves that their life will come to an end and complete the sentence "If I was more conscious of my death, I would ________". The aim is to use the energy from contemplating death for self-improvement. 
</li><li><b>Path to Living an Extraordinary Life</b>: He emphasizes the importance of investing time in self-improvement and becoming a student of one's own psychology. Engaging with his content, doing the exercises can guide individuals towards self-actualization and a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Leo's increasing contemplation of death</b>: Towards his 30s, Leo finds himself contemplating death more frequently, using this as a motivator to focus his life, prioritize his time more effectively, and eliminate pointless distractions. 
</li><li><b>Detailed visualization exercise</b>: He guides a visualization activity, encouraging listeners to focus on their bodily presence and the immediate environment. He transitions into probing the concept of existence before birth and during deep sleep, leading onto imagining permanently going to sleep and subsequently losing the ability to experience life.
</li><li><b>Value of present existence</b>: Leo underlines the importance of recognizing the preciousness of existing, especially when considering life's finite nature. This existence allows for rich experiences, makes you aware of your only chance at life, and encourages contemplation on how best to utilize this opportunity. 
</li><li><b>Confronting death as a part of life</b>: Leo proposes accepting death as an inevitable aspect of life instead of fearing it. He expresses that living the best possible life, regardless of its length, can bring contentment that eases the acceptance of your mortality.
</li><li><b>Post-exercise reflective questions</b>: After the visualization exercise, Leo presents several reflexive questions designed to provoke thoughts concerning what they'd miss most about life, what they want to attain in life, and what is truly worth doing. These can further offer clarity on how to make meaningful use of one's limited time.
</li><li><b>Significance of contemplating what is worth doing and not worth doing</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the significance of contemplating on what is worth doing and not worth doing in life, particularly given the shortness and singularity of human existence. He encourages the audience to pause the video to answer such significant questions in their current heightened emotional state for superior perspectives and insights.
</li><li><b>Discouragement of pettiness and self-awareness of small-mindedness</b>: Gura suggests that full consciousness of the brevity and singularity of life helps reduce petty thinking and actions. He poses the question about how the viewer is being small-minded, encouraging people to consider this even within their overall strategies and objectives in life.
</li><li><b>Significance of aligning life with finiteness and reorganization of life experiences</b>: Gura promotes the idea of restructuring one's life based on the awareness of its finiteness - this could mean quitting a career or ending a relationship. He recognizes this process as difficult, likely scary, but crucial to self-actualization and achieving a more significant existence.
</li><li><b>Self-actualization exercise based on awareness of one's own mortality</b>: Gura proposes a seven-day exercise, aiming to maintain the viewer's awareness of their finite life and its implications. This exercise involves waking up each morning and reminding oneself of life's finiteness, followed by completing the sentence 'If I was more conscious of my death, I would ________,' with ten different responses each day.
</li><li><b>Utilization of resources for self-improvement and self-actualization</b>: Gura concludes by advocating for active engagement with his materials on Actualized.org to initiate personal growth and self-actualization. He promises that consistent engagement with the content, completion of the exercises, and expansion beyond his guidelines can lead viewers towards an extraordinary and satisfying life. He emphasizes the importance of pledging some time each week to stay committed to progress.
