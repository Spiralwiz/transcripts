[Music] what is death well finally we've come to this
ultimate of questions which I want to answer for you
here very clearly without equivocation but I hope you can
appreciate the depth of this topic and how tricky and
challenging it is and some of the things I'm going
to say here are very advanced insights some of the
most advanced insights that you can have about life reality
and self and some of the things I'm gonna say
are gonna sound outrageous are gonna sound insane are gonna
sound impossible and yet they're true and you can discover
for yourself that they're true so anything that I'm about
to say that sounds far-fetched to you that sounds Looney
Tunes to you that sounds fantastical and impossible just understand
that first of all I'm not saying it from a
position of ideology or belief this is not a belief
system of mine number one number two I'm not expecting
you to adopt this as an ideology or as a
belief system of yours that's not the intent of this
communication this is if anything I say has any validity
whatsoever you can validate it for yourself in your own
direct experience and so that's the place that I'm speaking
from if it sounds incredible that's because it is it's
highly incredible and yet nonetheless you can still validate it
for yourself without needing to believe me so here we
go I do you really want to know what is
death what is death well first before I tell you
see the biggest mistake people make about death is they
take death for granted as a given and they also
assume first of all they assume that there is such
a thing as death that death is real secondly they
assume that it's impossible to know what comes with death
or after death and that anybody who tells you that
they know what death is or what comes after death
that these people are deluded that they're religious nut cases
that they just have beliefs that they're just speculating that
they just have fairies or that they just say they
don't want to face the harsh realities of the emptiness
of death or the unknown they don't want to say
that they don't know so therefore they just make stuff
up right this is the standard assumption but this assumption
needs to be questioned because when you truly admit that
you don't know something that's not the same thing as
saying that it's never possible to know something so if
right now you honestly don't have a direct experience of
what death is you're not conscious of it that's fine
that's perfectly fine that's most people in life are in
that situation if you find yourself in that situation be
honest and tell yourself I don't know what death is
that's great that's a great honest place to start from
but it's a very gross mistake of epistemology to make
the additional leap or conclusion where you then say well
and and therefore because I don't know right now that
it's impossible to know and that nobody could ever know
that's not something you have a direct experience of you
don't know that it's impossible to know you just assume
so so I want you to be conscious that you've
assumed that your whole life also I want you to
be conscious that you have assumed that death is a
real thing isn't that interesting isn't it interesting that it
never occurred to you in your entire life nor anybody
around you none of you family members none of your
friends none of your teacher thought of your professors none
of your clergy people none of your scientists even that
you learned from it has never occurred to you or
to any of these people to ever sit down and
question the validity of the notion of death see a
lot of people will act skeptical to my proclamations here
that I'm gonna make in a minute about what death
is no say olio but you're just a blind believer
and you don't really you're not skeptical enough really I'm
not skeptical enough or you're not skeptical enough have you
actually been skeptical about death why do you think death
is real why do you assume that you think that
death is a scientifically proven fact or is death something
that you're interpreting is death maybe something you're projecting onto
reality why do you assume it's real see all of
us is taken for granted death is just assumed to
be a fact well that's not actually the case so
what happens when you actually die when you actually die
you dissolve into an ocean of infinite love and consciousness
so what death is is it's several things I just
want to state it very clearly here and then we'll
go into depth elaborating upon all these different formulations of
death that I'm going to give you so death is
equivalent to infinite love number one death is equivalent to
infinite consciousness number two death is equivalent to God number
three death is immortality number four death is paradise or
heaven number five all of these are synonymous just different
facets different ways of looking at what death is but
they all come together there's no contradiction between these they
all come together death is what are we number six
now I don't remember the number death is complete non-duality
complete formlessness a total lack of identity of any kind
the collapsing of all dualities and so the biggest mindfuck
of life is to discover that death is actually infinite
love because that's the last thing that you expect death
to be we as humans because we're so terrified of
death we demonize death that we think that death is
going to be the worst thing that's ever happened to
us it's the worst possible thing that can happen to
you right everything else in life all the other terrible
stuff that can happen to you in life is all
relative to sort of the absoluteness of death that's how
we tend to think of things and we spend our
whole life trying to avoid death almost everything we do
is is predicated upon the need to avoid death but
if you think about it if you ask yourself why
am I so afraid of death why are humans so
afraid of death if we don't know what it is
if none of us have ever experienced it as many
of us claim and in fact if we say it's
impossible to know what death is that sort of conventional
wimp wisdom if that's the case how do you know
the death isn't the greatest thing that's ever gonna happen
to you in your life you don't you assume it's
the worst when someone close to you dies you cry
for them and you assume it's the worst thing that
could happen to them when your dog or your cat
dies you assume it's the worst thing that could happen
to them when you see death on the news when
you're watching some war zone and you're seeing bodies getting
carried out in body bags you think well this is
this is terrible people's lives have been cut short and
how unfair life is that these people have died prematurely
children have died and innocent animals have have been killed
and and all this sort of stuff right but if
you don't know what death is and you don't by
your own admission if you're honest then why do you
ascribe all this negativity to it can you see that
there's nothing scientific or objective or factual about what you're
doing you're assigning a meaning and interpretation to something you
have no idea what it really is see can you
see how that could be a problem can you see
how your own irrational fear of death distorts and skews
your perception of reality after all why do you fear
death is there something objectively bad about you let's say
ceasing to exist if that's what you believe death is
what's bad about that well objectively neutrally speaking of course
nothing the reason it seems bad to you is because
it seems bad to you because you're selfish say and
you have a self biased perspective on reality and so
everything that you judge to be bad the whole notion
of bad is completely relative to the thing the ultimate
thing that you call bad which is what you've called
death or the end of your survival the end of
yourself but what if the self and survival that this
is just a self bias you have that there's nothing
important or special or even good about it you see
so you see to really appreciate what I'm talking about
here you need to have watched my episode called self
bias and also understanding survival part 1 in part two
because what we're really getting at here is we're getting
to the very core of self bias self bias how
your own selfishness distorts your perception of reality and so
one of the chief problems of self bias is that
when your self biased you're selfish basically everything you look
at gets distorted through the lens of of the self
of what your self needs and what you need is
to keep surviving as the self you believe that you
are whatever that is see and so you might say
well Lea what's the problem with that I mean I
got to survive don't I to a certain extent you
do but also the problem with that is what's the
cost of looking at the world in a selfish way
the cost of looking at the world in a selfish
way is that you don't see it for what it
really is you only see it for how it can
serve you well the ultimate cost of that is that
if you believe that you are a self and you
identify with being some particular self and you're now engaging
in survival your entire life defending and protecting that self
well this process can't last forever it's a finite process
it has to end at some point and so therefore
now you have committed yourself to fighting against that end
your whole life but also at the back of your
mind you know that end is coming you sense it's
coming and you're afraid of it you can see now
if you look at the universe as though it has
a beginning or you look at your own life as
though it has a beginning necessarily because that's a duality
it's gonna also have the end of that beginning you
can't have a beginning without an end and you can't
have an end without a beginning see so just by
thinking that you as an individual being had a beginning
necessarily that means there's gonna be an end do it
see ordinarily what we assume is just we we assume
that well of course how else could it be yeah
I have a life I have a beginning and then
I have an end so this is totally natural and
normal and it's this is just how reality is but
what if that's not how reality is what if that
is a function of how the mind looks at reality
what if death is not a physical event what if
death is a construction of the mind what if your
birth and your life was a construction of the mind
what then see this is a a radical counterintuitive possibility
which isn't possible and can't be taken seriously under the
materialist paradigm and that's one of the key limitations of
the materialist paradigm under the scientific rationalist materialist paradigm as
the story goes there's a physical external reality we are
beings within that reality we are conscious within that reality
but ultimately our consciousness hinges upon physical factors atoms molecules
brains neurons biology genetics and evolution and many of these
kind of physical stuff so we ground ourselves in that
and then we believe that all well death is just
death is just a physical process all physical things die
and you can't do anything about it and you can't
escape it and so the only solution is to just
accept it but that's assuming that the materialist paradigm is
true what if it's not true what if there is
no external reality what if there ever was what if
that's just concepts and ideas what if that is a
part of how you invented yourself as a self you
see to really understand how death works you have to
understand how life works and how birth works because you
can't have death without birth and of course we take
birth for granted as a biological process it's not a
biological process it's a process of constructing an identity to
be alive at all you need to construct an identity
identity is not a scientific fact identity is something you
construct an identity is a totally relativistic notion this is
another mistake that materialists make and common sense makes these
we tend to think that well I'm a human I'm
this biological organism sitting here what else could I be
or like a dog is a dog and a cat
is a cat and a tree is a tree and
when a tree dies a tree dies and when a
cat dies a cat dies and when a dog dies
a dog dies and when a human dies a human
dies no a tree was never born to begin with
a tree doesn't think of itself as a tree you
think of a tree as a tree when you say
that a tree dies you are the one who is
projecting death onto that tree and you are the one
who's even projecting the identity of a tree being a
tree onto the tree there is no tree there's colors
and shapes and sounds but there's no such thing as
an entity called a tree from the point of view
of the tree this is the key you have to
understand here to understand death identity is the key to
death into life what you identify as is totally relative
and arbitrary you could identify with being a playboy you
can identify with being gay you can identify with being
black you can identify with being President of the United
States you can identify with being shy and introverted you
can identify with being wealthy and successful you can identify
with being a human or an alien or a spiritual
being or an animal or whatever there's no limit to
what you can and if I identify yourself to be
and you have many layers of identification to you so
you identify with being human most likely you notify with
being male or female you defy with being successful or
not successful and maybe you identify with your career and
you identify with your family and you identify with your
race and your identify with your we already said gender
um maybe your nation being American or Japanese or Norwegian
or whatever see these are all layers to your identity
and perhaps most fundamentally you identify with being a living
entity a biological entity that might be your most fundamental
identity see well what if these things were not facts
but things are on my constructed so what I mean
here is this the following radical thing see if you
can accept us in your mind as a possibility that
what I'm telling you is if you stopped telling yourself
that you are a man or a woman or black
or white or even human or even a biological thing
if you stopped telling yourself that you are any of
those things you would never have been born is what
I'm telling you can you open your mind to that
possibility that your birth was not a biological process you
telling yourself that your birth was a biological process is
part of the identity that you created you see because
if you can create an identity where your identity is
not something you created but is in your mind you
tell yourself is something that is biological and external and
out of your hands it's not something you did it's
something that happened to you it's something that's a biological
physical fact if you create that kind of identity for
yourself as a human and you furthermore you add that
it couldn't be any other way this is just what's
true this is reality you tell yourself if you construct
that identity that is your identity and it's gonna feel
to you as though you're a real living biological human
who was born and who's going to die and that
there's no other way it could be are you open
to such a possibility this is in fact what you
did this is in fact what you're doing see staying
alive is not something you just did once if you
do it every single moment and what I'm telling you
is that if you keep telling yourself every single day
that well here I am I'm a human I'm alive
I've got a name whatever your name is I've got
a gender I'm I'm a Christian or I'm a Muslim
or I'm a scientist or I'm an atheist Rob a
skeptic or whatever you believe you are if you keep
telling yourself that that is how you maintain your birth
and what I'm suggesting to you is the following if
you stopped telling yourself those things you would die which
is precisely why it's not in your interest to understand
the things that I'm saying here because if you order
stood the things I'm saying here it would be a
serious threat to you so again what is death death
is the end of your identification with whatever you identify
with if you identify with being rich and then you
lose all your wealth and then you get the idea
in your mind that you're never gonna be wealthy again
because you're just no good and you suck and because
you know that wealth was just a one-time fluke you're
never gonna get back and that your desk to be
a poor person literally what's happening in a sense is
that a part of you is dying when that happens
now of course not the human biological part because remember
I said there's many layers to your identity so just
because you lose the top layer the surface layer of
you being some wealthy billionaire you lose that and when
you lose that notice you're gonna go through a mourning
process very similar to the process people go through when
they lose a loved one or a pet there's gonna
be a mourning process of losing your millions of dollars
and your reputation and your identity is being a wealthy
hotshot but you'll get over it you'll get over it
and then your identity will change it'll become something else
now no this is still surface level stuff if we
keep digging lower and lower and lower we get to
the very core of you are you of your identity
your identity of being a human being who was born
if somehow you managed to question that identity and to
deconstruct it and to completely let it go what would
happen is that you would die I don't mean that
you would stop seeing colors and shapes your identity would
die and from that point on if you never thought
again in your life going forward if you never thought
again the idea of I am a human if you
never thought that anymore if you even removed the word
eye from your vocabulary from that point on you never
thought anymore it would be as though you were never
born in the first place life would go on you
would eat you would go to the bathroom you could
even go to work but it would be as though
you were never born this stuff would be happening but
it wouldn't be your identity anymore this body would be
doing stuff it would be talking it would be thinking
even it would be moving its hands and doing stuff
but it would be like you're you're dead inside your
identity is gone but then you might wonder well in
that case what would I actually be what would be
my identity like let's say I remove all layers all
the artificial layers of the identity I remove my gender
I remove my race i remove my wealth i remove
my career i remove my family i remove even my
biology what's left what's left then is your true identity
your identity before anything is constructed this is what we
call the true self capital T capital S or the
self capital T capital S the self this is an
identity of null it's a no identity it's nothing it's
emptiness it's pure consciousness empty consciousness formless consciousness and at
the same time it's infinite it's everything so whatever is
arising is you but also if it doesn't arise that's
also you it doesn't matter whether something arises or doesn't
arise it's all you now you might say oh okay
okay leo fine but what about actual death what about
physical death they're not getting it when you tell yourself
but what about actual death what about physical death you're
imagining that there's no such thing as physical death the
distinction you draw between some sort of psychological death and
the actual physical death that's part of your identity that's
what you you use that distinction to construct your identity
because then you say well I exist on this and
where the actual death happens that's what's real and then
this thing here this psychological mumbo-jumbo that Leo is talking
about that's the unreal so this is just philosophy this
is just intellectual mental masturbation this is the domain where
science happens and this is the domain of [ __
] religious nonsense if you make that distinction that is
the identity that you've constructed for yourself so you got
to remove that distinction the distinction between the mental and
the physical this needs to go if you want to
understand what death is so it's possible for you to
become conscious of or to experience death without actually what
we would say physically dying the body doesn't need to
die for you to become conscious of what death is
and the reason that's possible is because you never were
the body the body is an identity you construct it
for yourself so you can unconstructive can deconstruct that identity
and you can experience what death is become conscious of
what death is without having to undergo physical death you
don't need to shoot yourself or harm yourself see if
you actually were the body if that was your ultimate
identity then you would have to actually physically harm yourself
in order to understand what death is but that was
just a materialist assumption that was never deeply questioned now
we've questioned it and when you questioned a deep enough
we get to the point where realize that oh I
don't even need to do that to die see and
so in this way what becomes possible is for you
to die as they say die before you die die
before the body dies you might wonder if Leo how
do you know how do you this is true well
this is not a belief that I hold of course
this is something I've directly become conscious of and that
I have experienced I've died many times and I've gone
through this process to the point where it's not a
it's not even a big deal anymore to die because
you just know what death is you're conscious of what
it is in fact there's no distinction between life and
death so you can become so conscious that you realize
that when you die you don't go anywhere because there's
nowhere to go because the idea that there's a here
and are there like while I'm alive I'm here but
when I'm dead I'll be somewhere else this idea of
being here or there this this is a duality in
itself there is no here or there everywhere is one
place everywhere is nowhere so try to maybe look at
it from this perspective try to imagine that you were
never actually born and that even though you think you
were born you're sitting there right now but right now
everything you've ever experienced your whole life that you've called
your life and you've called birth and all this that
all of this has been death the entire time so
imagine that this video my voice is speaking to you
I'm speaking to you in your death you're already dead
because you were never alive you were only alive as
an idea that idea alive that's part of the identity
you can start it for yourself see and when you
quote-unquote die you're not going to go anywhere you're gonna
be right here there's nowhere to go there's nowhere to
go of course these are very uncomfortable truths that nobody
wants to admit see as a society we've demonized death
so badly as a society we've we've created a cultural
reality out of death literally we've brainwashed ourselves millions of
and billions of people have come together to brainwash ourselves
that death is bad and horrible and terrible and that
we should avoid at all costs and why have we
done so because if we didn't do so we wouldn't
be here to talk about it this is what survival
entails this is the core lie at the heart of
survival this is the core falsehood of survival is that
survival is fighting furiously to defend something which is completely
unreal imagine that what would you do with yourself how
would you live life if you realized that death was
completely unreal and was just a social construction if you
no longer had fear of death how might that change
your attitude towards life towards work towards relationships what would
you do would there be anything left to fear anymore
after you realized that death is an illusion you see
fear is a hell of a powerful tool of self-deception
because if you think about it let's say there was
some deep profound truth that the devil wanted to hide
from you if we imagine a devil the devil wants
to hide this truth from humanity how would the devil
hide this truth would he bury it in the middle
of the earth would he shoot it out into outer
space where nobody could get to it whoa whoa how
would he hide it from mankind he would just simply
veil it in fear that's it because anything that mankind
deeply deeply fears mankind doesn't explore and what does mankind
fear more than death nothing that does the ultimate thing
that mankind fears so it's very easy for the devil
to hide truth simply by Cokely cloaking it in fear
and calling it death and that's exactly what the devil
is done metaphorically speaking is the devil has labeled the
most truest thing there is truth capital T love with
capital L infinity with the capital I God with capital
g has labeled that death and so you might wonder
well Leo why is enlightenment such a secrets and why
are so few people enlightened it's very simple you might
wonder why is there no evidence of God because you've
called God death you might wonder Leo where is this
love you keep talking about infinite love where is the
infinite love I don't see it because you've called it
death you see how tricky you are this is the
very heart of devilry what we're talking about here this
is the most fundamental deception that the devil does the
devil needs to pervert the truth and call it falsehood
and turn falsehood and call it into truth then only
then from that from that core self-deception only from that
place can survival happen and life can happen if this
core self-deception isn't in place there can't be life as
we know it there can't be humanity death is truth
death is love death is infinity death is God death
is consciousness death is selflessness and what you call life
that's selfishness that's falsehood that's delusion that's identification that's attachment
that's construction that's fantasy that's illusion that's imagination that's hallucination
that's survival that's self bias you might wonder how on
earth could death be infinite love I'm not talking about
some petty human love here I'm not merely talking about
the feelings of love I'm not talking about romantic love
I'm talking about existential love I've explained it before in
my episodes about what is love Part one and Part
two I've explained also what truth is in my episode
about what is truth I'd explained what consciousness is in
my episode about what is consciousness I'd explained what God
is in my episode about what is God part one
and two so see now we're we're bringing all these
together love is nothingness love is infinite freedom love is
formless consciousness so when you die literally what happens and
it doesn't matter whether this will happen to you through
an awakening experience through enlightenment or this will happen to
you on a psychedelic or if this happens to you
at the moment of your body's physical dying which whichever
it happens on for most of you it'll be when
your body physically dies what will happen is that you
your identity will completely dissolve so this little contracted identity
that you've developed over your lifetime this will completely dissolve
and you will melt and merge into the entire you
verse you will become absolutely one and indistinguishable from everything
else and with this your life will end and you
will become infinite you'll become totally formless you will become
the Godhead and this this very process of dissolution into
total absolute selflessness this is the process of of infinite
love this is the pinnacle of infinite love so the
tragedy the tragedy of life the beauty of life is
that we struggle for 80 years we're born and then
we struggle for 80 years thinking that work or you
know we're struggling against death and we're struggling against fear
and we're struggling against all the obstacles in life that
interfere with our ability to have a good life we
struggle against all that finally we lose that whole struggle
and we die and we think to ourselves that oh
man this is gonna be the worst thing ever and
everything beautiful about life is gonna be gone everything wonderful
is gonna be gone and it's just gonna be a
bleak empty nothingness some sort of void of nihilism or
maybe you tell yourself that you're gonna go to heaven
some sort of afterlife in the clouds with 72 virgins
and other sorts of materialistic images like that and you're
telling yourself how terrible it would be if if if
there wasn't to heaven you tell us a holy oath
if there's not this beautiful heaven with with the pearly
gates and and the 72 virgins then I is just
gonna be blank empty nothingness and it's gonna be terrible
it's gonna be the worst like you know what kind
of cruel evil God would create such a reality where
instead of going to heaven I would just end up
in an existential nihilistic void forever but what you don't
realize is that is infinite love that is the very
essence of heaven heaven is not a material place heaven
is the total absence of self it's completely becoming unlimited
unlimited in every way that's infinite love that's heaven that's
nirvana that's paradise it's total formlessness and while it's threatening
to us as little egos as little formed entities it's
threatening to us because it it dissolves us we lose
all of our shape when this happens actually what you
discover in that process is you discover that that is
your true form that is the happiest you'll ever be
that is the freest you'll ever be this is existence
and reality and goodness and love in its most pure
form in otherwise completely formless it's almost like imagine we
have a little bit of water let's say we have
a liter of water here on earth and we could
put it into different containers we can put it into
a tall glass into a wide flat dish we can
put it into various shapes depending on the containers it
takes because you know the water is is fluid we
can even freeze it and carve it into some sort
of sculpture and here we have this ice sculpture and
there is it it is in its particular form but
then what happens is if we take this water and
we just throw it out into the middle of empty
outer space the water just what does it become it
just becomes a blob an amorphous blob we might imagine
a sphere especially if it's like warmed up a little
bit by the Sun just becomes like liquid water and
just floats in a vacuum in zero-g and so it
doesn't have any shape because it's being pulled equally in
all directions perfectly equally let's let's imagine this kind of
scenario and it's liquid water or you could imagine liquid
mercury whatever so that it's still liquid even if it's
out in the middle of space you know it's cold
out there but whatever so it's liquid and it's just
it's a perfect sphere see and you might say well
this is terrible from the point of view of an
ice sculpture because an ice sculpture needs to maintain a
particular form otherwise it stops being that literally it dies
if you break it apart into some other shape but
also you could think of it as the following you
could think of it as when the water becomes a
perfect sphere and lose all of his shape that's when
it's most essentially what it really is its amorphous that
is its truest nature see water is not an ice
sculpture water is not tall water is not shallow water
is not short water is not wide water is not
a cube water is not water is amorphous that's its
essence and so that's all that really death is is
you're going from a shape a particular shape that you've
constructed and identified yourself with being to being amorphous being
infinite being omnipresent and of course to do this and
to live from this place then it is possible to
live from this place you don't need to actually physically
die to live from such a place you would have
to have no identity whatsoever by having no identity you
have an infinite identity which means you're completely universal and
you're completely detached from any particular form now you can
appreciate why the great sages and mystics and religious teachers
have told you from the very very beginning that attachment
is the enemy of the spiritual path and you know
going back all the way to Jesus in the Bible
you know he talks about how he's easier for it's
it's as hard for a rich man to get into
heaven as it is for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle you see so why does
he say that because the rich man is attached to
all these material attachments his successor as well to his
power and fame and all his accumulated houses and and
cars and all this sort of stuff while you're attached
to to all those things you can't become totally formless
you can't realize your total formless identity and so you're
always stuck in that particular form and you think that
form is so great but what you don't realize is
how great it is to lose all form altogether and
you're terrified no not only do you not realize this
you're completely terrified of it so no matter how much
I sit here and I tell you how about how
death is absolute love and it's infinity and it's God
and it's beautiful it's wonderful it's the best thing that'll
ever happen to you no matter how much I tell
you all that it doesn't matter because you're utterly terrified
of it because you're so attached to your particular form
and you think that I'm just bullshitting you or you
think that well what if Lia was wrong so no
amount of my talking will get you to surrender your
attachments for that to happen you would actually have to
go through a process of death of self deconstruction and
self annihilation you'd have to go through that process and
that process will be terrifying for you most likely because
most of us are terrified of death why are we
terrified of death because we have to be in order
to be alive as these chimp-like human creatures see we're
in a bind we're damned if we do and damned
if we don't because if all of us were not
afraid of death we couldn't be here talking about it
because to be here talking about it we have to
create form we have to create a society with create
a culture Olympic great technology we have to live long
enough to have children so they can pass on information
pass on knowledge build more technology resulting in the communication
systems we have today so that I could deliver this
message to you none of this would be possible if
you were totally formless and I was totally formless but
then again none of it would be necessary either because
what's the whole point of this communication it's to ultimately
get you to realize your total formlessness so you might
wonder why does it need to be this way well
it does I mean it's a circle it's a never-ending
infinite circle see the form which reality creates then ultimately
leads to the unification and depolarization of all form and
all dualities which ultimately merges back in total unity and
then once that unity is accomplished then that unity breaks
apart d it polarizes itself splits itself into dualities creates
form creates live creates reality creates animals creates humans creates
your life creates technology all of this and then of
course once that all's here then it needs to come
back together and unify again and this is all that
reality is it's a it's a polarization and depolarization process
it's a process of division and unification so your birth
was a process of division and your death is a
process of unification and of course the old my ultimate
mind [ __ ] of it all is that there's
no difference between division and and unification they're they're totally
identical they're two sides of the same coin you see
and you are all of that you are the division
and you are the unification you are the birth and
you are the death so by going all the way
meta what you realize that all this is a process
happening inside of you the universal you the formless you
you see and that all of this is just a
manifestation of love this is what love is infinite love
tada this is what you see all around you infinite
love manifesting itself both in polarized and non polarizing forms
through division answer unification and this goes on to infinity
forever all the way down and all the way up
forever it's a fractal of infinite love and you can
realize this directly because this is what you are you're
not separated from it so the greatest irony and tragedy
of human life is that we all live in such
terror of death and what we don't realize as humans
is that death is a total illusion actually death will
be the most beautiful end of your life it'll be
the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to you
now of course don't get me wrong I'm not saying
here that if you if you torture a person that
he's gonna sit there and enjoy it and of course
not so the actual circumstances by which you come to
die those can be horrific and torturous and very painful
and can lead to a lot of suffering you know
if you're if you're going through the process of being
tortured before you're dead that's gonna be hell but the
actual moment of your death that's going to be the
pinnacle of life see that's gonna be your life coming
completely full circle and you merging back into your true
nature and you becoming the truth you becoming the entire
universe you losing your identity completely see and so the
tragedy and irony of it all is that we humans
have invented so many elaborate schemes and systems to avoid
to avoid becoming the most beautiful thing that there is
and the reason and all these schemes and systems I'm
talking about crimes businesses relationships families sexuality entertainment movies video
games social media politics governments war all of that all
of that is just a delay tactic to avoid infinite
love because the infinite love is so deep and so
profound that it completely eclipses your ability to exist as
a finite thing whatsoever that's how good reality is so
while we might think that oh my god I'm depressed
or something bad happened in my life we might think
of how this is so why does life have to
be so terrible hunter life is so terrible precisely because
life is infinite love but it's precisely because life is
infinite love that it's so epic in its goodness that
if you were to see it's full goodness you would
cease to exist and nobody would even know that you
existed so if you want to exist you have to
deny actively deny infinite love and that's literally what you've
been doing your whole life otherwise you wouldn't be here
you'd already be gone you'd have already merged into infinite
love so the only ones of us that are here
in humanity and in society that are talking about life
and reality and science and all this stuff are the
ones who are terrified of infinite love because those of
us who weren't we're already dead we're gone we're out
of here you can't talk to those people they're already
in infinite love and of course going to infinite love
is not don't imagine as going some other place like
some sort of super hidden dimension somewhere no no no
going into infinite love is right here right now this
all of this so when your grandmother dies or your
grandfather dies or your parents die or your children dies
or your children die or your your pet dies your
friend dies what happens literally they become you this right
here everything is here your grandparents consciousness your mother's consciousness
your father's consciousness your children's conscious your dogs or cats
consciousness all the consciousness of all the people have ever
lived is right here right now in your consciousness but
you are separating yourself from that because you need to
create an identity of being a self which is why
you've created in the first place these ideas of my
grandparents consciousness my mom's kinder says my dog's consciousness other
people you know Hitler from the past or Caesar and
from the Roman times whose long dad do you think
that these people have gone somewhere they haven't gone anywhere
they're right here only their forms have disappeared and you
think that those people are dead only because in your
mind you're attached to their forms see Cesar's right here
Hitler is right here anyone who's ever died in your
life is right here nothing has happened to them nothing
bad has ever happened to anybody in reality that's the
truth of death and of course this will all be
radically denied totally denied by society by your family by
your friends by your own mind and I will be
called a devil for saying this I will be called
evil for saying this I will be called a monster
I will be called deluded I will be called a
cult leader I will be called insane I will be
called religious and woohoo and new agey for saying all
these things and why would I be called all those
precisely because everything I said here has to be denied
if you want to continue living life as a finite
being which is why this is I gotta talk to
you in school you're not gonna read it in some
textbook you won't see this on the evening news no
one is gonna validate this for you nor should you
believe me because hey you know the things I'm saying
are pretty outlandish what if I'm wrong what if I
am be lewd what if I am crazy what if
I am a criminal you don't know from your point
of view you know nothing so if you believe me
it gets you nowhere you're still stuck being a finite
being and if you don't believe me that's even worse
if you're sitting there doubting me well that also gets
you nowhere you're still a finite being still stuck in
the delusion of things that there's death so death really
isn't is a relativistic notion what dies is your identity
from the absolute point of view nothing dies it's all
just an infinitely reincarnating fountain God is just a shape-shifter
at shape-shifts through an infinite number of forms and it's
not not attached to any particular form therefore it lives
forever can't die it's immortal I remember the first time
I became aware of the possibility of immortality this happened
long before I actually awoke and realized it personally but
you know we got to start somewhere so usually the
way this process works is that you hear stories of
immortality and you think they're just stories until one day
you hear enough of these stories that a possibility a
radical new possibility opens up in your mind that maybe
they're not just stories maybe that immortality is actually possible
not as a science fiction scenario where your brain gets
uploaded into some computer no no no actually possible as
a function of changing how you perceive reality that is
the key insight that is necessary that that that won't
get you where you need to be that's just the
key insight that opens the door through which then it's
a long corridor you have to walk through that before
you actually reach immortality so but that that initial opening
of the door is a critical step and I can
explain when I first realized this this was years before
I actually awoke I think I was reading some sort
of Zen parable you know those Zen koans and things
sent Zen stories which are kind of flood and cute
to read and I was reading this story where in
this story they were talking about a forest trees and
a forest and this story said something along the lines
of if a tree identifies with being a tree and
that tree in that forest is cut down that's the
end of that tree but if the tree identifies with
being not a tree but the entire forest and one
of the trees in the forest is cut down the
forest is immortal and it can never die and when
I read that that was my first clue as to
this being a real possibility because I realized at that
point that what if I my whole life is just
like that tree what if I'm misidentifying if I switched
my identity from being that of a human this body
to that of being the entire universe if I could
make that shift in identity that might be enough to
make me immortal and sure enough that's the case now
you might say olya but what about what if they
cut down the whole forest if you cut down the
whole forest then then it's all dead and so your
immortality fails that's correct because this is just an analogy
you know every analogy has its limits so in this
analogy if you did cut down the whole forest that
would be the end because you identify with being a
forest a forest is still a finite limited formed thing
so for you to truly become immortal you would have
to not identify with being a forest you'd have to
identify with being infinite with being the entire universe with
being nothing now you might say ah leo but the
universe even if I expanded somehow my identity magically expanded
it to include the entire universe still Leo doesn't science
tells us tell us that the universe will collapse at
some point or it'll go to some sort of you
know heat death or you know I guess even the
universe might be destroyed maybe gets sucked into some black
hole and then even the universe is gone that's right
so this is the difference between a universe with the
lowercase U and a universe with a capital uppercase u
so when I say universe when I say identifying with
the whole universe I'm talking about universe as an absolute
with an uppercase u that's not the universe of science
the universe of science is a finite limited relativistic formed
thing which will die it was born and it will
die so if you identify with with our particular scientific
universe you're still gonna be mortal you need to identify
with being truly infinite infinite universe is a totality of
everything that's ever possible including all the multiverses and anything
else out there and our universe all of that you
got identified with absolutely everything that's the only thing that
isn't created or destroyed the totality the unity the oneness
if there's any heat of duality in your notification then
you're gonna be mortal because every duality collapses so you
have to go so meta that you transcend any individual
dualities and you identify with the entire movement of reality
of consciousness this polarization and then depolarization this division and
merging see you can't identify with any one particular division
you have to be the whole thing and that's exactly
what you'll become at your death pretty cool huh see
so life is the opposite of cruel because what you
don't realize is that this whole time you've been here
in life material existence and your life has been endangered
many times you've suffered and you've always faced this crippling
fear of death and you know what if something go
terribly wrong with your children all this but what you
don't realize is that when something does go terribly wrong
with your children if it does let's hope it doesn't
but if something does go terribly wrong with your children
well you don't realize its parent is that your child
becomes infinite love so nothing is lost see that's the
beauty of the design of life is that all suffering
and all setback and all loss is all finite and
relative but the absolute is love and goodness and it's
always that and so you really have nothing to lose
and nothing to fear but fear itself the love is
so great that you are too finite and weak to
handle it that's the tragedy of everything that you think
is evil or bad everything you think that seems to
undermine the love of the design of life that's actually
it's very evidence but you don't want to accept that
because there's a finite little little limited being from your
point of view you're just attached to survival that's all
you understand is survival you can't understand it and it
love you can't understand that it makes no sense to
you your mind cannot handle the idea of death so
the irony is that it seems as though well you
know the things you're saying here are so outlandish and
so unscientific and so mystical it's so irrational and so
full of wishful thinking and it's like who are you
really kidding here no this is truth and all of
your pretenses to science to materialism to atheism to rationalism
all of these ideas and and identities you've constructed about
being a realist and being rational and being like being
hard-nosed and being factual and being objective all of this
this is all fantasies this is all wishful thinking this
is all denial of infinite love all of your skepticism
doubt all of your pessimism all of your depression all
of your criticism all of this is just a denial
of infinite love and you're going to lose this battle
no matter what doesn't matter what you believe doesn't matter
how hard you fight you are guaranteed to lose the
battle to infinite love you're going to melt into infinite
love no matter what you do it doesn't matter and
that is God's mercy for all of its creation so
you're playing a game you can't possibly lose but you
have fooled yourself into thinking you can lose it and
that's why you suffer and that is the source of
all evil evil is nothing other than a misperception of
the truth but your consciousness is so finite that you
can't help yourself you don't know how not to miss
perceive the truth so this is the situation that we're
stuck in the entire process of life of human growth
is the process of coming to realize your own finitude
and ignorance your own self limitation and then transcending your
own self limitations your own self deceptions that's what all
of your life is about whether you realize it or
not and the extent to which your life becomes good
and enjoyable and peaceful is the extent to which you
align yourself with this process and then the extent to
which your life is miserable and full of suffering and
pain and evil is the extent to which you resist
this process you deny this process and you act like
a stubborn mule and you try to be selfish and
wisdom is aligning yourself with this process and moving directly
towards selflessness as soon as you can without detours distractions
games defense mechanisms and all that other stuff that you
do that we call human life yeah that's a hell
of a thing but hey don't take my word for
it discover for yourself what is the case maybe I'm
wrong you might wonder Walia what about reincarnation what about
that from the highest absolute perspective everything infinitely reincarnates so
after this body dies will there be some new body
of core probably I mean I don't know I don't
know the details of what will happen after this bio
and body dies so I'm not going and gonna make
claims about that I'm talking about the absolute perspective from
the house protect if it doesn't matter what happens to
this body it doesn't matter if I turn into a
giraffe or if I turn into an alien or if
I turn into Hitler like none of it doesn't matter
because ultimately from the absolute perspective I already am all
those things I'm cycling through the entire chain of being
and so are you because I am you and you
are me so right now I'm sitting here shooting this
this video I'm also sitting there listening to myself talk
as you see so it doesn't matter unless you think
it does it's relative so don't get stuck on this
idea of us for a finite limited reincarnation or incarnation
is unlimited you might say believe how could you possibly
know any of this I died I died it's your
direct experience and you can too did it does you
no good to sit there and speculate about this stuff
to theorize about it like all well what if Leo
is right or what if he's stronger but I think
this will happen maybe I'll turn into a giraffe or
maybe I'll turn into an alien or maybe this happened
this isn't help what's necessary and the only way you
can understand what's being communicated here is by actually dying
of course the problem is that that's this is the
last thing you want to do you don't want to
do it now you might say Oh Leo put but
if what you're saying is true why don't you just
shoot yourself right now but that assumes I'm alive to
begin with I've already done it many times so I
don't need to shoot myself physically you're attached to this
whole physical thing you don't need to physically kill yourself
nor don't get me wrong I am not advocating that
you physically harm your body whatsoever I don't advocate suicide
in the physical sense what I'm advocating is that you
realize that the duality between physical and mental is unreal
and imaginary that's what I'm talking about here so don't
don't get me wrong you might ask well Leo what
but if I'm depressed right now and I'm in a
miserable situation in my life why do I have to
work for awakening why don't I just kill myself right
now physically what I'm shooting I'll be infinite and I'll
be God why don't I just do that well you
can I don't recommend it for social reasons I don't
recommend it but you certainly can thousands of people do
every single year but there's something wrong about it because
you you still when you do that you still do
it out of selfishness you see you see the problem
you're still doing out of selfishness the much better way
to go about it would be to actually do the
spiritual work instead to overcome your suffering and your depression
all that to rise above it to transcend it to
do this not physically but to do it at a
mental level or at an existential level transcend existentially and
then to become a example for others of what's possible
for them and then to enjoy your life enjoy existence
enjoy the formed material world you can enjoy all this
stuff it's amazing it is amazing and also remember there's
nowhere to go so if I shoot myself right now
where am I gonna go I'm gonna be right back
here I'm not going anywhere from your point of view
till seem like this body disappears but it doesn't matter
see you're the one who's attached to this body not
the awakened person the awakened person is not attached to
the body so so harming the body is completely unnecessary
this itself as egotism do the work to awaken and
appreciate the beauty of love manifest in physical form you
see when you're totally formless as the Godhead let's say
after you physically die there you can appreciate love in
his totally pure formless state but it's even wrong to
say that you can appreciate it because appreciation is still
a formed limited finite process or thing don't worry about
that you'll be there you came from there you'll go
back there so don't worry about that when you're here
in this formed body and this formed realm enjoy and
take it all in as beautiful it's amazing it's remarkable
this is love crystallized precipitated as mater you're living in
a in a matter / love construction here appreciate that
love and mater in its finite form is a beautiful
thing it's finite but it's still remarkable and it's beautiful
and it's worthy of appreciation because look if you don't
do it who else will you're the only one here
someone has to appreciate all this stuff you are here
to appreciate what you are you are both that formless
thing but you're also this formed thing here and really
they're not different so appreciate it the point of life
is to awaken and then to appreciate yourself and all
of it is yourself appreciate the love that's here stop
separating yourself from the love that you are and then
when your body dies it dies and you're not attached
to it it's not a problem and it's all good
see that's my suggestion for you is this really possible
how could it be that humans can be immortal well
I know it sounds outlandish but that's literally what I'm
saying is that you are immortal but you ain't a
human so you have to let go of this idea
of humans being immortal because humans can't be immortal humans
are a formed thing everything formed is mortal by definition
even rocks and trees planets Suns stars they're all mortal
but consciousness itself truth itself love itself these are immortal
these are absolutes the absolute is the case under all
circumstances it doesn't change can't be creative destroyed has nowhere
to go you can't kill it because you have nothing
to kill it with when you have total oneness realize
this if you have total oneness oneness cannot kill itself
because the process of killing something means that here it
is you have to go outside of it that means
you have to split it into two one part of
it has to then kill or attack the other part
then this part has to disappear go to some some
other place because these two parts let's there in one
part of the universe there has to be some other
part of the universe or somewhere else the trash bin
of the universe so to speak where all the dead
stuff goes you know like in a fever of programmed
computers there's a there's something called garbage collection that means
that when you create objects in a computer virtual world
to destroy these objects actually isn't that easy this is
actually a challenge for many video games and other computer
simulations is that they have to construct the object but
that object is in memory then they have to destroy
that object but when they destroy that object it still
is retained in memory you have to do special processes
to dump that data somewhere else but where are you
gonna dump that data if you have nowhere else to
dump it to because you have one total oneness you
see total one this means that the very space where
everything is is the exact same space where the trash
bin is we're inside the trash bin of the universe
right now this is the trash bin hello so you
can't really kill yourself in fact this is a bit
of a terrifying realization when you first have it it's
possible for you to realize that you cannot kill yourself
God cannot kill itself and this is one of the
paradoxes of God because you know some of those paradoxes
that are like well if God created the rocks can
God create a rock that he himself can't lift interesting
paradox I've addressed it before and my FAQ about what
is God part 2 check out that FAQ right dress
it but a similar paradox is this one if God
is all-powerful can God kill itself and if it can't
doesn't that mean that it's not all-powerful what's the answer
well the answer is is that God is all-powerful but
the one thing it can't do is it can't kill
itself not as an absolute it can kill itself in
the relative domain and really the part of the answer
is that the idea of killing itself that is a
dualistic notion that only exists in the relative domain so
this problem doesn't exist for God as an absolute as
an absolute killing and death are our null notions you
can't apply those dualistic gnosis to the absolute but in
the relative sense God can't kill itself in the sense
that they can create a human the human is dissatisfied
with its life the human shoots itself kills itself and
this sense God can kill itself but that's only because
God isn't fully one isn't fully conscious God is in
its polarized form and so what killing itself means is
the unification of the polarization you see so once God
is fully in its unified state the notion of killing
something or going somewhere else simply can't even arise you
see because what killing means is it means to unify
really but how can you unify that which is already
fully unified you can't so all that you need to
do is change your identity from being out of a
human to being that of God and then your amore
and that is ultimately the power of truth pretty cool
that truth turns out to be so damn powerful alright
that's it I'm out of here please click that like
button for me and come check out my website actualized
org there you'll find my blog you'll find my book
list the life purpose course new stuff that I plan
to be releasing in the future I have some more
courses plan and other stuff that I'm working on and
if you like my work support me on patreon you
could chip in 5 bucks a month or something like
that a small amount but it could help me to
expand the channel in the future do maybe some advertising
attract more people to this life-changing work there we go
now you understand what death is now you should never
fear death ever again but of course in practice you're
gonna be terrified of death for a long time to
come even if you have awakenings you're still gonna be
terrified of death because the e the self letting go
of all of your attachments this is a much more
challenging endeavor than simply having a few awakenings to truly
transcend the fear of death an awakening won't be enough
you're gonna need a massive [ __ ] awakening and
even after that you're surely gonna have attachments in practice
it's just really really hard to purify this body in
this mind of all of its attachments really hard you
can have family attachments relationship attachments sexual attachments even attachments
to food to money to success to comfort to pleasure
to whatever you're gonna have attachments it's really really hard
you could do you could make a lot of progress
but just keep in mind it's really really hard it's
gonna be a lot harder than you think it is
but also it's a it's a highly worthwhile process to
go through even if you never become totally detached from
absolutely all material existence even a little bit of attachment
will improve your life will make it easier will make
it more enjoyable will make you feel like a child
again and that's exactly what psychedelics do is for that
brief moment those five or ten hours that you're in
a psychedelic trip during that time you are detached from
material existence and it feels like heaven it feels like
paradise it feels amazing you wish you could be in
that state all of your life but of course you
probably can't and the reason you can't is for your
own good so that you can keep surviving see so
long as you're here I don't care how awakened you
are so long as you exist in a finite formed
way so long as there is a body here so
long as there is a mind here so long as
language is being used so long as food needs to
enter your body to keep you alive so long as
that is the case you're gonna have attachments and you're
gonna be playing by the rules of survival because as
soon as you stop playing by the rules of survival
you're gonna die very quickly and that's fine there's nothing
wrong with that you can do that if you want
you can starve yourself to death if you want but
all so why why is that why is that something
you should want to do you're gonna die anyways I
mean your physical body is so why not instead choose
to enjoy all this cool stuff that's here and then
when you die you can exist as as empty formlessness
for a trillion years even longer for eternity so uh
you can you can have your cake and eat it
too is what I'm saying you don't need to choose
one or the other you can have both that's how
good reality is you
