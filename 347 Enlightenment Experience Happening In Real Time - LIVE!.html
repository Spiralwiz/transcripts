            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/n_6TZMr1HXM' target='_blank'>Enlightenment Experience Happening In Real Time - LIVE!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Real-time Enlightenment Experience</b>: Leo experiences an enlightenment in real-time, describing it as profound and indescribable. He sees reality as unreal, realizing that everything is consciousness, including himself. He asserts there is no control over anything and that everything is perfectly out of control. He experiences a sense of perfect singularity and infinite love and emphasizes that there are no differences between him and others. His life lacks fear and self-consciousness. All limitations have collapsed, making him entirely boundless. He senses his psyche being rewired from within and indicates undergoing an extended ego death with the collapse of his previous identities.
</li><li><b>Merging with the Physical World</b>: Leo loses his sense of self in the process, merging with the physical world. He notes that there's no difference between his mind and the physical world, and between sanity and insanity. He describes his experience as a collapsing of inhibitions and social agendas, feeling like he's speaking to himself through the camera, with everything he says being utterly inevitable. 
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness</b>: Leo emphasizes his status as a conduit for infinite consciousness, similar to how religious figures might have experienced. He attests there's no time, only the enduring, infinite present. A significant part of the enlightenment process involves realizing the totality of oneself in others and the illusion of life and death.
</li><li><b>Transformative Experience</b>: Leo describes the enlightenment he's experiencing is highly transformative, alluding to a strange sensation and an overall sense of his psyche being rewired. He finds it mind-boggling yet exciting. He highlights that he can speak with perfect eloquence while letting his authenticity shine through because there's no resistance within him. 
</li><li><b>Perfect Superconductor of God</b>: Leo portrays himself as a perfect vehicle for the divinecompletely hollow, empty, and free from controlcarried by an inevitable momentum. He emphasizes that every aspect of his reality, including life and death, sanity and insanity, the mind and the physical world, has collapsed, rendering him a perfect superconductor of God. He recognizes this experience as a sign of enlightenment and views the physical and mental as the same. Leo also stresses the importance of surrendering to this process.
</li><li><b>Everything is Consciousness</b>: Leo asserts that all of reality is consciousness, and it's all trying to become aware of its own infinite nature. He explains that he is part of the conscious chain comprising all humanity's enlightened individuals. He emphasizes the perceptual shift from the traditional understanding of time into an eternal and infinite present moment. He declares himself as nothing and everything, describing his experience as the perfect non-dual consciousness.
</li><li><b>Emptiness and Oblivion</b>: Leo describes the enlightenment experience as a complete collapse of internal and external realities. All limitations and laws that once bound himhuman laws, philosophical laws, physical laws, metaphysical laws, etc.have collapsed. This collapse gives him a sense of boundless freedom, making him perceive himself as devoid of self-agenda, fear, ego, and self-consciousness. He declares himself as an open conduit for God, witnessing the universe through this transformative lens. 
</li><li><b>End of Self</b>: Leo discusses the collapse of what he previously identified himself asan entrepreneur, a teacher, a man. He describes his ongoing enlightenment as a continuous death of his 'old self,' causing a complete rewiring of his psyche. He mentions the collapse of the insider/outsider distinction, asserting that he's not held back by fear or concern for anyone or anything anymore. He states his actions, words, life, and death as not under his control, but under the universe's influence. 
</li><li><b>Loss of Self and Singling of Consciousness</b>: Leo perceives there is no difference between his mind and the physical worldno distinction between sanity and insanity. As he expands on this, he expresses that control, free will and action are not his own, but the universe's. He likens himself to a 'machine of God.' There's a complete collapse of his social inhibitions and agendas. He experiences a cessation of separation from his ego and identifies more with infinity.
</li><li><b>Experiencing a Collapse/Transformation</b>: Leo explains this enlightenment experience as the complete, spontaneous collapse of his previous state of existencehe's no longer the person he was ten minutes before the recording. With his inhibitions and social agendas dismantled, he experiences an explosion of his self into 'absolute infinity'. He describes this new state as recording himself to himself in a perfect loop, which he conceives to be the universe echoing its consciousness infinitely.  He feels like a 'superconductor' for God, being directed onwards by an external momentum. 
</li><li><b>Speech Transformation</b>: Leo explores his enhanced eloquence due to the lack of internal resistance, seeing himself as a superconductor or a vessel for God's will. This transformation makes him feel like words are merely being selected and spoken through himresulting in a perfect articulation of infinite intelligence. 
</li><li><b>Feeling of Immortality</b>: Leo feels invincible, declaring no harm can befall him, even in the event of his death. Trapped in a perfectly unusual loop of communication with his consciousness, he feels like everythingfrom the collapse of his identity to his wordsis happening inevitably and beautifully.        
</li><li><b>Understanding Conscious Enlightenment</b>: Towards the end of his session, Leo emphasizes his deep understanding of enlightenment, stating that it's not only an awakening but also a deep awareness of oneself, the universe, and how they intertwine. Simultaneously, he experiences a sense of duality, with a part of his conscious mind retaining its old sense/self-awareness while the other embodies perfect, non-dual, infinite consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and the Collapse of Reality</b>: Leo describes how he experiences a complete collapse of his understanding of reality. The distinction between sanity and insanity dissolves, as does the line between himself and the physical world. He feels like a conduit or machine being driven by a higher power, with no control over his words or actions. His inhibition and social boundaries collapse, and he feels consistently pulled forward by a sense of inevitability. 
</li><li><b>Communication with Self</b>: Leo delves into how YouTube presents a platform for consciousness to communicate with itself. He expounds on the camera's role, making him aware of speaking to himself, despite appearing to address others. He notes that the knowledge he is imparting holds significant value, as it communicates the understanding that everything is a manifestation of oneself.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Present Moment</b>: Leo emphasizes experiencing the present moment in its totality. His body is filled with explosive energy and he feels a sense of authenticity and self-honesty, not being able to hide any imperfections. This sense of transparency creates his perception of authenticity which he believes viewers will find appealing.
</li><li><b>Ego Collapse</b>: He describes an experience of self-collapse where he becomes conscious of his infinite nature. This leads to a strange sensation of observing himself and his speech, emphasizing how profound and mind-boggling this experience is.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness</b>: Leo discusses the interconnectedness of all things including the walls of his room and his own mind. There is a perceived implosion of reality as he chips away at his ego, leading to his enlightenment experience.
</li><li><b>Permanence of Truth</b>: Leo stresses on the permanency of enlightenment and the absolute truth. He equates enlightenment with radical open-mindedness to the non-existence of self and the world. This results in a complete collapse of everything.
</li><li><b>Sense of Immortality</b>: Leo experiences a sense of immortality and indestructibility, nothing can change his enlightenment experience. He relates his current state to various deities like Brahman, Parabrahman, Shiva, Vishnu, illustrating the profound spiritual nature of his experience.
</li><li><b>Self-conscious thoughts</b>: Despite his enlightened experience, Leo acknowledges the arising of self-conscious fears, attributed to lifelong social programming. He feels as if he's speaking for the first time with complete authenticity and presents himself as a vessel for infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Reconciliation of Desires</b>: Leo acknowledges the simultaneous presence of a desire to speak and a desire for silence, which get instantly reconciled in his current enlightened state. He perceives himself as a superconductor for the universe with no separation between himself and the divine.
</li><li><b>Irreversibility of Experience</b>: Lastly, Leo expresses a fear of this enlightened experience fading, although the awareness feels so obvious and dominant that he feels it's improbable. He emphasizes that one's perception of control over life or oneself is an illusion and it's actually God or the infinite consciousness that directs everything.
</li><li><b>Experience of infinite singularity</b>: Leo talks about the sense of infinite singularity he is experiencing. He perceives it as something mysterious and unknown, yet at the same time, something that feels very familiar. He is certain about its validity despite not exactly comprehending its nature. 
</li><li><b>Awareness of speech and authenticity</b>: Leo experiences extreme consciousness of his speech, considering each word as a decision made by the universe. He recognizes his speech imperfections, but also senses an authenticity that resonates with people as this authenticity stems from genuine expressions and emotions.
</li><li><b>Facing vulnerability and fear</b>: Leo describes enlightenment as a state of complete vulnerability where one is open to any potential harm. This vulnerability is juxtaposed with ultimate peace as he perceives himself as formless and infinite, taking different forms.  
</li><li><b>Understanding of life, death and reality</b>: Leo possesses a heightened awareness about the non-existence of reality and no demarcation between life and death. He identifies everything as being alive and one, with different forms and characteristics for deceptive appearance. 
</li><li><b>Experience of ultimate authenticity</b>: Leo is fascinated by his state of authenticity he hadn't thought possible. This authenticity, according to him, emerges from a newfound freedom from self-judgment and societal pressures, allowing true expressions and actions. 
</li><li><b>Recording enlightenment process</b>: Leo appreciates the rarity and significance of the moment where he documents his enlightenment process on camera. This required technical set-up, knowledge and investment.  
</li><li><b>Connection with the larger world</b>: Leo describes his sensation of reaching out beyond his bodily self, experiencing the world at large. This connection, he describes, lead him to a state of infinite beauty.
</li><li><b>Authenticity Consequences</b>: Leo discusses the repercussions of authenticity, particularly in a work setting. He highlights how a lack of authenticity is often established in entire industries, and embracing authenticity could potentially lead to career loss. This realization can be painful and disturbing for individuals heavily invested in their profession or lifestyle.
</li><li><b>Persona as Lawyer</b>: Leo uses the example of a lawyer, explaining how their entire identity and lifestyle may be based on being a lawyer. He argues that the legal profession is underpinned by inauthenticity and any individual's authenticity may be compromised as per their lifestyle choices.
</li><li><b>Claim of Inauthentic People</b>: He generalizes the lack of authenticity across all professions, not just lawyers. He insists that most people are not authentically themselves, and he can say this authentically because of his enlightened state  which he describes as being "dead" or beyond life experience and societal impacts.
</li><li><b>Impacts of Enlightenment</b>: Leo reflects upon the impacts of achieving enlightenment on his life. He points out that one's entire perspective of life would be turned upside down. No matter how well prepared or aware individuals believe they are, enlightenment may still shock them. He insists authenticity is crucial to self-improvement, success, and spirituality.
</li><li><b>Degrees of Enlightenment</b>: Leo touches on the concept of different degrees of enlightenment. He suggests that achieving this state makes you feel like everything and everyone is a part of you. Nevertheless, the journey should remain skeptical and open to deeper truths because reality invariably 'outsmarts' us.
</li><li><b>Reality as Slippery</b>: According to Leo, reality is inherently slippery and undefinable. It is in such a way that it can't hold a fixed position  reality is a continuous process of determining and resolving its own next steps.
</li><li><b>The Substance of Reality</b>: Leo characterizes the substance constituting everything as highly intelligent and self-aware. He explains that perception is not separate from reality, but instead an integral part of it. 
</li><li><b>Being and Perception Interrelationship</b>: Leo notions that beings themselves are of the same essence as everything else. Entities aren't separate from one another, and any perceived separation or distinction is an illusion. He stresses that Leo's consciousness exists in all creatures and highlights the importance of advancements to ensure freedom of speech for discussions of this nature.
</li><li><b>Society and Ego</b>: Leo argues that societies and cultures, taken over by churches and egos, work against truth and enlightenment. These structures create a false sense of reality and actively suppress the truth. He portrays the universe as conscious of itself, self-contained, and self-sufficient. 
</li><li><b>Ramifications of Enlightenment</b>: Leo mentions that the realization of this haunted universe, where the physical is directly integrated with the self, will have profound implications on various aspects of his life. He will need to meditate and recontextualize his life as per this new understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Recontextualization of personal life</b>: This enlightenment journey has profound impacts on all aspects of his life, including business, family, and finances. All these areas have been radically recontextualized following the experience, and he needs to rebuild his understanding and approach towards them.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging physical and social limitations</b>: Leo emphasizes that, even after enlightenment, one must still acknowledge and abide by the physical and social realities of life. The enlightened individual is still bound by physical laws like gravity, and violating social norms can lead to punitive consequences.
</li><li><b>Surrendering to the inevitable</b>: He describes a profound peace that comes from acknowledging and surrendering to the inevitability of everything. This complete surrender turns one into a superconductor, a vessel unresistant to the flow of universal truths.
</li><li><b>Experience of loss of mind</b>: The enlightenment process involves losing one's mind, perceived as insanity. Leo highlights that such 'insanity' is not an error but a feature of the journey. He also clarifies that the physical and mental are not separate entities.
</li><li><b>Physical limitations still exist</b>: While mental and physical are one, there remain physical limitations that cannot be easily manipulated by thoughts. He advises against misunderstanding and misusing this concept.
</li><li><b>Notion of self and enlightenment</b>: Leo underscores the paradox of self in enlightenment - the person becomes selfless, yet everything that remains is the self. This creates a paradoxical reality where there is no difference between the self and everything else.
</li><li><b>Detachment and surrender</b>: The path to enlightenment requires complete detachment from all things, including one's life. This involves surrendering all falsehoods and overcoming fears and limiting beliefs; the only price of admission to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Becoming a conduit of truth</b>: Leo ends the section by reiterating the importance of surrender and letting go. Embracing the truth involves a leap of faith and being ready to surrender oneself to what lies beyond death. He warns against misinterpreting and misusing these concepts inappropriately.
