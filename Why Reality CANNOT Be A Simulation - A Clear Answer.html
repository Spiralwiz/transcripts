[Music] why reality cannot be a simulation that is what
I'm gonna explain in this episode but before I get
into that happy holidays as usual this time of year
I hope you're having a good 2019 this is my
last episode of the decade sometimes they say that the
decade doesn't really end until the end of 2020 but
oh well I'm counting it as the end of the
decade now so this will be the last one of
the ekiden we're starting on a clean slate come next
year and we'll see how that goes if you'd like
to support me on patreon you can go to patreon.com/scishow
and distract you from the seriousness of the topic at
hand this is a meaty topic for you today I'm
gonna explain why reality cannot be a simulation I see
a lot of foolishness on YouTube videos about this topic
that are so misguided you know it's popular these days
because we live in the sort of computer era that's
basically where the 21st century is and those the 20th
century you know the Information Age so it's popular to
speculate about science fiction scenarios about how oh what if
we're in a matrix what if we're inside of a
computer virtual reality what's gonna happen in the next 500
years like Leo what's gonna happen when computers become super
fast and there's a is and virtual reality gets so
good isn't it almost guaranteed that we're gonna be creating
really high-quality rendered virtual realities and video games than crawling
inside of them and then you know it's just you
know it's a small leap and logic to just assume
that you know if video games keep getting better and
better and better in in a hundred years our video
games are gonna be indistinguishable from reality and then we're
gonna find a way to interface with that and then
you know before you know it we're inside a computer
and bam we've got the digital sing and then this
sounds like so profound this sounds like it's a profound
understanding of metaphysics and it's not it's actually it's a
joke it's a joke and it gets people thinking in
the totally wrong direction and there's this kind of popular
trend on YouTube where people discuss philosophy through these flimsy
philosophy videos where people just speculate about all well maybe
it is a simulation maybe it isn't a simulation maybe
God exists maybe God doesn't exist what about this what
about that this is not how I like to do
philosophy I like to do philosophy and get actual answers
and believe it or not it's possible to do philosophy
and get actual concrete definitive answers to profound existential questions
like this one so my radical claim for you today
is that it's possible for you to definitively know that
reality is not a computer simulation and I'm gonna explain
how it's possible to know that and you know it's
it's it's amazing because there are a lot of otherwise
we would consider them intelligent people in the scientific community
within academia in Silicon Valley who subscribe to these really
silly easily debunk able metaphysical notions of some digital singularity
or some simulation theory and that's what this is called
simulation theory the idea that everything can be a simulation
and you have big-name credible people like Elon Musk who
subscribe to this theory there are quotes you can find
online of Elaan musk for example saying that the chances
that we're in a simulation are very high or if
we're not in one already then the chances are almost
certain that we will create one in the near future
and then there are quotes from people like Neil deGrasse
Tyson who's supposedly very scientifically minded or he's regarded as
such anyways the mainstream media you got folks like max
tegmark you've got people like Ray Kurzweil you've got others
that whose names escaped me but there are there are
academics who actually get grants and funding to research this
[ __ ] and that's because they don't know how
to think metaphysically about these topics so anyways enough bashing
of them I like to bash the materialist a little
bit just because how silly it is so we're gonna
break all this down here in a minute a point
I want to make before I forget about materialism so
really simulation theory is materialism on stilts that's what it
is it's like materialism 2.0 you know when when the
old-school materialism 1.0 gets boring and uninteresting then we got
you know people bringing out the matrix and all these
things and it makes it sound as though you're being
intelligent and metaphysical and really thinking deeply about reality when
you're not and of course the Matrix movies that were
popular in the late 90s and early 2000s they played
a big role in this too and you know the
reason that the Matrix movies were such a big cultural
phenomenon when they came out is because it was the
rise of the Internet the early Internet and the possibilities
for the future and computers was all kind of wide
open and there were these interesting possibilities of what can
happen with AI what can happen with computers and virtual
reality and so forth and so it's only natural that
we start to think along these kind of metaphorical lines
I'm like well what if what if life is just
a computer or something like this and so the Matrix
movies they'll have some serious metaphysical problems which we're gonna
talk about right now so really this is the problem
in general with simulation theory is that it doesn't really
understand what it's talking about because the core issue here
when we're talking about whether we're in a simulation is
we're talking about what is the substance of reality itself
what is reality made out of and of course if
you're a materialist the way most people are then you
believe it's matter of atoms or some other material substance
may be energy if you're a little bit more fluid
about that or maybe numbers and math like Max tegmark
has this theory where he thinks that because you know
he's a mathematician so he sees the whole world in
numbers and he thinks realities matter of numbers that of
course computers supposedly like may add on numbers that's what
makes computers work and tick so isn't it only like
you put two and two together and then reality is
mathematics right that's what it is no it's none of
that and you can know definitively reality is consciousness there's
nothing to reality but consciousness and what is consciousness consciousness
is what you and I are experiencing right now this
is it this is rock bottom this is as fundamental
as reality gets it's infinite consciousness now that's a very
loaded notion we'll talk about that in more depth but
let's let's just go back to this idea of a
simulation what does it even mean to say that reality
is a simulation so supposedly that means that right now
I'm sitting here talking to you and you're sitting there
listening to me and like I guess the idea is
that actually this is a virtual reality which isn't the
real reality because this is being rendered where where is
the matrix happening where is the virtual reality happening according
to simulation theory I guess it's happening in some sort
of computer but what does that mean that means it's
held in the RAM it's held on a hard drive
it's it's bits within a CPU but what is that
what is the CPU what is RAM really if you
look at it well it's atoms moving back and forth
it's you know bits of electricity circulating around it still
grounded him in a material substrate see so if the
idea is that some ancient alien civilization advanced very far
in their technology and they created supercomputers that were able
to crunch trillions of bits per second and all this
crazy stuff and they developed AI and they've developed virtual
worlds that are indistinguishable from reality then supposedly they could
have stuck us in there and how would we know
that we weren't born into one of those but of
course you see all that this does is shifts the
problem of the substance of a reality the question here
is what is the sustance of reality it just shifts
it back one level it's the same problem as many
theists face when they tout God as sort of the
metaphysical origin point of reality so you ask a theist
well where did the earth come from and he says
well God created it okay well if God created it
then who created God or what is the substance of
God is God made out of atoms molecules chemicals energy
quarks numbers mathematics equations what is God has got an
equation you see and then you ask the theist you
you keep pushing the theist and very quickly the theist
has no answer because the theist has only thought one
move ahead his whole brilliant strategy for explaining reality was
to posit some sort of entity like a God and
then but then he has no explanation for the entity
itself but the simulation theorists are doing exactly the same
thing just in a different style instead of using a
god they're just using a computer but the question still
remains what is a computer made out of what is
the simulation that the computer is rendering what is that
made out of so if this is the virtual world
here so then there's a computer somewhere behind the scenes
that we can't see that computer supposedly as man of
atoms or something some sort of substance right well then
what is this made out of what are my hands
made out of are my hands now made of atoms
well you can't quite say that because atoms are something
that are within the virtual reality so what are they
matter of pixels voxels what what is that and how
does the computer create that how does the computer this
matter of atoms and molecules and bits of energy and
so forth I guess electrons we would call them that
are coursing through that CPU how is that being turned
into pixels or voxels or whatever of this virtual reality
how's that happening see and of course the simulation theorist
has no answer to this because there's not even an
answer to this question in theory it's not that they
aren't able to like do the science to figure it
out it the science this whole model is so absurd
you can't even do science on it it's that absurd
you can't even run a philosophical thought experiment on it
really because it's so stupid it's a it's a deep
misunderstanding of how consciousness works and of course what the
simulation theorists do is they they sweep the problem of
substance under the rug they don't want it really go
into the metaphysical question of what is the substance of
anything because you see when you ask the question what
is the substance of anything it doesn't matter what it
is it can be a cat dog and you'd be
a videogame a virtual reality a computer it can be
whatever was there prior to the Big Bang it could
be some alien thing you know whatever it doesn't matter
it can be inside the simulation outside of the simulation
what is the substance of all of it see it
doesn't help you to couch one thing inside of another
thing inside of another thing because it's that classic old
Hindu story where they ask you of like well what
suspends the earth in space and so they need to
find some kind of explanation for it and rather than
just admitting that well the earth just hangs freely in
space because it's got nowhere else to go in a
sense the earth is following in all directions simultaneously and
therefore it's going nowhere the earth is going everywhere and
therefore nowhere and so it's just hanging around in the
vacuum of space but rather than admit that they need
to come up with some substance so they say well
it has to rest on the on the back of
four elephants okay why four elephants well I don't know
just we know elephants you know the ancient Hindus they
they knew elephants where they grew up and you know
today the 21st century we we know computers so we're
just substituting computers for elephants here and then you know
but what about the elephants the elephants they got us
be standing on something - right well okay a tortoise
they knew tortoises back then so they use a tortoise
and you know today we know atoms or we know
quarks or we know energy so we say energy or
Clarke instead of a tortoise because that's what we know
that's what our best scientists haven't come up with okay
but then what about the turtle weren't it what is
it sitting on and here you you only have two
choices really well maybe three you can just brush off
the question you say well screw you you know we're
done and then you just leave the discussion at this
point exit the chat scientists exits the chat materials usually
exit chats at this point or they bite the bullet
and they say well it's just a turtle and it's
not supported by anything well if that's the case why
do you need the turtle in the first place and
then of course by that logic why do you even
need the elephants why can't we just directly say that
the earth is not resting on anything if a tortoise
doesn't need anything under it then an elephant doesn't need
anything under it and the earth doesn't need anything under
it I see it's simpler you don't need to come
up with with weird you know magical substances and then
the other possibility you could say well it's Turtles all
the way down that's the Turtles all the way down
so that means there's a turtle under a turtle under
a turtle forever okay but what does that really mean
because really what you're citing there is you're pointing to
infinity you're saying there's an infinity of turtles so an
infinity of substances so one thing nested inside of another
inside of another so you can play the same game
with the simulation theory you can either dismiss this whole
discussion and say ah screw it I don't care which
is what most scientists and materialists do they're not seriously
interested in metaphysics because they regard it as something that's
just speculative and not tangible or but you know it's
funny because even though they regard it that way they
still are eager to talk about simulation theory and treat
it seriously so that's kind of hypocrisy or what they
say is well okay so we'll bite the bullet and
we'll just say that it's all happening in a physical
computer man of atoms and molecules just like in the
virtual reality except this is now in the real reality
that we don't see behind the scenes whatever that is
but it's basically made out of matter okay but where
did that matter come from how do you explain that
matter so if some aliens are simulating us who's simulating
the aliens see it so the mystery is not resolved
at all if you say that we're in a simulation
it only adds an extra layer of complexity to the
mystery of existence or you can say well maybe the
aliens lyoha I got you the aliens are also being
simulated by other even more advanced aliens okay well who's
stimulating those and then well there's even more advanced ones
and who's stimulating those we'll even more advanced ones okay
so it goes on forever this is Turtles all the
way down it's a aliens all the way up okay
so you're talking about infinity there but do you really
understand what that means well we'll talk about that and
what infinity means in a moment so how do we
resolve this problem by forcing ourselves to take the issue
of the substance of reality head-on without trying to avoid
it by creating other simulations or other nested objects and
other weird substances face it head-on what is this that's
right here this direct experience forget about stuff behind the
scenes forget about atoms and molecules and all what is
this right here this thing we call direct experience because
this is all you have a reality is direct experience
everything else is concept everything else is speculation your ideas
of an external reality behind the scenes or aliens simulating
this reality here this is all something that is being
imagined and constructed within this direct experience right now this
can be a little difficult for a materialist to swallow
because they really are addicted to this idea that there's
an external objective reality behind the scenes because they need
that to explain what's here because if you remove the
idea from your mind that there that there is an
objective external reality behind the scenes or that there are
some aliens behind the scenes or that there is some
god behind the scenes up in the clouds running the
show some sort of puppet master if you get rid
of all that then you're forced to confront the mystery
of consciousness right here you're not putting it off anymore
and this presents a very interesting possibility which is the
possibility that reality is not something that we can't know
or can't discover because the thing we're trying to know
is somewhere hidden behind some veil that's impossible for us
to penetrate because we're locked in this sort of simulated
bubble or whatever we can never get to the aliens
see this is another one of the popular little kind
of corollary to the simulation theory which is the idea
if the simulation is so good if the aliens are
so intelligent they could simulate us so perfectly that we
would never even be able to tell that we're in
a simulation and therefore it says though it seems like
under that logic simulation theory can never be disproven and
so therefore we must forever remain open to the idea
that simulation theory might be true because Leo what if
the aliens are just really really good and therefore even
all the thoughts leo that you're having right now are
simulated by the aliens and you would never even know
it and this seems like a intelligent sceptical argument but
it's false it's demonstrably and definitively false let's try to
explain why that is the trick the magic key that
unlocks this problem turns out to be consciousness see it
just so happens and there's really no logic for why
this is the case but it just so happens that
you have access to reality exactly as it is at
all moments including right now what's happening right now to
you is exactly what reality is the only question is
are you conscious of what it is or is your
mind veering off into all sort of fantastical directions about
atoms and molecules and brains and chemicals and external realities
and aliens and simulations and computers and electricity and gods
and all this is your mind doing all that or
is your mind fully conscious of what's here right now
so if you were fully conscious of what's here right
now you would become conscious of consciousness itself you would
become conscious that consciousness is not supported or grounded in
any substance or substrate consciousness is the substrate consciousness contrary
to the scientific materialistic paradigms and theories about it consciousness
is not something that is happening in a brain or
in a body or in a living organism consciousness is
not something that is being mediated by molecules or chemicals
or atoms rather all of those things are distinctions being
imagined by consciousness so what reality is is consciousness imagining
everything and anything which is reality so consciousness is imagining
an atom consciousness is imagining energy consciousness is imagining mathematics
consciousness is imagining the brick wall consciousness is imagining the
floor you're sitting on right now there cannot be a
brick wall without consciousness so science has it precisely backwards
and most philosophers have it precisely backwards is they think
that first you have all the physical stuff which is
all real then you have the consciousness stuff which is
all fluffy personal experiences the human lived experience that all
this colors sounds sites quality as they call it and
this stuff is all unreal it's the second order stuff
which is somehow coming from the first order stuff of
matter and energy and math equations this is precisely backwards
what's actually true and real is qualia colors sounds feelings
emotions that is what's real what you're experiencing right now
that's reality it's so close to you that you are
directly interfaced with it you are not even interfacing with
it through perception or through sense organs or through any
kind of medium it's totally raw raw consciousness is what's
right here right now and then here's the here's the
complication the mind then creates stories and imagines conceptual frameworks
to try to explain this mysterious direct raw consciousness that's
here right now the mind of the ego mind the
human psyche does not want to admit that reality is
made out of pure consciousness this is a very threatening
notion because it throws a lot of stuff up in
the air it's it makes reality seem less than real
less than solid and the human psyche has a vested
interest in trying to ground itself in a reality so
the human psyche is constantly trying to construct reality but
see you see to construct reality you have to construct
in such a way that you're not conscious that you're
constructing it and then that is what we call reality
because if you were conscious that you were constructing your
reality it would no longer really seem like reality anymore
it would seem like imagination or mind consciousness but that's
way too much responsibility for you and for the average
person even for the average scientist they don't want to
take this much responsibility for their reality so the difficulty
in understanding what I'm communicating is not that we need
better science experiments and we need better technology we need
super colliders and we need mathematical geniuses like Einstein in
Isaac Newton and so forth - you know to tell
us what the answers are because we don't have them
yet that's not the problem here the problem is that
we have the answers we've had the answers to this
question for thousands of years the problem is how do
we get you specifically to understand the answer because your
mind doesn't want to understand the answer because there's a
conflict of interest here to be able to understand this
answer would be very threatening to you and to your
way of life into your entire notion of reality you
see if you start to really understand what I'm talking
about here you're gonna go down this slippery slope of
realizing that more and more of the stuff that you
thought your whole life was real and true and solid
and grounded is it grounded in anything at all and
that's a very threatening notion so the problem is that
many scientists they like to hold this to this ideal
of thinking that well we're objective scientists we don't care
about emotions work we only care about the facts not
our feelings we don't care about psychology we don't care
about philosophy we just crunch the numbers man we're just
purely rational we stand outside of reality and we we
use our instruments and microscopes and telescopes and our logic
and our reason and our mathematics to analyze what's really
there and then we just report the facts and we
can do that because we're neutral objective third-party observers and
léa when you start talking about consciousness and emotions and
feelings and colors and qualia and direct experiences this is
all human stuff it's not real it's subjective what we
care about is the objective but are you open to
the possibility that you have exactly backwards that there is
no objective there is only the subjective the objective is
something that you're imagining something that consciousness is imagining right
here right now so I want you to open your
mind to the possibility that rather than atoms molecules and
energy and general relativity and other theories like this science
as a whole rather than that being the ultimate truth
that is all second order derivative the ultimate truth is
what you're experiencing right here right now this is it
look at your hand take it out look at it
this is more real than math than science then atoms
than energy this hand and this hand is not atoms
it is not energy it is not mathematics it is
not a computer simulation it is the colors that it's
made out of it is the shape it is how
it feels this is reality imagine dare to imagine a
reality which is pure consciousness what is consciousness look at
it don't fear I'm not asking you to speculate about
what consciousness is we don't need to speculate if we
speculate about what consciousness we're going off in the wrong
direction consciousness is right here take out your hand and
look at it this is consciousness you have direct access
to reality because you are reality and because you are
reality try to notice become conscious right now that you
you are reality you're not merely inside of reality you're
not merely a part of reality you're not a biological
creature running through reality you are reality itself you are
the very substance of reality itself can you get that
right now just a little bit try to focus your
awareness on that just a little bit see so try
to feel it feel I don't think it feel it
what is this space that you're in you're feeling this
space you're in it you're aware of it you're conscious
of it your consciousness permeates the entire room permeates the
entire world right this is your life try to recognize
that if you drop dead right now because somebody shot
you none of this would be here for you from
your point of view all of it would be gone
it would be so gone that it would be like
it never even existed but but let's go a little
bit deeper because it's it's it's more more of a
mindfuck than you even think because if we're saying that
all of us is gonna be gone surely what's also
going to be gone is logic reason mathematics science atoms
energy molecules experiments human history all of those things that
you ground reality in all of those will be gone
as well because all of those were a part of
your consciousness this is a very simple little thought experiment
to show you that it's all conscious science is consciousness
history is consciousness atoms are consciousness even the brain itself
is consciousness the brain here plays a very tricky role
because it seems like the brain is a physical object
in which consciousness occurs but that is not actually the
case you got it backwards the mind is not happening
in the brain rather the brain is happening in the
mind and by mind we is just another word for
consciousness we mean consciousness you see so because you are
reality itself consciousness it's actually impossible to do what the
scientists ideal of science is it's impossible to step outside
of science and be an objective impartial third party observer
and a reporter of objective fact this is impossible because
you're intimately involved with reality itself see if you were
separate from reality you could look down upon it but
you can't do that because you're not separate from reality
you are reality and there's nothing outside of reality because
reality by the definition of that word reality means everything
that's real everything that exists everything that's true everything that
is see so if you think you can step outside
of reality and look down upon it will what are
you stepping into so to speak so if reality is
over here and you step outside of reality and you
look at it so where are you and what are
you made out of to look at reality you'd have
to be made of something real to be able to
look down upon it or think about it use reason
or whatever or to communicate it even to your own
self you couldn't do that because all of those are
parts of reality communication thinking reason sciences is all part
of reality and all of this is a ball of
consciousness but now of course the skeptic comes in here
and says well Lee okay I may be conscious maybe
it is all consciousness but how do we know that
consciousness is not being generated by some sort of computer
behind the scenes well for this you need to become
fully conscious of what consciousness is what is consciousness that's
a very deep question and again here it might seem
like well okay Leah we've hit a dead end cuz
now it's not possible to no philosophers have been asking
the question what is consciousness for 2,000 years and we
still don't have the answer scientists they still don't know
it's a giant mystery no it's not it's not a
mystery at all I mean it is a mystery but
you can become conscious of a conscious is because you're
conscious but the problem here is is that consciousness because
it's an immediate thing and you are it the only
way you can know what consciousness is is by you
being conscious of it that means a scientist can't do
it for you you can't read what consciousness is in
a textbook you can't write down a mathematical formula for
what consciousness is because the formula itself is within consciousness
because the textbook itself is a part of consciousness you
can read a thousand or even a million textbook textbooks
for the next thousand years and you will still not
understand what consciousness is because those are various forms all
those books are various forms arising within consciousness but they
can't tell you what it consciousness itself is see because
again to understand what conscious is you have to hit
the nail square on the head and you can't veer
off with your mind to some direction about all well
maybe consciousness as atoms maybe consciousness computers or something no
no no consciousness is what's right here furthermore what consciousness
is is its distinction and that's what reality is reality
is distinction consciousness is that which imagines distinctions that's what
mind is I'm using consciousness and mind interchangeably in this
talk so if you can imagine the difference between any
two things that is how reality is constructed so reality
and consciousness are not constructed out of molecules and atoms
and energy and brains and Stardust and whatever else you
want to imagine time and space and all that but
rather by the distinction of those things those things are
all distinctions an atom is a distinction energy is a
distinction a brain is a distinction within consciousness Stardust is
a distinction so when we talk about Stardust you're thinking
about Stardust that's what Stardust is it's what you're thinking
it is it's what you're imagining it to be and
notice how in order for you to think something it
has to be distinct from some other thing so the
only meaning that the word Stardust has is precisely the
difference between it and everything that's not Stardust the only
meaning of an atom is that it's distinct from the
opposite of an atom what is the opposite of an
atom Anan atom everything that's not an atom and so
on for everything so here's the key problem with simulation
theory is that it doesn't understand that consciousness is a
distinction it doesn't understand it's not conscious of what distinction
is and so simulation theory says that reality is a
simulation without understanding that a simulation is a distinction within
consciousness see so in the simulation theorists worldview there is
something which is a simulation and then there is its
opposite which simulation is defined against so if you say
that reality is a simulation you must also imagine the
opposite of a simulation see what you're doing here is
you're creating a distinction or you're cutting reality to two
now your reality on the one hand you're saying reality
as matter of reality is a simulation on the other
hand you also have to say that well but then
there must also be something that's not a simulation and
so that's what simulation theory is basically as it's like
you have a simulation which is supposedly our world and
then you have something behind the scenes that thing which
is not a simulation the real reality because you've divided
reality to two and so now you're placing this part
and making it dependent on this part without realizing the
interconnection between the two parts and what's being missed every
time you're making these distinctions without realizing what distinctions are
without being conscious of them is you're separating reality into
different substances for example you say well that tables made
of wood that glass is made of silicon that plant
is mad at carbon that humans made of water and
you treat the world as though it's been of these
different substances carbon water silicon wood you know the ancients
had earth fire and water and air and this you
know the five elements and all this kind of stuff
but I mean you know now we science has taken
that idea and just expanded upon it we have quarks
and we have different kinds of subatomic particle we have
leptons and protons and antineutrinos and this and that I
mean anti quarks science just keeps coming up with more
and more of this [ __ ] every every year
more new substances more new elements are added to the
periodic table but what's being missed in all this is
that reality is not actually made out of these things
these aren't real things these are distinctions being imagined by
consciousness consciousness is the only real thing and it's one
it's singular there's not many consciousnesses there's only one consciousness
the whole universe is one single consciousness but it can
draw these different distinctions because that's what consciousness does is
the only thing consciousness knows how to do is draw
distinctions that's it so it draws these assumptions and it
can separate itself or reality into parts and make it
seem as a reality meant of different parts and different
substances when really it's all just one but partitioned these
partitions we might think of them as a virtual partitions
like if we take a giant piece of paper blank
white paper and we take a pencil and we start
drawing lines across the paper dividing the paper these are
all virtual lines it might seem like we're cutting the
paper in half we're really not we're just drawing lines
and then we're imagining that the two different halves of
the line are two different pieces but ultimately if we
look at the whole thing from a sort of a
big-picture perspective from the ultimate zoom-out perspective sort of from
God's point of view then what we clearly see is
that it's it's one single sheet of paper with a
bunch of distinctions drawn upon it which allows us to
distinguish different objects see so here's the thing that the
simulation theorists are missing is that consciousness cuts through all
levels of reality so I'm not necessarily saying that there
can't be different levels of reality there can when I'm
saying though is that you need to come conscious that
all levels of reality are made of one thing which
is consciousness so let's explain it this way you know
if you really bought at the simulation theory you might
say well Leo but but just I mean I hear
you're talking about some interesting ideas here but just very
practically what do you think is gonna happen in the
next hundred years aren't computers gonna get better and faster
aren't video games gonna get better in higher res isn't
there gonna be a virtual reality which is gonna be
indistinguishable from earth reality and then aren't humans gonna just
naturally want to play these games and play in these
virtual worlds and then isn't is it really that far-fetched
to imagine that a human can just like we could
take a baby and just raise it in a virtual
world and it won't even know the difference but that's
exactly my point see simulation theory and all of science
basically they're all a philosophy pretty much any theory depends
upon crucial distinctions that it makes these distinctions have to
be unconscious distinctions for the theory to do what the
theory needs to do otherwise there wouldn't be a theory
so a theory itself is interesting but anyways I'm getting
too wrapped up in this anyways um to zoom out
one level what I'm trying to say is that in
simulation theory they make a distinction between real reality and
virtual reality of the real world and the stuff that
happens in a video game but this is a trick
of consciousness there is no distinction between what's happening in
a video game and a real reality or your life
that's a distinction that you create it and or imagining
so what I'm telling you is something quite radical see
if you can bite this bullet I'm telling you that
Mario inside of Mario world is as real as your
physical body and that Mario is made of exactly the
same thing as my body right here can you accept
that little radical because he we like to believe that
us humans we are the real ones and what's happening
on the TV screen well that's not real Mario's not
real mario world's not real but who's making that distinction
we are of course and of course we draw our
distinctions in a self biased manner see my episode about
self bias there in Portland we draw our distinction a
self biased manner in order to create a sense of
reality see reality itself is a distinction because we need
to distinguish as humans between reality on the one hand
and fantasy on the other and so we're very very
threatened when the boundary between reality and fantasy is blurred
or erased or threatened in some way and that's exactly
what this conversation is doing it's undermining entire sense of
physical reality which is why you don't like it maybe
if you're a special person you like it if you
want to awaken maybe you like it but otherwise if
you're a materialist you don't like this if you're a
scientist you don't like this because what I'm doing is
I'm erasing all the boundaries that you have used to
anchor your entire psyche so for example what I'm telling
you is that there's no there's no clear distinction between
being sane and insane and you don't like that because
you like to think of yourself as sane and you
like to think of somebody who's your enemy or some
crazy person some criminal you like to call him insane
you don't like the idea that maybe there is no
difference between him and you and then when I tell
you that there's no difference between an ordinary citizen and
a terrorist there's no such distinction other than what you
imagine it to be you don't like that idea because
you like to be able to point to the terrorists
at all the terrorists are so evil they're such bad
people but we weren't just were the good guys but
of course there is no such distinction there ever was
it's imaginary and then when I tell you something like
oh this one if you're a materialist you're really not
gonna like this one that the distinction between science and
pseudoscience or science and fairy tales and myths that this
distinction is not a real distinction but something that you
are imagining oh you don't like that at all you
don't like that at all because you've built your entire
identity around the idea that there is such a distinction
and you have elevated this part of the distinction the
science part and you have denigrated the part about the
myths and the fairy tales and the spaghetti monsters and
all this flying spaghetti monster you've denigrated all that and
you've built your whole identity about being this rational evidence-based
person and you're really attached to that entity you might
have built an entire career around it hell you might
have gone to university you might have gotten whole PhD
based on this premise that there's a difference between science
and fairytales and now what I'm telling you is that
there is no such difference you imagine the difference and
now you're faced with the real possibility of an existential
crisis because now you have to admit that science itself
might be a fairy tale and you don't want that
you're in denial about that possibility and so your mind
starts coming up with all sorts of stories speaking of
fairy tales your mind starts coming up with tough stories
about how why I'm wrong and why I'm stupid and
why everybody knows that science is not a fairy tale
and you're gonna point to all this various evidence about
why it's not a fairy tale you're gonna point to
Einstein and Newton and you're gonna point to men landed
on the moon and you're gonna point about smart phones
and computers and all this stuff that science Tinley old
science is so great you're so demonizing science and so
denigrating science how come science can do these things but
fairy tales can't well that's a deeper topic that I
can't get into here it's complicated consciousness is complicated yeah
I'm not saying it's simple it's devilishly ingeniously convoluted and
deceptive because it's mind you are lost inside your own
[ __ ] mind you have some spun such a
story so many stories within stories within stories you've weaved
such a tapestry using your own mind that you literally
have confused fantasy for reality and you don't know how
to distinguish them anymore or rather you're distinguishing of them
itself is the fantasy there is no difference between fantasy
and reality there's only one thing consciousness it's right here
consciousness imagine a brick wall conscious can imagine a unicorn
but don't make the mistake of thinking that just because
you can imagine a unicorn that necessarily the unicorn acquires
the same properties as a brick wall there is a
difference between a brick wall and a unicorn and that
difference we call physicality which is that distinction that we
make and here you'll say aha Leah but I caught
you now so now you're saying there is a real
distinction between unicorns and brick walls no you're not understanding
how deep this goes there only is a distinction between
a unicorn and a brick wall if you believe there
is if you imagine it to be and here you
say well leo but but I can I can stop
believing that difference and there still will be a difference
between a unicorn and a brick wall I can touch
a brick wall I can't move my hand through a
brick wall but a unicorn isn't even a material thing
and here is we're getting up against the limits of
your consciousness so here now your state of consciousness is
the limiting bottleneck you can't go further into understanding what
I'm saying because the state of consciousness you're in right
now is so rigid that literally you're not able to
be conscious of the lack of distinction between a unicorn
and a brick wall even if you wanted to you
can't do it you can't will yourself to do it
because consciousness is not the same thing as belief or
as willing yourself to do something so you can sit
here for a hundred hours and will yourself to walk
through that wall to pretend as though that wall is
imaginary and you will not be able to walk through
it and the reason is is because not because the
brick wall is real but because you're not conscious of
how the brick wall is imaginary for that you need
a radically new state of consciousness which you don't know
how to access but if you could access that state
you could realize that the wall is imaginary and then
the wall would cease to exist for you as a
wall you see so there's layers to this it's it's
quite complicated it's quite tricky and it doesn't work as
simplistically as you want it to because when I start
talking about imagination people get these stupid naive ideas of
like well since lis houses everything is imaginary that means
she should be able to just walk through the brick
wall otherwise he's full of [ __ ] no you
have to understand that I am a limited consciousness right
here I am limited in in various ways these limitations
are what we call physicality now that doesn't mean these
limitations are there forever they're just here now it doesn't
mean that I can control all these limitations doesn't make
me Superman so you have to be careful so now
you might want to really okay but but so what
you're saying distinctions so now there's distinctions and you're saying
conscious but isn't conscious as itself a distinction and what
are distinctions made out of these a distinction itself a
distinction and here is where again here is where thoughts
and words can't take us because thoughts and words are
themselves distinctions you have to become conscious of what a
distinction is or what consciousness is consciousness is not a
distinction consciousness is an absolute it is the substance out
of which all distinctions are made so what are all
distinctions made out of what is what is the thing
here's the way to phrase it what is the substance
of the line that separates a unicorn from a brick
wall what is that line made out of I'm not
talking about the brick wall and I'm not talking about
the unicorn I'm talking about what is the thing that
separates the two what is that made out of that's
an interesting question try to contemplate that for a moment
it's not as easy as it seems how would you
even go about becoming conscious that tricky or if you're
a scientist here's a good question for you what is
the line made out of that distinguishes science from fantasy
and myth and fairytales what does that line made out
of can you see that the line that separates science
from pseudoscience cannot itself be made out of science or
pseudoscience that would be begging the question because before the
line is drawn there is no difference between the two
after the line is drawn there is a difference between
the two but what is that line made out of
and the answer is consciousness but then what is consciousness
what consciousness is nothing it's absolutely nothing which means that
distinctions are absolutely nothing this nothing is so nothing it's
a complete absence of substance it's so nothing that to
even call it nothing is already too much because the
way we ordinarily use the word nothing and the idea
of nothing that's a distinction between nothing and something but
the nothing I'm speaking of is not the nothing that
is the difference between the nothing into something I'm talking
about absolute nothing it's a nothing which is one it's
a nothing which has no opposite it's a nothing which
has no properties and no substance to it which means
you can't talk about it you can't think it you
can't see it you can't feel it and yet it's
absolute and it's here right now and in fact it
is the only thing that is here right now which
is what all of this is it's absolutely nothing so
the key mistake that to tie this back to our
original question because we've kind of gone deep here a
little bit off-track the key mistake that simulation theory makes
is that it posits some sort of other substance it
up it pauses two substances the virtual world and in
the physical real world and now there's two this is
like creating that elephant in that tortoise what needs to
be realized that there is not - there's only one
thing happening reality is a singular thing and that the
substance of everything is nothing not an ordinary nothing not
the ordinary nothing you're thinking of you can't think of
the nothing that I'm talking about actual nothing actual nothing
is not what you're thinking it is it's actually this
right here look at your hand pull out your hand
and look at it this is actual nothing not what
you're thinking about whatever you're thinking nothing is that's not
nothing that's something actual nothing is this but you say
but Leo this isn't nothing this is a hand why
are you calling it nothing it's not a hand a
hand is a distinction you've made what is the distinction
of a hand made out of that thing is nothing
absolute nothing nothing which has no opposite which is of
course not separate from the hand itself if all of
this sounds very confusing and nonsensical and illogical and contradictory
and paradoxical it is that's not a bug that's a
feature of reality reality is a paradox why is there
anything here at all well consider the possibility that maybe
there isn't unless you imagine that there is and the
reason that you think there's something here is because you
think there's something here and if you stop thinking that
there's something here something real there will not be anything
here nothing real that's the twisted mind [ __ ]
of consciousness now none of this is possible or makes
sense within the materialist paradigm of atoms and molecules and
so forth but fortunately that paradigm is false because it's
imagined it's made out of imagined distinctions within consciousness and
how can you know that what I'm saying here is
true and that I'm not just making this [ __
] up by thinking through it all for yourself very
carefully and be coming directly conscious of what I'm talking
about what I'm talking about is found right here I'm
merely describing what you will find if you bother to
look right under your own nose very carefully the problem
is that people don't like to look under their own
nose they like to fly off into Fantasyland about computer
simulations and atoms and molecules and external realities and brains
and science and Stephen Hawking and whatever else multiverse theories
matter and antimatter that's fantasy this is reality but Leo
you said there is no reality that's right reality is
a distinction but this is what we've got here it's
one thing it's one whatever it is is what it
is you can't really say what it is because to
say what something is is itself to create a distinction
so consciousness is prior to your ability to say anything
about it because to say anything about anything is something
that is created by consciousness see so consciousness is the
rock-bottom basically what I'm sort of saying here if you
want to draw an analogy it says though you've lived
your whole life believing that the earth is a globe
which needs to rest on a elephant on top of
a tortoise and so on and what I'm telling you
is that there is no elephant there is no tortoise
there is only the earth floating in a vacuum except
now we're not talking about the earth we're talking about
this very present moment right now you've spent your whole
life living and believing that this present moment is grounded
in atoms and molecules and history of the universe and
big bangs and multiverses and whatever else mathematics and now
I'm telling you all of that was fantasy and all
there ever was and is is right here right now
this and this is nothing and so in this way
we can know definitively for sure that we're not in
a simulation why not again this is very important because
you're still probably thinking if you buy the simulation theory
you're still probably arguing with me and you're saying well
Leo but but still couldn't it be the case that
in the future we'll in Computers then will will inhabit
them and live in them and there will be additional
singularity sure we could do that we have that already
you can go buy a VR headset and put it
on and you can lose yourself in the VR world
you don't even need a VR headset you can just
go play go play an RPG go play some Skyrim
or something or some grand theft auto is one of
these games you know that is engrossing is immersive play
one of these games how do you feel you lose
yourself in the game it doesn't even matter what the
graphics are like you've lost yourself in games back when
they were in the Nintendo 64 era you played some
mario 64 and that thing was ugly as hell you
can go look at some videos of how ugly that
thing looks now by today's standards but you still got
lost and it doesn't matter how many polygons Mario could
be man out of 10 polygons or a million polygons
it doesn't matter because Mario's had a consciousness either way
every video game world you've played in has been consciousness
and it's been as real as your life it is
part of your life which is why it impacts you
so much which is why if you're a gamer you
take your game seriously if you're a film fan you
take your film seriously you don't treat them as some
sort of derivative realities you lose yourself in these games
have you played some MMORPG like World of Warcraft or
something like that EverQuest you get lost in these worlds
people people get so lost in these worlds they die
from hunger you can find cases like this on the
Internet people die of hunger from just like play or
die of tiredness from just playing these games non-stop just
grinding away these games for for day after day after
day without leaving their computer right because they got lost
in a new world but it's not really a new
world it's just more the same its consciousness see so
the mistake of the simulation theorists is that they're not
recognizing that computers are consciousness computers mana consciousness virtual world
to mana consciousness there's no difference between a virtual world
in a real world not really so actually what I'm
telling you here and this is a possibility that many
scientists and simulation theorists and philosophers don't fathom is that
consciousness because reality is one consciousness must always cut through
every level and nesting layer of reality so even if
we do create a flawless virtual world and we take
a baby and we grow it up hooked up to
this machine from birth such that it doesn't even know
what anything outside that virtual world is let's say he
grows up in mario world mario land and it's a
super high-res you know high-resolution hyper real mario land he
grows up in that according to the simulation theorist he
would be so deluded and so deceived by this illusion
that he would never even be able to tell or
break out of it but that assumes that there is
a fundamental distinction between the two and what i'm saying
is that no matter how many virtual worlds you create
no matter how good they are and no matter how
many virtual worlds you nest inside of one of that
because you know we could imagine that you create a
virtual world that's so good that it can also have
its own simulation of another virtual world that's so good
that we could have another one and another one and
no one forever so there could be ten thirty fifty
a hundred thousand levels of these virtual worlds and so
you would think that well if these virtual worlds are
so damn good and we can just get like a
child to grow up in in indies he would be
so lost and it's so many levels deep that he
would never be able to break out and what I'm
telling you is no he would always be able to
break out because the truth is from the absolute highest
perspective all of it is consciousness just different forms of
consciousness different distinctions within consciousness but all of it is
consciousness and since there is nothing but consciousness and since
you are consciousness even though it's easy to get lost
in the forms of consciousness there's always the possibility of
breaking free and becoming what we call awake to become
awake is to see through an infinite number of layers
and forms of consciousness to realize what consciousness is cutting
through everything all possible illusion is cut through with a
deep enough awakening now there's there's layers of awakening and
there's layers of of illusion to shed so a single
awakening may not be sufficient it may not be sufficiently
deep we could imagine in this kind of nested doll
scenario that we've been thinking of these different virtual worlds
nested inside each other that one could awaken from one
virtual world but not yet the next one and not
yet the next one and not yet the next one
so in this case we can imagine if there's ten
virtual worlds there's ten possible awakenings that could happen or
there can be one single grand awakening that cuts through
everything with a person realizes that he or she or
it's is infinite consciousness which is the scene through the
entire illusion and the reason that we can know for
sure that worse that there's not one more simulation behind
us somewhere you know cuz you would wonder like Willy
okay so if there are ten simulations all you know
ten virtual worlds nested in each other and we've awoken
from ten of them isn't there a very likely possibility
if there's an eleventh one or a twelfth one how
would we ever know if we got to the very
end and so again Leo it's impossible to know for
sure and so we must always keep our mind open
to the possibility that we're in a virtual world and
my answer to you is no if you think that
you still don't understand what consciousness is because for consciousness
to be one it must also be infinite and I
can't really explain to you infinity here it's a deep
topic I've explained it elsewhere and go check out my
two-part series understanding absolute infinity where I talk about infinity
in more detail I won't explain it here but I'll
just briefly say that when you realize infinity you cut
through all possible virtual worlds you're totally conscious of consciousness
and you realize that consciousness is one singular substance which
is nothing and you realize that this nothing permeates absolutely
all possible realities multiverses dimensions realms whatever you want to
call them it cuts through it permeates and creates all
of them and that all of them are absolutely nothing
and here you're absolutely conscious this is absolute consciousness what
absolute means is that it's true under all conditions it's
true in all possible universes it's true not possible virtual
realities it's the one thing that unifies all things that
you become conscious of that and you are of all
illusion and no evil demon no Cartesian evil demon no
alien race no matter how intelligent they are can ever
trap you into any kind of simulation when you're that
conscious you're totally conscious of the entire universe and all
possible universes at all possible times past future and present
that's a very ordinary extraordinary state of consciousness which very
few people have experienced but this is what is called
enlightenment and this is a real possibility and if you
ever do encounter and reach this state of consciousness you
will have complete understanding of reality and you will know
for sure absolutely that reality cannot be a simulation because
again a simulation is just one distinction it's perfectly clear
to you once you're awake that simulation is just once
one distinction and it's just one facet of the absolute
and so that answers that tada there's your answer this
is not speculation this is not something you should believe
this is something that I invite you to become conscious
of to work towards and if you keep watching me
in the future I can guide you share with you
methods and techniques for how you can become consciousness I
have already in the past in Prior episodes I talked
about meditation I've talked about yoga I've talked about psychedelics
I'll be talking about more of all that stuff in
the future sharing more powerful techniques with you I'll be
sharing new psychedelics that I've discovered I've just new psychedelics
that mankind hardly knows about that you can use to
to catalyze your awakening process and to verify all the
things that I say everything that I say is is
perfectly scientific it just requires your intimate involvement that's really
the only mistake that science makes it's not that science
is evil or SuperDuper wrong or something like that it's
just that science is dissociated from consciousness science tries to
be too objective for its own good trying science tries
to be so objective it misses the one absolute which
is pure empty subjectivity itself now you might say leo
okay but um but shouldn't you know you talk about
open-mindedness Leo shouldn't we just be open-minded still maybe maybe
you're wrong Leo maybe there is a possibility maybe you've
made some kind of mistake maybe there's just a possibility
that we are in a simulation I mean who really
knows no if you think that you don't understand what
I'm talking about you haven't fathomed what I'm saying there
is no possibility whatsoever that we're in a simulation because
all simulations are consciousness this is one of those things
you have to get it can't be explained to you
beyond what I've already said you have to grow kit
and now here's a skeptic will say Ollie oh but
but prove it to me prove prove what you're saying
is true but again if you're demanding proof you're not
understanding the depth of the epistemic problem here it can't
be proven to you because what is proof proof is
a distinction dummy you can't prove consciousness because it's right
here proof is second-order proof and evidence and reason and
logic and argumentation is something that occurs within consciousness so
you can't use it to reach underneath and to grab
the substance of conscious itself because the substance of conscious
self is nothing how do you prove nothing how do
you prove absolute actual nothing only by recognizing that you're
it it's the same problem is trying to get a
donkey to recognize his own reflection in the mirror no
amount of argumentation or proof will work on the donkey
the donkey has to sit and look in the mirror
until he goes oh my [ __ ] god that
there is me and no amount of science or logic
or math is gonna prove it to him you can
beat him you can kick him you can you can
cram his face into the mirror you can scold him
you can call him names you can call him stupid
and it's not gonna help him the only thing that
will work is if he sits there for a long
time and he has an awakening there's no substitute for
consciousness precisely because there's nothing here but consciousness if you
can't be conscious of what consciousness is you're [ __
] God Himself can't help you and by the way
God is consciousness this is God you get all that
good cuz I'm done here I've beaten this horse to
death this donkey to death now the work is on
you happy holidays of course Happy New Year happy 2019
my next video will be after I come back in
2020 if you want to pursue this further start meditating
start doing yoga maybe experience like a telex I don't
want to tell you what to do it's your responsibility
to figure out how deep you want to go with
this start contemplating you can start reading books on my
book list very powerful book list I have go check
it out over 200 life-changing books on there if you
read I guarantee this if you read all 200 books
I have a little bit more in 200 on the
list and you fathom everything in those books and you
start to embody even a quarter of it you're gonna
become superhuman you're gonna become a God among men if
you can do that and then beyond those children you
will need to read another book in your life if
you fathom everything that's said in those books see the
thing with the book list is and just in general
the thing with reading books is that it's really important
which books here eat a lot of people read a
lot of different kinds of books there have been many
people who have read way more books than I have
various professors academics Nobel laureates intellectuals of various kinds whoever
thousands of books I haven't read thousands of books I've
probably read maybe around 300 books in my life estimating
but what really distinguishes me from those people is that
I've read the right books I was really really careful
to read the right books reading the right books is
everything in this work it's not sufficient to awaken you
but it's it's a necessary foundation so if you read
the right books I'm telling you you won't need to
read the books to rush your life spend the next
five years reading these 200 books and you will understand
yourself and the world and reality so deeply that you'll
be set you'll be set for life and then everything
else after that will just be my new show so
yeah and that's sort of a point where I've reached
recently is that I've become so conscious recently that I
can't read books anymore because anything that I read in
a book is like it's sort of like being Albert
Einstein and then being forced to sit through first grade
there's no there's no point once you're Albert Einstein you
don't need to go back to first grade anymore you
know what you're doing so these books will help you
to do that and that's ultimately what I'm trying to
do with all the material that I publish on actualised
org is I'm trying to one of my goals is
to get you to this point where you become so
deeply soaked in understanding of life self psychology non-duality reality
metaphysics epistemology culture dynamics of the ego self-deception you understand
these things so well that all of life becomes clear
to you of course that doesn't mean you're perfect doesn't
mean you can't make mistakes I can still make mistakes
I'm not saying everything I knows is perfect but you
can reach a certain critical mass of understanding we're really
it's amazing it's amazing how deep in this is this
is one of the most rewarding aspects of this work
which is so difficult to communicate is just how profound
your understanding of reality self in life and humanity becomes
once you reach this sort of super critical mass of
understanding through reading books through contemplating through watching videos you
reach this mass it takes I would say it's gonna
take you five or ten years probably more like ten
years for you to reach this super critical mass if
you're serious about it if you're just screwing around you'll
never get there but if you're serious about it like
I was it'll probably take you ten years and man
will that be the best decision you've ever made in
your life that you did that so many doors and
opportunities will open to you that I can't even begin
to enumerate them your life will change in such profound
ways you'll have amazing mystical experiences you'll avoid so many
traps so many bad situations so much suffering will be
avoided by having this understanding you'll have so much wisdom
and this wisdom will be universal wisdom that you can
apply in all situations you'll be able to apply it
with your children at school in business at work in
your relationships in your marriage in your sexual relationships in
your dating life in politics your life purpose with your
emotions the power of wisdom is that it's universal if
it's true wisdom so there you go I'm down here
please click that like button for me come check out
actualize it or check out my blog find the book
list there find the left purpose course there I'll have
more resources coming out in the future go hang out
on the forum sign up for the forum is free
and stay tuned for more this is philosophy as it
is meant to be done I really despise philosophy done
as mental masturbation or s speculation real philosophy changes your
whole life real philosophy rewires your mind real philosophy removes
suffering real philosophy gets you tangible absolute answers to life's
deepest questions real philosophy leads to profound mystical experiences this
is not the kind of philosophy that they teach unfortunately
in in most universities that's [ __ ] that's philosophy
as mental masturbation that's studying old dead men's ideas dead
men who were deluded and didn't understand what consciousness was
and now you waste all your time studying their stupid
ideas that just infects your mind with more duality and
more ignorance and delusion real philosophy is practical philosophy you
know what that means love wisdom fill us Sophia Phil
is love and Sophia is wisdom the love of wisdom
that's what actualize ever I guess it's my love wisdom
shared with you and your love wisdom which keeps you
tuned to these lectures and your love of wisdom which
keeps you on this journey of thinking about life contemplating
reality asking deep questions meditating doing psychedelics going to retreats
doing yoga and other such things that's love of wisdom
love of truth and philosophy is the most rewarding activity
that you can do in life and philosophy of course
is identical to spirituality these two are sometimes separated in
the minds of people as though they're different they're different
when they're done poorly when done well they converge and
what you realize is that true philosophy and true spirituality
are actually identical and that's a beautiful discovery to make
and I want you to discover that in your life
and so we have more philosophy to do so stick
around for 2020 and we'll see what comes the new
year you
