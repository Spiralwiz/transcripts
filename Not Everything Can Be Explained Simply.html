[Music] a quick note before we get into the main
topic i've recently launched the actualized clips channel which is
a second brand new actualized channel which contains short snippets
of my long content so if you're having difficulty keeping
up with all the overwhelming long-form episodes that i do
go check out the clips channel i've been getting a
lot of positive feedback from people on it people seem
to love it so maybe that's for you go check
that out it's free all right and you'll find a
link down below to that all right so let's get
into the main topic so the topic here today is
this misconceived notion that i see a lot of people
subscribing to and it's very self-deceptive it's the notion that
if you can't explain a thing concisely and simply then
you don't understand that thing have you heard of this
notion before a lot of times people will use this
as an excuse to dismiss certain ideas that they hear
because especially like my content i'm very sensitive to this
because my content tends to be very long and people
have such short attention spans that they say well leo
surely there's no need to sit around and talk about
the nature of science for five hours or for two
hours surely if you can if you have such a
deep understanding of science you can explain it to me
in five minutes or for example like well you've got
a leo you've got videos about god explaining what god
is like a three-hour long video on the nature of
god and that's just part one and then there's a
part two as well surely god can't be that complicated
if you really knew what god was then you should
be able to do a five minute video on god
and explain it to me so leo that proves you
don't really know what you're talking about this is a
very common line of defense that the ego mind takes
and i'm not just saying this from sort of a
personal perspective like i'm coming from some butthurt place about
this no it's just it's a common defense tactic that
i've seen used elsewhere not just with my work of
course my work is is particularly prone to this kind
of attack it's a false attack and we're going to
deconstruct it here but it's particularly prone to that because
my bias is for going very deep on these topics
that's my whole thing in life it's like i want
to i want to have the deepest understanding of reality
humanly possible that's my whole thing that's what i've devoted
my whole life to and so you should start to
perhaps suspect that maybe if what you're after is depth
of understanding that that's going to be a little bit
more difficult than what you can achieve through a five
or ten minute video or five or ten minute explanation
i want to explain to you why that is and
it's actually interesting because this kind of defense is oftentimes
used by rational people scientifically minded people atheistically minded people
and so on especially when it comes to more philosophical
topics and questions and more spiritual or mystical topics and
questions and issues is that they tend to think that
like oh well if this guy really knew what he
was talking about this mystical stuff if this mystical stuff
was really true then it should be very simple to
explain well but why would you assume that because after
all let's really be even-handed about this let's really make
sure we're being neutral that we don't have double standards
that we set for science versus the mystical stuff or
for philosophy or for any kind of inquiry into the
nature of reality look at it like this you spent
12 years learning mathematics in school 12 [ __ ]
years of misery and pain and torture racking your mind
trying to understand even something as simple as subtraction multiplication
and division try to think back into your past first
grade second grade where you were struggling just to understand
how subtraction works and think of how many hours of
lecture you received from your teachers from your tutors if
you had tutors from your parents if they had to
help you with your homework assignments think of how many
hours you spent doing homework assignments think of how many
subtraction problems you've solved in your entire schooling career hundreds
thousands so now you understand subtraction and maybe a few
higher level ideas within mathematics tru just try to fathom
how challenging that was for you to grasp that hold
on got something stuck in my throat right so now
imagine if i came to you and i was completely
ignorant of mathematics and you let's say you graduated high
school and maybe hopefully by the end of high school
you learn a little bit of calculus at the very
least or in university you did uh and i start
asking you what's calculus tell me tell me what calculus
is tell me the essence of calculus i want to
understand what would you what would you tell me where
would you even begin with that question you see how
tricky it is now you let's just assume that you
are a calculus whiz you aced all your calculus tests
and that in fact you became a calculus professor and
you do it for a living so your understanding of
calculus is just amazing you understand every nuance of calculus
the history of calculus you can solve these equations with
your eyes closed but that's not the problem the problem
is me the problem is my ignorance when i ask
you about calculus because you can't start talking about calculus
you gotta you gotta go like down one level and
first you gotta teach me addition and subtraction and then
multiplication and division and then equations with variables x's and
y's and z's and then the quadratic equation and then
geometry circles and squares and lines and this sorts of
stuff and then analytical geometry charts and graphs and the
unit circle and then trigonometry and then more advanced concepts
polynomials and functions and all the different kinds of functions
that exist and how they work and then maybe now
we can have a discussion about calculus and even then
it's not going to be a five-minute discussion you can't
explain calculus in five minutes and now i hear you
saying but leo i can find a youtube video right
now of somebody explaining calculus in five or ten minutes
that's only because yeah you can find a video like
that you can always do a truncated explanation of anything
the problem is is is it going to be meaningful
to the person learning it and what level is the
person learning it at if you're like if you're in
12th grade math class and you've done all those other
lower classes and you've done them well then yeah we
can do a 10-minute little intro into calculus but i
mean is that going to be enough for you to
really understand the essence this the spirit the core of
calculus no i mean yeah you can do a little
a little general explanation but you're not going to really
deeply grasp what derivatives are what integration is and all
these other concepts from calculus because the way calculus works
is that it or mathematics in general basically is that
it builds it builds and builds and builds on top
of itself that's why it's so challenging because you have
to get the first layers right and if there's any
misunderstanding or confusion in the first layers you can't go
on to the next layers which is why if you're
failing your tests in school they hold you back a
grade because they know you won't be able to understand
the more advanced material in the next grade unless you
can have at least a basic level of comprehension of
certain things and so this is true of all science
science is very deep and dense and you got to
learn it in little bits and pieces over hundreds and
thousands of hours over years and decades and then you
can have some sort of intelligent conversation about the function
of nature or some aspect of nature people take this
for granted people take this kind of schooling that we
get for granted we just sort of assume that these
would be ideas that you would understand even if you
didn't went to school but you wouldn't so any time
that you're trying to ask a deep question about the
nature of reality or yourself or life the problem is
how much foundation do you have to hear the answer
i can give you some very quick answers to very
profound questions because i do understand some of these topics
but the problem is not that the problem and this
is really the thing that i spend the majority of
my time racking my mind over in my life is
how do i bridge the gap between where i am
and where you are because if you were where i'm
at you wouldn't need my explanation by definition so if
you're if you're trying to learn from me by definition
that assumes that i know something you don't know otherwise
why are you listening to me and by the way
if you feel that you know more than me then
please stop watching please stop wasting your time listening to
me i know some of you like to hate hate
watch me or whatever and maybe you do that for
entertainment's sake but i would encourage you not to waste
your life on that don't don't hate watch anybody don't
waste your time watching stuff that you think is stupid
if you think what i'm saying is stupid or false
or delusional or you think that i'm wrong and that
you know better than me about any of these questions
about science about god about psychedelics about religion about spirituality
about non-duality about enlightenment that's your prerogative that's your perspective
that's your right to take that sort of position but
then why are you watching me don't waste your time
go build your life be constructive what i want for
you is i want you to eliminate those aspects of
your life that are not constructive and productive towards your
life purpose or towards your happiness or towards your well-being
or the health of yourself and everyone around you and
society see so be very careful not to fall into
this trap of hate watching stuff on youtube i know
i fall into that trap too sometimes i'll hate watch
some you know some conservative political pundit or something just
because it's so stupid it's like looking at a car
wreck you know it's just like you can't help but
look at it but recognize that that's a toxic tendency
within your mind and that you can let that go
and you you should be as you're self-actualizing you should
be spending more and more of your mental energy concentrating
it towards constructive productive aims whatever those are whether it's
your spiritual work or your business or whatever but anyways
that was a tangent so getting back to things so
where was i um yeah so i can give you
short quick answers to very complicated advanced questions but the
problem is that you're not going to understand the answer
so this sort of little simple adage that well if
it can't be explained quickly and and simply that means
the person explaining it doesn't understand well that's one possibility
consider the alternative possibility which is that things can be
explained very tersely concisely and simply but that's going to
pack a lot of information into a very dense symbolic
form whether it's a thought a word an equation whatever
but then for you to really unpack that that very
much assumes that you you already have a very deep
foundation as i do and then we can communicate with
with very few words in fact really if you were
as conscious as me we could literally just sit and
look at each other and that would be all that's
necessary nothing would need to be said for example someone
might ask okay leah what's so what's uh what is
reality tell me what reality is i want to know
what it is and where it came from and how
it how it works and why it's here ah you
say you know so why don't you tell me tell
me tell me simply tell me quickly okay i can
grant you your wish reality is infinity that's it that's
it that's the whole that's the whole answer nothing more
needs to be said reality is infinity but do you
have any clue what that actually means no most of
you don't even if you think you do you still
don't you have no clue how deep the answer is
and how deep the question is so this is a
this is a very common trap the mind falls into
is that the mind underestimates the depth of reality and
it tends to think that it can answer and understand
questions about reality with simplistic answers and then as you
start to study these things you realize just how little
you knew so this is this is just a general
trend that you should notice throughout your entire life this
has happened to you it's happened to all of us
we go into a situation and we think we know
everything about that situation the simple situation is simple it's
easy we know all the answers and then we start
to study and the more we study the more we
realize bam i was so deluded i wasn't even close
to understanding this issue i of course didn't have the
answers at all and the more i study the less
answers i have the more questions i have the more
confused i get think of a time that this has
happened to you it especially happens when you try to
accomplish something in life like for example business or for
example with capitalism a lot of stage green socialist type
people who lean towards sort of the socialist ideology they
will criticize capitalism a lot and business owners and ceos
and executives and this sort of stuff but these people
have never i mean the socialist type people have never
actually started their own business and so when they do
go to start their own business they quickly realize just
how difficult it is to start a business how fierce
the competition is how much of a game of survival
it is and then you have two choices either you
will say ah [ __ ] it all this business
stuff is just evil nonsense and i'm not even gonna
participate in this game and then you just quit and
then you go just work for some employer and then
you're you're pissed off that this employer is exploiting you
and you know not paying you your fair share and
all this sorts of stuff or you could you can
actually have a a moment of epiphany you can realize
wait a minute the simplistic ideas i had about socialism
and capitalism and that i'm being exploited and all this
sort of it's not so simple because actually to succeed
in business requires a sort of brutalness it's a game
of survival it's very much like being a a lion
out on the safari hunting for zebras or antelope that's
that's a brutal that's a brutal business it's a business
of survival and just because you go work at starbucks
or some other place for some employer that doesn't mean
you've escaped that problem you've just sort of ignored taking
responsibility for it actually because see now you can be
pissed off at your boss for being the evil capitalist
who exploits you without realizing that the boss has to
be doing the things he's doing otherwise the company's going
to go out of business because of the competition so
if you actually take on the responsibility to challenge you
might say ah you know i had some overly simplified
ideas about what socialism and capitalism are and maybe capitalism
isn't so evil and maybe profit is not some evil
but it's actually sort of a necessary thing in order
to run a successful business and maybe business and corporations
aren't evil in their essence but it's just actually how
human beings survive at this point in our development and
it's sort of a necessary evil and maybe i'm involved
in this necessary evil in a much deeper way than
i thought maybe i'm not separate from it and see
now you get now you get a more real sense
for economics it's not just simplistic theories that you learned
in college by reading a few books now you're really
in the thick of it well it's likewise with stuff
like trying to understand consciousness or meditation or psychedelics or
with science trying to understand what science is see most
people think they know what science is and they're very
cocky and arrogant about it and if i try to
teach them a little bit deeper the complexities of science
and some of the limitations of science they start to
get very arrogant and defensive about it and of course
that's projected like onto me as like oh leo you
don't know what you're talking about yeah but see i
spent 20 years contemplating the epistemics and metaphysics of science
more than most professional scientists have um whereas you how
many years have you spent contemplating the nature of science
if i had to bet i would say less than
a year so the challenge with me helping you understand
what science is and understanding some of its limitations is
you're missing 19 years of contemplation and study and reading
i didn't just contemplate i read books i listened to
lectures i studied science and thought about it deeply in
in university i took philosophy of science courses i took
logic courses and i struggled through all that for years
for decades and then contemplated and then read philosophy and
read famous scientists read about einstein read about descartes read
about leibniz studied their work thought about their work considered
the limitations of their work right how much of that
have you done so if you haven't done any of
that how do i communicate with you that's the challenge
that's the bottleneck the bottleneck is a lack of foundation
therefore my videos are oftentimes about building that foundation and
building that foundation takes time and effort that most people
don't have especially on youtube in general this is a
general psychological principle of human beings is that human beings
are very bad at building foundations for anything because building
a foundation for anything requires a lot of time and
forward thinking and patience and daily follow-through for you to
understand some advanced mathematical concepts took 12 years of building
a foundation and now you just take the foundation for
granted and now we can have a conversation about some
advanced mathematical concepts but that's not the case for example
with consciousness you did not spend 12 years building a
foundation of understanding what consciousness is or what psychedelics are
or what science is now you might say leo no
i spent 12 years studying science yeah you spent 12
years reading about scientific discoveries you did not spend 12
years doing science in fact i'm willing to bet you
haven't done a single science experiment in your entire life
now you say oh leo but but in in you
know in high school chemistry class they made me do
some experiments yeah they made you like a monkey follow
through some steps that they wrote in a in a
manual you went through those steps you did something you
don't even remember what you did or how you did
it or why it was even being done you did
that just to get a grade and to pass the
test you didn't actually genuinely do any science in your
entire life and yet you think you understand science see
and even if you did do some science that doesn't
mean you've actually deeply contemplated the epistemics and metaphysics of
what you were doing you can do great lab work
like a monkey where somebody tells you that they need
some chemical reaction made and you just you know you
go look up in a book what of chemical reactions
you look through a catalog of those reactions you find
the reactions that are are necessary to achieve the result
somebody wants your employer wants let's say and you go
mix those those chemicals together and you generate a result
and then you give it to them and then they're
happy or whatever and good but while you were doing
that you didn't think deeply about what are chemicals where
did they come from how do they work how do
we even know chemicals exist really maybe they're just hallucinations
of the mind you didn't ask any of these questions
because it wasn't relevant to achieving some results that you
were paid for or some grade that you were supposed
to receive there wasn't even time to ask these questions
in fact if you were asking these questions this would
get you a lower grade this would this would get
you less money less success why because asking these questions
oftentimes isn't practical and it slows you down if you
have to question everything you're doing all the time at
a deep metaphysical philosophical level it's hard to achieve anything
because like if you want to go drive to the
grocery store and you walk outside and you you're getting
into your car and then suddenly it hits you like
wait a minute what is a car where did this
car come from who built it how did it get
here where the technology of it come from and you
start to deeply question this source of stuff and you
start to question what is metal that it's made out
of whatever where did the rubber in the tires come
from you will spend a whole day just questioning this
car and you will not drive to the grocery store
and then your kids will go hungry you see so
once you recognize that there's a big difference between doing
stuff and actually getting to the bottom of it through
contemplation thinking deeply about it the majority of humans don't
think deeply about anything they don't think about anything they're
just like monkeys walking around doing stuff that is acceptable
in their culture and that their culture tells them to
do so going back to the point of this problem
that human beings are very poor at building foundations for
things the only reason you developed a foundation for mathematics
for science for language for other things you learn in
school is because school is a system that forced you
this was a system that recognize how powerful this is
school is a bureaucratic system that was invented over a
course of let's say the last two thousand years went
through a a deep evolutionary process uh first maybe it
started as tutoring uh like in ancient roman times in
greek times it was just tutoring one-on-one instruction then classrooms
were developed then these classrooms grew into larger schools then
these schools grew into universities then these universities you know
turned into entire businesses and corporations with giant bureaucracies and
funding and a bunch of other things and there were
all these different subjects and different experiments were done onto
you know how do you teach kids which way which
learning styles are are better suited to what people and
then tests were developed and a base of knowledge was
this took thousands of years to develop this and then
we forced everybody to go to school for 12 years
you didn't have a choice about that as a kid
you just went and that forced this foundation upon you
but imagine trying to achieve that with something that is
outside of the school system outside the school curriculum by
yourself imagine if you had to teach yourself mathematics completely
by yourself without any support systems from your culture or
your society imagine you grew up in a society where
mathematics didn't exist or it existed but only a few
fringe people knew about it like maybe one in a
thousand people knew about mathematics but the rest of them
didn't your family didn't your friends didn't your colleagues didn't
and then one of those fringe one in a thousand
people tried to teach you mathematics how would that go
how would he even introduce the idea of mathematics to
you because in the world you grew up in people
weren't even talking about it as a legitimate subject in
fact maybe they were talking about as some sort of
witchcraft or superstition after all what is mathematics it's some
sort of woo ideas in your mind it's just philosophy
and nonsense that you know some some stupid mathematician invented
it it doesn't do anything it's just ideas and mental
masturbation imagine if that was the attitude of your culture
and then some mathematician came to you and started to
actually seriously try to explain some mathematics to you like
trigonometry how would that go can you anticipate how stuck
you would be but imagine you you somehow you you
recognize the validity and the the value and and importance
of mathematics and you started learning it by yourself imagine
how difficult that would be compared to the way you
learned it in school because in school you had to
go there was math class there was a bell that
rang and you were like just like a you were
like a like a herd animal you were literally like
a factory-farmed cow just going wherever you know whatever path
they led you down learning whatever they told you to
learn you didn't ask any questions about why am i
learning this should i be learning this is this even
true what i'm being taught where did these ideas come
from none of these ideas entered your mind when you
were young you were just learning stuff blindly like a
monkey jumping through hoops passing grades and tests but imagine
you if you had to develop mathematics on your own
this would mean you would have to set aside time
every day where you would say okay for the next
hour or two i'm just i'm learning mathematics i'm reading
books and then i'm going to spend a few more
hours later in the day doing homework assignments these different
exercises i'm going to do 50 or 100 of these
long division problems and then after you do that for
a few weeks then you move on to the next
chapter of the book and the next topic and then
you learn that for another few and then you keep
doing that and you and you do that for 12
years every single week for 12 years how many of
you would actually succeed in that less than one in
a million why because simply for us humans mostly what
we're doing we're not doing anything original we're just following
the herd whatever our friends and family and colleagues are
doing is what we do and anything too far outside
of that is extremely difficult for us to do because
we have to isolate ourselves from the herd and devote
ourselves to this task and be very focused about it
be very serious about it and be very persistent with
it despite failure and difficulty and you have to keep
pushing and pushing and pushing yourself most people are so
bad at motivating and pushing themselves or creating a long-term
vision or plan for themselves they can't even plan one
year into into the future let alone 12 years think
about how much vision it takes just to say to
yourself you know what i'm going to spend the next
12 years learning mathematics and maybe it'll get me somewhere
maybe it'll have some value for me and that means
i'm going to wake up every morning thinking about mathematics
reminding myself to sit down for an hour read the
book reminding myself to sit down later in the day
do homework assignments even though they're painful and complicated and
confusing and maybe i don't enjoy it that much but
i'm gonna keep doing that for 12 [ __ ]
years and it'll get me somewhere only one in a
million people has enough vision and motivation and self-discipline and
follow-through capacity to actually execute that to actualize that the
only reason mathematics is so widespread is because there was
a system that you went through like a sheep to
teach you that to force you into that and you
wanted to quit and if it was left up to
you you would have quit mathematics very early on the
only reason you persisted is because your parents forced you
your culture and society expected it of you and you
were given no other options it was not a choice
you had and then in a sort of certain sense
it became easy when you don't have a choice about
something it's actually easy to do it but it's really
hard to do something when you have an infinite number
of choices and possibilities when you can go have sex
socialize watch tv youtube play video games when you have
all these options who's going to learn math nobody the
only people are going to learn math are those who
are forced into a system that forces them to learn
it that's the only reason people by and large understand
math and even so even if you went through 12
years of that your understanding of math is still piss
poor for most of you the way that science and
mathematics works is that it builds very much like a
imagine a giant redwood tree a thick thick thick thick
tree with many many rings that are built right and
the way the reason that a tree has rings in
it is because every year or so every season the
tree expands kind of going from from the inside to
the outside and it builds layers and it creates accretes
layer upon layer upon layer so really what you have
in an old tree is you have a sort of
a nested a nested matrashka doll effect of smaller trees
as it was growing out up and out of itself
and you can't just have the outer layer of a
tree that outer layer depends upon the inner layer and
that one depends upon the previous one and so on
and that's how human knowledge and science and mathematics and
so forth work now the topics that i cover are
topics that have been neglected by our education system topics
like self-actualization philosophy metaphysics epistemology psychology sociology developmental psychology the
philosophy and and methods of science consciousness psychedelics spirituality religion
mysticism topics like success emotional mastery leadership creativity how to
discipline and motivate yourself life purpose how to find your
values how to self-reflect how to contemplate how to think
deeply and independently about things for yourself how to deconstruct
your own mind and reality love wisdom you spent virtually
zero time studying any of these topics in school or
in university you may say oh leo no but i
took a psychology class in high school and i studied
some psychology or sociology in in college and i did
some study of physics and science in in college and
i took a few intro philosophy courses in in college
yeah maybe you did but all of that is just
like it's it's it's so minuscule it's so miniscule and
it was so poor in quality and the amount of
effort and thought that you put into it was so
little compared to what is necessary to really truly deeply
understand these things so my job is to help you
to understand these things that are outside the norms of
our current education system and our education system is very
limited precisely because it ignores these topics now you might
say oh leo that that sucks why doesn't education just
include these important topics if they're so important why wouldn't
education include them leo isn't that an argument against their
importance because i mean honestly if these things were so
important like if consciousness was truly so important if love
was so important if truth was so important surely there
would be classes on these things early in school and
all throughout but there aren't therefore these things must be
[ __ ] or nonsense or unimportant but what you
don't understand is that the education system is deeply political
the things that the education system teaches i'm not saying
it's political in the sense that it makes you a
a conservative or a liberal i'm saying that it's political
in the sense that ideas are dangerous and scary things
threatening things they are threatening to power and they are
threatening to social order so what you think of here
these topics as just being ideas as just being philosophy
as just being mere curiosities they're not that precisely what
separates the topics that i just mentioned that i talk
about so much and that i am passionate about the
most is that they are deeply deeply functional they play
a crucial role in one's survival and as a result
they're very dangerous they threaten the social order and because
they threaten the social order and they threaten power hierarchies
um they threatened how society is structured they threaten the
economy they threaten religion they threaten science they threaten technology
they threaten the traditional family they threaten culture because they
threaten these things it becomes virtually impossible to get the
general population to agree to teach these things in school
if the things that i taught would be taught in
school the teachers who would be teaching these things would
probably be at the very least outcast from society and
demonized but they might even have violence done to them
and even killed that's the seriousness of what we're talking
about now sure you can teach these topics in a
shallow way which is not too threatening but if you
teach these topics in a very deep way and especially
when you start to interconnect them all together in a
holistic way to build a big picture understanding of what's
really going on in reality and in life that's where
it gets very very threatening and in general this is
why school doesn't teach you to question anything deeply for
yourself it's mostly just memorization that's mostly what school is
it's just memorization and then regurgitation of what you memorized
that's not a true understanding of anything it's not really
learning it's just indoctrination and dogma it doesn't matter whether
the content that you're being indoctrinated with is scientific or
not you're still being indoctrinated with it and it's still
there for dogma and belief now it's precisely because these
topics are so important that they are not covered do
you see because the most important topics are the ones
that relate to survival the most important questions are the
ones that most people in society don't want you asking
because when the majority of your culture and your society
is built upon constructed fantasies and illusions that are designed
for the perpetuation of the human race for survival when
that is the primary paradigm from which society operates when
your concerns are things like money and sex and material
advancement and technology and the preservation of your career and
your family and your religion and your tribe when these
are your primary concerns in life there can be no
deep questioning because you're not really interested in truth you're
not interested in understanding anything you're interested in just maintaining
patterns of survival most people are not interested in questioning
or deconstructing their religion or what their professors are teaching
in university or the way that business is conducted or
their tribe their political party their nation when they're teaching
you history in school they're not interested in teaching you
in an unbiased history which spans the entire globe they
are interested in teaching you the history of your people
that's what you were taught in university or in high
school is the history of your people not the world
you got a very biased history of your little starting
from your little local region of the globe you didn't
learn the history of australia if you're not australian you
didn't learn the history of japan you didn't learn the
history of china you didn't learn the history of new
zealand you didn't learn the history of of most countries
on the planet mostly just your own and then whatever
entanglements your country had with other countries that's what you
were taught and even that was taught from a very
self-biased perspective where your country was placed on a pedestal
and all the other ones were marginalized and diminished you
see and now to go into the school system and
to suggest hey let's let's change the way we teach
history in america in american schools let's not teach about
george washington and about thomas jefferson and the constitution the
revolution let's not teach about that let's focus on the
entire world evenly let's teach them about australia let's see
to japan what would happen there would be an outcry
there would be absolute outcry from the the parent you
know the parent association that governs the school there would
be an outcry like how dare you teach my children
about those black savages in africa they need to learn
about good old western civilization that's that's the response you
would get in many districts across america you know how
dare you teach australian history before american history because american
history is more important than australian history that would be
the kind of logic and it would be very threatening
for the parents because whatever the kids learn the kids
have to come back to their parents at the end
of the day and then you know the kid is
sitting at the dinner table and the the parent asks
the kid of course well say what did you learn
in school today and then and the kid is going
to say something like well i learned that uh for
example in in the middle east they had advanced civilizations
that were more developed than western european civilization during certain
periods like the you know islamic golden age they had
more advanced mathematics they had more sophisticated universities and other
things like that they were more open-minded more multicultural than
then some of us even are today and then when
that when the parent when the conservative you know parent
who didn't learn these things hears about this stuff this
conflicts with with the parents worldview and their worldview is
a sort of nationalistic one of like you know yankee
doodle dandy uncle sam you know we're the best you
know america is the best america is the greatest western
civilization the greatest this sort of they have that kind
of worldview and now this clash is what their worldview
and they say wait a minute what are these teachers
teaching my children filling their mind with all this anti-american
stuff about islam being great at one point this is
all you know they're all a bunch of terrorists and
stuff that's how that's how the parents might think if
they're very ignorant and so the ignorance of the parents
reinforces the ignorance of the entire education system because the
education system can only be as open and advanced and
as conscious and as developed basically as the parents and
also the teachers who are teaching it and who are
supporting it and who are paying taxes to fund it
schools in america at least are funded by by local
taxes local real estate taxes fund schools and if the
schools are teaching something the parents don't like the parents
will raise hell like hell i mean like in kansas
they still have this problem i don't even know today
do they teach evolution in kansas i don't i don't
even know if they do i think they they still
teach intelligent design the sort of stupid christian version of
intelligent design i think they they i think they're still
teaching that at the very least they teach it alongside
evolution as though these two are sort of equal you
know present both sides why is that the case well
because the the parents in kansas are conservative so you
can't you have to i'm trying to get you to
understand how deep how deeply the ignorance roots itself within
human society we can't have very advanced schools and very
advanced teachers teaching very advanced subjects because the majority of
the population is too ignorant and too unconscious and too
underdeveloped to appreciate the value of those things and in
fact it will be directly threatened by those things just
try to imagine would it be it would be like
for example in saudi arabia in a elementary school in
saudi arabia to teach children at an elementary school level
to question the existence of god allah or the validity
of the quran if you did this in saudi arabia
they would kill you they would literally kill you for
doing that as a teacher so it's sort of a
self-fulfilling prophecy effect when a culture is uh is steeped
in ignorance and dogma then that dogman ignorance is reinforced
in many many ways at the most extreme level it's
reinforced by cutting your head off but there are many
subtle ways that it can be enforced you can be
fired lose your job you can be demoted you can
be marginalized you can be outcast you can be demonized
you can have your reputation tarred and feathered you can
um you can be accused of of being you know
a pedophile or something um you can be like the
amount of ways you can be demonized and marginalized for
your views if they're radical enough and conflict enough with
the prevailing predominant culture is endless and we see this
throughout all of human history this has happened the brightest
most brilliant human beings the most conscious and the most
developed of every era have always been demonized demonized marginalized
had their power taken away from them and oftentimes imprisoned
and killed why is that because the more conscious and
developed you get the more truthful your perception of reality
is and truth and consciousness and love these are antithetical
to the ego and to survival so the most truthful
people are the ones that need to be eliminated the
soonest with the greatest vengeance and their reputation need to
be tarnished the most because that's the only way we
can maintain the fictions and constructions that our society and
culture is addicted to because if we allow all these
you know brilliant people to rise up and to start
teaching what will happen is that culture all the constructions
and fantasies of culture will will start getting deconstructed and
questioned and contradicted and that becomes extremely confusing and threatening
to the majority of the population who are not on
board with that and they will revolt and they will
kick those people out of power or kill them that's
how it's always been done since the beginning of human
history and it's still done today although in developed countries
don't really kill people so much for that anymore but
we certainly tarnish their reputations and we discredit them and
we marginalize them as much as possible and we absolutely
do not give them money and power to be able
to have enough influence on the population because really what
we're talking about here is a game of fighting for
the soul and the mind of the population it's an
influence game it's a survival game between different meme complexes
like science materialism atheism or religion or whichever religion you
know islam christianity buddhism whatever all of these different worldviews
are fighting with each other for domination and monopolization of
the the newest fear the mind sphere of of the
population and based on how this mind sphere is manipulated
and what kind of constructions are allowed or disallowed you
can then build economies and businesses on top of that
when you have a stupid population you can build businesses
that extract wealth from that stupidity and so it's this
very deep tangle of both the education system the political
system the business economic system all of it is in
entangled together creating the core of what we call society
and you're in the middle of that and you're only
now as i'm talking about this starting to get a
little inkling into the fact that you're in the middle
of that and how much you were indoctrinated by all
this how unconscious all of this is all of this
is occurring unconsciously this is not some grand conspiracy to
keep you stupid it's just that people are deeply unconscious
and it takes a lot of effort to raise our
consciousness especially collectively making sense you see do you see
how long it took me just to explain that and
you still really don't understand what i'm talking about you're
just only seeing the tip of the spear here and
it's taking an hour just to get here and there
was no way i could have communicated this to you
in five minutes that you would understand that would have
any impact on you i mean i can always condense
my teachings down to shorter and shorter little aphorisms and
statements but these aphorisms and statements will only have meaning
to the extent that you have an ability to decipher
and unpack them which you won't have unless you spend
hours and hours and hours studying contemplating it and taking
in all this stuff all this knowledge all this information
here is one of the biggest tricks and mechanisms that
the ego mind uses to maintain itself the ego mind
and generally just in general even more broadly your mind
is constructing all of reality but in order for it
to feel like it's real and not a construction you
have to be unconscious about the fact that you're constructing
reality you have to deny it so the mind as
it's constructing it immediately begins constructing constructions that deny construction
is occurring and you have many of these constructions in
your mind and so when i'm communicating with you the
reason it can take so long and it can be
so challenging uh and it requires so much in-depth explanation
is because i'm not dealing with a blank slate your
mind is already full of 20 or 30 or 50
years of constructions and programming from your culture and your
society and you don't even know that that's there i
mean you know it's there in the in the abstract
sense but you don't know the full detail of it
in the full extent of it if you did it
would make you vomit immediately you would be disgusted with
yourself you would have an existential crisis so you have
all these defense mechanisms against acknowledging and admitting and even
seeing the construction process occurring and you don't even know
what these defense mechanisms are i do know what they
are because i've studied them for years within myself and
within others and so i'm trying to share some of
them with you the problem that is though that you're
playing this game of construction therefore the most threatening thing
to you is any kind of deconstruction therefore if what
i'm teaching is mostly deconstruction which is what i teach
then your mind is going to be very resistant to
that and you're going to have the full power of
your intelligence of your mind is going to be devoted
towards preventing the deconstruction from happening and so one of
the ways that the mind creates a very solid construction
such that it feels so real that most people can't
even begin to entertain the idea that they're constructing this
whole thing right here it's like leo my mind is
not constructing what are you talking about if i was
constructing reality how come i constructed this shitty life well
precisely because you're constructing it unconsciously but leo if if
i'm constructing reality how come i don't look so beautiful
how come i look ugly well you believe you look
ugly that's something you constructed you don't see your own
beauty because society has created constructions that you adopted unconsciously
as to what beauty is and now you're operating on
those constructions without even realizing it so you can't even
see your own beauty so you see anyways the way
the mind creates this very lifelike construction is simply through
sheer quantity it's not just a couple of constructions it's
a construction wrapped inside of more constructions wrapped inside of
more constructions inside of more constructions and it's just this
never-ending twisted tangle of thousands of constructions all buttressing each
other creating a sort of structure that seems to hold
it's really a house of cards but you can find
some some pictures and videos of people creating some amazing
houses of cars look it up on youtube you can
find some some like masterful houses of cards being built
and they look very stable and they look very impressive
but that's because every card is supporting every other card
in this way such that it it creates a sort
of a sense of integrity but it's not really integrity
it's a it's a fiction it's a fantasy in the
same way that if you want to write a really
good novel sci-fi or fantasy what do you need to
write a really compelling novel that that draws you in
and is so lifelike and is so immersive that you
just get lost in it for weeks you forget that
you even have a normal life you stop going to
work you stop seeing your children you stop having sex
because this novel is just so engrossing you can't stop
until you finish it how do you do that as
a writer a lot of detail a lot of juicy
detail you're constructing an entire world the sort of lord
of the rings world let's say where you have all
these different creatures and monsters and people and characters and
they're doing things and it's dramatic and it's interesting and
it's all interconnected and you can draw connections between like
oh this person is related to that person and he
came from you know he was the son and daughter
of this person there and this and this and you
build backstory and backstory and future stories and then you
you do you know backwards projections future projections flashbacks and
flash forwards and you combine all this stuff together and
it becomes as though it's its own world and then
to deconstruct that becomes very challenging because see like let's
say i say oh well you know uh let's say
you're really into lord of the rings or something and
i come to you and say oh you but but
frodo is just a character he's a fictional character and
you say no he he's not what are you talking
about leo frodo frodo is so real he has parents
i can name him his parents his parent his mom
was so and so and his dad was so-and-so and
i say yeah but that's still part of a story
and you say well no they're not part of a
story lord lord of the rings has this like entire
continent and world like middle earth it's an actual place
i don't know what it is it's a planet or
something i'm not familiar very deeply with the lord of
the rings uh lore but you can i'm sure there's
a deep lower there you can kind of go deeper
and deeper into the lore and in fact there's probably
a bunch of fan fiction lore even on top of
what was written in the books because you know people
go wild with this stuff and they start inventing stuff
they probably have invented the name for frodo's mother and
father and where she came from and where he came
from and how they met and how they had sex
and all this and where they're living and where middle
earth came from what it was evolution was its entire
history and and see when i start to try to
deconstruct for you frodo you're going to drag in the
entire fiction of the lord of the rings universe and
you're going to keep pointing to every fiction in there
to explain why frodo is real you're going to say
the world is real i say no the world is
not real you say but it is because people eat
and people [ __ ] and people die so it's
a real world but i'd say but yeah but that's
fictional and you say no but it's not fictional i've
read about you know um this character here he died
and then that character there was born and then this
happened there and this happened there there's a rich history
of it and i said yeah but that's all stories
and you say no it's not stories because you're so
bought into it because it feels so lifelike you say
there's trees and there's rocks and there's mountains and there's
cities and they have names and it's so life like
there's politics going on and there's a battle between good
and evil and this and that and like i mean
this is what game of thrones did so well perhaps
an even better example than lord of the rings because
lord of the rings actually isn't that realistic whereas game
of thrones like really took lord of the rings and
it made it so politically realistic and so kind of
brutal and bloody and like you can imagine living in
that world and people do and that's the whole appeal
of this kind of fantasy stuff the mind loves imagination
that's because it's constructing everything imagination is the only business
that the universe is in there's no other business in
town reality is imagination various gradations of it you're imagining
this whole thing right now see that's a very simple
explanation if you ask me what is reality i'll just
say well it's all just imagination and you say oh
well yeah i mean but that doesn't explain anything right
because you're [ __ ] ignorant you have no foundation
for what that means in the same way that if
you ask if you ask me well what is you
know you ask a scientist well what is uh what
is matter and energy they can say well e equals
mc square and you look at that and you say
well this doesn't tell me anything it's just a stupid
equation it says nothing right because to understand what e
equals mc square means you need 12 years of school
and then probably another few years of university you need
to understand every term in that equation e m c
squared what do these things mean what does the equal
sign mean and then and what did and how does
that explain these you know deeper things about the nature
of space time people take all this for granted people
expect easy quick simple explanations for things but reality is
too complicated for that so you have to decide do
you really want to understand these questions if you do
then how serious are you these are serious life and
death questions that's why they're powerful and important and worth
investigating if all you have to devote is five minutes
a day then you're not a serious person you're not
serious about living and therefore how great can your life
be it can't be great because you can't understand what
life is with that little of a commitment you take
life so for granted that you just want to cruise
through it via the path of least resistance in a
lazy way well if that's your attitude then your results
you better expect mediocre results because life is such a
thing that you only get from it what you put
into it most people are so lazy investing in their
lives that they're poor their whole lives and i don't
mean financially poor although of course most people are i
mostly mean they're spiritually bankrupt philosophically bankrupt epistemically and metaphysically
bankrupt psychologically bankrupt to not be bankrupt in any of
these fields you would need to be serious about them
first you and then to be serious about them you
need to be serious about life but you're not very
serious about life are you you just want some sort
of quick easy answers well consider the possibility that the
quick easy answers you want are exactly the ones that
are so shallow that they would not significantly improve your
life which is why your life has not significantly improved
how much your life improves is going to depend precisely
proportionately to the depth of the questions you ask how
deeply you want to live your life and how much
passion and seriousness and effort you're willing to put into
it you can't become great at mathematics if you're uninterested
in mathematics and you're only willing to invest five minutes
a day into mathematics you're not serious and so that's
the result you get you're a poor mathematician well all
of that works the same way when it comes to
consciousness psychedelics philosophy metaphysics epistemology psychology sociology politics government relationships
emotions love sex you only get what you put in
it's a very fair structure actually why should reality give
you more than you want for your own self why
should reality cater to somebody who's so lazy and undisciplined
and unserious and shallow as you there's actually a very
deep reason for why you only get what you give
from reality and that's because you are reality you're constructing
reality there's not some other source within reality like a
god sitting up in the clouds that can shower you
with boons and toys and other things that you want
you are reality if you don't create it for yourself
if you don't furnish yourself with what you want then
you won't get it if you don't have a deep
desire to understand then you won't understand precisely because you
are reality for reality to understand itself it has to
care about itself if you don't care about reality you
therefore don't also care about yourself and if you don't
care about yourself then how can you have a good
life how can you expect reality to care for you
when you don't care for it i mean the logic
of this is so clear and it's so simple the
problem is that you've spent the majority of your life
as a sheep as a human sheep just sleep walking
through life going through the motions following the herd not
thinking deeply about anything taking everything for granted and not
fundamentally you're just not serious about life i mean that's
what it really boils down to you're just not serious
about life that's your problem and things for you will
not change until you become serious about life when you
really become serious about life you will gladly devote hours
and hours into studying and reading and following up on
this stuff you will look at my book list you
will buy every book on my book list you will
read the 200 plus books on my book list you
will devour them you will take notes on them you
will underline them you will read them multiple times you
will ask me serious questions rather than just trolling and
other [ __ ] that you do you will ask
serious questions you will reach out you will find serious
people serious teachers who have serious things to say and
you will appreciate them and you will go on this
journey and you will seriously study and you will do
the work you will contemplate you will do your homework
and you will do it all on your own without
any support whatsoever from your society and from your culture
and from your friends and from your family and from
your professors and from scientists from academics from anybody you
will do it all on your own that is intrinsic
motivation right there but how many people will do that
one in a hundred thousand maybe again it goes back
to that example that we're really poor at developing our
own foundation really what's easy in life is getting to
a place where you're born and then you get to
a place where the center of gravity of your culture
takes you and then once you're at the center of
gravity of your culture rising above that becomes increasingly harder
and the higher you want to rise above the center
of gravity of your culture will require more and more
independence of thought from you more and more discipline effort
seriousness purpose vision motivation and the ability to not get
distracted by and discouraged by the rest of the herd
because the higher you try to go from the herd
the more they will call to drag you back in
and they will use every trick in the book they
will demonize the sources and teachers that you're using to
advance yourself they will get you to question why you're
doing this at all and that it's not important they
will invite you to have sex with them and to
sleep with them and to eat food with them and
to go to church with them and to read the
books they read and to watch the movies that they
watch and they will demonize your goal if you share
your goal or vision with them they'll say oh well
that's so crazy that's ridiculous why would anybody want to
do that in fact that's evil they will call it
satanic or they'll say it's dangerous well they're right it
is dangerous it's dangerous to venture outside the hurt so
it's really all up to you how much do you
want out of life you're going to get exactly what
you put into it do you want a lot put
in a lot if you take life for granted you're
not going to invest a lot and you won't get
a lot and you'll be just like the herd like
everybody else you'll be mediocre and if you care about
the deep questions such as what is reality what is
truth what is consciousness what is love what is god
are we living in a simulation what is science is
science true what role does the mind play in constructing
reality what is the function of philosophy what is religion
about where did religion come from why does it exist
what are psychedelics what is awakening how do i live
the good life how do i be a good person
why is there evil in the world what is my
purpose in life what is the meaning of life what's
the point of life does life have a point how
do we know anything at all if you want to
ask serious questions like this then you got to be
prepared for serious work for serious answers and you have
to be aware that the answers could frighten you and
that it's not just a matter of doing a bunch
of homework to get the answers the reason that these
questions are rarely answered is not because they can't be
answered it's because the process of answering these questions is
so threatening that very few humans go down the roads
necessary to get the answers and when the answers are
revealed to them they don't have the stomach to accept
the answers they reject the answers they are scared of
the answers they deny the answers they avoid the answers
they run away from the answers they demonize the answers
it's not that the answers don't exist you can answer
every single one of these questions absolutely definitively but do
not expect the answers to be spoon fed to you
by me or anybody else you have to work for
the answers the answers will only be as good as
your intentions to get them your seriousness your commitment your
passion your curiosity these are the bottlenecks you are the
bottleneck i am not the bottleneck in your journey of
understanding existence you are so what are you willing to
do about it you
