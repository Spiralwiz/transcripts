hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about self-acceptance how to
stop beating yourself up and tearing yourself apart I want
to show you how to practice self-acceptance this is a
very counterintuitive thing because generally we don't allow ourselves to
accept ourselves this comes as a very counterintuitive move and
I want to help you to do that here with
a guided visualization but before we get into the visualization
let me give just a little bit of background a
little bit of theory here on what we're talking about
practicing self-acceptance this is one of these things that is
like the softer more feminine side of personal development and
usually a lot of us especially guys we get into
personal development and it's all about what we can accomplish
and what we can get and what we can create
and a success and all this kind of like alpha
guy stuff right we want more confidence and we want
this and what we do is we kind of ignore
the softer side the feminine side so to speak of
personal development and one of these things is self-acceptance this
is really important and it's going to feel at first
when you try to do self-acceptance it's going to feel
fruity and it's going to feel soft and it's going
to feel like oh man this is all the stuff
that I don't want I don't want to be this
that does self-acceptance or practices self-love but this is something
I really can would converge you to reconsider because this
one practice right here that I'm going to guide you
through can produce massive massive results in your life think
of all the results that you've gotten at the gym
in the last year or in your business and last
year or at work in the last year and now
imagine that self-acceptance just this one practice of self-acceptance is
going to get you more results than all of that
combined the real results that count are the inner growth
results and that's what self-acceptance practice really goes to the
core of right we're not trying to solve your mood
problems or your your neuroses here through some sort of
external fix or some sort of behavioral change that stuff
has its place but also self-acceptance has its place just
going inside and looking for the things and aspects of
yourself that you have been denying for years and decades
and just being open to them and just getting those
different parts of you communicating together that's very very powerful
it's very powerful because there's something you've probably resisted for
decades and you're not even aware that you've been resisting
this we all have what we might call sins and
I don't mean that in some religious sense of sins
like you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do that
I mean sins in the sense that we look at
our own personality we look at our life we look
at our behavior and of course we want certain aspects
of our life to be different we don't like how
we get angry at somebody we don't like how we
criticize people too much we don't like that were judgmental
we don't like that we're jealous and all these kinds
of things but of course you know we try to
hide these things that we don't like about ourselves and
when we do that that makes us disintegrated literally disintegrated
this integration means you're broken up and fragmented into multiple
parts so that's what you've got going on in your
mind is you've got like all these different aspects to
you there's the aspect of you that wants to go
to work real hard and then there's aspect of you
that wants to stay in bed and just be lazy
and then there's the aspect of you that wants to
have a great relationship instead of work and then there's
the aspect of you that after you've spent a lot
of time in a relationship and had some great sex
then you want to go back to work so you
have all these kind of like conflicting forces and what
ultimately needs to happen is you need to somehow integrate
all these things together so that you can become a
a calm grounded well-rounded human being this is how we
get rid of our neuroses is by doing this and
a lot of times if you're coming at personal development
from a kind of a masculine perspective then your your
tendency is to want to kind of brute force your
way through these pro just through action it's like well
give me a technique or an outer behavior that I
can do that will just eliminate all this stuff you
don't really want to kind of like look inside and
open yourself up because it's somewhat of a feminine activity
right opening yourself up and kind of surrendering and this
is actually very very necessary if you want to develop
into your full masculinity you're not going to be fully
masculine just by acting stoic and alpha and macho you
want to open yourself up more so the key here
is that these sins that you have whatever they are
maybe you're not happy with how much money you have
or you really don't like your performance at work or
your performance in the bedroom or whatever most of us
what we intuitively do is we say well this is
all bad stuff we label it bad and we try
to move away from it but here's the key insight
and the counterintuitive move instead of hating your sins which
only makes them stronger you want to love your sins
to death love your sins to death that's the key
insight here the counterintuitive move and this is somewhat fruity
feeling at first but once you start doing more and
more of it you see how great it really works
now one common objection that I hear when I tell
people this stuff and I've experienced this myself when I
first started try and doing it is that the objection
goes like well Leo if I just accept myself as
I am and I accept my lazy side and I
accept my my bad side and my angry side accept
all these parts then what is there to develop aren't
I done just sitting there as myself and now I'm
satisfied so to speak and now why am I even
improving myself what is there to improve so this is
kind of the paradox of self-acceptance versus achievement and self-development
you really need to do both at the same time
I'm not telling you just to accept yourself and then
do nothing I'm telling you to accept yourself first of
all the act of accepting yourself is a doing this
is actually something that you have been doing so if
you want you can think of this as a technique
it's like an inner game technique so you can leave
it that way so actually you are growing you're developing
yourself but you're doing it kind of on the inside
in a more softer manner but also it's not that
you just accept yourself and then you don't get off
your couch and do anything actually what's going to happen
is that once you accept yourself fully only then do
you start to tap into authentic motivation right now a
lot of you are motivated by inauthentic motivation neurotic motivation
which means that you hate some aspect of yourself like
you hate how you look in the mirror so you
go to the gym and you hate how little money
of anybody cast so you go and you work real
hard that's a that's a very kind of crude form
of living life and a crude form of motivation a
crude form of self-development it works when that's all you've
got but eventually you have to evolve past that and
you have to get to these higher levels and these
higher levels it's not about moving away from things it's
actually about moving just towards the things that you authentically
genuinely are desiring in your life and that's exactly what's
gonna happen when you accept all the parts of yourself
then you're going to give yourself the space and the
freedom to then change those things that you want to
really change and that's going to come from a much
more authentic place than a place of neurosis which is
where you've been coming from probably for the years so
that's the theory let's now actually have you do the
practice I'm going to guide you through the visualization so
this will take probably 15 or 20 minutes go ahead
and isolate yourself make sure you have time to sit
through this whole thing this will be worth your time
I promise all right so go ahead sit with your
back up straight just listening to me and get in
the present moment and close your eyes and keep your
eyes closed throughout the duration of this visualization take time
to just relax your body and get into the present
moment get in touch with the feelings in your body
become aware of your thoughts and your breathing and all
the tactile sensations and the temperature of your body and
as you sit there with your eyes closed just relax
and take a nice deep inhale and then exhale nice
and slow at your own pace good get very focused
and centered on what's happening in the present moment right
now the sound of my voice any other sounds that
might be around you the sensations that are affecting your
body right now get in touch with all those notice
that right now in the present moment you are sitting
there you're this one you're this thing that's sitting there
right now listening to me put your attention on that
thing that you are good now I want you to
bring to mind a strong feeling of love that you've
ever experienced for anything could be nature could be video
games could be sex could be food could be a
family member of yours doesn't matter just stir up a
strong feeling of love that you've ever had for anything
in life pick a specific thing and now what I
want you to do is I want you to isolate
that feeling of love so that there's just like this
cloud of love that you're feeling independent of the thing
itself independent of the video game with the sex or
the food just get the feeling of love itself right
now into your body and feel it in your mind
and in your heart and anywhere else that you would
feel it in your body it might help you to
remember a time in the past to bring up a
memory where you felt loved okay good so now you've
got that cloud of feeling of love and it's in
your body now what I want you to do is
I want you to apply that love to the one
that you are sitting there right now in the present
moment so just take it and spread it all throughout
your body and apply it to you so in your
mind tell yourself that this is for me this is
for this one that's sitting here don't ask how do
I do this just do it just give yourself love
right now just give yourself love unconditionally for no reason
whatsoever do not look for a justification of why you
deserve love just give it to yourself with no strings
attached relax your body and just allow for the love
to flow to you good now we're going to repeat
this several times in different contexts what I want you
to do now is to bring to mind this one
who is sitting there who gets angry sometimes this one
that's you this one who gets angry now give that
one love give the angry part of you love just
infuse it with love don't ask how just do it
good now bring to mind this one who is sitting
there who has been treated unfairly in the past haven't

about it we'll just bring that one to mind who's
been treated unfairly and give that one love give the
wounded part of you love good now bring to mind
this one who is sitting there who has treated other
people unfairly in the past haven't you treated that other
people unfairly in the past just as they have treated
you unfairly haven't you wounded other people and isn't that
something you don't like about yourself is that you are
capable of wounding others so just bring that one to
mine who has wounded others and give that one your
love good now bring to mind this one who is
sitting there who has been critical of others that part
of you that's critical all the time that's judgmental bring

still closed you're very calm and centered and in the
present moment take all those parts of you that we
went through and give all of them your full love
and integrate them all together and own every single part
of you tie them all together as though you're tying
them all together with a string into a bundle that
bundle is you realize that you exist in this very
moment it feels to you that you exist and if
you notice existence makes no judgments and assigns no values
and places no guilt or shame on your existence does
it the very fabric of existence we might say accepts
you exactly as you are because it is you all
existence cares about is being it doesn't care about what
you've done or how you should be in the future
or whether you're not good enough now the way that
you are you're being all existence cares about is being
however it is it is an existence is never wrong
it is it either is or it isn't but it's
never is and then also wrong notice that existence itself
doesn't need you to be any other way than how
you presently are you may want yourself to be some
other way but existence does not we might say that
existence gives you unconditional love because you simply are existing
now give yourself the unconditional love and acceptance that existence
gives you every moment of your life good that is
the process of accepting yourself go ahead and open your
eyes come on back alert and refreshed and awake and
we're done keep doing this process throughout the day over
the next week just check in with yourself and remember
that whatever is going on in your life that you're
not satisfied with just remember to stop for a moment
when it's happening if you can be conscious enough and
just to remember that you need to give yourself more
love and acceptance and compassion rather than browbeating yourself and
trying to act out from a place of neurosis and
resistance against this sin of yours whatever sin you have
loved that sin to death what will happen is that
your sins will all melt away with love you don't
need to fight them you don't need to slay these
big dragons and hydras because every head you cut off
a Hydra a new one just comes up and grows
out of that stump and that's a battle you will
never win but if you just accept these things what
will happen is that you'll just soften to them and
then naturally these things will just melt away and fall
apart they'll just dissolve before your eyes but that can
take some time does the process could take weeks or
months to do to work but it definitely works as
long as you are conscious enough to remember to just
keep doing it you can always come back and re-watch
this and get grounded again in your own self-acceptance that's
it I'm signing off go ahead post your comments down
below please click the like button right now share this
episode with a friend and lastly come check out my
website actualize that Rug right here I've got a free
newsletter there that keeps you up to date with all
the information and concepts you need to know about how
to master your life this is the process of self
actualization what I'm sharing with you here this is not
some juvenile eyal self-improvement tactics this is very very deep
stuff I'm trying to share with you the most profound
things that I've discovered in my life that I'm researching
every single day and practicing every single day for myself
to live the most profound passionate life that I can
discover and I've done a lot of research to find
the principles the principles you need to know for how
to do this a lot of expensive was a very
counterintuitive you wouldn't ordinarily think of using these kinds of
principles in fact usually you do the exact opposite and
think that you're doing good in fact you're shooting yourself
in the foot so I'm I'm really excited to show
you some of these counterintuitive principles and also show you
the application of these principles because a lot of times
what happens in personal development is that teachers will talk
about principles in theory but then they don't actually take
it to the nitty-gritty how do you actually apply it
how do you make this stuff very practical so my
thing is taking the abstract connecting it with the concrete
and showing you how to do it piece by piece
by piece these are episodes if you watch these episodes
every single week and that's what the newsletter if you
sign up to it helps you to do then you're
staying on track and over the next couple of years
just an hour a week you're watching these episodes take
a little bit of action doing some of these assignments
some of these visualizations and you will not believe how
much your perspective on life will transform in just a
couple of years not to mention ten years what you
could do in ten years with this information is absolutely
extraordinary you wouldn't believe me if I told you all
the things that could happen in your life powerful changes
can happen I hope you can see the value of
that and I'm excited to show you more soon so
