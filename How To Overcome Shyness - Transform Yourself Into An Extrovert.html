Hey! This is Leo for actualized.org And in this quick
self-help segment we're gonna talk about How to overcome shyness.
So what I'm going to do, I'm not gonna go
into this topic completely in depth Beceause this is a
deep topic. But what I'm gonna do is I'm provide
you with some really practical things that you can start
doing right now to get this problem handled in your
life. So let's talk about this. Shyness. There's various forms
of shyness that we can talked about. Shyness in school,
shyness in business, shyness in your dating life shyness in
your social life with friends. So let's brake down each
one of these and give you cuple of practical techniques
you could say tactics that you can use to start
overcoming this shyness problem. First thing. And this is gonna
be deeper idea is that it's all in your mind.
This idea of shyness. You gotta get off your mind
that you're shy tipe of person. You're not shy tipe
of person, You're someone who's been shy in the past.
That doesn't mean you have to be shy rest of
your life. or that you are born shy. This is
a really silly and really dangerous idea to buy in
into this concept that you are somehow "A shy person"
"A shy personality tipe" An extreme introvert And that you
can't have success. In fact, what I can inpire you
with my story hopefully is that I was extremely introverted.
And I still consider my self to be a really
extreme intorvert. But! I've been able to make lot of
progress in that to the point where if I'm interacting
now most people cannot tell that I'm introverted In fact
they think that I'm extrovert. because I worked on my
social skills. So first thing you got to realise that
this is a problem that you can totally handle. This
is not something that you have to live with rest
of your life. So get that into your mind right
now I want that seed planted. And then we can
find ways to make it sproud to make it grow.
So, let's talk about this What are some actual things
that you can do Well, to really overcome shyness You
have to start to overcome your self-image and you have
to start to overcome this idea that people are looking
at you and that people are really caring what are
you doing. The problem, the fundamental problem is that you
care to much about what other people think of you
And that is something that you're gonna have to numb
down throught a process progressive desensitization. Is that you're gonna
go throught And whatever technique that I'm give you here
is you're gonna numb yourself down to this idea that
it's important what people think of you. 'cause right now
you care to much and maybe because you care so
much about how people think of you you stutter or
you don't make eye contact or you don't go up
and introduce yourself or you're afraid of approaching someone putting
yourself out on line because you either fear rejection you
fear embarrassment you fear that people will laugh at you
you fear that people think that you're weird or any
number of these kind of doom and gloom scenarios. the
fact is that's something that you've constructed in your mind
and I know because I have this I've had really
bad in the past. and I still have it in
some degree now It's still hard for me sometimes go
up to stranger and introduce myself Or to go on
the line and go you know like Hit on the
girl in a club or in a bar that's still
challenging So, first of all, realise that you're totally normal
And that there are a lot, a lot people in
the world millions of people caught in this situation And
the reason is they haven't gone in there and they
haven't numb themselves down to it. So the only way
that you're really overcome shyness is by actually going out
and interacting with people. You can't really avoid that. What
you can do is kind of build up gradually so
that is not as painful or scary as it would
be if you just for example went up and you
had to give speech in front of a thousand people
in an auditorium and that would be so scary that
you probably trow up and you would never do it.
Whereas if you start yourself a small and baby step
your way up over long period of time then you
can get this problem handled. So for example. If you
are shy in the context of work like you're not
asserting yourself at work and you know that you're that
other people are more involved their voices being heard more
in group meetings etc. what you gotta do is to
start opening yourself up start very small what can you
do what's one thing you can do well you could
maybe find one colleague or two colleagues and just make
friends to them and start building up relationships with them
and maybe you could start going to luch or meeting
up wiht them during cofee breaks or at the watercooler
and just start chatting them up it's something that you
can have to you have train yourself to do and
you have to push you comfort zone a little bit
'cause naturally you're not gonna want go and just have
some idle chitchat with somebody at the water cooler or
maybe ask them to lunch maybe what i they reject
you you have to put yourself out on a limb
It's a small limb the fact is that most people
will not reject you you'll be suprised how good they
respond to you And if you're socially uncalibrated, they'll still
respond well to you in most cases. and even if
they don't again this goes back to the problem of
Why you care so much? Why you're care so much
that someone doesn't want to go to luch with you
or snubs you at the water cooler it's not that
big of a deal and you have to get yourself
accustomed to that 'cause right now if you're very sensitive
to it if you have go a thin skin then
that's gonna be paniful But you got to put yourself
out there and try it so start small and then
once for example you've got some lunch relationships bulit you're
going out with people at lunch maybe then you're going
out first with one other person so just the two
of you then maybe you inveite a thirt person then
maybe you hold a a weekly lunch With, you know,
with your team of ten people or five people. And
all o sudden you start kind of hobnobbing with them
interacting with them in kind o a more casual lunch
environment. Then all the sudden when you're work in a
group meeting, then you can be more assertive there. And
it'll just transfer over and you'll get better and better
at it. It's something you have to pratice. That's the
work situation. How about shyness with the opposite sex? How
do you overcome that problem? That's something that I've been
working on for the last few years Really big problem
or me because I really wasn't involved with relationships or
dating when I was growing up in hish school and
in college. Because I just simply chose not to something
that was not on my priority list I've used distraction
for me. And that came to bite me in the
ass because Well, Then I realised that eventually I have
to get involved in it and now I don't have
the skills and the experience that I would've developed how
I've been in that environment Plus I would have more
more opportunity to get exposed to it Through school and
college was a good place to get exposed. So, if
you are scared there and you are shy You have
put yourself on line again. If you're guy, go out
to bars go out to clubs, hang out with other
guy friends and see what they're doing. and copy them.
and go approach girls. and yes, it's gonna be painful
it's gonna be scary, but you have to do it.
that's the only way you're gonna get that part of
your life handled. That can be really well process that
I can't go into here but just realise that you
have to go out there and put yourselfout on the
line. and the worst case scenario is you get shot
down and you know what? It literally does not feel
nearly as bad as you make it out to be
in your mind. So you just have to go out
there and put yourself on the line. For women, Women
don't pursue guys as much as guys pursue girls so
it's little bit different. But again. It's still the same
situation. If you wanna be moreassertive if you wanna be
more authentic you have to go out there and put
yourself on the line. So start small, and then build
your way up. The same situation applies to like your
social circle of friends You just have to push yourself
to do little bit more in each interaction. So for
example if you go out with your girlfirend to lunch,
and you feel like you're fifth wheel in the group
and you're not serving much of a purpose and you're
not really assertive and you're kind o meek Then, you
gotta realise that situation and in that moment step it
up. And try to push it little bit. Try to
get outside of your comfort zone and do that every
time you're in an interaction and eventually you're gonna open
up. you're gonna start to open up. I've actually found
a really good way to brake your shyness. is to
go and talk to cashiers for example when you're buying
your groceries or you're buying your gas or you're at
a store and you're buying something. talk to the cashiers.
and chat them up 'cause they're always friendly they're boards
they have nothing to do and they're not gonna reject
you. so they're pretty much have to talk to you
they have to be nice So go up and talk
with them and kind of force yourself to actually start
conversation. Don't just say: "Oh, hi how you doing" and
then kind of ended at that actually like maybe ask
them a question or tell them somethig about yourself. What
I've really found extroverts do is it's not so much
that they as a lot of quiestions, is that they're
really so comfortable being themselves. And being expressive that they
draw you in with the magnetism So, what they do
is they talk a lot about themselves. And it's usually
like stupid stuff that if you're an introvert you would
ask yourself and say why would you even talk about
that. but fact is that it for an extrovert it
doesn't metter they just blurt it out they don't have
those filters in plase like we do. like introverts. So,
for example if you're standing there in a grocery, grocery
store and you're checking out maybe you make a little
comment as to, you know, what the clerk is wearing.
And maybe you poke fun it. at that person. Or
you just make a slight little comment or you mentioned
something that you saw on TV or in the news.
you mentioned sports you mentioned something that's on your mind.
you can even just mention how you're feeling. you can
walk in there it doesn't matter you have to pretend
to be happy, you can walk in there and say
"I've had a shitty day" "I've lost my keys" and
then "I ran a gas" "And now I'm here at
the grocery store and you didn't have the thing that
I wanted" "And this sucks" And you can just say
that and the other person it doesn't matter even if
it's negative when you're saying they'll still respond to it
and that'll actually spark up a conversation. then you can
also ask questions. and get a conversation going that way
so start small and then just build your way up.
And make little habit doing that all the time. I
found that that's like probably on of the best ways
to break out of your shyness. Start talking to people
tat you're interacting with. In the real world. as you're
out about doing your errands. kind of force yoursel to
get those conversations to be little bit longer. Usually we
try to like cut things down we don't talk to
the waitress we don't talk to our bank clerk We
don't talk to the gas station attendant 'cause now like
we say "oh, what's the point?" But if you're introvert
there is a big point you talk because first of
all, you're developing the skill and second o all you
should notice that you're actually gonna enjoj your day mourn
your interactions more when you're actually having and stiking up
these conversations. Because sometimes they'll strike up conversation and you'll
find that's a lot more interesting Then you realise it
could be. like you start on a topic like weather
wich is boring and all sudden the cashier will tell
you "Oh, she just got merried" or, you know he'll
tell you that "Oh, he just bought this thing" and
it's like something cool maybe you can add some value
to your life. maybe you can add some value to
his life. and it ends up being a win-win so
those are some practical techniques I think some other things
that you can do is you gotta immerse yourself in
groups of people. put youself into organisations or little groups
or you can actually go out there and interact with
people. Big problem nowdayswhen everyone is on the internet and
locked up at home is that we're just too isolated
so maybe that's the problem that you have. Is that
you don't have enough people to interact with so way
to break up that shyness take the initiative and join
a group o some kind One group that you can
join for example is Toastmasters. Which is a public speaking
group wich will also help you overcome the fear of
public speaking. It's a really friendly environment they have Toastmasters
literally all across the world in every city. Hundreds of
these organisations, thousands of them little small clubs that you
meet with once a week and you just talk it's
very friendly very supportive easy group to join. And it's
also very cheap. And then there are other groups like
this. Find a group that that really holds and aligns
with your interests. so you can go to someplace like
meetup.com and you can search for meetup groups. literally on
any topic on any subject from overcoming addictions to, you
know, people that are into science fiction to people that
are into music to people that are into philosophy and
like talk about books, so you can find these different
groups usually these are very supportive friendly environments especially it's
very easy to get into them beacause they're aligned with
your interests so if you like to read books of
a certain kind maybe you like to read scinece fiction
books you can find a group of people every week
and talk about science fiction books. and break out of
your shell that way and that's really good way to
do it so you gotta get yourself involved with people
be out there also if you've got friends, go out
with them at night if they're going out to bars
or go out to clubs they're going out to laser
tag or some sor of social events. go with them!
I know as an introvert there's strong tendency to just
want to say "No that's something I really want to
do, something I like to do" You can't really ask
yourself Do you really wand to overcome your shyness? or
do you want to be plagued by for the rest
o your life? Because I can guarantee you that it
will hold you back in so many ways . That's
why I had to overcome it It' will hold you
back in your dating life. It will hold you back
with quality friends which really affects your happiness level in
life if will hold you back from business opportuinities it
will hold you back at work it will hold you
back at school just so many different ways you don't
want those areas in your life to be stifled. You
wanna be expressive and you're gonna be much, so much
happier When you get rid o this this whole shyness
issue. You're gonna be much less self-conscious. You're gonna be
relaxed and having fun. But realize it's gonna take you
a while to get there. and best way to start
is to get yourself out the door. Get out of
the house Talk to people. Put yourself on the line
a little bit more a little bit more each time.
all right. That's going to do it 'cause this is
