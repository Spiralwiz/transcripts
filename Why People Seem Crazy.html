it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode I'm
going to talk about why people seem crazy [Music] you
this topic here is a lot deeper and more profound
than you might initially think just from hearing the title
this is one of those foundational topics what I want
to do here is I want to convince you to
change your model of people and you do have a
model of people you use this model to explain why
people are the way they are you also use this
model to dismiss certain people certain individuals or certain groups
of people entirely and by doing so you rob yourself
of some important understanding and also you agitate yourself so
this is an important and quite practical matter to look
into but we have to look into it at a
very fundamental level there are two basic models that you
can use to think about people one is that people
are all the same and the other is that people
are all different most people hold the first one they
hold that most people are the same and this creates
problems for them I used to hold this model myself
for a long time and just in the last year
or two I've had to make changes I had to
change my model because I've studied so much diverse stuff
so many diverse perspectives that it's no longer tenable for
me to hold that all people are the same it
just doesn't hold up to empirical facts especially when you
start to study the edge cases of human beings this
model sits very deeply in your mind usually you don't
think about it it's there as a default position and
of course our modern 21st century culture likes to tell
us that everybody is equal because we have this drive
towards democracy towards egalitarianism and that's a good thing we
don't want to go backwards on that but one of
the bad consequences of that is we start to look
at everybody as though they are wired like us and
this is an assumption which turns out to be false
so let's explore this sameness model I'm going to call
sameness model and then I'm going to call the other
one the difference model throughout this episode so let's explore
the sameness model and what it really entails and what
its full consequences are the problem is that we don't
really understand the consequences of some of these paradigms that
we adopt unconsciously the sameness bottle basically says that hey
I'm a person here's how reality is for me here's
how I feel here's what happiness feels like here's what
sadness feels like here's what anger feels like here's the
stuff that angers me here's the stuff that outrages me
here's the stuff that hurts me all this kind of
stuff and then I basically think that everyone else must
be the same way because hey we're all human beings
it kind of makes sense that human beings basically all
function the same after all we do communicate with each
other and we're able to make that work so the
famous model says that hey all those other people out
there my friends my family my co-workers employees all this
kind of stuff that they're all basically wired like I
am and that makes sense in a sort of naive
way another assumption of this famous model is we assume
that we all live in the same physical reality we
assume that there is one canonical physical reality and that
human beings tap into that reality in the same way
and so that this one reality is responsible for all
our sensations and perceptions and that's why everything fits together
so well we can communicate with each other and we
can do stuff together we can coordinate this because we
live in the same reality that's a deep assumption here
it should already rings some bells for you that we'll
need to make an assumption that's this grand you better
have some proof to back that up because it might
not be the case that reality works that way we
can't take that for granted and then the famous model
says so if people are wired like me but they
don't act like me and they don't think like me
then that means there's something wrong with those people they
are misbehaving because for them to behave properly they would
have to act like me you're using yourself as the
measure the metric the yardstick and then what you do
is when you find people who are really misbehaving you
call those people crazy criminal evil stupid lazy or even
animals you will put them into a separate category from
yourself you're not going to give the dignity of being
human to those people you'll call them savages or barbarians
and of course humankind has done this for for millennia
we know that from history books but also notice that
we still do it today if someone acts completely out
of the norm we will call them one of these
dismissing labels we have to because if we hold the
model that everyone is basically the same the only way
that can work with empirical reality is if we deny
and cut off the edge cases of human beings and
this becomes a problem because these edge cases sometimes are
not just merely edge cases like one or two crazy
individuals sometimes this is thousands of individuals millions of individuals
so we have to be very careful about that it
shows us that our model is too limited for the
available data set that we're trying to explain and one
of the things that I'm really interested in is the
biggest possible understanding that I can have of life and
of course that means I have to understand human beings
and why they act in some of the crazy seeming
ways that they act why do human beings act this
way why do human beings fight why do human beings
argue and debate for hundreds of years and nothing is
resolved why does this happen I'm interested in understanding this
phenomenon and what I've discovered is I can't understand this
phenomenon using the sameness model just does not work now
what about the negative consequences of this model let's consider
these the negative consequence of having this limited famous model
is that it leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of people
it puts us into an adversarial relationship with foreigners and
by foreigners I don't just mean people from third world
countries or some indigenous tribes in the rainforest somewhere of
course those are foreigners to us and usually we crinkle
our nose at their customs and their habits and behaviors
that makes sense but as foreigners I'm talking about something
more broad here I'm talking about anybody who basically isn't
wired to think and behave like you you will consider
that person a foreigner and you will not be able
to successfully interact with that person because you're not going
to be able to appreciate understand their perspective because you
basically believe that all human beings have the same fundamental
perspective on life with minor differences sure you allow for
people to have different beliefs different opinions within reason you
allow that but if someone has a radically different perspective
on reality you your model doesn't allow that you see
and that becomes a problem because in reality people do
have radically different models of reality and perspectives than you
do and a really poignant example of this that I
like is even in your own family this can happen
so for example if you're a father or a mother
and you have a child your child most likely will
come out and have a similar perspective to you and
will be wired mostly like you and in that case
this problem is not so obvious but it's also possible
the child could be wired very differently from you for
example they could have a different sexual orientation than you
do they could have a mental illness they could have
depression or they could have anxiety they could have physical
addiction problems with alcohol with drugs and these things could
be part of their actual brain wiring part of their
brain chemistry they can be schizophrenic they can be [
__ ] so all of these these are just minor
examples of the radically different wiring that your child could
have even though they have the same genetics as you
basically but the way those genetics are expressed can be
very different in practice and what will happen there is
that now you're going to have a problem as the
parent because you're going to try to educate and teach
that child the way that you were taught by your
parents and the way that you think is right but
see you're coming from your own perspective and you're not
going to be able get along with this child because
you're not going to appreciate its needs its fears its
anxieties and its perspective on the world and so of
course that will lead to to a very troubling relationship
and cause you a lot of suffering and now that's
just one point an example now take that and extrapolate
that out and start to see that this could happen
not only with your child but also potentially with your
spouse with other members in your family with distant relatives
with your boss with your employees with the students that
you teach if you're a teacher with your customers with
your favorite role models these people could all be wired
differently than you so making the assumption that they're wired
like you and that you can communicate with them in
the way that you would communicate with yourself or with
a peer group who is very similar to you that
you've surrounded yourself with that's a dangerous mistake you can
see how that can create a lot of friction and
a lot of problems simply because your model doesn't accommodate
for the fact that hey this student that I have
or this particular family member or my boss they really
are living in their own separate bubble their own reality
and I need to be to a certain extent accommodating
of that I don't me to live in their reality
myself but I at least need to be able to
step in their shoes and see life from their perspective
otherwise we're going to have irreconcilable differences and this of
course is where tribalism comes from so tribalism is this
this idea that humans surround themselves with their little tribe
of like-minded people who are all wired the same all
believe the same all act the same and then they
go to war with neighboring tribes who act a little
bit different so this is happening of course on the
collective level and it's leading to a lot of war
and violence everywhere around the world so that's a problem
but then also it's a problem in your personal life
because what this leads to is a lack of acceptance
and compassion for people who are radically different than you
because fundamentally you expect everyone to be like you and
if they're radically apart from you in their opinions and
in their behaviors you're going to think that they are
less than you or perhaps not even human or you're
just going to dismiss them as just some crazy deluded
person not realizing that maybe there's something of value to
understanding their worldview something you could learn there so the
negative consequences here are that it creates frustration for you
it creates anger it creates blaming criticizing creates hostility arguing
debating and ultimately violence and could leave you lead you
to committing evil upon such people to mistreating these people
because as soon as you label someone is crazy or
criminal or an animal or lazy or deluded this now
opens the door for you to treat them very poorly
and we see how this has played its course throughout
human history this is one of the chief causes of
all of the evil that has been perpetrated by human
beings upon human beings is because of this problem right
here and you see that throughout history as humanity has
evolved and we've become more democratic generally speaking our minds
have also opened we've become more tolerant of a cosmopolitan
perspective and as we do that we're able to get
along better and also we feel better about ourselves because
when you are no longer fighting to maintain your little
sameness model of humanity and you open up to a
different larger wider perspective then you no longer need to
be defending your position so much because you've already seen
that your original position I wasn't tenable and you've given
it up and you've broaden your perspective and now your
perspective fits empirical data much better so what's the alternative
to the same astana it's the difference model and what
this entails is recognizing that every individual is genetically unique
recognizing also that there is enormous genetic variety among humans
and not just between races and ethnicities but also genders
but not just genders between individuals so I have an
episode that I shot in the past a while ago
called masculinity versus femininity where I talk about basically a
similar issue that I'm talking about here but there it
was confined to men and women and the whole point
of that episode was to show you that there actually
are physiological and neurological differences between men and women their
brains are actually different physically different and that this results
in different behaviors different psyches different attitudes different emotions and
so forth and that this is very important to understand
if you're going to have a successful relationship with the
opposite sex and that a lot of couples get in
trouble because they expect their opposite sex partner to be
just like them and they try to turn them into
a man or a woman when they need to be
the opposite they need to be allowed to be themselves
so that was an important episode there but now we're
broadening the lessons there and now we're applying this to
all of humanity to individuals on an individual level you
need to start to recognize that every individual is different
people have different personalities people have different body types people
have different strengths and weaknesses people have different desires of
versions and fears people have different abilities motivations different levels
of self-discipline and pain tolerance people have different emotions and
different moods people have different brain chemistry all the dopamine
and serotonin and all the other stuff that's going through
all your neurons that chemical soup that your brain is
steeped in that's different for all people for some people
it can be radically different than it is for you
and you better believe that that's going to change what
they think what they believe what they chase in life
what they run away from in life what they fear
and how they interact with people there's also big differences
between spiritual attunement levels within people it is not the
case that all people are equally spiritually attuned and that's
actually a very important point which I'll come back to
later in this episode because this is a I think
this is critical to understanding the whole field of spirituality
and lastly the difference model means that people actually occupy
different realities than you that's the most dramatic claim of
this model I'm not just saying that people have different
preferences than you and different opinions that's obvious enough I
want you to imagine for a moment changing your model
of human beings such that you admit that rather than
there being one canonical physical reality and all of us
are participating in it that instead each one of us
is living in our own Bob and that there is
no one canonical physical reality out there rather our bubbles
can be more or less aligned with each other and
if they are aligned then that alignment is what we
call physical reality and to the degree that they're not
aligned that's the degree to which we fight and argue
and don't really understand each other and the reason that
that happens is because we keep trying to force this
canonical physical reality to be there without maybe considering the
hey maybe it's not there at all maybe what we
call physical reality is just the stuff that aligns between
all our different bubbles imagine that for a moment that's
a pretty radical thing can you see this shift in
paradigm it's a pretty big shift I'm going to keep
talking you keep thinking about it as I keep talking
because I'm going to present you with some evidence now
for why I think the difference model is a lot
more accurate because I'm making a pretty big claim here
I want you to shift your paradigms but you're not
going to shift your paradigms unless you're presented with the
compelling evidence and personally for me that's what I required
in order to start to shift my paradigm is by
studying and researching especially starting to study some physiological data
out there stuff from the medical fields stuff from clinical
psychology stuff from from medical researchers you start to see
that there's a very strong case to be made for
the difference model it's just that most people don't bother
looking into this with any degree of depth and so
they never are forced to face the empirical facts and
so they think that they are sameness model can account
for them but actually once you face these facts you
see that that's not the case so what is the
evidence for the difference model well first we have the
Big Five aspects of personality so psychologists and researchers have
discovered over the last 50 years that there are basically
five aspects to human personality five really big ones and
these are like axes or spectrums across which we can
map most human beings fairly accurately and this is a
very good predictor of their behavior and the things that
they pursue or avoid in life and this is very
illuminating I haven't talked about this before and this warrants
its own whole separate episode just on these five big
aspects of personality but let me give you a quick
nutshell summary edit here so what are these five aspects
firstly its extraversion and that's a scale so it ranges
from extremely introverted to very extroverted we call that extraversion
the next one is agreeableness the next one is conscientiousness
the fourth one is neuroticism and the fifth one is
openness and all of these are scales now these are
the five big aspects and you might be wondering well
what does agreeableness mean exactly and what does conscientiousness mean
and so forth let me break this down into subcomponents
because actually this is what the researchers have done there's
the five big aspects and then each one has like
five more sub aspects to it which are also scales
that you can plot yourself on and this gives you
a good idea of what the original five aspects are
all about so for extraversion we have friendliness gregariousness assertiveness
activity level excitement-seeking and cheerfulness these are also all scales
and these are the sub components that make up extraversion
and you can rate yourself differently on all these scales
there are actually assessments that you can take there semi-scientific
like assessments you can take them online and you can
map yourself and you can see what are all these
different characteristics and how do you align on those and
you can see how your family members and your spouse
and your girlfriend and boyfriend all this align and then
that becomes very eye-opening and revealing because you can see
the differences there and that explains a lot of why
you don't think alike why don't you behave alike so
the next aspect is agreeableness and this one is broken
up into the following sub components trust morality altruism cooperation
modesty and sympathy next we have conscientiousness and this one
breaks down into self-efficacy orderliness dutifulness achievement striving self-discipline and
cautiousness then we have neuroticism and that one breaks down
into anxiety anger depression self-consciousness in moderation and vulnerability and
lastly we have openness which breaks down into imagination artistic
interest emotionality adventurousness intellect and liberalism so those are quite
a lot of factors now what you can do is
you can take this assessment and I'm actually having on
how to link down below to a free assessment online
that which you can go take and you can rate
yourself not only on the big5 aspects but also on
all the minor sub components as well and that can
be very illuminating to discover where you fit on that
scale but the reason I'm talking about these big five
aspects is because I want to present this as a
piece of evidence for why the sameness model doesn't work
we know from lots of testing or last 50 years
that human beings map very differently on to all these
different subcomponents and that this explains a lot of their
behavior and you can see that these personality aspects are
quite significant because a person for example who's high in
neuroticism is going to see the world very differently from
a person is low in neuroticism because your emotions color
and filter what you see and in fact they shape
your reality they constructed a person who is high in
openness is going to have a very hard time cooperating
with someone who is low in openness because the person
high in openness is going to be daydreaming and having
all sorts of flights of fancy imagination he's going to
be very philosophical and artistic and emotional and adventurous and
very liberal whereas the closed person is going to be
very conservative very traditional oriented he's not going to want
to listen to your philosophy and your crazy cockamamie schemes
and ideas he just want going to want to you
know obey his his religion and his belief system and
how are those two people going to get along you
can see that that's what creates the divide between liberals
and conservatives so this explains quite a lot this doesn't
quite say that we all live in completely separate realities
we need some stronger evidence to make that claim but
this already starts to tell you that you can't treat
everybody the same chances are that your spouse has a
different set of personality characteristics than you do and if
you're not aware of this you and your spouse are
not going to get along very well at least when
you understand what the problem is what the source of
the friction is then you can say oh okay let
me step back for a second let me start to
maybe appreciate that person not for just being a [
__ ] or an [ __ ] but for just
being a different person and that that's part of what
life is about is that I'm this way and she's
that way or he's that way and we need to
learn to get along and maybe I can learn to
appreciate the differences maybe there's something about her perspective or
her qualities that I've been denying and I've been trying
to get her to be like me but maybe I
can let that go and just say oh I can
appreciate that person's neuroticism a little bit even though I
don't like how crazy and emotional she is I can
appreciate her neuroticism I can see where she's coming from
because the interesting thing about these personality characteristics is that
there's no one good one and one bad one there's
no optimal set of personality characteristics where you sit down
and say okay I want to be highly imaginative and
non neurotic and I want to be very orderly and
I'll do it and then that's going to be the
perfect human being it doesn't work that way that's a
way too simplistic and naive and of a notion the
reason all these personality characteristics exist is because they're necessary
for the successful functioning of the human race if you
want to think of Humanity as a giant ant colony
that would be a good metaphor in an ant colony
they have worker ants they have caretaker ants they have
the cui and they have the warrior ants and they
all serve their own role and I think human beings
are like that except we have way more diversity than
ants do but most of us don't understand this and
we run around trying to make other people like us
and this is fundamentally the answer to why people seem
to be crazy they seem to be crazy because we're
not appreciating that each one of us is constructing our
own reality and that we are living in our own
bubbles and that there's no right or perfect one there's
no one superior bubble or view of reality there's just
different ones and different ones are good for different purposes
you see so a person who is high in neuroticism
you might think well that's a pure negative not necessarily
it depends if a person is growing up in a
certain place in a certain geography in a certain political
climate then neuroticism might a great attribute and in another
place it might be a big obstacle so it all
depends and of course we know that natural selection and
evolution is always optimizing organisms to find the right fit
for their environment so all these characteristics are contextual you
can't know which ones you're going to need which is
why they exist in the first place it's nature's way
of optimizing human beings to do what they need to
do to survive or maybe nature will turn human beings
into a dead end we don't know how that will
play out but it's worked so far so we have
reason to believe that there's some deeper wisdom to it
so go click on the link below and take the
assessment and see where you rank on all these attributes
so let's move on to the next piece of evidence
of course we have the myers-briggs I should mention that
which is another personality like assessment and there's all kinds
of different ways that we can slice and dice human
personalities so the myers-briggs have you taken that before that
also ranks you in several key categories and kind of
defines what your personality is so that's not a piece
of evidence for you there as far as personalities of
course as evidence we have gender differences you cannot treat
genders the same there's a quite a big substantial difference
between the psyche of a man and a woman not
saying that one or the other is better or worse
that would be a trap but just saying that they're
different and we'd to acknowledge these differences and that men
are better at some things and women are better at
certain other things so we each have our strengths and
weaknesses personally for me recognising this was very important for
me to interact successfully with the opposite sex because when
I try to interact with the opposite sex before when
I was unsuccessful it was because I was treating women
exactly the way that I would treat a man and
that of course creates problems of course another interesting piece
of evidence which has come online and last 10 and
20 years or so a lot is sexual orientation we
pretty much now know oh that sexual orientation is not
just a personal preference it's not just sexual deviants and
perverts a lot of it has to do with your
wiring and a lot of it has to do with
your early upbringing and even with what happened when you
were still a fetus in your mom's womb the kind
of chemicals that were coursing through her body the kind
of drugs she was taking if she was taking any
kind of drugs the kind of stress levels that she
was under all of these things affect your sexual orientation
they also affect other aspects of your psyche so we
know that people can have a quite a wide variety
of sexual orientations and it's not just straight or gay
but there's a there's all sorts of weird edge cases
out there that a lot of us just dismiss is
like oh that's very crazy and weird it's just an
edge case but then again you have to be careful
about that because if your model only survives by taking
hundreds of edge cases and cutting them out and saying
that all they're not important then how good is your
model you have to wonder I think that what sexual
orientation studies and evidence is showing us is that people
behave sometimes in weird ways especially with their sexuality because
nature programs them that way or their upbringing early childhood
upbringing does and that can be quite an eye-opening and
you can see the contrast between being accepting of other
people's sexual orientations or being very close-minded about it and
just saying no no no no no all those people
are just deviants and then all just crazy and weird
and they've just been corrupted and the only right sexual
orientation is my sexual orientation you see isn't it interesting
how you always judge other people relative to your one
correct position you never assume that your position is wrong
you always assume that it's right it's very interesting rather
egocentric another piece of evidence is addiction potential so through
the last 50 years we have a lot of good
high-quality clinical and psychological evidence and medical evidence that addiction
is a is not just a you know bad moral
behavior that addiction is actually wired in the brain and
that different people have different potentials for addiction people have
different potentials for alcohol addiction drug addiction opiates and so
forth and sexual addiction and other things and that for
some people drugs alcohol and sex present much bigger addictions
than they do for most people and that's not because
they're bad human beings or they're misbehaving it's simply because
there's different wiring different chemicals in the brain that stuff
matters a lot so if you have a child for
example who has a drug problem rather than treating that
child is like oh you're a bad child you're misbehaving
that would be coming from the sameness natl right because
when you're criticizing and condemning your child for doing drugs
the reason you're doing that is because you're assuming without
recognizing it hey you should be like me when I
was a kid I didn't do any drugs and it
was easy for me yeah but that's when you were
a kid and you were you you have your genetics
you have your wiring you have your upbringing your child
don't assume your child is just like you they might
have different genetics they have a different environment they had
a different set of conditions when they were growing up
and all that makes a big difference so from the
difference model the way you would treat your child of
course you might still not want them doing drugs but
you look at your child and say I understand your
drug problem I understand that for me drugs are not
a problem but for you it seems like they're really
a problem because you keep getting addicted to them over
and over again and no matter you know how much
your bring you're still addicted to them so clearly there's
something going on there it doesn't look like you're just
doing it for fun because you can see the bad
consequences and yet you're still hooked so see you're taking
a more broad more compassionate approach to this to this
child that you have not just browbeating them and telling
them to to be more like you which is a
mistake that a lot of parents make and you know
sexual orientation another one of these things where we like
to demonize people we like to say all that person's
a child molester and this person he has some weird
sexual fetish and that person is an addict and this
person can't stop and this person did it it uh
all this kind of stuff and we cast these people
as deviants or criminals and we lock them up well
we have to be careful about that because like what
they find with with the sexual predators and child molesters
and so forth is they find that these people they
really can't help themselves in a lot of cases and
that their problem might not just be because they're morally
bad people but their problem might be that it had
abusive childhoods or their mothers when they were still in
their mother's womb had high stress levels or were taking
drugs and that this affected their brain chemistry you see
and so in a lot of cases even when these
sexual abusers when they want to stop they still can't
because it's just like something that's wired into their brain
and of course we we condemn these people but you
got to wonder what would it be like if you
were in their shoes see this is the key thing
that we need to make this move we need to
make this move of putting ourselves in other people's shoes
people who are radically different than us if we really
want to have compassion understanding for those people imagine for
example if your own child was a sexual predator and
he wanted to stop but he couldn't because of some
past trauma or some brain dysfunction you see you would
have a lot more compassion for him if you really
understood his situation rather than just say oh yeah you're
criminal you're a deviant and we'll lock you up and
throw you away and we'll we'll morally condemn you so
we're starting to see that there's a lot of variety
of human beings in this Ardant starting to now explain
why some human beings behave in some very weird ways
well it's because we're wired differently so actually it makes
a whole lot of sense why should everybody behave in
the same way we're not ants after all we're a
lot more diverse and complex and now I want to
cite some evidence which is really mind-blowing and this is
really the evidence that convinced me to change my model
and this is the evidence not just a different personality
characteristics but of people inhabiting different realities and to get
this evidence you need to start to go look into
mental illness and brain disorders so mental illness like schizophrenia
and brain disorders which happen with people who have strokes
and physical trauma to the brain from car accidents or
mining accidents this sort of stuff this is a very
interesting and rich field of study in fact I just
recently added a book to my book list which explains
a lot of these interesting brain disorders it was written
by a by a medical doctor who has a clinical
practice and he specializes in the rarest brain disorders in
the world and so people come to him from all
over the country and all over the world with their
weird very rare brain disorders and he helps to diagnose
them and to treat them and he specifically deals with
a lot of head trauma from car accidents and people
who have strokes where some part of their brain completely
dies off like one of their hemispheres dies there's a
bad wiring in there maybe cancer and they're like a
tumor or just a car accident broke something in the
brain and what's very interesting is him describing a lot
of the ramifications of this brain trauma and when you
listen to these clinical case studies it's just incredible it's
incredibly fascinating and it reveals a lot of stuff about
how important the brain is for your behavior ad for
your thinking there are so many examples in that book
that you're going to have to just go read it
because I can't I don't have time to cite them
all to you but I will cite a couple which
completely blew my mind so one example he was talking
about is he was talking about how a patient called
him and this patient was there on the phone he's
like okay I got a really serious problem when I'm
walking down the street after I had my car accident
or my brain damage after I'm walking down the street
now I see dancing dwarves and a little miniature elephant
circus walking down the street and it looks just as
lifelike as the regular by standards walking down the street
and the doctor is listening to his iCloud that's a
that's a really amazing if they're really made even come
into my office and we'll talk more about it so
the guy comes into his office and he's sitting there
with the doctor in the office the doctors ask them
all sorts of questions just to better understand what's going
on because he's never encountered a patient with quite this
kind of situation and so the guy is describing that
yeah he seen these little [ __ ] clown dwarves
jumping around and juggling balls and there's like a little
miniature elephant and whole circus and it's all rolling down
the street and he's seeing this as though it's totally
lifelike and the doctor analyzes his brain he sees that
some may be visual cortex element of his brain has
been damaged and so the doctor starting to suspect like
oh yeah maybe this is why it is this way
but then the doctor gets curious and you ask them
so I'm curious how do you deal with like your
friends and your girlfriend and your family members aren't they
weirded out by this don't they think you're crazy and
the guy says well you know doctor I know that
only I'm seeing these hallucinations and that other people don't
see them so I just keep my mouth shut and
nobody really knows that there's anything wrong with me and
the doctor is very puzzled by this like how can
how can you contain something like that it seems like
something like that would be so significant that you you
couldn't just hide it from anybody and the patients like
well you know to be honest I've had to do
it since I was sitting here in this room with
you and the doctors like well what do you mean
and the patient's like well I didn't want to say
anything but there's a monkey sitting on your lap and
the doctor is like what do you mean and the
patient starts describing this monkey who he sees sitting in
the doctors lap right now and the doctors like is
the monkey there right now and the face is like
yeah it's right there what's the monkey doing oh it's
just sitting there and breathing and wagging its tail and
the doctor is so convinced by his descriptions of this
monkey that he actually has to look down at his
lap to check if there's actually a monkey there because
he's not sure anymore and of course there's no monkey
there but to this person it feels like there's an
actual monkey there and so the doctors blown away by
this and he describes this funny little example but of
course it sounds funny to us but in reality for
that person it's not so funny imagine putting yourself in
his shoes how would you feel you see in that
case that is what I mean by a totally different
reality that person is living in a different reality than
the rest of us and it's it goes way beyond
just a mere personality difference and you can see that
a person who lives in that kind of different reality
will certainly have a different orientation towards life they will
believe different things than you do they will behave differently
perhaps in weird ways that you can not understand because
you assume that everyone shares the same basic physical reality
and that's not the case that's just not the case
and if you want to really become convinced of that
check out this book on my list it's in the
brain section brain category that I have there and I'll
actually be adding some more books along those same lines
to that same category in the future because these examples
just completely blow me away and change my whole perspective
on why human beings struggle to understand each other I
think we really underestimate how differently we can see here
and feel physical reality we can't just assume that everyone
is tapping into the same thing I'll give you one
more example from this book and this is an interesting
example which actually goes back I think over a hundred
years a very very early example that was in the
clinical history and what it is is that there was
one patient who had some brain trauma and before the
brain trauma he was a totally normal individual somehow he
got some physical brain trauma and then he talked with
the doctors and with the doctors he realized that he's
experiencing this problem of seeing other people as not living
beings but as Androids so this is actually a documented
medical condition and they found this in not just one
patient but in multiple patients where if some portion of
your brain is damaged the right portion then you're not
going to be able to relate to human beings and
see them as living human blood and flesh beings there's
actually a module in your brain which is responsible for
that and if that module is deactivated then you will
see a human being who looks just like a flesh-and-blood
human being but you're not going to feel like they're
a living human being you're going to feel like they're
an impostor or a robot on the inside and so
this guy became so convinced that this he thought that
his father his father was taking care of him his
father was helping him in dealing with with his brain
but he thought that his father might be this Android
and so one night when his father took him back
home and they were sleeping in the same house together
he was so convinced that his father was a robot
that he took a hammer and he bashed in his
father's skull and opened his brain to see if there
were cogs and wiring inside and when the police came
to arrest him for killing his father and they asked
him what the hell are you doing bashing in your
father's skull with a hammer he said because he was
a robot and I needed to find out see now
this is a case that we would often just dismiss
as well that's completely insane but like I said we've
documented multiple examples of this where people have these sorts
of conditions and it's been traced to the fact there
are certain modules in your brain which are responsible for
this you have modules in your brain which are responsible
for you recognizing human beings for seeing physical objects as
three-dimensional objects you have modules in your brain that allow
you to recognize your mother's space or your father's space
and many other examples like that and if any one
of these modules is damaged there's the wrong brain chemistry
or whatever some neurons are severed then watch out some
very weird stuff can happen now these brain disorders of
course are a very radical example of something that I
think is a lot more subtle in most human beings
in most human beings I think that of course mostly
most of us don't have brain disorders but I think
we do have slight differences in brain chemistry slight differences
in the genetics which are responsible for shaping the the
various modules in our brain and this affects how we
see the world not in always super radical ways that
you're going to see a monkey but in more subtle
ways and that's why it's so difficult to factor this
into your model because you can never really get inside
somebody else's shoes and see or feel the world through
their brain you see but it actually makes a lot
of sense that each of our brains is unique because
we all have unique genetics and you can see how
your brain affects your mental states and how your mental
states are critical to how you interact with the world
so it would make sense that evolution and natural selection
are constantly at work optimizing our consciousnesses which are mediated
by our brains for the particular environments and tasks that
we are trying to navigate in order to survive and
reproduce so that means that a brain living in the
rain forest needs to have different wiring than a brain
living in a big city like New York because these
are very different environments so there are a very different
tasks that the brain needs to be able to do
in order to survive effectively and reproduce in these environments
or maybe if a brain is born in a peaceful
region of the world versus a war-torn region of the
world you can see how natural selection will select different
kinds of brains to cope with those very radically different
types of situations in order to survive so I hope
this is all starting to come together and start to
make more and more sense make a more compelling case
for the difference model let me give you one last
example which really blows my mind and this is the
example with DMT and the pineal gland there's an example
that I recently learned of of an artist named Shawn
Thornton who I'll have a link to down below he
was a regular artist who then was diagnosed with cancer
of the pineal gland this is a very rare type
of cancer and of course you know that the pineal
gland people talked about how the pineal gland maybe is
the manufacturing center of natural DMT which is responsible for
some spiritual experiences perhaps even enlightenment life experiences in the
mind and this is a a theory that we have
we're not quite sure how much DMT is in the
brain but there's some good evidence suggesting that there probably
is some natural DMT produced by the brain very interesting
because DMT is a very very potent psychedelic but with
this artist he had this cancer the pineal gland and
as soon as he did his art completely changed and
rather than just painting regular paintings he started to paint
these very detailed intricate spiritually ladened paintings and you can
go and take a look at some of those I
want you to take a look because it'll blow your
mind there are these very intricate paintings with all sorts
of religious symbolism and they look like a psychedelic DMT
trip that's what they look at they're very trippy looking
very colorful very bright vivid colors and so his whole
style of art changed he didn't do this consciously it's
not like he sat down said okay I'm gonna change
my art style to be more spiritual like no this
is just the natural byproduct of what happened when something
in his brain changed the pineal gland and maybe now
started to produce more DMT which resulted in him starting
to see all sorts of spiritual visions and then he
just started to paint those so check out the link
below to look at that and I also have I'm
going to have a blog post on my blog about
it so you can go check my blog post to
get the link there which brings me to the very
interesting example of explaining why human beings talk about spirituality
in radically different ways this is something that I've been
trying to explain for for a while now because this
is something that I think that even most spiritual gurus
don't have a very good grasp of and that's because
I think that they ignore the genetic component to spirituality
I think that there's a strong genetic component to spirituality
I think there's a strong neuro chemical component to it
and it matters how your brain is wired and this
is I think you can really convince yourself if you
do some psychedelics over and over again you're going to
start to see that human consciousness is really a very
malleable thing and that it is almost perfectly attuned by
natural selection for you to be effective at survival and
reproduction in whatever environment you find yourself in and that
there's a lot of ways in which consciousness can be
but isn't because perhaps it's not very useful to you
for your survival and reproduction this is one thing you'll
start to notice if you start to do a lot
of psychedelics and you start to notice that a little
little bit of chemical can make a massive difference in
how you see the entire world massive difference the reason
that I think that most spiritual people don't really understand
the full scope of spirituality is because they haven't studied
all the different perspectives on spirituality that are out there
if you do study all the different perspectives in a
very fair-minded and objective way what you realize is that
there's so much diversity and variety in a way that
traditions and different people talk about spirituality this cannot merely
be explained by the fact that people have different personalities
or different cultures that they grew up from or that
they just have different ways of describing enlightenment certainly enlightenment
is a common element across all the major spiritual traditions
of the world certainly but there are also a lot
of other what I would call edged case phenomenon that
oftentimes gets ignored or ridiculed as just flights of fancy
as though people are just deluding themselves what do I
mean by this well I think that some people literally
do see spirits demons aliens and other sorts of mystical
phenomena which has been described in mr. traditions for thousands
of years all across the world and that these are
not just flights of fancy these are not just deluded
people now certainly there are always some deluded people in
fact there are usually many deluded people everywhere but I
just don't think that these concepts would even exist in
our cultural understanding if certain brains didn't actually manufacture these
experiences I think that because there's so much variety in
human brains that people actually do have some crazy experiences
of reality which are so ineffable and so difficult to
describe that they do the best they can but normal
folks cannot understand them because they simply don't have the
neurological mechanism to see what these people are seeing and
this accounts for some of the weird stuff that you
can read about in a new-age circles and in esoteric
traditions and within various kinds of mystical traditions and that's
why they're kept esoteric they're kept esoteric because really the
only people who can understand these things are the people
who are able to experience them and everybody else is
cut out of the loop that's very interesting that's a
very interesting hypothesis there I'm not saying I'm 100 cent
convinced of this I'm just saying that this is the
only thing the only explanation that makes sense to me
given all the different stuff that I've read it does
not make sense that people are just making this [
__ ] up I don't think the allure that imaginative
to make this kind of [ __ ] up and
some of these brain disorder case studies can point us
in this direction I think that people have different capacities
for consciousness and that this actually explains why most people
are not spiritual and most people are not serious about
enlightenment because their brains aren't really wired for it they're
not interested in existential truths because and it's makes sense
from an evolutionary perspective because why should they be it
doesn't really help them navigate ordinary life and so their
brains don't care about it and so they don't pursue
it but a few rare individuals do care about it
and therefore they pursue it and they pursue it very
hard and they have some massive spiritual attainments and I
think this explains why spiritual gurus like the Buddha or
Jesus Christ are quite rare they're not common day folk
because I think they had different wiring than most people
had and this is something that most spiritual gurus will
never admit to you the standard spiritual line is that
hey everyone's the same everyone has the same spiritual potential
so just go at it use these techniques and it
work for you but we see that that's just not
the case so few people actually get enlightened why is
that if enlightenment is so easy and so simple it
would be extremely common so the empirical problem we have
is we need to explain why less than one percent
of all human beings are enlightened and my explanation for
that is that's because they're not wired for it and
that's not the same as me saying they can't that
they're permanently blocked from it no not at all I
think that 99% of people can do it but they
won't because they're just not wired to pursue it hard
enough to get there and I think that this pertains
not only to spiritual development but also to more ordinary
self-help a lot of self-help teachers or gurus will like
to convince you that hey you know everyone can be
successful everyone can cure their depression everyone can be motivated
everyone can go out there and do whatever they want
but I think that that's a too naive to pollyannaish
the reality is that some people really struggle with certain
aspects of their lives some people really struggle with addiction
in ways that other people can't even imagine some people
really struggle with depression in ways that other people can't
imagine and so on some people struggle to motivate themselves
some people struggle to find their life purpose to find
a something that's very compelling for them to pursue in
their life and for other people it's a lot easier
now that doesn't mean that you're a lost cause it
simply means that you have various characteristics and you're wired
for pursuing certain things in life and so everyone is
a little bit different and of course it makes sense
that not everyone would be super super motivated all the
time or always cheerful always in a good mood it's
definitely easier for some people and for others and you
know sometimes you hear motivational speakers who come out there
and give you a great speech about how you should
be motivated and excited about life and all this and
all that and then you try to do it you
realize it doesn't work well the reason it doesn't work
is because the motivational speaker is speaking from a different
position a different view of reality than you are but
you're assuming that hey he and I are basically the
same well that's that's an assumption there that you might
have to revisit at some point in your life generally
what I find is that people who are very strong
in something in life cannot appreciate or understand how this
could be a weakness for somebody else like if you
take Arnold Schwarzenegger for him weightlifting is natural and easy
he loves it it's just a beautiful thing he can
do it for six hours a day make another type
of person who maybe has low energy has different brain
chemistry maybe has some low energy because of a thyroid
issue and for him weightlifting is even just an hour
of it can be a real grind see it's a
big difference and for the Arnold Schwarzenegger person he would
look at the weak person say oh you're just being
weak and lazy and maybe he is in certain cases
of course people are weak and lazy but in other
cases it's like no he's just not wired for it
the way that you were and that has to be
appreciated and understood otherwise you're really misunderstanding the problem you
think the problem is laziness when really the problem is
a lack of suitability physiologically and psychologically and I think
that's the important thing to understand I'm seeing that this
model of reality in a humanity explains a lot more
of the facts than my old model of course the
problem is that this difference model is quite threatening to
people because what it really means ultimately is that rapists
must be rapists criminals must be criminals terrorists must be
terrorists narcissists must be narcissists unconscious people must be unconscious
people perverts must be perverts alcoholics must be alcoholics lawyers
must be lawyers yes even those damn lawyers have a
reason for being lawyers bombs must be bombs hippies must
be hippies workaholics must be workaholics and religious fanatics must
be religious fanatics but you can see now that this
is a very bitter pill for most people to swallow
because the ego loves to take a moral high ground
and to say no no no Leo and Leo Leo
no you're going too far this is just complete moral
relativism and this doesn't work for me all these people
you're talking about they're dysfunctional they're bad they're wrong they're
evil they're criminal they're crazy they're not normal people they
have moral defects and they need to change and you
can be more like me but is that actually the
truth could it be that you're denying nature it's interesting
that you're taking this position that these things about nature
you're saying are wrong and it may should be different
but what if nature is exactly right and that if
something is it's there because nature wanted it to be
there in a sense that's a lot more humble of
a perspective the problem I see is that people take
a very local perspective and they try to explain all
of reality based on their local little egoic perspective what's
good for me what I want what I believe the
see nature takes the ultimate global perspective nature doesn't just
care about you nature cares about everything equally and it
needs to balance everything so that means if someone steps
on your toes and you don't like it well maybe
that's what's necessary for the optimal evolution of nature and
maybe you just happen to be an evolutionary dead end
maybe you're going to have to make a sacrifice for
the larger hole of course you don't like hearing that
because you're you and you care about you and the
worst thing that can happen to you is there not
being a you so of course you're going to fight
tooth and nail to maintain your perspective makes sense from
an evolutionary perspective for you but that's not a that's
not a very good way to evaluate the big picture
of what reality is doing how else do you explain
human variety is it really right to explain it by
saying that half of humanity is crazy deluded criminal and
barbarian is that really how you can explain this that's
not an explanation that's a dismissal you're not real stepping
into those people's shoes I would suggest that you stop
assuming that nature is wrong and rather flipped it on
its head and start assuming that nature is right and
that your mind might not be big enough to really
understand why nature is doing everything it's doing maybe reality
doesn't make mistakes maybe reality is a process of ultra-efficient
self optimization and it's always at work optimizing itself and
what we see right now including all the criminals rapists
and terrorists and all these people that you don't like
which personally offend you maybe this is all necessary as
part of the optimization process and whatever nature is evolving
towards that's what it's evolving towards and just because you're
playing one little tiny role you're like a little ant
in the middle of a rain forest right you're just
a little ant in the middle of a rain forest
a speck in the entire cosmos and yet you're trying
to judge the entire cosmos and tell the cosmos what's
right and what's wrong who should be there and who
shouldn't be there based on your little ants perspective of
the universe rather arrogant of you what I think is
that without this understanding that I'm offering here humanity just
doesn't make sense when you actually make the move and
adopt this differents model that I'm talking about everything will
start to make a lot more sense and you're going
to be able to get along with people a lot
better now let me quickly cover some traps and some
misunderstandings that are easily possible when hearing what I'm saying
the first trap is you might think a goleo does
this mean that all my dad behavior now is justified
that rapist could just keep being a rapist and I
can keep doing the bad stuff I've been doing no
I didn't say anything about that you know if you
are acting out of integrity with yourself and that there
is harming you so if you have bad behavior if
you're hurting other people if you're acting unconsciously you're going
to regret it yourself that's the law of karma in
action so I'm not justifying anything here I'm just saying
that people tend to behave the way they were programmed
to behave and I'm not just saying that everything is
genetic there's a very strong environmental component to your behavior
as well and that has to be taken into account
and I'm not saying you can't change your behavior you
certainly can you can change your behavior a lot and
I recommend that you start behaving in a manner which
is compassionate and caring and not hurting of others because
when you're hurting others you're just being egotistical you're not
really understanding the bigger perspective that I'm talking about here
what I'm talking about here when you really understand you
start to develop a compassion for other people much more
so than before so you start to tread more lightly
in the world and you don't harm people as much
as you did before that's generally what happens with consciousness
if you're doing it right another trap people could fall
into here is to misinterpret this as saying okay so
Leo this means that my race is superior to all
the other races I knew it I knew what those
politically correct people were telling me that all races are
equal but now I know the white race is the
superior race no that's not what I said at all
I said that there are differences and all these differences
are contextual and if there is no one superior race
or type of human being or personality or brain chemistry
it's all relative so actually I'm taking away any sense
of superiority that you can have over other people to
feel superior is to not really be able to step
into other people's shoes that's the only way you can
feel superior to people or to another race when you
step into their shoes you realize oh it's just a
different way of looking at the world it has its
pros and cons just like my way of looking at
the world has its pros and cons another trap here
might be is to interpret this as saying well Leo
this means now that my dreams are impossible I had
these lofty dreams of becoming a millionaire or entrepreneur following
my life purpose or becoming like Arnold Schwarzenegger and now
you're saying I can't do it because I don't have
the right genetics and I don't have the right brain
chemistry be careful about turning this into a excuse not
to grow yourself you can grow yourself nothing that I've
said contradicts that yes it's the case that you have
certain strengths and weaknesses you have to play up to
your strengths and you have to shore up and work
on your weaknesses and you have to be strategic about
that but that doesn't mean you shouldn't dream that doesn't
mean you shouldn't have big goals if you're into that
sort of thing go for it it's not impossible you're
still going to have to work very hard no matter
what your genetics are I'm not saying you're just going
to coast to success with genetics no environment support training
is important learning theory is important all of it is
very important your effort is not pointless your effort is
actually controlled by your genetics and by you are bringing
but that doesn't mean you can just stop the effort
and you're going to become some Olympic athlete or championship
a weightlifter or an amazing actor or anybody like that
without a ton of effort so effort is still required
another way to misinterpret this is to think of it
as like well leo so this means that I can't
become enlightened now I wanted to become enlightened now you've
shattered my hopes no wonder I struggle so much with
enlightenment it's because I'm not wired for it but you
see that's just an excuse what I'm actually saying is
I think that 99% of human beings who are normally
functioning and have a fully intact brain are capable of
becoming enlightened it's just that they're not working at it
hard enough you're capable of it just work towards it
that's all I'm saying here will it be harder for
you than for other people certainly it probably will will
you become a Buddha probably not can you become a
Buddha maybe I don't know if you want to go
to the highest levels of spirituality possible it might be
a lot harder for you than for some maybe it
will be impossible for you to access certain things if
you want to see some demons or some aliens you
might not be able to see them because your brains
just not wired for it or maybe you take a
psychedelic and you do see some or whatever we need
some astral projection or some lucid dreaming or whatever and
you sort of tap into that stuff I don't know
you have to experiment this is really a field that
has not been researched very well so you have to
be open don't limit yourself artificially by saying stuff like
oh I can't do this down I can't do that
now no the fact is that you simply don't know
what you're capable of until you go out there and
really really really try a lot of the stuff that
you think you're not capable of doing which are part
of your genetics actually is just a limiting belief like
for example for most of my life I used to
be overweight I was 65 pounds overweight I was very
fat you wouldn't even recognize me I was so fat
and I used to believe if you asked me back
then when I was fat why are you fat I
would say it's because of my bad genetics I was
cursed with bad genetics my parents were fat so I'm
fat it makes sense and that kept me stuck for
for a good long time until I realized that all
that is [ __ ] and then I worked really
hard going to the gym and changing my diet and
I lost all that weight and I've kept it off
for the last ten years and it was actually quite
easy to keep it off and I have no fear
of falling back into that old lifestyle completely changed my
attitude towards fitness and health has completely changed so that's
an example for you of how it could be dangerous
this idea of genetics can be dangerous because you can
use it to to justify all sorts of lazy behavior
and another way to misinterpret this is to think of
the things I talked about here as meaning well leo
does this mean now that anything goes in society that
means that we should just let terrorists run free and
kill people and rapists can just rape children in schools
and that everything is cool I'm just supposed to sit
back and accept all this no that's a whole different
thing what I'm talking about is just accepting reality as
it is and then what you do about it is
still up to you and as a community we get
to decide what kind of society we want to create
so if we as a community decided hey you know
we don't want murderers just running around gunning people down
and we don't want rapist raping our children in schools
then we make some laws and if we catch people
like that we put them in jail but the difference
is that we don't condemn them we don't demonize them
we don't call them animals well actually we take sympathy
for their situation because we understand that these people could
have had very bad childhoods they could have some dysfunctional
genetics or physiological problems and maybe some of those are
actually curable maybe we can invent some medicines or some
therapeutic techniques that we can help these people to become
well functioning members of society see but we don't do
it from a condemning position where it's like oh you
did this and you're such an evil person that I'm
going to lock you up then I'm going to put
you to death and and I'm not even to bother
to to step into your shoes it's a it's a
compassionate approach that's the difference so let me give you
quickly some takeaways some very practical takeaways from everything I
talked about in this episode firstly be yourself be who
you are naturally designed to be discover that you need
to discover what your strengths and weaknesses are and what
your authentic self is that's a big aspect of personal
development secondly let other people be themselves stop trying to
convert them into being just like you start to appreciate
the differences thirdly learn to be open to radical new
lifestyles and worldviews that doesn't mean you have to personally
adopt them all but let other people have radical lifestyles
just as long as they're not hurting themselves or hurting
other people let them do what they want to do
understanding that there's probably a reason why they're doing it
it's probably something that they're driven towards by their by
their genetics and by it by their psyche fourthly realize
that you don't know what it's like to be another
person you don't really know you're just guessing you're just
assuming and it's very humbling to admit this into to
just be in a state of not knowing about this
also think twice before judging moralizing and condemning other people
because the thing you might be condemning them for might
be something that they're just a victim of themselves that
you're not appreciating and that if you were in their
shoes you would hate it if somebody was condemning you
or if your child was in their shoes you would
hate it if somebody condemned your child think twice before
giving advice to people because usually when you give advice
to people you do it from your own point of
view it's like you're giving advice to somebody else the
way you would give advice to yourself but the advice
that's right for you might be totally wrong for somebody
else and this is a point that I learned a
lot over the last few years because I've been interacting
with so many of you who have been leading me
comments sending me emails on the forum posting stuff on
YouTube and so I've been reading people's problems and trying
to give them advice but as I give advice I
realize more and more that my advice has to be
very careful because it's very easy for me to give
advice for myself but a lot harder to give advice
that's quality advice for other people because I have to
take into account their differences also seek alternative worldviews don't
just be stuck in your own worldview try to go
out there make friends with radically different types of people
who see the world in a very different way that
will grow you a lot recognize that everyone has strengths
and weaknesses and that those are context dependent what's your
strength right now could become your greatest weakness if you
just move to a different city or a different country
and vice versa what's your weakness right now could become
your greatest strength if you just find a way to
use it properly change the context also be careful about
who you role model if you are role modeling some
Olympic athlete some celebrity or actor some entrepreneur some weightlifter
whoever that you really mind maybe some spiritual teacher like
the Buddha or Jesus Christ or Mohammed you got to
be careful because you're assuming that hey I'm the same
as the Buddha I'm the same as Jesus Christ I'm
the same as Muhammad know you could be wired very
differently from these people exceptional people the ones in our
world class you got to assume that they probably have
some unique wiring which allowed them to climb the ladder
all the way to the top and become so successful
and so famous so use them as inspiration but also
be careful because these role models have a way of
distorting your own connection to your own authentic being as
you're trying to go out there and become more like
Arnold Schwarzenegger you might forget that hey do I even
want to do why do I want to be like
Arnold Schwarzenegger why am I not following my agenda and
try to be more authentically me but instead going out
there and trying to emulate somebody like a monkey and
lastly craft your lifestyle around your personality type this is
what it's all about craft is self actualization journey around
you don't just take my advice blindly or any other
teacher figure out what you need figure out what's going
to work for you discover yourself and then craft your
lifestyle around that people have different lifestyles because they need
to because they have different needs different strengths and different
issues that's it I'm done here please click the like
