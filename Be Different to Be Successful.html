hey this is Leo for actualised org and today I
want to have a discussion about this topic of being
iconoclastic and how being the exact opposite of what everyone
else is being or what everyone else is doing can
actually lead to some amazing results so this is an
interesting idea because there's a balance to be had between
being conformist and then being rebellious or iconoclastic and challenging
conventions just for the sake of challenging them so when
I was a kid through middle school in high school
I used to be I haven't had a rebellious streak
and really kind of an iconoclastic streak I would call
myself a proud iconoclast but I'll give you just a
quick example of how this played out so in middle
school I used to remember I would walk up to
people like friends in school and I would ask them
this question I would tell them if someone gave you
a million dollars right now to quit school forever and
you could never come back you'd have to quit where
you are right now and this was like eighth grade
so if you quit school at eighth grade and you
were never allowed to come back but you had a
million dollars would you take that deal and of course
most of the kids they hated school anyways they probably
quit it for $100 but of course for a million
dollars they all said yes and being the kind of
smartass that I was I would always I would insist
and I would argue with them I would say no
I would never take that deal because the education is
so much more important over the long run over the
long run that education is going to earn me a
lot more than a million dollars so in the end
that's a poor deal to take because you could never
come back and you could never get proper education and
so yeah I was probably little bit smarter than most
kids in terms of how I was thinking long term
and all that kind of stuff but really I was
coming up this question from a place of ego so
you know I wanted to prove that I was a
smartass and that I was different than everyone else and
so that's kind of why I was posing the question
that's that's why I was posing that answer it was
almost like I was a I was I was I
took the answer of the exact opposite what I assumed
most kids would would take and so in that sense
I wasn't really coming at it from you know from
a very wise perspective it was more of an it
goeth perspective but still the net result was actually was
actually the same because whether I really believe that the
education was was really worthwhile long term or whether I
was just doing that because I thought it was different
and that's what I valued didn't really matter because the
net result was that I started to value education actually
ended up happening was I started putting a lot of
energy and investment into education into my education so through
school I started getting good grades studying hard doing all
that kind of stuff and I really believed it I
didn't I was interesting myself but part of the reason
I was doing that was because I actually thought that
it was it was the cool rebellious thing to do
is to be smart because most kids didn't want to
be smart most kids were talking to their friends they
were slacking off they hated homework all that stuff so
I thought if I want to be original if I
want to be unique the best way to do that
is to actually go in go in against the grain
so I actually thought that it was gonna be cool
like cool in the uncool sense to be smart and
so that's actually how I got smart and I got
an amazing education which I'm grateful for to this day
because of that and it all came from being a
little bit iconoclastic and over the years my content has
kind of gone down because it was a kind of
extreme I found myself challenging stuff that that was you
know solid stuff and and so you know where where
else is applied that was just like a little school
example well one other place where you really want to
be unique and sometimes you get really rewarded for for
going against the grain is in business sometimes in business
is really important to do things differently because it's important
for you to carve out your niche and doing so
reduces your competition you don't want to be competing with
a bunch of other companies within the same market that
drives down prices that make that means you have to
work harder it's much better to create your own little
niche your a little area of the market that you
can corner and just work on that and usually to
do that you need to play up your business's strengths
and idiosyncrasies and so there sometimes it's good to not
do what everyone else is doing because if you go
into that popular market that popular niche the thing that's
hot right now that tends to a lot of times
lead to market crashes bubbles or reduces pricing to the
point where margins are driven down you don't earn a
lot of money you end up working really hard and
you don't get too much for it so that can
be really good for business generally though the reason that
you want to be iconoclastic and you want to go
against the grain is because is because of mediocrity and
if you think about it if you're gonna have if
you want different results than everybody else and this was
just a general rule that I followed since I was
pretty young so times lived literally since middle school was
that I tend to think that if I just do
things differently I'll get different results and the way I
thought about it was just simply this is that you
have you have the majority of people in the world
there's like 7 billion people in the world now and
the majority of them are quite mediocre they live boring
lives they are either poor or just above the poverty
line they're struggling to get by a lot of them
are emotionally unstable tons and tons of problems and just
not what I think of as when when I think
about myself and the way I want my life to
go and the trajectory of my life to have of
Awesomeness and success and financial well-being and psychological well-being all
this stuff and achievement and just satisfaction with my life
I don't picture most people as having that so when
I think about that I start to wonder ok so
what are they doing that puts them into mediocrity and
if they do what most people do that puts them
in mediocrity then if I do that that will put
me in the same place whereas if I do something
different that will put me in a different place perhaps
sometimes a worse place but also perhaps a better place
so it's not always that doing something different will get
you to a better place it can actually put you
in a worse place and we'll talk about that in
a bit but some of the kind of mainstream stuff
that people do also tends to be very unhealthy and
bad and so going against that grain can be very
good that's why just living by that principle of doing
things differently can sometimes just blindly put you in a
good position because you start to avoid some of the
problems that mainstream society has and you start getting a
different mode of thinking and different level of success generally
though the reason that you want to be iconoclastic also
is because you know what are the common problems that
keep people in mediocrity well I think some of it
you know obviously lack of lack of resources and that
kind of stuff in poor countries but one of the
problems I think is is laziness and really not wanting
to work hard you can definitely see this in like
mainstream American culture where you have this uh there's just
general willingness to grasp at stuff that's easy to get
or that's free so people will go for free samples
if there's a store opening and they give out free
stuff people flock to that store if there's a you
know if there's a big lottery to be won it's
played on the news and people go and buy tickets
and when you win the lottery that's for you to
something amazing and people ask each other questions like well
what if you won the lottery tomorrow what would you
do oh I'd quit my job I do this I
do that I'd go for a vacation so like this
kind of idea that you know you can get free
stuff or they can go gambling you get something for
free or really another way that it's manifest online especially
if you've done any sort of business research or you
try to start a business or you're familiar with with
online businesses in any way you've you know the get-rich-quick
schemes I mean some you'll even see these advertised on
TV with real estate and stuff like that basically that
get-rich-quick scheme which is like a quick little business so
you can start at home that will earn you tons
of money with with no investment no time investment you're
going to be only working four hours a week and
you're going to get all the money in the world
and it's going to be easy and effortless convenience of
your own home you don't have to go to a
boss so you know we've all heard this common story
and sometimes even you're driving on the roads you see
signs that are saying stuff like work from home and
earn $200 an hour you know stuff like that so
that is trying to appeal to that mainstream desire to
get something easy with low energy but get a lot
for it and so and of course you know that
appeals to all of us on some level because we
want to be efficient with our use of energy and
resources that's just something we as as living organisms do
that's kind of programmed into our DNA but also that
can actually backfire and I think in mainstream society that
actually does backfire more often than it doesn't because at
this point human society has developed to such an extent
that you know it's black is becoming easy it's almost
becoming too easy it's easy to get your food it's
easy to get your water it's easy to really to
earn money it's easy to get a job all this
stuff is really programmed as a society for you so
you don't have to you don't have to risk life
and limb to do that stuff you just have to
put a little bit of effort forward and if you
follow the rules in society generally you'll turn out fine
and people even fail at that but that's mostly because
they start they start taking it for granted common example
is just with health like the way that people abused
our health by eating junk food because it's so easy
it's so convenient such so much energy so much calories
in in a little bite-sized piece of candy bar or
our cheeseburger or whatever it is that you eat but
it's not very nutritious for you mainstream society encourages it
it's easy to get it but it's almost like we're
getting too lazy that's why half the country is overweight
or obese is because it's too easy to get that
stuff and it's like that laziness that not wanting to
work hard is a is starting to backfire so that's
one of the ways that you can you can become
a little bit contrary and and tackle some of those
problems so by by tackling that idea of not working
hard and being lazy that's definitely going to help to
get you out of mediocrity you know stuff like wanting
easy money wanting Fame and success all this stuff is
just a typical of what I'm talking about another thing
that I really like to just just ponder is is
this idea of herd mentality and some of the pros
and cons that go along with herd mentality so really
herd mentality leads to group think and some of the
evils of social conformity that come with that and there
are other problems so well you know what are the
problems with groupthink and social conformity and herd mentality well
one of it one of the things is that it
kills originality and generally in the marketplace if you're doing
business or you're trying to provide value to an employer
originality is something that's desired especially now when most jobs
are service service type jobs so no longer are we
doing much manufacturing especially in America it's more about your
creative output so you know how creative can you be
in your business how creative can you be in your
work in your career whatever it is that you're doing
and how original can you be how innovative can you
be to be innovative and original means you have to
think differently by definition than everyone else because you need
to be able to explore the regions the regions of
possibility that other people haven't gotten to yet and that
usually requires a different mode of thinking so in that
sense if you're thinking with the herd if you're doing
what everyone else is doing it's hard to be original
hard to be a discover hard to be an explorer
and then you don't get the benefits from being an
explorer and discover in an innovator and a lot of
times some of the best results and business come from
doing just that so that's one way that it's good
not to engage in herd mentality so a lot of
times also following the herd simply makes ideas untenable or
unfeasible so you know what's an idea of this well
some common examples aren't like investing in stocks like if
everybody invested in the same stock and everyone tried to
get rich off of it it just wouldn't work in
theory because to make money on a stock someone else
has to be losing some money there right and it's
the disparity between buyers between buying it and a low
price and selling it at a higher price which means
that basically you're offloading that value out to somebody else
and then you're cashing the difference well like hedge funds
for example or actually successful mutual funds succumb to this
problem when a mutual fund or hedge fund becomes very
successful and it starts taking on too many new investors
what is it happening is that really becomes too big
for its own success so it becomes unsustainable when everyone
tries to be successful at the exact same thing usually
it doesn't happen because you can't distribute you don't have
enough resources to distribute across the whole across all the
players in that game equally so you know if we
wanted to make everybody in the world a billionaire well
to make 7 billion people in the world billionaires it
probably just wouldn't work out the math wouldn't work out
right society just wouldn't work out be cut why because
you know someone has to be doing the low-level grunt
work like someone has to be cleaning the toilets someone
has to be doing your plumbing someone has to be
doing all the stuff that you would never want to
do if you were a billionaire so if everyone became
billionaires instantly it just it wouldn't be tenable really you'd
have to devalue the money or something like that because
or you need like robots to be doing all the
grunt work so you can't just instantly make everyone a
success there has to be some disparities you know don't
make that a limiting belief on yourself but I think
generally if we're talking about large numbers then that's true
also that's why for example like pyramid schemes like they
might start to work at first and then eventually they
have to they have to die they have to collapse
because it's unsustainable you need an infinite number of new
players coming into the game to keep the pyramid scheme
going so I find that very very germane to business
because in business once too many players get into a
market the market can get oversaturated and even if you
can get some success there it's not the kind of
success that you really want to be going after because
you're working very hard for it and getting very little
in return because there's too many people trying to divide
the pie so the pie pieces become very very small
very fast you know what's another example of where being
kind of contrarian and iconoclastic is good well I think
just in how you are as a person how you
behave and what your personality is like it's good to
be original and idiosyncratic so you know when I was
a when I was younger in school I used to
think and I used to look at people and I
list used to evaluate them based on their mannerisms and
I would look you know the mannerisms of mine festers
or my teachers kids around me and I would kind
of judge them for it I'd be like oh that's
you know that's quirky what he does with his hands
that's weird like the way he laughs his laughs is
kind of funny you know his hair hairstyle is kind
of funny like this kind of stuff like these things
that would kind of make people stand out I would
tend to poke fun of people in there in my
mind about that and my ideal at that point was
kind of like well I'm going to try to reduce
as many manners as butt as I can within myself
so I'm you know I'm I don't have those quirks
and you know as I got older I started to
realize that that those idiosyncrasies are actually kind of good
because what they do is they they kind of build
your personality and they make you stand out and they
make you a little bit more magnetic because if you
if you numb down and polish out all the all
the mannerisms that you have everything about you that's kind
of unique then you just become very vanilla you have
no you have no spicy of no flavor treat to
who you are and it also doesn't make you very
happy because those quirks are expressing those quirks is an
expression of yourself and it's usually feels good to do
that and suppressing them can be kind of limiting and
soul draining or at least just not you know you
don't get that sense of thrill that you do with
really sharing who you are with other people and it
doesn't really make you very very lovable I tend I
guess what happens is that if you polish out that
stuff you become very homogenized so it becomes easy for
somebody to for everybody to like you a little bit
or at least to be just kind of agreeable with
you but it's hard for people then to really love
you or gravitate towards you so you're not very polarizing
it's like you're good for everybody you're just very generic
you're kind of the lowest common denominator that people will
accept sometimes it's good to be polarizing because there's so
many people in the world that you can be friends
with I mean you're going to be the limit the
bottleneck there is just going to be the amount of
time and energy that you have so you don't need
to worry about attracting thousands thousands and thousands of people
to make a thousand people happy you really just need
to worry about expressing yourself and having the people that
love you really love you and then people that hate
you if they really hate you you shouldn't really care
too much about that so sometimes it's good to to
put out those idiosyncrasies and those develop those mannerisms because
it builds up your personality makes you more magnetic and
in that sense it also makes you stand out from
the herd right if you're just like everyone else you
tend to blend in if there's something very unique about
you then you're going to stand out and that can
be very good for you also you can stand out
in bad ways so don't you know everything has to
be taking kind of in balance the other problem is
that I mean even if you wanted to eliminate mannerisms
what I found as I was trying to do this
for a while is that you can't really effectively eliminate
and there's still going to be quirks about you they're
there and in fact not having mannerisms is somewhat of
a mannerism in and of itself because most people are
quirky in some ways and if you're too vanilla it's
almost like you're going to be kind of cut and
dry and a little boring and that will become like
your like your signature your trademark and that's really not
a good trademark to have so so really you don't
want to be vanilla other things the reasons why conformity
is bad conformity can lead to epic failures epic financial
failures we've we've seen this through history so if you're
a student of history you've seen this pan out in
many many different ways financial failures from stock market crashes
to real estate bubbles to pyramid schemes to gold rushes
you know from the very real gold rushes back like
in the 1850s and what not to to modern-day gold
rushes like maybe the the dot-com bubble bursting stock market
that kind of stuff you know industries that become very
hot they get flooded with people and then because there's
not enough resources to go around basically collapses or once
the resources run out the industry collapses you definitely saw
that with the real gold rushes where people would flock
to a gold mining town and eventually they'd strip it
dry and then people would people would keep coming and
coming but there was not enough gold to sustain everyone
that was there so usually only a few people made
out rich and the rest work better off at all
for it same thing happened with the stock market crashes
you know it happens repeatedly this is not just a
one-time event you can research a whole history on how
conformity conformity leads to epic financial failures you know you
don't want to get caught up in that in fact
that can be really bad if you end up getting
caught up in that blind and blindsided by it you
can literally wipe out your entire savings and destroy your
entire life many many documented examples of that you know
on the other hand you know we've been talking about
conformity and we're talking about how conformity can be bad
the others the flip side of this coin is that
there's a balance and so conformity can also be good
groupthink does have many positive advantages one of them you
know is that a lot of times the herd has
some mainstream tendencies that are actually really healthy and really
good so you know what's one example this well I'd
say education like if you're born in America or most
modern countries in the world even probably the poor countries
it's like you're just expected to go to school you
know groupthink just tells you to go to school you
have to go to school you don't even think twice
about it you don't really even have much of a
choice and then even after school you're generally pressured to
go to college your parents pressure to go citing pressures
you to go teachers pressure you to go all all
the kids in your school are going so like going
to college becomes very effortless it's not a very big
decision that you have to make maybe for some people
it is but mostly it's like yeah it's a no-brainer
to go to college and probably in the end that's
a really good thing for you is that you know
you don't want you don't want to to not have
that solid base of Education which will allow you to
be much more successful later on so like that's a
good example of groupthink where you just automatically following the
herd and you're actually getting some good benefit from it
you know other examples are sometimes that there is there
is um there are trends or fads that start off
with groupthink and if you're not in tune with them
a lot of times it's good to kind of see
you know where is the words the herd starting to
move towards so for example when the internet came online
you know a lot of people started internet businesses they
started making websites people started talking about it stock started
started becoming hot so if you were just kind of
starting to observe that trend and you were not really
into the internet yet you started seeing that you started
following it through herd mentality just through think because everyone
else was doing it that would actually been good for
you because there's so many great benefits from the internet
you get so much free information a much better way
to shop you can save money you can connect with
friends better you can make money yourself through it so
all these these positive benefits from the internet which actually
turns out to be very like very huge permanent improvement
to a human society which is not just a little
quick fad a little blip on the radar it's here
to stay and so getting getting on board with that
one as early as you could would have been great
so following the herd there was nice in that case
also like with PCs if we go even earlier back
if you were resisting to become a PC adopter nowadays
like you know you need to know how to use
PC you don't you know how to type like that
kind of stuff following herd mentality on that is great
because you start getting all the benefits of being able
to use a PC and your computer makes you more
efficient so you know so many different benefits you get
from PC from word processing applications to sharing stuff with
friends and family to you know working more efficiently having
skills to get to get better at work to be
more efficient at work to manage projects emails all that
stuff so in those for those examples you know getting
getting on board with groupthink is good and so you
know I guess the way I'm gonna wrap this up
is to say that there is a balance that you
want to have there but in general especially if you're
talking about business I think financial success and you're talking
about personal success and getting the kind of results that
you dream of that most people don't get and you
realize that what you want is what most people don't
have and will never have at least for the foreseeable
future then you want to start thinking about how do
I do stuff differently you know if everybody is saying
that I should be starting an online business by doing
XYZ in market ABC then maybe that's not the best
way to go what if I kind of take some
of the best lessons from that but then actually do
my own thing deuce like something slightly different so at
the same time I mean I guess the underlying point
the bottom line is that you want to really be
very conscious and use your judgment and be very aware
of what the trends are how rooms think works and
start thinking about how to be doing stuff differently I
guess my strategy I think the ideal strategy is to
do things on your own and be contrarian but not
for contrarians sake do it because it makes sense to
do it for you and also at the same time
don't turn a blind eye completely to groupthink into trends
that are happening society or even fads because those can
be valuable indications of stuff that you should be paying
attention to that's not on your radar so use your
judgment do the stuff that you got to do to
be unique be yourself don't be afraid of that don't
blend in just for the sake of blending in peer
pressure all that completely unnecessary and unhealthy but also pay
attention to some of the trends because those can alert
you to some of the good stuff and when you're
using your judgment like that I think you'll find that
you'll get much better results and you'll start to create
that kind of life that few people have because bottom
line is that you start doing things differently than most
people do you
