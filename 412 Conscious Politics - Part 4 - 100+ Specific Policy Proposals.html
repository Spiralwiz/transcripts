            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XSV0ZhD_yvw' target='_blank'>Conscious Politics - Part 4 - 100+ Specific Policy Proposals</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Criminalization of money in politics and corporate lobbying</b>: Leo Gura proposes a constitutional amendment to ban all money in politics, thereby eliminating legal bribery in the system and reinforcing democracy's idea of 'one person, one vote'. He also suggests implementing public financing for all elections.
</li><li><b>Abolition of gerrymandering</b>: Gerrymandering, where district lines are redrawn for political advantage, distorts representative democracy. Gura advocates for redrawing all district lines using unbiased, non-partisan, independent bodies or computer algorithms for fairness.
</li><li><b>Abolition of the Electoral College</b>: The Electoral College inhibits the application of the democratic principle of 'majority rules'. Gura proposes its abolition to ensure that electoral outcomes are aligned more closely with the popular vote.
</li><li><b>Making voting more accessible</b>: Gura suggests measures such as online voting, automatic voter registration, and making election day a federal holiday to increase the accessibility of voting, thereby fostering greater citizen participation in the democratic process.
</li><li><b>Improving Accessibility of Voting</b>: Leo Gura proposes improvements to the voting system to increase accessibility and decrease discouragement for voters. This includes reducing wait times for voting, eliminating closed primaries and caucuses to make the voting process more straightforward and inclusive, especially during the primaries.
</li><li><b>Creating Stronger Primaries</b>: Gura emphasizes the need for stronger primaries to enhance the political competition. Currently, primaries are closed in many states that limit accessibility for individuals not registered as Democrat or Republican. 
</li><li><b>Advocating for Multi-Party System</b>: Gura advocates for a multi-party system with rank-choice voting to encourage competition and break the stalemate of the two-party system prevalent in the U.S. 
</li><li><b>Introduction of Federal Propositions</b>: He suggests the introduction of federal propositions to address and vote on popular issues that Congress often overlooks. 
</li><li><b>Restricting Lobbyists from Holding Public Office</b>: Gura calls for a ban on lobbyists - professionals who influence political decisions in their favor - from holding public office to prevent potential conflicts of interest and corruption.
</li><li><b>Higher Taxation on Extreme Wealth</b>: Gura proposes significantly higher taxation on extreme wealth and accumulated wealth over certain thresholds. He also suggests higher estate taxes and corporate taxes, with a tiered system to alleviate burden on small businesses.
</li><li><b>Closing Tax Loopholes</b>: Leo advocates for closing tax loopholes that large corporations often exploit to avoid taxation.
</li><li><b>Higher Taxes on Wealthy and Corporations</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the need for higher corporate taxes for large corporations that earn billions every year, stating that such corporations tend to squeeze out smaller businesses and stifle competition through lobbying and creating an unfair tax environment. He suggests that tax breaks should be provided for smaller businesses and entrepreneurial ventures to encourage competition, creativity, and innovation.
</li><li><b>Increase in Capital Gains Tax and Elimination of Tax Loopholes</b>: Gura advocates for higher capital gains tax and passive income tax, arguing that individuals who accumulate wealth through stocks, arbitrage, derivatives trading, and other financial tools pay comparatively lower taxes despite not contributing significantly to societal development. He believes there should be more tax breaks for those engaged in manual and creative labor. He suggests eliminating tax loopholes that allow corporations to store their wealth overseas to avoid taxation, proposing stricter regulations to track and tax such wealth.
</li><li><b>Taxation of Luxury Goods and Real Estate Speculation</b>: Gura calls for higher taxes on luxury goods and real estate speculation. He asserts that individuals who own and live in multiple houses, or who merely speculate on real estate should pay higher taxes for their secondary and tertiary homes. He proposes substantial taxes on foreign real estate investments that drive up housing prices in major cities, creating affordability issues for ordinary people.
</li><li><b>Tax Payer Choice</b>: Gura suggests giving taxpayers the option to choose where a portion of their taxes are directed. Possible categories could include improving healthcare, green energy, schools, or space exploration. This could motivate individuals to engage more with governmental processes and increase accountability.
</li><li><b>Stricter Penalties for White-Collar Crime</b>: Gura calls for stronger penalties for white-collar crimes, arguing that corruption and manipulative schemes by senior officers and managers of corporations can lead to severe societal issues, including the death of thousands of people. He suggests the creation of a governmental department to regulate and penalize such crimes in order to deter corrupt practices.
</li><li><b>Accountability on CEOs and Managers</b>: Leo Gura strongly advocates for increased accountability on CEOs and senior officials within corporations, arguing they need to face stricter penalties if found guilty of exploitative business practices. 
</li><li><b>Transparency through Public Disclosure of Income and Profit Margins</b>: Gura champions the idea of publicly disclosing all incomes and profit margins, which he believes will highlight inequalities within the system and decrease the potential for exploitation. He envisions a governmental database that presents every citizen's income and every corporation's profit margins, which he supposes can help individuals understand and challenge the disparities within their industries and facilitate fair competition. 
</li><li><b>In Defense of Whistleblowers</b>: Contrary to the current scenario where whistleblowers face harsh repercussions, Gura calls for legal protection, safety provision, and financial compensation for people exposing government corruption. He considers whistleblowers as crucial contributors to maintaining transparency and eliminating system inefficiencies.
</li><li><b>Elimination of Black Ops Programs</b>: Gura argues against the existence of secret budgets and black ops programs. He criticizes the secrecy surrounding these operations, considering them as sources of corruption and expressions of fear. He encourages a shift from fear-driven decisions to policies based on abundance and love.
</li><li><b>Military Budget Reduction</b>: Voicing criticism against the enormity of the American military budget, he suggests significant cuts to this expenditure. He also advises against the current practices of maintaining hundreds of military bases worldwide and selling defense equipment to various countries, which according to him, channel a significant amount of resources and creative energy into destruction rather than development.
</li><li><b>Need for redirecting military expenditures</b>: Gura offers a critique on the military-industrial complex, arguing that substantial resources are wasted in the manufacture and decommissioning of weapons that provide very little value to society. Instead, he proposes redirecting these resources towards internal infrastructure, education, and healthcare for the benefit of citizens.
</li><li><b>Shifting the military budget</b>: He suggests significant cuts to portions of the military budget, particularly in areas of excessive and unnecessary technologies such as new nuclear weapons and advanced fighter aircraft. At the same time, he emphasizes that this should not affect the troops' salaries but instead lead to their increase. 
</li><li><b>Improvement of police and first responders resources</b>: Gura advocates for improved police training in racial sensitivity, negotiating, and de-escalation, and urges for increased numbers of police and FBI agents to enforce laws and stop crime. He recommends better training and higher salaries for these professionals to reduce corruption and improve work conditions.
</li><li><b>War crimes enforcement and prohibition of torture</b>: Gura speaks to the need for strong enforcement of war crimes, with transparent reporting and prosecution. He also calls for an outright ban on torture, extending beyond U.S. soil to include any involvement of American citizens in the torture of anyone across the globe.
</li><li><b>Workers representation in corporate boards</b>: Gura proposes legislation to ensure worker representation in corporate boards, particularly for large corporations with over a billion dollars in profit and considerable employment. He suggests a 50% worker representation, arguing that it would change the way many corporations operate and make working conditions better.
</li><li><b>Defending the right to unionize</b>: Gura also stands for the protection of workers' right to unionize, arguing against any form of corporate interference with unionization efforts, which he proposes to criminalize.
</li><li><b>Raising the minimum wage</b>: Gura argues for raising the minimum wage to a living wage, suggesting a figure between fifteen to twenty dollars an hour. He disagrees with the idea that this would negatively impact the economy, noting that higher minimum wages in some states have not had adverse effects. Gura argues that a higher wage is fundamental to balance the power between individual workers and powerful corporations.
</li><li><b>Low Wages and Minimum Wage</b>: The video discusses the challenging reality of living on minimum wage, highlighting the difficulty of survival and breaking free from the financial stress. Leo believes that increasing the federally mandated minimum wage from $7.25, which is not a living wage, is critical. 
</li><li><b>Regulation of Predatory Industries</b>: Leo argues that certain industries, including banking, finance, and healthcare, are manipulative and extract excessive profits without providing substantial value. He argues for significant government regulation for these industries to prevent the exploitation of consumers. 
</li><li><b>Antitrust Regulations</b>: Leo advocates for strict antitrust regulations to prevent large companies from buying out smaller ones and stifling competition. He proposes barring companies earning over a million dollars of profit from acquiring other entities, fostering more competition and innovation.
</li><li><b>Copyright Law</b>: Leo calls for shorter limits on copyrights. Current corporate practices extend copyrights far beyond a creator's lifetime and limit creativity by recycling old content. He advocates that copyrights should expire upon the creator's death.
</li><li><b>Prison Reform</b>: Leo suggests a shift from punishment-orientated prison systems to rehabilitation-focused systems. He proposes the inclusion of non-dogmatic, spirituality-based programs such as mindfulness training, meditation, and yoga programs into prisons to reduce recidivism rates. 
</li><li><b>For-Profit Prisons and Better Treatment of Prisoners</b>: Echoing compassionate attitudes towards criminals, Leo calls for the abolition of for-profit prisons due to their corrupt incentive structures. He urges the implementation of education and jobs programs for inmates upon release to reduce the likelihood of re-offending.
</li><li><b>Prison reform and humane treatment of prisoners</b>: Leo Gura suggests necessary improvements in regards to how prisoners are viewed and treated, highlighting the need for rehabilitation-focused initiatives. He argues that demonizing individuals incarcerated for non-violent crimes only exacerbates recidivism rates upon their release, becoming a burden for society. Efforts should be concentrated on rehabilitation for the majority of prisoners, understanding that some might be beyond help.
</li><li><b>End of the drug war and legal consequences</b>: He advocates for the end of the drug war, which would include the release of all those jailed for minor drug possession charges. The classification and penalization for drug-related offenses need significant adjustments.
</li><li><b>Refugee and immigrant assistance and acceptance</b>: Commenting on the general fear and unwelcoming attitudes towards refugees and immigrants, Gura calls for a more compassionate understanding of their circumstances and an expansion of support systems. He refutes the idea of scarcity being a barrier to welcoming more immigrants, emphasizing that the U.S.'s land and resources are not fully utilized. 
</li><li><b>Addressing poverty, hunger, and homelessness</b>: The need for measures to eradicate poverty, hunger, and homelessness is underlined, which can feasibly be addressed with proper political will and policies.
</li><li><b>Environmental regulation and resource management</b>: Heavy environmental regulation is essential not just for controlling global warming but also for mitigating pollution and dependency on non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels. Improved management of resources and a shift towards renewable energy is proposed, with a specific suggestion for a carbon tax on polluters.
</li><li><b>Toxic testing of consumables</b>: The call for a government department dedicated to conducting toxicity testing on food, water, air, products, and cosmetics is made. Consumers should be easily able to access data regarding such tests, including contents of heavy metals and other harmful substances in products.
</li><li><b>Mental health funding</b>: Significant funding should be allocated to mental health services, including offering free therapy and life coaching. These services should be available widely, including in schools, workplaces, and prisons. The proper functioning of an individual's mental health impacts both their personal life and their interactions within society.
</li><li><b>Mental Health Support for criminals</b>: Gura points out that criminals often need mental health support to overcome their tendencies for criminal behavior. Providing such support can break the cycle of abuse and crime that can perpetuate for generations, and can also help to reduce crimes like domestic abuse perpetrated by those with untreated mental issues. 
</li><li><b>Decentering Capitalist Mentalities</b>: He encourages society to break free from scarcity mindsets, specifically addressing concerns regarding immigration and resource allocation. Gura counters claims of overpopulation and resource scarcity by pointing out mismanagement and lack of strategic planning as the real issues. Capitalistic fears, he suggests, should not hinder humanitarian efforts or environmental responsibility. 
</li><li><b>Major investment in Green Energy and better battery technologies</b>: Gura talks about the need to invest in green energy solutions and significantly improve battery technology. He suggests a program as ambitious as the Apollo moon landing mission of the 60s dedicated to conducting research in green energy, advocating for government-led initiatives.
</li><li><b>Free mental health services and life coaching</b>: He suggests the importance of making mental healthcare accessible to all. Gura highlights the impact of untreated mental health issues on society and emphasizes the potential of such an initiative in increasing quality of life and consciousness of the population.
</li><li><b>Stricter Regulations for Factory Farming and Increased Transparency</b>: Leo Gura argues for tougher regulations on factory farming to ensure more humane conditions. He proposes greater transparency in this industry and condemns laws that prevent disclosure of factory farming practices.
</li><li><b>Funding for Infrastructure</b>: Gura highlights the importance of well-funded infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, and public transportation. He supports government subsidization for improving transportation facilities, stressing that good infrastructure is a critical element of society.
</li><li><b>Government Efficiency and Corruption</b>: He refutes the common belief that government is disorganized and inefficient, citing examples of successful government operations such as the military, airport management, disaster relief, and postal services. Gura acknowledges existing corruption, but asserts that proper funding and incentives can lead to government success.
</li><li><b>Science, Arts, and Corruption</b>: Gura critiques the corruption of science by corporations, arguing that empirical research should be conducted for the sake of truth rather than profit. He proposes government intervention to rescue science from corporate influence, establishing it as a reliable tool for societal well-being.
</li><li><b>Equal Rights for Minorities</b>: Leo Gura advocates for equality and protection rights for all minority groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals. He proposes the provision of free counseling and therapy services to members of these communities to enhance their societal integration.
</li><li><b>Supreme Court Reform</b>: Gura suggests potential reform of the Supreme Court system, mentioning the implementation of term limits and a more impartial selection process free from partisan influence. He also supports term limits for all elected government positions.
</li><li><b>Access to Birth Control and Feminine Hygiene Products</b>: Gura argues for the provision of free birth control, condoms, and feminine hygiene products. He believes that easy access to these products could significantly improve lives due to their fundamental nature.
</li><li><b>Mandatory Paid Family Leave</b>: Gura advocates for the provision of mandatory paid family leave for both mother and father upon the birth of a new child. He asserts that this policy would contribute to better caregiving and education for children, ultimately leading to improved future adults.
</li><li><b>Reducing workweek hours</b>: Leo Gura proposes reduction of the traditional 40 hours workweek to 30 hours. This change would allow for more self-actualization, creativity, and improved quality of life, preventing workaholism.
</li><li><b>Overhauling education</b>: Gura advocates for a massive investment in education by the government, prioritising more schools, smaller class sizes, and increased incentives for teachers. Emphasis should be on teaching critical and conscious thinking, love, and emotional intelligence rather than a focus on memorization.
</li><li><b>Removing privatization of public schools</b>: Gura argues against the privatization of public schools. His position is that wealth-based education systems create disparities in quality, leading to rich individuals attending private schools and leaving public schools underfunded. To mitigate this, he proposes a uniform public school system that is funded equally regardless of the community wealth.
</li><li><b>Redistribution of the military budget</b>: Gura proposes a significant cut in the military budget with a majority of the funds redirected towards improving public school education.
</li><li><b>Changing the structure of corporations</b>: Gura points out that developments in technology have greatly improved work efficiency but the financial gains mainly benefit the top tier of corporations rather than the workers. He contends that regulations should be enforced to ensure financial gains are distributed more evenly within corporations. 
</li><li><b>Prohibition of overworking employees</b>: Gura strongly advocates for regulations to prevent employers from overworking their employees, noting that this is especially common in the video game design and legal industries. Overworking, he argues, is unhealthy, encourages toxic competition, and hampers creativity.
</li><li><b>Education System Overhaul</b>: Leo Gura advocates for transforming the education system to focus on critical thinking rather than merely teaching students what to think. He proposes greater choice for students in choosing subjects they are passionate about.
</li><li><b>Incorporation of Mindfulness and Consciousness</b>: Gura believes schools should incorporate mindfulness, meditation, mysticism, spirituality, yoga, and consciousness as central elements of the curriculum. He suggests introducing classes on metaphysics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and developmental psychology. 
</li><li><b>Teaching Practical Life Skills</b>: Gura highlights the importance of teaching practical skills such as cooking, nutrition, finance, business, and marketing. He advocates for the inclusion of lessons on conscious relationships, masculinity, femininity, and parenting.
</li><li><b>Education on Conscious Politics</b>: Gura proposes teaching students about conscious politics to later enable a higher quality of voting. He also insists on comprehensive sex and science-based drug education.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Study Abroad Programs</b>: Gura supports promoting study abroad programs to help students gain a broader cultural understanding, which, in turn, promotes tolerance and broadens perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Development</b>: Gura argues that finding life purpose should be a goal for every student. He believes that secondary education should set up students with the skills necessary for securing a job and meeting basic survival needs.
</li><li><b>Change in National Success Measurement</b>: Besides GDP, Gura proposes other factors such as happiness, love, consciousness, and corruption indexes to measure and publicly track a nation's annual success. 
</li><li><b>Ending the Drug War and Promoting Psychedelics</b>: Advocating for the end of the drug war, Gura suggests legalizing and popularizing psychedelics. He calls for opening psychedelic clinics in all neighborhoods for help with addiction treatments.
</li><li><b>Funding for Small Businesses and Objective Journalism</b>: Gura emphasizes the need for substantial funding for small businesses and entrepreneurship. He also stresses the importance of supporting objective journalism and warns against its corruption under rampant capitalism.
</li><li><b>Objective journalism and anti-corruption enforcement</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of serious, objective journalism. He proposes high protection for journalists and increased funding for internet access in rural areas to promote information accessibility. Gura also suggests the establishment of an anti-corruption enforcement agency dedicated to eradicating corruption within government, police, and corporate sectors. 
</li><li><b>Investment in space exploration</b>: Gura advocates the expansion of the space exploration budget, citing its potential for futuristic business fields, technological advancements, and inspiration beyond mundane human pursuits. He also recommends the development of a meteor defense system as a preventative measure against potential extinction-level threats. 
</li><li><b>Funding for public services and consumer protection</b>: Gura calls for better funding for national emergencies and disasters and enhanced protection for national museums, parks, and monuments. He supports a massive expansion of the Consumer Protection Agency, developed to protect consumers against corporate exploitation. 
</li><li><b>Healthcare and fitness</b>: Gura calls for free healthcare, cheap government-produced generics for drugs, increased funding for preventative care, and serious research and development in holistic medicine. Furthermore, he proposes free gym access for all to tackle the obesity issue in America.
</li><li><b>Technology safety regulation</b>: Gura suggests the creation of a government agency responsible for testing new gadgets, technologies, websites, materials, and novel chemicals for safety concerns and radiation issues, such as those related to 5G wireless telephones.
</li><li><b>Humanitarian aid</b>: Gura argues for providing humanitarian aid to countries plagued by terrorism as opposed to military intervention. Assistance could include food, medicine, technology, and other means of improving living conditions and infrastructure.
</li><li><b>Further constitutional amendments</b>: Gura proposes further constitutional amendments to guarantee rights to alter one's consciousness and privacy from electronic surveillance. He also calls for recognition of social media platforms and search engines as public utilities, due to their extensive influence and importance. 
</li><li><b>Funding scientific research</b>: Gura advocates for government-funded research into mysticism, meditation, spirituality, psychedelics, paranormal, and psychic phenomena to enhance understanding of human consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Environment and fiscal policy</b>: Gura supports massive funding for recycling programs, a ban on nuclear power, and advocates for the government to balance its budget, which diverges from many liberals and Democrats. He believes overspending and creating debt for future generations is not the right approach.
</li><li><b>Balanced Budget and Higher Taxes</b>: Gura stresses the importance of balancing the federal budget and if necessary, raising taxes to achieve this. He warns that failure to balance the budget can lead to economic repercussions such as recessions, depressions or collapses. 
</li><li><b>Change in Law-breaking Fines</b>: Gura suggests that fines for breaking the law should be a percentage of net worth rather than a fixed amount. This would ensure that wealthy individuals cannot treat fines as inconsequential, while lower-income individuals bear a disproportionate burden. 
</li><li><b>Gun Regulations</b>: Gura argues for serious background checks and safety measures for gun ownership. He does not advocate bans, rather promoting the ownership of guns to those who have undergone a mandatory rigorous training program, passed mental health and safety checks and registered their guns in a national registry. 
</li><li><b>US Territories</b>: Gura proposes that US territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam either need to be made states or granted independence to ensure fair representation in Congress.
</li><li><b>Regulation on Outsourcing</b>: Companies that outsource jobs to other countries for cheaper labor should be prevented from receiving subsidies and government contracts as per Gura.
</li><li><b>Regulation on Advertising and Marketing</b>: Gura calls for stricter regulation on predatory advertising and marketing, particularly banning ads for junk food, pharmaceuticals, military industrial complex propaganda, fossil fuels, credit cards, and payday loans.
</li><li><b>Empirical Testing of Public Policy</b>: Gura suggests the creation of a government department for the empirical testing of public policies. This department would carefully track the results and impacts of different policies that are enacted, thereby informing politicians and people of the positive or negative impacts. This could help in making better informed policy decisions.
</li><li><b>Empirical Politics and Conscious Capitalism</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that his proposed policies advocate for a more conscious, ethical, and moral form of capitalism, not an end to capitalism itself. This form of capitalism incorporates elements of socialism, but is not socialism. The aim is to evolve capitalism, making it more empirical and less oriented toward materialistic hoarding and exploitation. 
</li><li><b>UBI and Welfare</b>: He touches on Universal Basic Income (UBI), viewing it as a beneficial addition to a robust welfare system, rather than as a replacement for other proposed policies. Leo asserts that while UBI provides financial assistance, it doesn't replace the value provided by clean water, good education, or corruption-free government. 
</li><li><b>Meeting Basic Human Needs</b>: Leo envisages a society where all basic human needs, including food, shelter, education, healthcare, and job security, are comfortably fulfilled. Although this is a long-term goal, he sees it as an inevitable future development. 
</li><li><b>Global Governance and Military</b>: Leo supports the formation of a global government and a singular global military force, aimed at ending internal conflicts between nations and enabling more efficient use of resources. He asserts that such global cooperation could lead to lowered taxes and greater internal focus on improving infrastructure.
</li><li><b>Freedom and Regulation</b>: Leo emphasizes that his proposals aim to increase true freedom, a complex, non-linear concept that requires strategic limitations to balance freedom across systemic elements. He distinguishes his policies from socialism by confirming that they support private property, entrepreneurship, and profit, while curtailing corporatism and corruption. 
</li><li><b>Significance of Private Industry</b>: Leo stresses that his approach still leaves room for private industry and maintains the strong presence of private property. He highlights that his proposal only suggests heavy regulations on giant businesses to prevent monopolization and encourage healthier capitalism.
</li><li><b>Making it harder to become a millionaire or billionaire</b>: Leo Gura asserts that making it harder to become exceptionally wealthy can lead to more economic balance. In his view, wealthy individuals and corporations should face steeper tax obligations, in turn making it easier for lower-income individuals to survive.
</li><li><b>Encouraging creativity and entrepreneurship</b>: The redistribution of wealth also serves to encourage creativity, art, science, innovation, and small businesses. Gura points out that giant corporations can stifle entrepreneurship and, by providing them with more checks, it can lead to an environment that's more favorable for small businesses.
</li><li><b>Goal of government</b>: Gura expands on his vision of an ideal government. The goal, in his view, is to create a system that promotes creativity, exploration, independence, autonomy, health, harmony, fairness, consciousness, love, peace, and happiness. Therefore, the policies he suggests are meant to encourage these principles. However, implementing these may require significant cultural changes.
</li><li><b>Potential objections</b>: Gura proactively addresses potential objections to his approach, particularly the notion that providing individuals with sufficient support might make them lazy or complacent. Gura argues that when people's basic survival needs are met, they then shift to 'being needs' - that is, they seek to self-actualize, to find life purpose, and to contribute creatively and positively to society. Thus, nurturing creativity, love, consciousness, and service serves to enhance the populace's overall sense of fulfillment and happiness. 
</li><li><b>Nature of self-help</b>: Gura concludes by clarifying the intention of his teachings. He acknowledges that many seek self-help resources to meet their basic needs and survive. While such resources are essential and valid, Gura chooses to focus his platform on advanced teachings that promote self-actualization and transcendence, intentionally bypassing discussions about basic survival needs. He believes that happiness lies in transcending physical needs and embodying love. His teachings cater to individuals seeking a transformative perspective on life and self-improvement, beyond survival concerns.
</li><li><b>Transition from Survival Needs to Being Needs</b>: Leo Gura talks about the transition from survival needs to being needs. Society aims not just to satisfy the basic needs, but to support individuals in becoming powerful creators and contributors to society. The culture needs to change to promote earning through powerful, creative contributions rather than just accumulation of wealth. 
</li><li><b>Motivation Beyond Survival</b>: Dismissing the low-consciousness view that people can only be motivated through fear of survival or scarcity, Gura argues people can be motivated by love, creativity, science, art, beauty, and life purpose. This shift fosters a more fulfilling and happy life.
</li><li><b>Corruption Within Government</b>: Leo Gura refutes the notion that higher corruption means that government size should be reduced. Instead, he points out that the corruption within the government should be tackled, while the government grows to manage the complexity of society. The progress in less corruption in government over the past years has been acknowledged.
</li><li><b>Taxation and Property Rights</b>: Contrary to the belief of some that taxation is theft, Leo Gura points out that the concept of theft and property rights does not exist without a government, as there are no property rights in the natural world. Taxation is the cost paid for the property rights, safety and security provided by the government.
</li><li><b>Motivation of the Wealthy</b>: Countering the claim that high taxation on the wealthy will demotivate them from Hardwork and building corporations, Gura explains that wealth is not the only motivator for the wealthy. Other factors such as power, creativity, and a sense of purpose motivate them.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of millionaires' and billionaires' motivations</b>: Contrary to popular belief, people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs are not primarily driven by money, but by a desire for power, fame, success, creativity, artistry, entrepreneurship, challenge, and a sense of life purpose. 
</li><li>- <b>Impact of higher taxes on millionaires and billionaires</b>: Raising taxes on high net worth individuals will not significantly deter them from building companies, inventing new technologies, or hiring employees, as money is not their primary motivator.
</li><li><b>Motivations of conscious individuals</b>: High consciousness individuals are motivated by love, consciousness, and selfless service. Hence, even for them, finances become secondary once basic needs are met.
</li><li><b>Aim of policies</b>: The policies proposed aim to satiate basic needs and promote higher values of love, consciousness, and selfless service in society.
</li><li><b>Arguments against the utopian claim</b>: While the proposals might seem utopian with a decade-long timeframe, they are obvious and inevitable when a timeframe of 500 years is considered. This is due to the inevitable trajectory of human evolution towards higher love and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Inapplicability of Soviet Union, North Korea examples</b>: The failure of such policies in countries like the Soviet Union, North Korea, or Venezuela can be attributed to the lack of developmental and societal infrastructure, corruption, and insufficient levels of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Successful implementation of these policies</b>: Examples of successful implementation of these policies can be found in post-capitalist societies like Northern Europe, Canada, and progressive US states like California.
</li><li><b>Clarification on equality</b>: The overarching aim is not equality of outcome, but equality of opportunity, refuting the claim that these proposals aim for everyone to have identical salaries.
</li><li><b>Assumptions about equality of opportunity</b>: Leo Gura addresses misconceptions about equality of opportunity, stating that it is not automatically granted and currently, far from it. He suggests that one way to improve equality of opportunity is by examining the outcomes. Differences in incomes and success rates among different groups of people indicate where systemic disadvantages exist. He refutes the idea that advocating for increased equality of opportunity equates wanting equality of outcome. He clarifies social justice warriors seek a more equitable society, not equal outcomes.
</li><li><b>Focus on conscious work and self-improvement</b>: Gura proposes a shift towards conscious work, where individuals find deep meaning and purpose in what they do. This type of work is not only more satisfying but also motivates individuals to work harder and longer. He acknowledges that while not everyone can be helped or improved, the goal is to create an environment that empowers the majority of people to grow.
</li><li><b>Resistance and evolution</b>: Acknowledging the resistance that will be faced from status quo, Leo asserts that this doesn't make the implementation of reforms impossible. He views the desired changes as part of societal evolution towards higher consciousness, increased love and greater unity, where even those who resist the changes contribute to the evolution process.
</li><li><b>Radical or visionary</b>: Leo responds to the label of being radical, arguing that from the perspective of a society in the "dark ages", any vision of higher consciousness and love will seem radical. He calls for judging ideas not on their radicality but their ability to promote higher consciousness and love. He points out that throughout history, highly conscious people have been viewed as radical visionaries in their own times but are vindicated and celebrated in hindsight.
</li><li><b>Brainwashing from the Status Quo</b>: Gura suggests that people's perspective is shaped by the status quo, which has brainwashed them into perceiving radical shifts in consciousness as outrageous or impossible. Because the majority of society is entangled in the status quo, visions that challenge it are often dismissed. He motivates listeners to surpass society's limited potential and explore greater individual and collective development. He argues we are still in a societal "dark age" and can aspire to much more.
</li><li><b>Individual and Collective Growth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes life progression, acknowledging change as uncomfortable but fundamental for both individuals and entities such as a society or a country. He asserts that current political tension and rivalry among social and political groups can be viewed as part of this collective growth process or as an indication that society is evolving.
</li><li><b>Turning Knowledge into Tangible Actions</b>: He urges individuals to take responsibility for societal problems, not laying the blame on unknown entities or different ideologies. He recommends extensive self-education on complex societal topics such as philosophy, sociology, psychology, spirituality, social science, and economics to be adequately informed and approach discussions from a non-partisan perspective.
</li><li><b>High-Quality Objective Journalism and Civic Responsibility</b>: Gura advocates for rigorous and credible journalism and urges his viewers to support high-quality news sources. In addition to this, he underscores the importance of active democratic participation through voting, not only in general presidential elections but also in primary elections and for local government officials.
</li><li><b>Selection Criteria for Political Leaders</b>: According to Gura, the qualities to look for in political candidates to vote for are love, consciousness, selflessness, and high moral development. These qualities, he asserts, are even more important than the specific policies the candidates promise to implement.
</li><li><b>Engagement in Local and State Politics</b>: He encourages viewers to donate to the most conscious candidates and politicians, volunteer, run for office, and get involved in local and state politics, stressing that democracy requires active participation and responsibility.
</li><li><b>Focus on Personal Development and Self-Improvement</b>: Leo Gura highlights the necessity of personal development and self-improvement not just as an individual goal, but as a contribution to conscious politics. He concludes by reiterating the importance of consciousness work, purification from corruption, love, meditation, and yoga in personal and political growth.
</li><li><b>Outlook for Future Videos</b>: Leo confirms that after branching into politics, future videos will return to the topics of awakening, self-improvement, emotions, love, and spirituality. He underlines the importance of viewing spirituality and politics as interconnected, stating that the goal of achieving a conscious government can only be realized when spirituality and politics are discussed together.
