            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/fV7uzssqIYo' target='_blank'>How To Become Rich - The Number One Reason You're Not Already Rich</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Becoming a Creator as a Path to Wealth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the vital role of being a creator to attain wealth. According to Gura, those who wish to become rich should create something of value. In contrast to poor individuals who often trade their services to an employer, he suggests putting oneself in a position to create more wealth by generating more value in the world, such as creating more content or projects in one's field.  
</li><li><b>Control over Creations</b>: Leo advises people to establish control over their creations, explaining that though employees may be creating something at their work, the ownership belongs to the company or the boss, which limits their potential for wealth. He highlights the frustration that employees often face when they cannot exercise creative control due to lack of authority.
</li><li><b>Wealth as Value</b>: Similar to concepts shared by Jim Rohn, Leo states that wealth translates to the value one can generate for the world and others. To generate more wealth, one should position themselves to create more value in the world. He cautions against simply working harder at one's current job and suggests finding ways to express oneself more or creating one's own business for larger creative output.
</li><li><b>Creativity and Expressiveness</b>: For Leo, a creator is someone who is fully expressive in their work, caring about the impact their output has on humanity. Being a creator, according to him, is not an inherent trait but something one can cultivate. Transforming oneself into a creator can lead to enjoying the work process more, gaining more passion and drive, and eventually becoming financially successful.
</li><li><b>Creating Something Remarkable</b>: The key to wealth, as per Leo, is creating something exceptional or remarkable. Ordinary or mediocre work does not lead to richness. It's crucial to develop projects or services that stand out, triggering a "wow" reaction. This section reinforces the importance of being an extraordinary creator in the path towards obtaining wealth.
</li><li><b>Taking Responsibility is Vital to Wealth Creation</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of taking full ownership for one's life rather than blaming external circumstances or individuals for one's inability to achieve wealth. He points out common excuses individuals use, such as blaming their boss, parents, health, or financial situation - all of which are seen as hurdles to getting richer. Gura argues that these hurdles are mental constructs people create to victimize themselves and avoid taking responsibility. 
</li><li><b>Being a Victim is Limiting</b>: Gura explains how playing the victim role not only limits one's opportunities but also causes one to forfeit their power to these external elements or circumstances. He proposes that individuals unconsciously choose to remain victims because it provides an excuse to avoid taking on the challenging process of change and self-improvement. 
</li><li><b>Embracing Responsibility Opens Opportunities</b>: Gura underscores the liberating and empowering potential of accepting full responsibility for all aspects of life. He affirms that making a conscious choice to eliminate negative, victim-focused thinking and assuming full responsibility for life's happenings is the key to unlocking potential and rewriting one's life narrative.
</li><li><b>Fear of Potential as a Success Barrier</b>: Gura also discusses the barrier that fear often poses on the path to taking responsibility. He suggests that individuals often fear claiming their full potential because of the hard work and commitment it would demand. By failing to recognize this fear as self-created and overcoming it, individuals limit their success and wealth attainment.
</li><li><b>Wealth Generation Requires a Long-term Vision</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of a long-term vision and sustained effort in generating wealth. He discourages expecting instant results or looking for ways to earn quick cash, and instead, advocates for applying responsibility taking every day. This, he believes, is crucial in transforming one's financial situation and life overall.
</li><li><b>Focus on Self-improvement Resources</b>: He encourages viewers to check out the free resources available on Actualized.org to help master their psychology, bust limiting beliefs, and create an extraordinary life. He highlights that mastering one's mindset and building a strong internal framework is fundamental to progress and success in any sphere of life.
