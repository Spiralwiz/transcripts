[Music] how socialization makes you stupid in this episode we're
going to talk about the dangers of conformity and group
think i deliberately gave this episode a rather flamboyant bombastic
title sort of a controversial title that will trigger some
people i wanted to frame it very starkly for you
because this issue is much more serious than most people
realize and this is what we'll be elaborating upon here
so the way i came across this idea really is
i've been socializing a lot over the last year i've
been going out talking to lots of people in the
last year i've probably approached and talked to at least
3 000 strangers maybe even more like i've socialized more
in the last year than maybe i have ever in
my life like a lot and i've been noticing the
kind of effect it has on my mind and especially
lately the last few years i've just become a lot
more conscious than i ever used to be and you
know i've gone through phases of lots of socialization in
the past in my life but i wasn't as conscious
back then as i am now and so now when
i'm out socializing i'm sort of hyper meta aware of
the effect that this socialization has on me and it's
very interesting just to observe so i started just kind
of contemplating all this and thinking about it mulling it
over and what i realized which of course isn't anything
new to me i knew this my whole life but
i realized even more starkly that i've never been a
highly social person it's just antithetical to my character structure
and to my personality and i started wondering why that
is why is that i've struggled with socialization in the
past i used to be very shy very introverted i
still am very introverted but i've trained myself to become
extroverted on command when necessary but still my natural tendency
is to be very introverted and i was just wondering
you know why did i struggle with this for my
whole life and i still struggle with it to this
day and like why and what i discovered is that
there's something actually deep there it's a lot deeper than
i used to think of it as and what i
really started to realize is that i don't really like
socializing but then i wondered well but why what what's
really behind that and here's what's really behind it for
me is because i find that it interferes with my
highest values it betrays being my authentic self it interferes
with original thinking and it takes me further away from
truth which is one of my highest values but it
also takes me further away from other high values that
i have i noticed that socialization introduces a pressure on
me to conform to the values of the people i'm
socializing with and to get mired in group think now
you might say well leo but isn't that just like
um you know a limiting belief you have does it
really have to be that way is that inherent to
socialization itself or is that just because you're doing it
wrong and so i was thinking about that you know
how do you socialize while still living up to your
highest values and not betraying yourself and being an original
thinker and being authentic to yourself is that possible and
of course to some degree that is possible i'm not
trying to instill you with this limiting belief that you
can't socialize and learn to be more authentic to yourself
and still maintain some of your values you certainly can
get better at that the trouble is though is that
it it requires energy and effort to do that you
have to do it very consciously to pull that off
and in most cases most people don't succeed very well
at pulling that off and there are hidden pressures and
trade-offs even if you're doing it all as best as
possible there's still hidden costs to socializing that you're probably
not aware of and so that's what i want to
talk about but certainly it's possible to socialize in a
way where you completely betray yourself and this would be
a disastrous situation where you completely betray your authentic self
completely betray your values and become a doormat and completely
subscribe to groupthink and conformity that's definitely possible that's not
what i'm talking about in this episode that degree of
low quality socialization i'm not even talking about and a
lot of people struggle with that problem i've i faced
that in school and earlier in my you know experiences
with socializing these days i have developed enough backbone and
understanding of my own authentic values and priorities in life
and my authentic self that these days when i socialize
i can be pretty firm on you know maintaining my
values and that and not um not sort of selling
myself or whoring myself out you might say but still
that still isn't the ideal situation there's still sacrifices that
are being made there even if you're doing it perfectly
that's the point i'm trying to make here what i
find is that the more that i socialize the more
i feel myself pulled into a hive mind of stupidity
and again this is this is a little bit tricky
i'm making some nuanced and subtle points here i'm going
to underscore the nuance even more later in this episode
but already i need to preface because some of you
guys will misunderstand it might sound like i'm denigrating socialization
and i'm telling you that you shouldn't socialize that's actually
not my point socialization plays an important role in your
development and in your success and even in your happiness
as a human being so again listen to what i
told you i spent the last year socializing with thousands
of strangers right so it's not like i don't do
it and i'm not being a hypocrite here for on
the one hand socializing and on the other hand denouncing
socialization i'm making a subtle point that there's trade-offs and
costs to socialize that you need to be aware of
that you're probably not aware of right now so that's
what we'll be explaining here before we get to that
i have a a quote here from a famous psychologist
eric frum from his book the sane society here's what
he writes quote what kind of men then does our
society need what is the social character suited to 20th
century capitalism it needs men who cooperate smoothly in large
groups who want to consume more and more and whose
tasks are standardized and can easily be influenced and anticipated
it needs men who feel free and independent not subject
to any authority or principle or conscience and yet willing
to be commanded to do what is expected to fit
into the social machine without friction end quote think about
that my claim is that most people are dumb simply
from the conformity that comes from loss of socialization and
most people are highly social and as a result they
tend not to think any original thoughts and their minds
are rotted to the core with group think and this
is true not just of socialite dumb people this is
true of even very smart and successful people even they
are made dumb by socialization i'm talking about scientists academics
ceos entrepreneurs and even [Music] very spiritual people people that
are part of the new age community the buddhist community
other kinds of spiritual communities and what you find when
you really analyze these people when you analyze the millionaires
and the billionaires the people on tv the influencers the
celebrities the public intellectuals even what you notice is that
they are constantly parroting things that they have heard from
elsewhere they are not actually thinking and speaking original thoughts
they are creating echo chambers for themselves and they are
living and succeeding within these echo chambers and these echo
chambers become very seductive and it's precisely because you can
become so successful by playing within these echo chambers that
people get locked into them and never find their way
out and this is the trap that i want to
make you aware of only recently have i started to
appreciate how much work original thinking involves i've done a
lot of original thinking in my life so much so
and i've held myself back from socializing and from group
think so much in my life that i almost sort
of take for granted the intellectual work that i do
thinking that everybody does this kind of intellectual work and
only recently am i realizing like no actually it's the
opposite almost nobody does it oh but almost nobody does
original intellectual work not even many intellectuals and it takes
a lot of work it takes so much work that
like recently by stopping doing it because i've been going
out socializing a lot actually i'm noticing the relief and
stress that i experience by not doing it it's almost
like i've been you know going to the gym my
entire life and then i stopped going to the gym
for a year and i noticed like oh my god
life is so much easier when you're not going to
the gym because you know go to the gym you're
struggling all the time now of course if you don't
go to the gym for a long time then life
can actually become harder than just going to the gym
regularly but you get the idea and why is this
topic important why am i talking about it here at
such length it's really for the following reason i've discovered
levels of intelligence in my own life recently i've reached
levels of intelligence that very few human beings have reached
and i was thinking about what enabled me what allowed
me to reach these levels of intelligence and one of
the conclusions i came to is that i was able
to do it by avoiding socializing and group think a
lot in my life and the level that i'm at
right now what i'm most interested in with what i
teach is really helping people to access these super human
levels of consciousness and intelligence i'm finding myself more and
more in love with just pure intelligence exploring the highest
possibilities of the mind with pure understanding and the amount
of joy and satisfaction and we might say meaning that
this has added to my life this is one of
the greatest gifts that i can help you to access
in your life that i feel the majority of mankind
is just missing out on the majority of mankind has
not fallen in love with intelligence and from this a
lot of joy could come that isn't coming in your
life and one of my highest goals now is to
help to guide others towards these superhuman levels of intelligence
that i've been able to access and actually doing that
is going to take many more episodes we're not even
going to just we're only just scratching the surface of
it here this is like the introduction in this episode
for this goal that i have for the work that
i'm doing going forward because conformity and group think are
really the chief obstacles to achieving such levels of intelligence
and so that's the first step and then there will
be other steps just knowing about this is not going
to be enough to reach the super human levels of
intelligence that are possible after my recent batch of awakenings
i've been able to access levels of intelligence that just
aren't blowing my mind uh it's hard for me like
i've it's hard for me to even believe that this
is possible for a mind to do and the ways
in which my mind is working now and the way
it's completely contemplating and thinking is like a whole order
of magnitude beyond the way that it functioned in the
past so something about these recent awakenings has really expanded
my capacity to think in very abstract and different ways
than most humans think very non-linear ways which i'll be
trying to explain in the future i still struggle to
explain exactly what the difference is in my style of
thinking but there's like a qualitative difference in how my
mind is working and it's very fascinating i'm still exploring
that and figuring out how do i communicate how do
i talk about it but this is the beginning of
that process so there is a serious cost to being
social that almost nobody tells you about and the cost
is that your mind as you be more social gets
infected with memes values and frames frameworks ways of thinking
that are of the herd and there's actually a good
reason why throughout history uh the most intelligent men tended
to be loners hermits ascetics recluses and virgins and i
don't just use the word men accidentally but actually deliberately
because and this might sound kind of sexist but it's
interesting that if you observe how men socialize and how
women socialize just generally speaking of course this is just
generalizations these are generalizations you can certainly find women that
are more intelligent than men but generally speaking if you
accept the premise that socializing makes you stupid and hey
many people will argue with me on that premise and
reject that premise we'll get back to that so i
still have to sort of demonstrate that and kind of
support the case for it um but if you accept
that premise and then you also understand that the majority
of women are much more social than men are and
the reason that is because a woman's survival and reproduction
hinges much more on her being social than it does
for most men and the reason that is because it's
easier for a man to survive as a loner than
it is for a woman to survive as a loner
it's a lot more socially acceptable for a man to
go to a club by himself than it is for
a woman to go to a club by herself it's
a lot safer for a man to walk down a
dark alley by himself than for a woman to walk
down a dark alley by herself these differences are real
and in the past they used to be even starker
than they are today because modern technology sort of evens
the strength the physical strength of men and women out
whereas in the past that was more of a stark
difference but anyways just what i notice is that women
in general are much more social creatures than men are
now of course some men are ridiculously social but just
you know on average and if you look at the
deepest intellectuals and geniuses of history um they tended to
be reclusive men i'm talking about the albert einsteins the
isaac newton's uh the nikola teslas of the world now
again i'm not saying there's not female geniuses of course
there can be and there were um but what i'd
like to suggest is that this is not an accident
because socialization takes a lot of energy and not only
does it take time and energy away from the intellectual
work you could otherwise be doing you know the the
five hours that you spend going to a nightclub you
could have spent those five hours meditating contemplating doing science
or being creative in some other way right so there's
just that obvious trade-off but there's an even deeper trade-off
than just that it's not just that you're losing time
and energy it's also that when you're socializing you are
becoming the average of the minds with which you are
socializing and what kind of minds are you socializing with
are you socializing with geniuses and mystics and sages probably
not you're probably socializing with rather low consciousness people and
even if you are socializing with academics in academic circles
and with the world's greatest scientists my point is that
you are still subscribing yourself to group think and to
various frames of thinking of the herd of that tribe
even if it's a very intelligent tribe and you are
in a subtle way getting brainwashed and you are falling
into conformity there and you are robbing yourself of truly
original thought and that is a very real trade-off and
real cost so what i'm saying here is that no
matter how conscious of a social circle you cultivate no
matter how many geniuses are in your social circle how
many ceos and world-class experts and phds you socialize with
fundamentally it's still making you stupid now that's a rather
controversial claim that i think a lot of people will
disagree with me on but just open your mind to
this possibility you know don't believe me what i'm suggesting
is that you just open your mind to this possibility
consider that there might be some serious trade-offs to socializing
and that doesn't mean that i'm saying you should never
socialize it simply means understand the trade-offs and then make
a conscious choice about whether you accept those trade-offs or
not or really even more practically you know decide for
yourself how much you want to socialize versus how much
time you want to spend in solitude in intellectual pursuits
and so forth and also just kind of like decide
for yourself you know what are your priorities and values
i'm not saying that there's one perfect balancing point for
every person people are different some people are more intellectual
some people are more extroverted some people get more joy
from socializing other people don't you know so you're gonna
have to find like your balancing point and it can
be significantly different for different people and it'll also be
significantly different at different points in your life maybe at
this point in your life you need to socialize a
lot more to achieve certain goals and then at another
point in your life you'll back off from that and
you'll become more of a you know of a hermit
and then you'll use that to achieve certain other goals
and you can you can strike those different balances at
different points and chapters in your life that's all fine
i'm just trying to make you aware of these trade-offs
it makes sense this is not really rocket science that
the more social you are the more minds you commune
with through talking and proximity the more social conditioning you're
going to receive and the more you start to think
like those around you the less original thoughts of your
own you're going to have because you're just going to
have less time and less room in your mind for
original thinking and also it makes sense that when you're
working in teams of people whether it's a group of
friends that you're all trying to like you know figure
out which restaurant to go to or you're working with
some you know some team at the office to accomplish
some project maybe you have 10 employees working together to
effectively function as part of a team you have to
sacrifice yourself you know as they say there's no i
in teamwork you have to surrender parts of yourself and
you have to make compromises to fit and function in
a team now again there are beautiful aspects to working
in a team and there's important things that can be
accomplished in a team that cannot be accomplished solo however
there are also things that can be accomplished solo that
cannot be accomplished in a team and there are costs
to sacrificing yourself for the team and what kind of
team are you sacrificing yourself for is that actually in
your favor maybe it is maybe it isn't this is
something that needs to be thought about more consciously and
not just done automatically mindlessly the way that people do
it and so basically there's going to be pressure on
you when you're part of a team or even just
a group of friends there's going to be pressure on
you to conform and to give up some of your
priorities and values for the team now you might even
say well leo but isn't that good because it's like
you have to become almost more selfless to become part
of a team to be a good team player requires
selflessness yes that can be a good thing however becoming
a team player can also yes in a certain sense
it makes you more selfless but also it can make
you betray your authentic self betray your values betray what
you really want in life just going along with the
herd and then this herd could be walking off a
cliff this herd oftentimes these teams and these herds are
involved in very shallow low consciousness survival activities or even
just downright devilry and evil in the case of many
ideological political movements or religious organizations or certain corporations low
conscious corporations certain kinds of criminal enterprises you know the
mafia for example the groups that many people are part
of they're not very conscious groups what are they really
up to and so as you do that consider the
possibility that you become less capable of deep intelligence the
people you surround yourself with reinforce your worldview they create
a kind of echo chamber can you see the problems
that that might lead to especially if you value deep
intelligence now if you don't value deep intelligence then there's
no problem and a lot of people don't value deep
intelligence in fact that is the problem with many groups
that you will socialize with and many people you will
socialize with that that they simply don't value deep intelligence
but the question is do you i do for me
personally it's a source of some of the greatest joy
in my life i think that could be true for
you as well if you're into my content in which
case this is an issue for you you have to
look at what's holding you back from the deepest levels
of intelligence that you're capable of and maybe what that
is is the people you're socializing with your mind will
become the average of your friends if you socialize with
them long enough and this is more dangerous than it
seems because i'm willing to bet that most of your
friends are not highly conscious sage-like people who are spiro
dynamic stage turquoise or the like most of them are
probably tier one individuals with rather low levels of cognitive
moral and spiritual development and ego development on that susan
greuter model that i talked about in the past and
then see what happens is that you get a lot
of goodies for your ability to socialize which is why
people socialize why do people love to socialize so much
because it gives you a lot of easy goodies these
goodies then make you blind to the costs that are
involved in getting these goodies the trade-offs what are these
goodies well success business opportunities friendships fun parties you can
go to of course sex approval validation likes status power
fame money and ultimately love these are the goodies you
could carve out an entire survival strategy for yourself in
life and become extraordinarily successful you could become a millionaire
and even a billionaire simply through your capacity to socialize
if you do it really strategically and effectively and not
only will you become successful but you'll you'll have a
lot of friends you'll get invited to amazing parties exclusive
clubs you'll have lots of sex with really attractive and
famous people and people will give you lots of validation
and approval your life will be easier you'll have people
you can rely on that will help you when you're
out of money or when you're feeling depressed you'll have
status and fame you'll be somebody in your community within
your tribe can you see how that becomes a trap
though can you see that once you have all that
how hard it is to give that up can you
see that once you have all that your mind won't
even want to question what the costs of getting it
were because the goodies are just so juicy and so
good who cares about the cost who cares if i
had to sacrifice deep levels of superhuman intelligence in order
to acquire all these goodies even just one of these
goodies by itself can be enough to get you to
surrender your interest in truth or intelligence like for example
sex or friendship or business opportunities that make you millions
of dollars or the fame and status that you get
just just one of those can be enough never mind
the entire basket of all of them combined together and
they usually tend to come together you know if if
you have lots of friends it's a lot easier for
you to get sex and if you have a lot
of friends it's a lot easier for you to get
job opportunities because you know one of your friends is
going to know somebody who knows somebody who has a
job that's how it works traditionally this is how humans
developed their massive levels of success and wealth in societies
they didn't do it as loners they did it through
uh through the social networks that they built and then
leveraging those social networks and then those people who were
unskilled at doing that those people failed they didn't become
wealthy they didn't become powerful they didn't have lots of
sex and um you know they died childless because nobody
would date them for example that's traditionally how it worked
uh our society now modern society actually makes it easier
for you to be a lone wolf in less developed
societies like in the middle east it's very difficult to
survive as a lone wolf primitives the more primitive the
society the more tribal it is the more you need
to be a team player and also the more conformity
and group think takes hold of you and the more
those people behave like a herd of sheep what i
want you to notice is the following do not make
the mistake of confusing success that you get from socializing
and people looking up to you as being smart and
intelligent because you're good at socializing and because that makes
you good at surviving do not confuse that for true
intelligence that's not the intelligence i'm talking about and it's
very easy to confuse those things because you know if
someone's a good manipulator of social networks and is like
very savvy socially very socially calibrated very political you know
politically savvy so to speak and is able to parlay
that into wealth and success in a family and a
big house and business opportunities we say that person is
very intelligent no that person is not very intelligent by
my definition of intelligence so i was reflecting back and
just thinking about you know what is it that allowed
me to achieve the levels of intelligence that i achieved
now in my life and i kind of like looked
through my whole life and also i was just thinking
about you know what is it that makes my work
unique out of all the intellectual work that is out
there in the world and uh one of the things
i identified is that um i was not social in
school and through most of my life and if i
was i would have gotten sucked into the prevailing group
thing and i would have lost my uniqueness and i
would not have been able to make the intellectual achievements
that i've made in my life so actualize.org is the
way that it is precisely because i deliberately didn't socialize
in my youth i avoided that when all the kids
were hanging around in school you know talking about the
same [ __ ] um brainwashing each other into conformity
with their values i was at home doing my own
thing i deliberately rejected the mainstream of philosophy spirituality self-help
science academia business marketing i tried to really go my
own way now was i perfect at this no of
course i still felt prey to various kinds of fads
and trends within popular culture and modes of thinking um
but overall i did much better than most people in
that respect and that opened the gateway for me to
get to where i am today and then and then
now i've reached the point where i'm like i'm so
conscious of how all these social dynamics all this group
think works that i'm going through a process of like
shedding all the remaining remnants of that that i can
find within my own mind no doubt you must have
noticed you know following my work how easily people fall
prey to tribalism partisanship ideologies cults fads investment schemes marketing
ploys exploitative branding various cultural movements radicalization polarization and even
scientific fads have you noticed this this is a theme
of the epistemic work that we've been doing over the
last five years or so we've talked about all the
dangers and traps of this kind of stuff the dangers
of ideology well so what's really going on here well
fundamentally all these problems stem from group think this is
what happens when you get a bunch of people together
and none of them just sit and think independently for
themselves and instead they just bounce ideas off each other
in an echo chamber and the reason that happens is
because it's difficult and stressful to sit alone in a
room by yourself and just think original thoughts it's much
easier just to join some herd and then just kind
of like blithely obliviously go along with wherever they're going
and just kind of trust in the herd or follow
some leader and just trust in that person so i
want you to notice that humans survive in a herd
humans construct self-serving narratives together in a herd they use
each other to reinforce a synthetic augmented reality that they
project upon the world and by using each other they
all buttress and support each other in such a way
that this synthetic augmented reality becomes indistinguishable from physical reality
these are themes i've discussed elsewhere go see my other
episodes for example understanding survival part 1 and part 2
how survival shapes who you are collective ego and how
ideology works go see those episodes for more on this
idea i want you to think about how your survival
is shaped by the herd or the tribe that you're
surviving inside of think about the social survival pressures upon
you and how they constrain and limit your mind and
your intelligence and also of course consider how they enable
you to so you do get benefits from the tribe
and the herd for example going to school all the
good aspects of education and going to school you know
these you inherited from the herd the only reason you
know mathematics for example is because it was part of
the tribe and the herd that you grew up in
otherwise you wouldn't know mathematics now is it a good
thing that you know mathematics i would probably say overall
yeah it's a good thing that you know mathematics even
though you were indoctrinated into it it wasn't an original
intellectual achievement of your own but it's still probably good
that the average person knows mathematics so that's good however
have you considered the cost what was the cost of
that also i'd like you to think deeply about how
you want to position yourself within society especially you youngsters
if you're in your teens in your 20s your whole
life is still ahead of you and what you should
be thinking about is how do you want to strategically
position yourself within society because you're basically in society without
a choice you have no choice about whether you're going
to be in society or not unless you're just going
to be living on some remote island you're part of
society so it's going to be the question of how
are you going to be positioned within society and what
pressures will that position exert upon you and your values
is it going to be exerting a pressure that impinges
on your highest values and priorities what do i mean
by positioning yourself within society for example let's say that
you're going to be working at starbucks for 30 years
as a manager of a starbucks do you understand that
working as a manager of starbucks for 30 years that
this places severe constraints on your mind it has to
in order for you to be able to fulfill that
position and not get fired what kind of constraints is
that going to place on your mind creatively artistically philosophically
spiritually morally cognitively developmentally you see or if you position
yourself as a professor in a university system at harvard
or mit or whatever you know if you're a youngster
you might have this kind of fantasy of like i
want to become one of these well-known professors at one
of these top universities that sounds like a good position
to angle for but i want you to really consider
the kind of constraints and limits this is going to
place upon your mind and your development i'm not saying
don't do it i'm just saying consider where you're going
to be strategically if you become a professor at harvard
for example maybe that's perfect for you maybe you're happy
with the constraints and limits that harvard places upon you
but maybe you're not think that through like what do
you want for example do you care about truth do
you care about god do you care about love do
you care about consciousness do you care about art and
creativity do you care about profound intelligence and jail breaking
your mind do you care about not selling out do
you care about not being um compromised by forces of
capitalism and financial pressures of various kinds if you care
about those things then consider how positioning yourself within a
certain institution or a tribe is going to impinge upon
those for example when i was in university i wanted
to become an academic philosopher a professional professor basically a
philosophy but then i started thinking about well but what
is actually going to be my position within academia and
the university system what am i going to have to
do to get those positions because those positions are not
easy to get they're coveted in rare positions but let's
say you get a professorship with tenure at a prestigious
university what's going to be the cost of that and
what i realized very quickly when i was only 20
years old is that my my actual priority and value
was truth that's why i was doing philosophy and that
if i positioned myself in one of these universities as
a professor i would not be able to live up
to and honor that value and priority of truth it
would impinge upon that truth would become a secondary or
tertiary matter while playing by the game of academia would
become the top concern and top priority in order to
maintain and to attain that kind of professorship position and
when i realized that i said well i don't want
to position myself that way and so i didn't consider
how your position in the tribe affects your intellectual sovereignty
that's deep here's a key insight for you original thought
is rare and precious the act of original thinking is
difficult highly valuable and rare almost nobody is thinking from
scratch your thinking is biased by social conditioning and your
position within society how you're surviving how you're supporting your
family how you're feeding yourself how you're paying your mortgage
this places limits upon your mind make that connection and
then sort of think backwards and kind of like reverse
engineer uh what position you want to take in society
based upon how free your mind you want your mind
to be like what kind of position do i need
to have in society in order to have the freedom
of mind that i want to have think about it
like that now see in order to think your mind
has to frame things in certain specific ways i call
these frames you might also call these paradigms socialization programs
your mind with various ready-made frames that you can use
now these frames can be very handy but they could
also be limited because these frames lock down your mind's
full freedom and true intelligence and to access this this
these super human levels of intelligence i'm talking about you
have to deconstruct and free your mind of these frames
these frames are like ways of seeing the world and
seeing situations and thinking about situations and these ways it's
like a box that you think inside of that you
don't really question and this frame comes with various kinds
of assumptions and expectations it's like different grooves that your
mind can go down to think down think of grooves
on a record and the needle goes and follows the
grooves that's kind of how your mind works with these
frames for here's a few examples of what i mean
by by these frames for example when we ask the
question like what is spirituality how do you conceive of
and think of what spirituality is what its importance is
what its meaning is what it's about you probably have
some kind of frame you were given based on which
books you read or teachers you listened to or you
know what your priest said in church the church you
went to or maybe the spiritual tradition that you are
subscribed to like let's let's say you're a buddhist right
buddhism presents a very specific frame for spirituality like you
might think well spirituality is about meditating or spirituality is
about escaping suffering eliminating all suffering or spirituality is about
liberation see just these like labels and words that you
heard as part of the echo chamber of buddhism these
got stuck in your mind to the point where your
your average buddhist cannot think of spirituality outside of buddhism
and i'm not just saying here just like that some
buddhist is just like behaving like a fundamentalist christian no
no the average buddhist is is much more developed than
a fundamentalist christian so that's not the problem i mean
fundamentalism is such a stupid and limiting constraint on the
mind that i'm not even talking about it here it's
so stupid i'm talking about something more subtle and more
nuanced you can be a very intelligent academic buddhist for
example and you think that you're being very intelligent about
your spirituality because you're not a fundamentalist and maybe you're
even open to other religions you're not just exclusively buddhist
but you're also open to hinduism you're open to yoga
you're even open to christianity and islam and you might
say well yeah i'm kind of these one of these
open-minded buddhists you know that is not like dogmatically militantly
buddhist and therefore leo this is not a problem for
me no it's a problem for you buddhism presents frames
of how to think about spirituality this is a problem
because actually buddhism prevents you believe it or not from
accessing superhuman levels of not consciousness but intelligence or for
example what is science you have certain frames about what
the word science means what it is what it isn't
you got these frames from school or elsewhere and you
think about science in this very limited fashion based on
the frames you were given you know however you define
scientific method or whatever else you might have ideas of
like who the ideal scientist is you know the ideal
scientist you might say is albert einstein or isaac newton
or whoever then you go and you try to emulate
those people in your quest to become a great scientist
yourself for example and these frames were all implicitly programmed
into your mind as you were growing up you're not
even questioning it right the average scientist at mit is
going about the pursuit of being a scientist in such
a conformist manner that they have no access to superhuman
levels of intelligence that i'm talking about as a result
of this other examples of frames might be materialism we've
talked about that in the past a lot you know
evolution is a frame looking at everything in terms of
evolution like this is evolving that's evolving you know evolution
is a huge frame that many scientifically-minded people just adopt
without really questioning it seriously what does it mean what
is evolution what are its limits what are alternatives to
evolution right see like once you get the frame of
evolution stuck in your mind like everything to you will
look like evolution just you know as as the old
saying goes when you have a hammer when all you
have is a hammer everything looks like a nail that's
the problem with these frames or for example you know
simulation theory a lot of people these days are are
just so conformist about you know they think they're doing
deep philosophy by thinking about simulation theory but trace where
you got the idea of simulation theory from you know
the whole idea of we're in the matrix man you
know a lot of people say oh we're in the
matrix let's escape the matrix they're just parroting they're just
parroting words you can tell they're just parodying words they
heard from elsewhere they're not thinking deeply about what the
matrix is or what simulation theory is or whether it's
even true or whether it's even a good idea they
think they're being smart when they're talking about these things
but they're just parroting ideas computer analogies are very popular
these days why is that you know when you're thinking
about the mind or the brain you think about computers
you make computer analogies and operating systems and this and
that and i've done that in the past um so
i'm not saying that's completely invalid but a lot of
people will use these analogies without really thinking about where
they're getting their analogies from they're thinking of humans in
terms of computers but is that really a valid analogy
where did that come from did you even think about
it no you're just parroting these analogies because it's part
of the zeitgeist the culture so these are some examples
of frames and these need to be questioned broken down
in order to truly unleash your full intelligence so one
of the most important things i'm doing now for myself
is identifying and deconstructing all these kinds of frames that
i've imbibed over the last 10 years especially of studying
all the stuff that i teach you know i've been
studying psychology philosophy sociology developmental psychology spirituality non-duality buddhism christianity
this blah blah blah and that science quantum mechanics evolutionary
theory chaos do you write all this kind of stuff
that was all good and important you know i still
recommend you read those books on my book list which
talk about all those things but see now to reach
the the really high levels of intelligence that i'm interested
in i have to deconstruct all those frames and question
all those frames and go beyond all those frames and
especially all the spiritual frames that i received and i
noticed in myself that one of the biggest things that's
holding me back from actualizing my highest intelligence is precisely
all the bad framing i got from non-dual teachers and
now i have to go and uproot all that from
my mind it's like bad software to use the computer
analogy it's like bad software that needs to be updated
which means you have to first uninstall it before you
can install the new version within our culture and society
intelligence is improperly defined and measured this is one of
the problems this is one of the meta problems i
have an episode called the social matrix speaking of another
analogy you know the social matrix that was an important
episode um the social matrix misdefines intelligence and the reason
does that is because the majority of humans are stupid
if you ask a stupid person for a definition of
intelligence he's going to give you a bad definition a
stupid person's idea of intelligence is not going to be
very intelligent so the social matrix confuses success and survival
with intelligence confuses social success socialization and social approval and
status with intelligence confuses academia and knowledge with intelligence confuses
left brain calculation abilities and stuff like you know iq
and solving logical puzzles as intelligence while of course those
activities do require some degree of intelligence there are many
degrees of intelligence beyond what the social matrix tells you
about i want us to redefine what intelligence is to
include wisdom and love in other words if it's not
wise and loving it doesn't deserve to be called intelligent
so for example if some shrewd business person uses his
intellect to devise some sort of scheme like a pyramid
scheme or a ponzi scheme that will fool a bunch
of people into making this this business very successful and
popular and profitable our culture would say that business person
who you know this con artist type who orchestrated this
scheme was very intelligent for being able to manipulate his
way into this level of success and what i want
to say in my redefinition of intelligence is that actually
this person is not intelligent because if this person was
truly intelligent there would be wisdom and love behind his
actions and his thought process and of course creating this
ponzi scheme and manipulating millions of people into handing you
lots of money and making it very successful this is
not wisdom and love this is what i mean by
the social our social matrix misdefines intelligence now you might
say well leo why i mean isn't wisdom distinct from
intelligence why would we want to redefine intelligence as wisdom
when we already have the word wisdom for for wisdom
why can't we like use wisdom for this more holistic
form of intelligence the more loving kind of intelligence the
wise sort of intelligence and then we can preserve the
old word intelligence for just like the sort of like
pure calculating you know like we might say like hitler
was like a evil genius you know he had a
certain certain like evil intelligence you might say um even
though you know he wasn't a good guy and he
wasn't very wise maybe he wasn't very loving but he
had sort of like evil intelligence or we might see
you know we might say like donald trump you know
um we might say he's very intelligent he's like he's
a very intelligent marketer he's a genius marketer even though
he might be using it towards some sort of nefarious
selfish purposes um so leah why are you conflating these
terms and these concepts uh well actually there's a very
fundamental reason why because in the end we need our
notion of intelligence to connect with infinite intelligence with the
intelligence that runs and designs the entire universe that's what's
missing in society's understanding and definition of intelligence they're not
making that connection because at the highest level when you
fully awaken you'll realize that god universal mind infinity is
infinitely intelligent and that intelligence god's intelligence perfectly aligns with
wisdom and with love that is the source of wisdom
the source of all wisdom is universal infinite intelligence and
the highest intelligence is love is selflessness so don't you
think it's important if infinite intelligence exists and it is
the organizing principle of the entire universe don't you think
it's important that when we use the word intelligence that
that aligns with infinite intelligence in some way and that
by saying someone is intelligent we're actually we're saying that
that person is approaching god literally that's what i want
our new definition of intelligence to allow for you see
because you know when trump is being intelligent in his
sort of like con artist way and being a demagogue
and fooling a bunch of people to give me a
bunch of money and becoming a billionaire and behaving like
a narcissist i don't want to call that intelligence because
what i want to call intelligence is that which gets
you closer to god because god is intelligence so whatever
trump is doing it ain't intelligent in fact it's it's
deeply stupid from a certain point of view even though
of course we can acknowledge that in a certain sense
he's a marketing genius and hitler was a sort of
a you know a nazi genius but in the end
nazism is stupidity so the bar is being set pretty
low there i'm trying to convey the importance of intelligence
within the universe as a whole everything we're doing with
actualize.org everything we're doing with self-actualizing ultimately boils down to
intelligence we're trying to be more intelligent we're trying to
be intelligent about how we live our lives how we
design our lives what we value what we prioritize how
we deal with emotions how we deal with people how
we deal with evil in the world how we construct
a better society this is all about intelligence intelligence is
the key to life the quality of your life hinges
upon how intelligent you're going to be now of course
when i'm talking about intelligence here i'm really talking about
like intelligence with a capital i i'm not talking about
book smarts the kind of intelligence i'm talking about you
don't get just by reading a bunch of books although
of course reading books is helpful although of course also
reading books can limit your intelligence believe it or not
see the sort of dumb kind of intelligence like academic
intelligence tells us that the more books you read the
more intelligent you become true intelligence tells us that actually
after a certain point reading books actually makes you more
stupid than intelligent in the end intelligence is required for
understanding and understanding is the ultimate pursuit of all of
life it's hard for me to explain why that is
because i feel like some of you listening will say
well leo yeah understanding is just something like you're interested
in because you're just like an intellectual type of guy
so for you maybe intelligence and understanding are important but
you know for other people it's not important and here
i'd have to challenge you and ask you to open
your mind to the possibility that truly all of reality
hinges on understanding understanding is the key to everything and
that in fact there is nothing more to reality than
the understanding of it if you understand all of reality
you're done you've reached the end of reality you win
the whole game by understanding it but you need a
sufficient level of understanding of it which was way beyond
the understanding you currently possess or know how to access
here is a list of features of what i would
call true intelligence the way that we should redefine intelligence
as wisdom love context awareness construct awareness talked about that
in the past especially in the nine stages of ego
development series go check that out and i'll talk more
about construct awareness in the future big picture thinking and
understanding holism i have multiple episodes on holism and holistic
thinking go check that out very important a deep grasp
of relativity i have an episode understanding relativism and i'll
have a few more parts to that series in the
future so relativity is huge for intelligence the ability to
take on new perspectives and points of view talked about
that in the past radical open-mindedness we've talked about that
in the past consciousness of course uh self-reflection we've talked
about that in the past a deep awareness of self-deception
we've talked about that in the past deep awareness of
bias and the ability to be unbiased we've talked about
that i have several episodes about bias facing fear that's
very interesting you might wonder what does facing fear have
to do with intelligence what's the connection and see the
ordinary definition of intelligence the sort of like academic definition
of intelligence if you ask an academic they would tell
you like well facing fear that's not what does that
got to do with intelligence you know on an iq
test for example an iq test does not measure your
courage or your capacity to face fear but really it
should because fear is not intelligent because at the highest
levels of infinite intelligence at god-consciousness there is no fear
fear is simply a sign that you don't fully understand
what's going on in reality that's literally what fear is
it's a misunderstanding you cannot be infinitely intelligent and have
fear fear of death is stupidity those things need to
be equated but they aren't in our current definitions of
intelligence you could have a high iq person with a
200 iq and he could be terrified of his own
death and we would call that person intelligent when actually
we should call that person stupid you see also we
have a lot of intelligent scientists and academics who are
very good at being intelligent about like their little narrow
discipline whether they're studying quantum mechanics or something like that
but then they are not deeply aware of self-deception all
the self-deception mechanisms that i talk about in my series
three-part series called self-deception go check that out so my
most important work all those self-deception mechanisms if you're not
aware of those you do not deserve to be called
intelligent no matter how many nobel prizes you've won or
what kind of scientific papers you're able to write you're
not intelligent if you're not aware of self-deception i'm not
just a little bit aware profoundly aware of self-deception and
also bias another component of intelligence is the ability to
surrender and to accept what is surrender is usually not
thought of as a component of intelligence of course the
ability to be transrational and trans logical is a important
feature of deep intelligence also emotional awareness and what's called
eq emotional quotient as opposed to iq a lot of
academically quote unquote intelligent people people with high iqs actually
have very poor emotional awareness and under my definition they
don't deserve to be called intelligent because actually there's a
lot of intelligence within your emotional system and if you're
not conscious of your emotions and how they manipulate you
and run your whole mind including your entire rational process
then you're not intelligent you're gonna make stupid mistakes emotional
awareness is crucial that's one of the differences between pure
academic studies versus spirituality within spirituality there's a great emphasis
on emotional awareness whereas in academia emotional awareness is not
even like a thing for example would-be professors are taught
mathematics and science but they're not taught emotional awareness that
is not part of their job description when really it
should be likewise for many academic philosophers you know you
can be an academic philosopher with low emotional awareness but
in my definition of philosophy you should not be counted
as a legitimate philosopher unless you have developed extreme emotional
awareness of your own inner emotional system another component of
intelligence is the capacity for deep abstraction implicit thinking and
what i call oblique ways of thinking i don't really
have time to go into that i'm going to have
a whole episode in the future about abstraction i already
have an episode about explicit versus implicit understanding go check
that out um but i'm going to have a episode
also about what i call oblique ways of thinking basically
i've sort of discovered slash invented a way of thinking
a different way of thinking than the way that most
people think i call it oblique thinking um it's a
very implicit way of thinking uh which is different from
like the sort of academic ways of thinking and i'll
i'm still not quite sure how to articulate it it's
very slippery uh i'll have an episode about that in
the future another component of intelligence is non-linearity being able
to think in non-linear ways to work with paradox i've
talked about that in the past on in my paradox
what is paradox episode and lastly intelligence in the way
i define it must have an existential and a spiritual
dimension intelligence without metaphysics and without spiritual dimensions is not
actually intelligent which means materialism rationalism scientism atheism are not
intelligent our culture considers these to be intelligent so you
see by redefining intelligence we're setting it up such that
when we call somebody oh that's an intelligent person what
that means is that person is on their way towards
god and the reason that is because the more intelligent
you become the more godlike you become until when you
become god fully you become infinitely intelligent and then your
intelligence becomes identical to the intelligence of the whole universe
which is what is running the entire show which is
the source of all science art religion cognition emotion intuition
rationality and the rest it's the true source of genius
the highest intelligence only comes with selflessness and the transcending
of survival and your identity limits your intelligence and your
intelligence also limits your identity people can have huge egos
and we could call them intelligent under our current definitions
of intelligence under the new definition of intelligent that couldn't
happen people with giant egos would be called stupid as
they are because having a giant ego is not very
intelligent by the way we also need this redefinition because
once mankind begins to explore the solar system and beyond
and we start to come into contact with higher intelligent
life in the universe which is going to happen sooner
or later we're going to discover beings out there that
are way more intelligent than us and we are not
going to understand them and their intelligence and why they
act the way they act unless we have a proper
definition of what intelligence is and so i want our
human definitions of intelligence to align with the higher intelligences
of beings in the entire universe that are out there
so we're thinking long term here i want you to
notice that going against culture and norms and your tribe
threatens your survival for more on that go see my
episode the social matrix also notice that thinking in new
ways leads to acting in new ways leads to living
in new ways so to live in new ways you
gotta act in new ways to act in new ways
you gotta think in new ways so it begins with
thinking in new ways it begins with being more intelligent
it begins with thinking about thinking how do we think
better how do we be more intelligent in our thinking
and there's a big difference also you should notice between
original thinking high quality thinking and just shutting off your
mind much of today's mainstream spirituality western buddhism and so
forth what they're actually teaching you is how to shut
off your mind to access various kinds of mystical states
and non-dual states that's good that has its uses but
that doesn't automatically teach you how to think in a
high quality way it doesn't actually teach you deep intelligence
it doesn't teach you how to how to understand things
properly and deeply and in general i noticed that there's
a sort of a denigration within buddhism on the issue
of understanding this is a mistake the mind is a
very powerful and dangerous tool and you can develop mastery
of using the mind but almost nobody in society teaches
how to do this because of course to teach it
you'd have to first master your own mind which most
people haven't because they're so wrapped up in self-deception bias
and their inability to jail break their mind and to
understand high levels of abstraction and relativity and the reason
they can't do that is because they're mired in group
think of their tribe and their culture and the reason
they can't break out of it is because their survival
hinges on it because of the way they position themselves
unintelligently within the system it is possible to develop mastery
of how your mind works understands and thinks this requires
practice if all you do is you just shut off
your mind and sit in meditation you might access some
non-dual states but you are not going to develop mastery
in using your mind and deep intelligence in your thinking
process that requires a lot of practice which for example
buddhism will not teach you that's where i come in
that's why where actualizer it comes in that's that's part
of the difference between how i teach and what you
get from other spiritual sources so here are some practical
takeaways from this episode if if you're feeling this a
little bit abstract and you're not sure what to do
with this information here's some things you should start to
do number one notice the effect other minds and culture
has on your mind literally notice how the thoughts you
think are affected and influenced by the thoughts other minds
around you think with whom you're socializing and communing and
also with your culture number two step is catch yourself
parroting phrases and ideas and thoughts which are not your
own especially spiritual ideas you know there's a lot of
cliches within the spiritual community all of them need to
be questioned stop just parody them i should probably make
a list of i'm thinking right now um i should
probably make a list of like all the spiritual cliches
that people pair it there's so many of them but
i have to sit down and like brainstorm them for
a few hours to come up with all of them
maybe i'll do that in the future but you could
think of some yourself you know spiritual cliches that you
hear whether it's people talking about chakras or various kinds
of sayings from the bible you know it's easier for
a rich man um you know for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle than a rich
man to get into heaven is that really true maybe
it is maybe it's not but like don't just parrot
it right these are not your ideas catch yourself just
parroting this kind of stuff or you know people say
oh we're in the matrix stop parroting that think for
yourself the next point is notice how the need for
social survival pressures your mind to conform to group think
i want you to actually catch yourself in the moment
when you're with a group of people where your authentic
self or your values are being compromised and where you
are falling into group think catch yourself notice that that's
the cost and trade-off that i'm putting out to you
that is happening it's just a question of whether you're
noticing whether it's happening or not uh the the next
practical takeaway here is notice how many original ideas you
generate and trace where your ideas came from like sometimes
it's good to do sort of a genealogy or an
archaeology of your ideas just kind of like trace you
know you have some sort of idea about spirituality or
science or whatever for example the earth is round that's
an idea you hold hopefully trace where that idea came
from like actually go and actually try to trace it
down in a sort of like like you're doing archaeology
it's like well where did i first hear that idea
was it from my mom or from my dad and
then how many times have i heard it and where
was it reinforced like maybe it was reinforced in first
grade when the teacher showed me a picture of the
globe or maybe it was reinforced in second grade when
i got this homework assignment or something right and just
like actually go go through and check where the idea
came from and hey if you believe the earth is
flat okay great so i want you to to trace
where that idea came from where did you get the
idea that the earth is flat who told you that
good exercise and try to see how many of your
ideas you actually generated and then the next practical takeaway
is sit down for 60 minutes and try to generate
at least one chain of original thought do that a
few times and notice notice the difference between just thinking
the way you're normally thinking and actually sitting down for
60 minutes and deliberately generating some new kinds of thoughts
that you've never thought before that nobody else has ever
thought before that right there that is gold that will
change your whole life if you keep doing that and
if you sit down and actually do it even once
you might be shocked to realize that i've never done
this before in my whole life this is the first
time you know you might you might say i'm 35
years old and this is the first time in 35
years where i sat down for 60 minutes and generated
some original thoughts the first time what the [ __
] was i doing for the first 35 years of
my life you might wonder and then keep doing that
of course don't just do it once okay now the
next point of this episode is as follows you have
to realize that the state of our society is such
that if you just do the bare minimum you will
become a battery for the matrix powerful systems outside of
your awareness will co-opt your consciousness to feed their survival
and serve their low consciousness priorities and outright devilry you
will become a slave without even realizing it you're not
going to become a physical slave you're going to become
a mental slave your intellect will become enslaved and then
by enslaving your intellect you can also become physically enslaved
wage enslaved and so forth enslaved in a relationship enslaved
in a bad job enslaved with an abusive boss or
whatever modern technology and modern society is amazing in that
it allows for such creativity and freedom but only if
you use it consciously with independence of thought that responsibility
is on you if you don't consciously exercise this responsibility
if you're not careful socialization will turn you into a
zombie and you will squander your life you will lose
your intellectual autonomy and sovereignty you will never tap into
your full spiritual potential and you will never reach your
highest levels of intelligence you have to look at how
your job your family your religion your politics your friends
your advertising your media your socializing how all of this
is enslaving your mind and making you a battery in
the matrix do not let mainstream culture and business define
the meaning in your life and set your priorities for
life you must direct the meaning in your life independently
of culture business friends family etc the prime challenge of
the modern life is to not let yourself be turned
into a mindless zombie through complacency your number one job
is to direct your life to be the ceo of
your life and fitting in is highly overrated your job
is not to fit in your job is to become
uniquely authentically you you to the hilt profoundly yourself that's
your job your job in life is to find yourself
and then be yourself to the utmost of course that
means ultimately awakening to yourself as god but even long
before you reach there you have a lot of work
to do understanding yourself as a character as a persona
as a human so it's not just about becoming god
it's also about becoming more human the more human you
and really you start there that's more practical than becoming
god one of the greatest joys in life is defining
yourself you get to define how you want to be
in life what you want to stand for how you
want to express yourself how you want to be creative
what you want to love how you want to express
your love for life and for the world and for
people what do you love in life you can think
of it as on your gravestone when you're dead it
should be written for every person this person loved blank
and that shouldn't be a mystery that should be completely
obvious by the way the person lived their life everybody
who knew that person should say this person loved blank
and fill in that blank and it's completely obvious and
everybody would agree like this person loved cartoons this person
loved making music this person loved sex this person loved
family this person loved their country or whatever and another
high-level goal you should have is to make your thinking
process independent of all pre-existing human frames this should be
a long-term goal of yours in life to become intellectually
autonomous and sovereign to become original innovative and creative with
your thinking process this is how you're going to transform
your whole life all the big changes in your life
are going to start off and really the source of
them are going to be the innovative and creative ways
that you're able to use your mind the requisite variety
of your mind i have a very important episode that's
exclusive to my blog called requisite variety you can do
a google search for it very important episode the deepest
intelligence has infinite requisite variety it's infinitely creative right the
reason you want to be so intelligent is not just
because it gives you a lot of joy and pleasure
but also because it's so powerful literally infinite intelligence is
infinite power the power of creation god is creation by
tapping into deeper levels of intelligence you tap into deeper
potential for creation you can use that to then create
the kind of life you want to create all the
things you struggle to create in your life that's because
you lack the intelligence necessary to create it that's because
you lack the requisite variety modern society gives you the
freedom to think anything but creates mechanisms which hijack the
impulse to think at all with all the entertainment the
food the sex the socializing the porn the virtual reality
the social media the news all the youtube videos all
the books see you're free intellectually really you're living the
greatest time ever you can buy almost any book read
anything you want watch any kind of video google search
for any kind of information but what's astounding is that
how few people actually exercise that freedom the majority of
people won't even go into youtube and type into the
search box some subject that they're interested in or some
question they're interested in instead all they do is they
just click on the videos that the youtube algorithm serves
up because they're so [ __ ] lazy they can't
even be bothered to type a question into the search
box and so what does youtube serve up using their
default algorithm it serves up more of the sort of
click bait drama-filled entertaining [ __ ] that just gets
you riled up but that doesn't actually provide any substance
or intelligence where whereas on youtube there are many intelligent
videos but most of them you have to search for
google is not going to serve them up to you
on a silver platter so if you're going to be
lazy and just click on the you know recommendation feed
and nothing else and never do a search for example
you know if you're like curious like what is consciousness
or what is existence or what is spirituality or like
how do i become enlightened or how do i create
the good life you could type any of those prompts
at any time into google or into youtube in the
search box and you'll get amazing videos with all the
answers many of them will be my own of course
i'm not just talking about my own you can find
many other good videos on these topics that are not
my own although i am i am biased towards my
own but um i think they're pretty good as far
as answering those kinds of questions directly but basically any
kind of question you have and i mean it doesn't
have to be existential questions it could be a question
like you know like how do i buy a house
how do i get a girlfriend how do i get
laid you know you know why do i struggle with
socializing or why why am i a people pleaser you
know why do i suffer from depression you can type
any of these into the search box at any moment
and you'll get answers but what's astounding is that the
majority of people never will they will live their whole
lives and never type those into the search box because
they're so [ __ ] lazy all they do is
just click on the never ending torrent of recommendations that
youtube serves up to them which is click bait and
[ __ ] and drama so this is what i
mean when i say that modern society gives you all
this freedom this infinite freedom all these powerful amazing tools
and yet most people are thinking less than they've ever
thought for themselves right now in the 21st century is
the greatest time to be alive if you're a creator
an innovator if you want to be a sage or
a mystic you have more tools more freedom more opportunity
than ever but here's the catch you also have more
distractions and hijacking than ever it's easier than ever to
become a zombie and to be complacent and to just
attach yourself to the social matrix with an umbilical cord
and let it feed you for the rest of your
life and then you'll become a zombie so be ever
vigilant against social matrix hijack watch your mind conforming like
a hawk watch how your mind conforms watch how your
mind follows various kinds of intellectual trends and fads whether
it's within crypto investing or some latest political movement like
libertarianism or marxism or some newest conspiracy theory make this
key distinction for yourself on the one hand there are
times when you are actually thinking deep original thoughts and
then on the other hand there are times when you
are just thinking what what other people have thought for
you and you're just doing group think make that distinction
notice when you're doing which notice how much of which
you're doing and the key habit you want to develop
here you know i think probably the ultimate takeaway from
this whole episode the most practical takeaway is spend a
lot more time sitting alone in a room thinking original
thoughts from scratch that's basically it that's everything i'm telling
you here it's just a long-winded way of saying sit
alone in a room and think original thoughts from scratch
and you can see how socialization if you're a highly
social person you like to party you like to go
to clubs you like to flirt with girls you like
to go dating around you like to go sleeping around
and having fun with your friends you can see how
if you're doing that that's directly taking time away from
you sitting alone in a room thinking original thoughts from
scratch notice that reading deep books and watching deep videos
is not the same as thinking original thoughts from scratch
now that doesn't mean deep books and videos are bad
it just means it's not the same as thinking original
thoughts from scratch also notice that listening to a guru
as great as that might be is also not the
same thing as thinking original thoughts from scratch so check
yourself honestly ask yourself when was the last time you
sat down and did 60 minutes of original thinking answer
that question for yourself right now when was the last
time was it last week last month last year or
not in the last decade and that basically tells you
why your life isn't going the way you want it
to go a high quality life requires high quality ideas
requires original thinking not just ideas you got you know
from somewhere else although of course it's also important to
get ideas from somewhere else on occasion sometimes you want
to feed your mind with external sources that's actually very
important for creativity you want a lot of diverse input
but sometimes you also want to guard your mind against
external influence so you can think some original thoughts sometimes
when i'm thinking about these topics that i do these
videos on sometimes i'll do research from a book or
online for these topics but sometimes i deliberately don't do
research so that i can first allow myself to generate
some original ideas and takes and then in addition to
that you know once i generate enough my own ideas
then i can maybe go and kind of add a
little bit of external ideas additional perspectives but the core
of what i try to teach i try to generate
myself and then i can add a little bit here
and there of other stuff that tends to produce my
best content i've noticed so here's an exercise you can
try pick a subject any subject and think through it
from scratch try this do this without relying on any
conventional knowledge so for example pick a question like what
is happiness or what is spirituality or what is science
or what makes a great film and then just sit
there for an hour and brainstorm and think about it
from different angles contemplate it this is the art of
contemplation i have many episodes in the past that explain
how to do contemplation why it's important one of them
is called contemplation another one is called how to contemplate
another one is called how to contemplate using a journal
another one is called the power of asking questions these
are all great episodes go watch them re-watch them and
then apply them what we're really talking about here is
contemplation the challenge here is that you need to be
able to both think deeply and you also need the
ability to let go of thinking and that's a bit
schizophrenic of a thing to ask of you and yet
that is our work when you meditate you try to
let go of thinking when you contemplate you try to
think more deeply and in a higher quality way both
are important skills practice them both likewise the challenge here
is that you need the ability to socialize but you
also need the ability to retreat into serious solitude both
require practice and balance and there are real trade-offs between
both so it's not one or the other i'm not
demonizing socialization here there is value to socialization and i'll
give you one very specific example of how socialization changed
my life early on back when i wasn't very social
back in my early 20s um what i actually did
is i went to this conference called gdc game developers
conferences held in san francisco i went there when i
was about 20 23 years old um it was one
of the first times that i that i flew somewhere
by myself without without parents so i flew to san
francisco to this conference it was a conference about game
development i want to become a game developer at that
point and i was just and uh and at that
point i had i had like zero socialization experience zero
pickup experience um zero public speaking experience and zero networking
experience and so when i went there i knew i
had to network so i kind of just forced myself
and did a little bit of just kind of like
you know fly by fly by the seat of my
pants networking i just sat by some tables you know
during lunchtime talk to random people you know we had
like at lunch time we had tables and there's thousands
of people there at lunchtime we had these little tables
where people would sit maybe eight people 10 people per
table you bring your food there talk to your neighbor
stuff like that so you know i went around i
handed around some business cards that i printed because i
was looking for a game design job and just you
know picking the brains of people like i was like
what do you do and how did you get here
why are you here and so you know what is
your company about what kind of job you have and
so i met some interesting people and one of the
guys i met there was he was just like an
indie he was just like an indie game developer and
this was back in 2000 what was it this was
like in 2006 2007 before indie game development was a
thing you know today indie game development is like a
popular thing it's just part of the the zeitgeist uh
back then the idea of being an indie game developer
it was brand new nobody knew you could do this
um it wasn't a proven way to make money or
anything like that there were no successful indie games yet
back then there were no indie platforms there was not
steam well there was steam but it wasn't really big
with indie games and um there just wasn't a market
for indie games back then there wasn't mobile yet the
iphone hadn't come out yet and all that so um
these were the early days right pre-indie and anyways i
so i found this guy and he was just working
on it on a game by himself independently and to
me this idea just blew my mind like what because
i was there thinking like well i need to get
into like a triple a studio you know i i
wanted to talk to like the big studios and get
hired but the idea that i could just make games
on my own that was a completely foreign concept to
me because i studied the whole game industry you know
for years through the 90s and 2000s i studied it
and there just there were no examples of that it
was all done through big studios so i thought i
had to be part of a big studio but talking
to this guy he said yeah you know and i'm
like how are you doing how are you funding yourself
he says like well i'm a i'm a software consultant
so i do consulting on the side and i earn
enough money from consulting and i only work like you
know like 10 hours a week consulting and the rest
of the time i just work on my game and
to me that was such a foreign cool idea um
that i'm like that at that point i thought wow
that would be amazing if i could set myself up
if i could position myself like that you know i
would have all this creative freedom to do whatever i
want um but at that point i'm like well but
that's it's sort of a unproven idea and uh i
was still kind of dead set on you know working
as part of like a triple a studio but then
i got hired by aaa studio and a few years
later you know i found it so miserable there that
i started having fantasies and that idea came about about
you know being completely creatively free and then the idea
came to me of i remembered oh that guy i
remember meeting that guy at gdc who had this like
cushy position for himself where he could just work on
his own stuff his own games he just a little
bit of consulting on the side paid for himself you
know gave him enough money and all that you know
consulting pace pretty well and i'm like well [ __
] i need to set myself up like that and
i did within a year i set myself up like
that not as a consultant but i started my own
business and was able to finance myself with passive income
and then i was able to work on any games
i wanted to and i still could do that today
if i wanted if i wanted i could just go
right now and work on any game i want without
anyone telling me anything um and so i'm yeah so
the reason i bring that up is because that was
a direct benefit from my socialization if i hadn't gone
to gdc if i hadn't pushed myself to network if
i just sat in the corner by myself eating my
lunch didn't talk to anybody uh i would not have
met that guy i would not have gotten that idea
and if i didn't get that idea then i wouldn't
have ultimately been where i am today and the only
reason i am here today being able to put out
this content is because i became financially independent through that
one idea that i got from socializing so all this
goes to say that socializing is not a bad thing
you can certainly use socializing to to really advance yourself
in your career and to even set yourself up very
intelligently however here's the problem is that if i became
really good at socializing and networking and i went to
every single gdc and other conferences and other parties and
places and i just socialize and socialize and socialize and
that became my whole life and my mode of survival
then i also wouldn't be here with you today teaching
the stuff that i teach i would be just like
everybody else doing what they're doing so that's the point
now let me point out a couple of traps about
this because i know people will misunderstand this and misuse
this teaching so trap number one just because you are
a loner does not make you highly intelligent make sure
you don't make that mistake if you are too shy
to talk to a stranger you are not highly intelligent
you have important developmental problems that need to be addressed
so go address them if you're too shy to talk
to a girl if you can't get laid if you
can't get a date if you can't speak in public
if you can't even maintain a couple of friends these
are signs of serious developmental problems within you aspects of
your life that are underdeveloped that need to be worked
on go work on them i worked on them don't
just be a loner because nobody likes you right you
see there's a difference between being a loner because you
could be social you could be having sex i could
be out at a club right now partying and having
fun and dancing but i choose to stay home because
i got more important [ __ ] to do because
i got to sit and contemplate about the nature of
god right that's one situation another situation is that i'm
sitting at home bullshitting and masturbating about god because i'm
too afraid to go out to a club to talk
to a girl i have no friends and deep down
i'm actually depressed and miserable do you see the difference
these days i go out to the club a lot
i socialize a lot but actually my favorite days are
the days when the club is closed or there's no
good club open and on those days i stay home
and i do something you know existential like i contemplate
the nature of god those are actually my favorite days
not because i don't enjoy going to the club i
actually do enjoy it but i enjoy contemplating god more
than that there's a time to be playful and stupid
and there's a time to be deeply intelligent learn to
have both aspects in your life and don't use this
idea of deep intelligence to judge and criticize others for
being social for having fun and then for as an
excuse why you don't do that and the real reason
you don't do it is because actually you can't or
you're afraid or you lack the skills and then you're
just using you know these actualized teachings as just a
way to mentally masturbate like if you're lonely if you're
truly see when i'm like sitting at home contemplating god
i'm not lonely if you're truly lonely and depressed and
you feel like you need a friend to talk to
go get that create that in your life god is
not really going to solve that for you once you
handle that then you can come back and you can
access god and you'll have the best of both worlds
here's another trap you might fall into is what i
call the trap of iconoclasm being iconoclastic for the sake
of being iconoclastic just being different for the sake of
being different trying to be different unique or non-conformist as
a facade or as a pretense so make this following
key distinction distinguish between being non-conformist in a shallow way
versus being non-conformist in deep ways so being non-conformist in
a shallow way would be kind of stuff like you
know being non-conformist as part of a group like you
join some sort of cult or you become a libertarian
or a goth or you're a part of a biker
gang or you become emo or red pill or incel
or black pill or you become a mark sister you
become anti-mainstream or you become you know uh an sjw
or an anti-sjw or you become some sort of new
ager and really you're just doing this as part of
a group you're not thinking independently when you're joining these
sorts of cults and movements these are shallow forms of
non-conformity deep non-conformity is when you sit at home and
you contemplate your deepest values what your priorities are how
you want to be creative and you work on all
that the things you deeply love then you go and
you pursue those things that you deeply love and then
whatever you're pursuing out of a genuine deep profound love
that's going to be deep non-conformity and then you don't
care whether other people like what you love you don't
care if they approve they don't care what your family
thinks you don't care about what your friends think if
if none of them like what you're doing it doesn't
matter to you you still go do it that's deep
non-conformity and then you don't compromise your values and your
priorities when others try to seduce you away into some
low consciousness activity or something that you don't value or
that goes against your priorities or breaks your integrity another
trap here is demonizing the mainstream be careful about that
just because something is anti-mainstream doesn't make it good or
intelligent there's a lot of stupid [ __ ] [
__ ] that is anti-mainstream in fact there's more stupidity
in the anti-mainstream than there is in the mainstream now
that doesn't mean that the mainstream is always intelligent there's
plenty of stupid stuff in the mainstream but god there's
so much just ridiculousness in the anti-mainstream that i see
these days be careful about that and also the trap
of conspiracy theories i have a whole episode about that
the it's called the sneaky psychology behind conspiracy theories um
subscribing to conspiracy theories does not make you deeply intellectual
and it does not make you non-conformist very much the
opposite a conspiracy theory as i've quoted in that episode
my opening quote there is that a conspiracy theory is
a is a fool's idea of intelligence and that is
the case now you might say but leo isn't actualized.org
itself one of these non-conformist conformist groups and the answer
is that actualize.org can certainly be turned into a trap
listening to actualize.org is not the same thing as original
thinking from scratch so even though i consider actualize.org a
deep source of intelligence and insight um that's like from
my perspective from your perspective if you're just sitting there
passively being programmed with all this these insights and then
going around parroting them and not thinking original thoughts for
yourself and deriving these insights for yourself then you're misusing
actualized.org and in that sense it's going to be a
problem for you you should think of my job as
really to inspire you to investigate reality for yourself by
showing you how much gold there is to be mined
from putting your thinking cap on and doing serious contemplation
one of my greatest weaknesses in this work is that
i give you all the answers that is a pretty
serious weakness you'll realize at some point that i have
you might not understand why that's a weakness but it
is however the intelligence behind this weakness is as follows
it's not just an accident is that i'm trying to
shower you with all these profound insights so that you
are inspired to think about this stuff for yourself and
to generate your own i want you to realize at
some point like oh my god there's so many amazing
insights that leo is sharing and he keeps pulling out
new ones from his ass every week for years where
all these insights coming from how is he generating them
what if i cut out the middleman and start to
do what he's doing for myself in my life wouldn't
that be amazing and then you actually get inspired to
do the work to train up your mind to do
that and that's what i'm really trying to teach you
by giving you all these answers there's a sort of
a meta lesson that's trying to be taught to you
here whether you get that or not i don't know
many probably won't but for my most serious students that's
what i'm trying to communicate to you you can generate
all these insights for yourself not only can you but
you should and you should get excited for doing so
and you should be excited about customizing these insights and
generating your own unique insights right you'll be able to
generate insights that i haven't generated and never will that's
exciting that should be exciting to you that should get
you motivated to start jail breaking your mind and thinking
outside the box and sitting down and contemplating generating your
own original insights that's what's amazing about this work and
i hope you learned that from me here are some
related episodes you might want to watch if you like
this episode radical open-mindedness how open-mindedness works the deep problem
of marketing cult psychology part two and how modern branding
exploits you that all ties ties in with this what
we talked about here today in conclusion i suggest you
forge your own path in life intellectually intellectually you're only
going to start living the day you commit to generating
your own original thoughts so get started all right that's
it i'm done here please check out my website actualize.org
there you will find my blog where i'm posting a
lot of original stuff quotes resources videos funny memes etc
go check that out i put a lot of time
and effort into it come check out my book list
read the books on there hundreds of books for you
to read to get you started with all this work
check out my life purpose course to help you get
on track over 25 hours of original exclusive content that's
not found on the free channel that will help you
to figure out your life purpose sign up to my
newsletter i'm going to be releasing more courses over the
next year and or two stay tuned for that if
you'd like you can support me on patreon.com slash actualized
also come join the actualized forum where we have a
community where you can find like-minded people to share in
your insights and have some camaraderie and companionship so you're
not doing all this alone all right the final thing
i want to say is this that stay tuned because
in the future i'm going to have specific videos on
how to think how to bootstrap your thinking i'm going
to have an episode on abstraction that's a really interesting
one um actually i already shot that one i shot
that one a few years ago so i i shot
an episode on what abstraction is and how it applies
to thinking it was actually such a good episode that
i didn't release it i didn't want to release it
because i thought it was too good sometimes i record
an episode it's not good enough to release sometimes i
record an episode that's too good for me to release
um uh i'll i'll probably make it even better at
some point and release it so i still have yet
to talk about abstraction and then uh a very interesting
episode that i'm working on is what i call oblique
thinking so as i said uh i've sort of come
up with a new way of thinking which i call
oblique thinking which is ways of thinking about highly abstract
and infinite type of objects in ways that normal thinking
is not able to grasp and i'm still trying to
articulate exactly how to talk about what this oblique thinking
is because by its nature is very implicit it's not
explicit so i have to make it explicit so how
do you make an implicit thing explicit so anyways a
bit of a paradox um so that's something to look
forward to in the future as well so stay tuned
for all those um i'm really gonna push with this
work to show you how to become a very original
thinker and how to tap into the deepest levels of
intelligence basically trans humans levels of intelligence that's something i'll
be working on for years in the future and maybe
even create a course on that at some point that
still requires a lot of research and development work for
me but i'll be throwing out nuggets here and there
so i'm excited about that i hope you are too
stay tuned for more you
