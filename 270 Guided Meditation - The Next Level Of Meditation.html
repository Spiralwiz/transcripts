            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/7LscnZCzdak' target='_blank'>Guided Meditation - The Next Level Of Meditation</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Guided Meditation</b>: Leo Gura from Actualized.org presents an instructional guided meditation video, emphasizing active participation instead of simply listening to theory.
</li><li>- <b>Participating in Meditation</b>: Gura advises setting aside 20-30 uninterrupted minutes to fully participate in the guided meditation.
</li><li>- <b>Letting Go and Surrender in Meditation</b>: He introduces the often overlooked aspects of complete surrender and letting go in a successful meditation practice, obtained from ig shanti's insights, as a counter method to the perceived neuroticism of thought manipulation during meditation.
</li><li>- <b>Beginning the Exercise</b>: Recommends finding a comfortable position, typically seated, closing the eyes, and stilling oneself to commence the practice. Guided meditation listeners are instructed to push away any judgments, prior methods or expectations related to meditation.
</li><li>- <b>Physical Awareness During Meditation</b>: Gura focuses on becoming aware of one's body sensations, including discomforts, without any attempts to affect, control or interpret them. Encourages allowing and noticing all sensations without specifically focusing on any one sensation.
</li><li>- <b>Nullifying the Need for Control</b>: He asserts the non-necessity of achieving a specific mental state, manipulating thoughts, or forcing relaxation. The only required action is to let go of control.
</li><li>- <b>External Sensations</b>: Encourages observation of external sensations beyond the skull, including bodily sensations, while maintaining alertness.
</li><li>- <b>Expanding Consciousness</b>: Gura suggests gently projecting oneself beyond the confines of the skull, into the surrounding environment to experience all of existence as a part of oneself without any conscious effort, as this state of being is always present.
</li><li>- <b>Deprecating the Mind's Influence</b>: The urge to understand, intellectualize or strive for enlightenment is negated, titling every experience as a meditative experience. Meditation is viewed as simply accepting "what is".
</li><li>- <b>Surrender and Acceptance</b>: He concludes with the emphasis on total surrender of the mind and body to the present moment without resistance.
</li><li><b>Comfort and relaxation during meditation</b>: In meditation, aim to let go of all struggles, desires, worries, and tensions. Allow your body to fully relax, from your jaw and shoulders to your abdomen and legs. Similarly, let your mind relax and don't try to control or manipulate anything. Accept all sensations, including unpleasant ones, and remain perfectly still.
</li><li><b>Surrender and embrace reality</b>: Achieving peace and calm in meditation is not about trying to control your state of mind but rather about surrendering. Let go of any need for control and surrender yourself completely to reality. Even if thoughts or desires for control arise, allow them, and then let them go. The mind becomes restful and the self is absorbed into the surroundings, becoming one with reality.
</li><li><b>Enjoying quiet mindfulness</b>: Take pleasure in the feeling of silence and effortless awareness. Do not strive for any specific state or manipulate your thinking. If you're struggling to let go, let go of the desire to let go. This form of meditation represents simply resting the mind while retaining alertness.
</li><li><b>Lessons learned from meditation</b>: Take the lessons learned during your practice with you when you come back. Reflect on them and use these insights to enhance your later sessions.
</li><li><b>Recommended practice routine</b>: Regular meditation practice is crucial. If possible, spend at least 20-30 minutes a day, if not a whole hour, in meditation. Stay present and let go of any thoughts or tension, exploring what it feels like to merge with reality.
</li><li><b>Adapting to the process</b>: Expect the mind to wobble and engage in 'monkey chatter' at first. Over time, by consistently releasing and surrendering, the mind will settle into a deep, peaceful state.
</li><li><b>The importance of practical application</b>: Emphasize actual practice over theoretical knowledge. Real transformation is embedded in the experience, not in understanding the theory. The most advanced states of consciousness are realized through hands-on practice, not intellectual comprehension. 
</li><li><b>Advocacy for newsletter sign-up</b>: Stay in touch with future materials and discussions through the Actualized.org newsletter. This regular contact will provide reinforcement and prevent practitioners from falling off track. 
</li><li><b>Potential audio guide</b>: For beginners or those who feel challenged meditating alone, consider using the provided audio guide as a tool. It is a trimmed version free from theoretical aspects, which can be looped for regular use. This aims to aid in the understanding and execution of practices discussed.
