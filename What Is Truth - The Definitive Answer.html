[Music] you what is truth the ultimate guide warning this
is a very advanced episode so be careful it's my
great honor and privilege to be able to be the
first person today in your life to tell you what
truth is nobody has ever told you in your entire
life what truth is this is a big deal now
that doesn't mean you're gonna understand what I'm saying but
it's a big deal to understand what truth is a
common misconception that people have about truth is they think
that scientists academics philosophers for priests and rabbis understand what
truth is and they don't they don't truth is something
that transcends science which is something that just doesn't compute
in the minds of most ordinary people so we're gonna
work through all that but this is a very tricky
topic the amazing thing is though and the good news
here is that it actually is possible to know what
the truth is and to understand it so this is
not just speculation and theory on my part and in
fact my bold claim here is is that I have
become directly conscious of absolute truth and that you can
too so it's not that I have some special privilege
here you can do it everybody can do it the
problem is that nobody does it or hardly anyone does
it so I will be explaining why this is the
case and helping you to understand where you're going wrong
but you need to appreciate how tricky of a topic
this is and how serious this is so even though
I'll be explaining stuff to you here that's not going
to be nearly enough you're gonna have to do homework
you're gonna have to really pursue the truth to understand
the things that are said in this episode because like
I said this is very advanced stuff and none of
this can be taken for granted also I just want
to underscore that nothing I say here should be taken
as a belief as an ideology don't take it as
a religion don't take me on my word you have
to do the work of finding out what I'm gonna
be telling you here so let's begin so I guess
I should tell you a little bit of the story
of how I became conscious of absolute truth what truth
is now I've become conscious of it in many different
respects and in many different ways at many different points
in my life so it didn't just happen once but
there was one particular moment which is still very vivid
in my mind that I can recall where I penetrated
through to what truth really means what that word really
means because we use this word you know colloquially all
the time casually in conversation you've used it in school
as though you knew what it meant but isn't it
funny how you went through 12 years of school and
then maybe four more years of university and not once
not once did anyone tell you what the truth is
nor did you sit down and seriously question to yourself
and try to figure out what the truth is you
took it for granted I will even bet you I
would bet you $1,000 that most of you never even
in your entire life cracked open dictionary and looked up
what the word truth means of course not the dictionary
would know because the dictionary doesn't know the dictionaries can
have a circular definition which just points to two other
terms all of which are defined in terms of another
and so it'll be a circular definition which doesn't help
you at all but you know most people haven't even
bothered to go that deep in their inquiry into what
truth is so anyways I was standing there one day
taking a piss and as I was pissing I was
wondering what is the truth because this is a question
that I've been asking myself since I was a teenager
basically for my whole life I've been asking the question
of what is the truth pursuing this question for for
years and for decades for thousands of hours contemplating wracking
my mind over it so I'm standing there pissing and
I'm and I'm just wondering to myself what is the
truth what is it what is truth what is truth
and then it hit me just like that the conceptual
notion of truth melted away the idea that truth is
some sort of idea in my mind that whole notion
melted away and then what and was actual truth that's
what was revealed to me and it's nothing crazy like
you might think it's just being it's the entirety of
the present moment as I was standing there pissing that
very moment all of it became the truth and while
that naam might not sound too profound to you it
was extremely profound so the trickiness with truth is that
at the same time it's totally ordinary and there's nothing
crazy about it and yet also on the other hand
it's the most extraordinary radical outrageous shocking mind-blowing thing you've
ever understood and of course it certainly helped me that
I was on LSD at the time so I highly
recommend that if you're gonna be pursuing the question of
what is truth you you you want to have some
assistance because the majority of people even people who meditate
I've known many people who meditate who do yoga and
so forth even people who consider themselves awake and they
still don't really understand what the word truth actually means
so let me explain it to you here but first
let's tackle some of the common misconceptions about truth truth
is a belief this is false truth is a concept
or an abstraction this is false truth is a philosophy
or some ideology like a religion this is false truth
is knowledge this is false that truth is a theory
or a model this is false that truth is science
logic or mathematics this is false that truth is impossible
to access this is false that truth is subjective this
is false that truth must be logical and it must
make sense this is false that truth can be written
down in a book and that you can read this
book and learn the truth this is false that truth
can be proven and that if truth exists then surely
it's provable this turns out to be false and the
last misconception is that truth is no big deal and
that it's irrelevant to ordinary life this is false so
now let's dig into what truth is there are two
kinds of truth that we need to distinguish here otherwise
we get very confused very fast the first kind is
relative truth we'll call it these are conceptual truths these
are truths of the mind and the second kind is
absolute truth or truth the capital T as I sometimes
say this is truth that is true under all circumstances
and conditions it's the opposite of relative you might say
it's not conceptual it's actual and so you have to
be a little bit careful cuz sometimes I will use
the word just simply truth ambiguously without telling you explicitly
which one of these I'm referring to sometimes I'll just
say the truth and you know usually when I say
with authority like that you know the truth that's what
I mean by absolute truth truth with a capital T
and then sometimes I just say truth in which case
I'm just talking about some relative truth so what's the
difference between these two well you have to be careful
about how the words are used I'll try to be
clear in this episode but you know in future episodes
sometimes I use the word rather loosely and you know
most people do most people don't distinguish between these two
and can create confusion so what are some examples of
relative truth the sky is blue is a relative truth
the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris France is a
relative truth a human being a human beings hand has
five fingers on it that's a relative truth one plus
one equals two what do you think relative or absolute
relative that's a relative truth squirrels like to eat acorns
a relative truth World War two happened a relative truth
objects are made out of atoms also a relative truth
now you might be scratching your head at this point
likely Oh hmm a relative true how but how can
how can the sky is blue be a relative truth
what's relative about that and one plus one equals two
relative how is this relative conceptual I mean if one
plus one equals two is not the truest thing we
know then what does truth even mean that's right that's
a very very good question but I want you now
to start to get interested in this idea of absolute
truth because of all the stuff I mentioned above is
relative and that's some of the most certain stuff you've
ever known in your life then what could the absolute
be and what would it mean for all the above
stuff you know given that it's relative for it to
be contingent meaning that it could be otherwise see as
amazing as this might sound to you all of the
stuff I mentioned up above these are all pseudo truths
because they depend upon concept symbols language interpretation and thought
these are all truths that are held within your mind
and for the truth of these statements to register in
your mind requires that your mind work in certain ways
see so even just to take a statement like the
sky is blue to be able to say that to
yourself in your mind and then either validate it or
invalidate it to believe in it or not to believe
in it to claim it as true or false already
this requires interpretive functions in your mind you have to
first of all you've to understand the language so this
is a linguistic truth you have to be able to
decipher the words you have to you have to be
intelligent enough as an organism to be able to even
understand what language is you know many animals don't if
you tell a donkey that the sky is blue it's
gonna go in one ear and out the other he's
not gonna understand what that means so he can't claim
it as true or untrue and in fact a donkey
doesn't even know the difference between truth and falsehood that's
the level that a donkey is at see we have
to be very careful with our with our assumptions here
we can't just assume that all consciousnesses and all beings
are humans nor can we assume that humans are the
highest level of consciousness and intelligence that there is in
the universe or that is accessible you know if we
go beyond ordinary human faculties so so that the sky
is blue you know this this is contingent and relative
in many ways first all which sky are we talking
about are we talking about the sky of the earth
or are we talking about the sky of another planet
you see so depends of course which planet you're standing
on but even if you are more specific and you
say well the sky of the earth is blue still
depends what time of the day or you looking at
this guy at nighttime it's not blue but even if
you say okay well Leo what I mean is the
sky during high noon with no clouds it's blue what
do you mean by blue there's need for shades of
blue which which blue are you talking about see the
mind has to take all of these factors into account
just to make sense of this statement the sky's blue
it seems so simplistic but really the sky's blue is
a gross abstraction people think well no the sky is
blue just a fact it's not a fact there's nothing
factual about that this is a gross highly complicated abstraction
which depends on how you're interpreting every word in that
statement and even even if all of that is given
to you in the end we could say well the
sky appears blue to human eyes does it appear blue
to a dog to a cat to a lizard to
a worm to an alien is it still blue there's
a worm even see a sky does the sky even
exist for a worm does the color blue even exist
for a worm there are some animals for whom colors
may not even be a thing so in that case
what is the sky actually because you know if a
worm looks at the sky and let's see he sees
it as orange and then I look at and see
his blue and some alien looks at it and sees
something else who's right what is the sky actually see
it's not so easy it's not so easy at all
these simple questions you know a human hand has five
fingers I posted a video recently on my blog of
humans who have six fingers they exist it's actually a
genetic trait that gets passed on that's a very rare
gene humans with six fingers six functional fingers pretty freaky
that's the thing you know and then even with one
plus one equals two you might say well how can
this possibly be relative and contingent you know supposedly mathematics
is the universal language even aliens on another star system
if you know if we send a binary code they're
supposed to be able to interpret our binary code or
whatever we send them and through mathematics we can communicate
this this sort of idea no that's not how it
works you see you need to understand what these symbols
mean one the symbol one the symbol plus the simple
equal sign the symbol two and then you have to
understand what is trying to be said by that statement
these are not obvious at all there was a time
in your life where you didn't know what one or
plus or equals or two was let alone how all
that stuff fit together you have to learn that that
required trial and error it required insight it required some
function of thought and the mind don't overlook that stuff
another aspect that makes all of these relative truths contingent
truths is that this is based on a sort of
a correspondence theory of truth all of Western philosophy pretty
much works on a correspondence theory of truth and really
most most philosophies and not even just West but even
Eastin around the world what this means simply is that
our understanding of what truth is it's like we have
a sense of an objective external reality out there somewhere
the way things actually are and then we have what
humans can know about it and think about it and
then what we say well the stuff that we know
which is true is that which corresponds with what's out
there in the real world and then that stuff which
we tell ourselves or think to ourselves which is false
which is not true is that stuff which does not
correspond with the world so if we say that the
sky is blue but then we go out and we
look at it and it turns out to be orange
then there's a lack of correspondence there and therefore based
on this we can determine that something is true or
false this whole notion of the correspondence theory of truth
is very problematic and tricky it's totally false it's partially
correct the problem with it is though is that it's
it's confining truth only to symbols and concepts and mind
stuff right I want you to notice that there's a
very important difference between the actual sky being blue and
your thinking or believing that the sky is blue these
are two totally different things so don't get me wrong
it's not that I'm denying that the sky is blue
per se I'm not denying that but we have to
be very careful to tease apart the typical conflation that
we have between the actual being or raw data that
is out there whatever it is the sky or the
Eiffel Tower versus our affirmation of its truth in our
own mind you see these are totally different things so
we might imagine for example for a donkey we could
imagine the donkey probably sees the sky and we might
even imagine that for the sky for the donkey disguise
probably blue reasonable to assume that given that you know
mammals have a similar nervous system and so forth eyes
work the same way probably between donkeys and humans too
reasonable to assume of course so we don't really know
but we can assume that and so so I don't
explain this so even though that's true the donkey does
not have in his mind in his consciousness the idea
that the sky is blue you see even though the
sky might be blue for him that doesn't mean he
can affirm the statement in his mind the sky is
blue nor does he even know what truth is nor
does he even know what the sky is or what
a color is okay this is very important it might
seem like I'm just making some hair-splitting semantic distinctions here
but this is very important to understand there's a very
big difference that thing which is blue might be there
for the donkey but when we say the sky is
blue is true that's an additional layer of cognitive stuff
that we're adding on to what was there originally see
even like for a human baby he can see a
blue sky but he's not going to know anything about
it nor can he say that that statement is true
see that's important so what you need to see here
is that relative truths are second-order it's something your mind
is doing on top of the reality which is there
and also it's important to note that relative truth has
an opposite which is namely falsehood and we tend to
think in terms of this duality something is true or
something is false and then it must be either true
or it must be false well that's gonna fly out
the window when we get to absolute truth so all
of that stuff I've been talking about that's not really
truth now let's get to actual truth true through the
capital T absolute truth what is this well it's tricky
and the best way to show it to you is
not by talking but through a little exercise so take
out your hand do this with me right now take
out your hand put it in front of your face
about a foot or two away focus your eyes on
it and look at it and be just become conscious
of the fact that there's a hand here or some
kind of object that you're looking at and I want
you to to really train your consciousness on the fact
that this this hand exists right now it's real this
is real this is as real as real gets you're
experiencing it right now that is absolute truth now widen
your gaze and look around the room that you're sitting
in look around see what's that what's what's here look
up and down and side to side to actually do
this with me and just become conscious right now get
out of your mind and just become conscious that reality
is happening right here this is reality this is as
real as reality guess they can't get any realer than
this be conscious of it of the entire room be
conscious of the entire room that's absolute truth but of
course you wonder will believe so so what what do
you this is not a big deal who cares I
already knew that no you didn't and you still don't
you still don't I'm trying to point you to what
it is but that doesn't mean you're conscious of what
it is I'm just pointing you to it we got
more to talk about here so stay patient with me
here this is leading somewhere so what humans conventionally call
experience our most intimate personal experience is absolute truth except
with a very deceptive wrinkle which is that experience what
we traditionally call experience is not what you think it
is it's something else and that's what I need to
explain to you here but before I do that though
what I'm saying is that everything that happens to you
everything that you experience is absolute truth in other words
if something is happening to you it must be the
truth interesting Lia why do you call it the truth
and not just experience then and Leo how can you
trust experience how do you know it's the truth these
are all very good questions that we're gonna answer as
we keep going here but let me tell you this
truth is simply that which is the case if you
want a definition for what truth is it's that which
is the case or actually we could even remove one
word from that definition or you just say truth is
simply that which is well that's removing two words that
which is the case or that which is truth is
business itself truth is being truth is actuality truth is
reality truth is direct experience that's what truth is but
the trick is what is business what is being what
is actuality what is reality what is direct experience what
is existence so the question of what is truth is
identical to the question of what is any of these
other things that I just mentioned what is existence what
is reality what is business have you ever wondered what
is easing what does it mean to is now you
might think well Lea this is just a silly word
game nobody knows how to answer this it's just you
know you can't really define what is this is but
have you thought about what that means this is a
very profound direction that we're going in that people usually
don't go in they usually don't question reality this deeply
and it's tricky how do you answer the question of
what is business it might seem like that's impossible to
answer that and yet what I'm telling you is that
it is possible and I'm telling you that right now
you have it answered it you don't understand what is
this is which is why I mean to have this
conversation and which is why this conversation is jut not
just mental masturbation but it's actually practical it'll actually lead
you somewhere I'm not wasting your time here believe me
on that front I wouldn't be doing this if this
was just all a word game and you know you
might want to go into the dictionary and check what
what does the dictionary say business is lookup is in
dictionary what will they tell you you'll immediately find there's
gonna be a problem there how do you define isness
it seems like business is something so fundamental so rock
to our experience of life that you can't even define
it with words because words aren't fundamental enough to tell
you what is 'no tsa's because words themselves are is
explain what is this is they have to be they
have to is and in fact do you have experience
of anything that isn't ism some food for thought for
you truth is the actual state of reality at all
points in space and time truth is not your knowledge
of reality truth is actual reality of which knowledge is
one part this is where it gets tricky so I'm
not saying that knowledge is separate from truth I'm saying
that there is actual reality then there's a second-order knowledge
of reality but that's still part of reality because knowledge
is within reality cuz everything is within reality because the
term reality includes everything it's one of those tricky terms
that expands to include everything that's real so truth is
reality itself so you see the problem with using knowledge
to get out the truth is that knowledge itself leads
to a sort of self reference problem because you're trying
to use knowledge to get around at itself but knowledge
is part of the thing you're trying to question so
it's like you're trying to use a finger to point
back at the finger you can't do it though that's
because we've hit rock bottom you can't go any lower
than truth you can't go any lower than reality you
can't go any lower than easing so it's just it's
so tricky to explain what truth is because it defies
explanation that's our problem here but basically what I want
to convince you of or suggest to you rather is
that think of the universe as if it's sort of
like you could say a machine and it can have
any kind of state at once like let's say it's
a computer hard drive you know computer hard drive has
bits ones and zeros and you can flip those those
bits on and off 1 or 0 and through this
you can get different states of the hard drive and
there are trillions of different states that every hard drive
can take well imagine that reality is like that except
it has no boundaries so it's infinite in all directions
there's not a limit to how many bits there are
in reality because reality has an infinite number of bits
and so the truth would be the state of all
the bits in the system whatever it is it doesn't
matter which bits are turned on or off the truth
is whatever bits are on or on and whatever bits
are off or off and that's the whole state it
defines the whole state of everything that is that's what
absolute truth means and part of that state that is
is this present moment right here right now so what
I'm telling you is that reality is not made out
of atoms the way that science says reality is made
out of truth let me repeat that reality is not
made out of atoms realities men of truth but what
is truth so see we're at work we're trying to
get deeper here and try to understand what is reality
made out of you're trying to understand what is the
very substance of the bits of which reality is made
because you know if we're considering a hard drive you
can say well Lea but but the bits in a
hard drive what are the bits in a hard drive
really made out of and you know you take a
microscope and you zoom in on it you'll see some
sort of circuitry some sort of silicon chips and whatnot
I don't really know what they make them the memory
out of some sort of silicon I assume you know
flash memory or spinning disks with sort of magnetic coating
on it what's the magnetic coating mataf iron I guess
some sort of iron film on top of some sort
of plastic or I don't know what they use copper
in a hard drive you know the spinning hard drives
so you might say well so leo so in a
hard drive in your analogy here in a hard drive
that bits are literally man of what like some sort
of iron particles right if we get to the bottom
of it's iron particles but then you're saying that reality
is man of truth how can reality be man of
truth what are the like what are the iron filings
made out of well that's exactly our problem here you
see the lower you go the more fundamental you get
at some point you get to hit rock bottom and
the problem here is that we got we hit the
self-reference problem we get strange loops as we try to
go deeper and deeper we get paradoxes as we try
to understand reality in the deepest level the reason we
get these soft reference paradoxes which I talked about it
before in my own reality is a strange loop episode
and I talked about before in the metaphysical implications of
Google's incompleteness theorem I've talked about these strange loops the
strange loops result because of a soft reference problem and
that is that look when I'm sitting here or you're
sitting there trying to understand what truth is the problem
is that we ourselves are part of the truth that
we're trying to describe which will necessarily lead to a
a soft reference problem in a paradox because again the
finger can't really point at itself and so this might
make you think well okay leo so I guess we're
stuck like we can't ever figure out what the truth
is except we can there's a paradox within a paradox
the paradox is that it seems impossible to understand the
truth but actually it's possible it just requires a radical
new state of consciousness it requires an epiphany it requires
an insight it requires an awakening so yes in that
hard drive those you know those bits let's say our
man of iron atoms but then what are atoms Matt
have quarks and what acrux made out of something smaller
strings and what our strings mataf what see science can't
answer these questions because of the self-reference problem but you
can go beyond science and you can go beyond the
self reference problem and you can realize that what everything
is ultimately made out of including atoms strings molecules hard
drives humans animals space-time and everything else is math truth
I also want you to notice an interesting thing in
this sort of model that we have where reality is
these bits that are turned on and off if we
turn all the bits off to zero that's still going
to be truth so what I want you to notice
is that it's impossible to escape truth truth is always
the case because truth is not dependent upon any particular
state of this system it doesn't matter if all the
bits are off or all of them are on or
whatever combination of bits in between is on and off
and all this it doesn't matter that is the state
of reality so we're actually talking about the entire state
of the entire universe and not just at this point
in time but all points in time in all points
in space and not just this universe but all multiverses
everything every last [ __ ] thing that could ever
possibly be whatever it is whatever it was whatever it
will be that's the absolute truth remember the definition of
truth is that which is the case that means if
you're sitting here and you've got an itch on your
ass that is the case that is truth that's why
it's happening to you if it wasn't the truth you
couldn't experience it it couldn't be happening to you and
this goes for everything that you've ever experienced in your
life and anything that ever happened in history or will
ever happen in the future so if you want to
think of it from God's point of view so to
speak imagine God sitting outside the universe somehow and looking
down upon it as if that was possible looking down
upon it and seeing the entire state of everything within
creation has ever happened and that entire snapshot of the
state of all of creation that would be the absolute
truth but also not just the big picture but also
the small picture so if God sort of took a
telescope and zoomed in or a microscope and zoomed into
the universe and you know looked at one little particle
on one little leaf on one tree on one planet
in one galaxy on earth let's say looks at this
little leaf looks the particle zooms in on that whatever
that's being shown to him that is also part of
the absolute truth you see because the big picture is
simply the summation of all the little pictures you might
say every molecule that you can zoom into is part
of the big picture just like the big picture is
all of it at once now let's consider the following
example I'm going to show you here an equation on
the screen 1 plus 1 equals 3 and now I
have a question for you is this the truth careful
it's a trick question is this the truth what do
you think yes or no the answer is yes now
I deliberately picked this example because it's tricky and I
want to illustrate the point so stick with me try
to understand what I'm trying to say here it's a
little difficult to to get it across what I'm saying
here is not that 1 plus 1 actually equals 3
in the symbolic sense that you're looking at these symbols
and try to interpret the meaning I'm trying to get
underneath that I'm trying to help you to get underneath
that to realize that there's something more fundamental about this
equation than its meaning or its symbols are trying to
convey so yes ordinarily we would say 1 plus 1
equals 3 is false because we're interpreting that from the
symbolic level but what I'm trying to get you to
do is to realize that that symbolic interpretation and that
symbolic falsehood that's a second-order relative thing there's something more
fundamental happening which we call truth which is the isness
or the being or the very experience of the equation
that's written here so in this sense I say that
it's truth I'm not saying that it's true I'm saying
it is truth are you catching that subtle difference to
understand this you have to stop looking at this equation
symbolically or what it means because the symbolism and the
meaning of it is second-order before you can have a
symbol that you can interpret and you can analyze whether
it's true or false or whatever else well other kind
of meaning you want to give it first of course
you understand that the symbol has to exist it has
to is it has to be and for it to
be it must be part of the truth see it's
not the whole truth river I I didn't say that
this is the whole truth it is the truth but
the truth includes all the little parts so this is
one little part of the ultimate truth the ultimate big
picture you see so somewhere in the universe right now
obviously there exists one plus one equals three namely on
your screen right here you're looking at it you're experiencing
it so obviously it exists for you obviously it's true
for you it is the case that's how this is
part of the truth the absolute truth so what we're
doing here is we're distinguishing between knowledge and isness and
now here's the the real mindfuck that i want you
to understand is that false things must also exist in
fact the very concept and notion of falsehood which we
ordinarily think is the opposite of truth actually exists it
must exist because the only thing that exists are things
that exist so the only way you can think of
the concept of falsehood is because it exists in your
mind right now it is the case the concept of
falsehood is the case are you getting that you can't
escape truth falsehood is a second-order relativistic thing not a
first-order thing as far as first-order things go the rock-bottom
of what reality consists of is only truth truth as
an absolute truth with no opposite there is no opposite
to absolute truth absolute truth does not no falsehood there
actually isn't any falsehood in reality there's only falsehood as
a concept there is no such thing as non-existence in
actuality there's only non-existence as a concept you see to
even think of non-existence that idea has to exist to
even say that a statement is false the statement has
to exist and you saying that is false has to
exist these are not just words I'm saying something very
profound here that you need to grasp at a level
deeper than merely language and deeper than logic I want
you to see that non-existence is impossible I want you
to see that falsehood is impossible now of course you're
suspicious and you're right to be suspicious you can be
all suspicious of me as much as you want because
what I'm saying is not based on a belief system
or an ideology that I have what I'm saying is
the truth it's actually what's happening it's actually what is
the case I mean I'm explaining to you precisely how
your experience works okay in your experience there actually is
no such thing as non-existence there is only existence but
you raise the objection but Leo this doesn't make any
sense because look like I'm looking at you right now
let's say for example and I'm seeing you of course
you exist and I'm seeing the stuff around you this
is all real ok we can agree on that it
exists but what about a kangaroo like Leo there's no
kangaroo right here right now so look the kangaroo does
it exist good let's go with that example so notice
what is actually happening there you're actually getting lost in
concept but you're not aware of how you're getting lost
in concept with this kangaroo so what's actually happening is
that you're imagining a kangaroo in your mind that image
of the kangaroo exists as an image in your mind
and then furthermore you're projecting that image onto what is
happening here on this screen before you and then you're
kind of imagining like kangaroo could potentially exist here somewhere
maybe a kangaroo could be sitting on my head you
could imagine that and then furthermore you say to yourself
well but yeah I think that could be the case
but it isn't the case and therefore the statement that
there's a kangaroo on Leo's head is false and therefore
there's a the kangaroo doesn't exist but all of that
that whole chain of of mental I don't know what
you call it mental work mental gymnastics that you're doing
all that conceptualizing that you're doing there in that scenario
all of it exists so what is really happening when
you think that non-existence is real is that you're fooling
yourself it's like an optical illusion you're fooling yourself using
your mind - is running through these cycles through these
loops and it's from losing track of these loops and
it's forgetting that really what it's doing is that it's
it's easing it's creating your mind is literally creating the
idea of non-existence but to create the idea of non-existence
it has to exist so you're literally bringing non-existence into
existence as a concept not as actuality because in actuality
there cannot be non-existence you see there's only truth there's
no such thing as falsehood falsehood is a conceptual second-order
phenomenon pretty cool huh interesting interesting how about your death
what is your death if non-existence isn't real is your
death real can you die what is your death is
your death actually something truthful is it actually a case
a fact or is it something that you're imagining something
conceptual in something second-order huh see now now we get
into some interesting possibilities all of a sudden now all
the sudden the possibility opens up that maybe maybe death
isn't what you thought it was maybe death isn't as
final as you thought it was interesting but you still
might be asking leo but what is truth itself you
still haven't told me you're playing these word games and
it's like yeah I'm looking at my hand right now
and you said my hand is the truth look at
your hand but what are you really looking at what
is it what is isness what is existence what does
it mean to say that something is true well I'm
not being slippery on purpose here even though it might
sound that way this is just the very nature of
the limitations of language and not just language but logic
and the human mind you see where we're getting so
deep that we're starting to transcend language and we're running
into paradox what truth is cannot be told to you
because it's already right in front of you right now
and yet you're still not getting it see the only
one who can grasp what truth is is you I
can't do it for you only you can do it
for you because the truth is intimate it's it's infused
directly into your state of being in your state of
consciousness the truth is not some foreign object that we
can look upon with a telescope or a microscope and
we can analyze it as though we're some sort of
impartial observer we are intimately interwoven with the very thing
that we're trying to understand here so if you're asking
me to tell you what the truth is you fundamentally
misunderstand what the truth is because I can't tell you
what the truth is because the truth is right in
front of you and any word that I say will
just be more truth more parts of the truth more
isness I'm easing at you here this entire video I'm
just easing at you but you don't know what is
this is so how do you find out well you
is your isn't put your awareness on is in itself
and keep it there and keep it there and keep
it there and keep it there until you get very
bored and frustrated and keep it there some more and
keep it there some more and keep it there for
10 hours keep it there for a hundred hours keep
it there for a thousand hours keep it there for
5,000 hours and at some point it will dawn upon
you what is nice is and that will be a
revolutionary discovery for you even though really nothing will change
the colors and sights and sounds of this room will
still all be the same nothing will really change yet
at the same time everything will change because suddenly you
will understand in one fell swoop what existence is you
see the problem here is that it's like I'm trying
to explain to a donkey what his reflection is in
the mirror I'm trying to get him to recognize his
reflection and I have this giant mirror and I'm holding
up in front of the donkey and I'm pointing to
the to the mirror you know the image here's the
donkey's reflection and I'm telling you no I'm grabbing the
donkey by the ears I'm I'm pulling and I'm saying
it looks stupid look at look at your face this
is you you look you this is you I'm doing
this I'm yelling at the donkey but the donkey's standing
there giving me a stupid look and he just doesn't
understand and nothing I say or do will make him
understand unless he has a massive epiphany and a a
sudden insight or a realization of like oh that's me
Oh like that that's that's our communication gap here see
you are that donkey you know people take for granted
the ability to recognize ones image or reflection in a
mirror this is a highly sophisticated thing that only the
most advanced life forms can do most animals on this
planet cannot do it chips can do it I think
dolphins can do it a few other animals can do
it Ravens I think can do it and a few
others but most animals can't do it they're not conscious
enough likewise most humans are not conscious enough to recognize
what business is what truth is and so because of
this it seems impossible but then again plenty of people
have done it so you can do it it's just
that it takes some work it's not a biological thing
it takes work it takes practice you cannot understand what
truth is without a massive awakening it's also impossible to
know what the truth is without knowing what the truth
is it's a catch-22 to know what the truth is
you have to already know what the truth is if
you knew what the truth was you wouldn't need to
watch this episode and if you don't know what the
truth is and you watch this episode you still won't
know what the truth is so how do you get
to the truth well you can't get to it because
it's already here it's already here you're just not recognizing
it it's a function of recognition it's a lack of
consciousness that's the problem it's not a lack of proof
it's not a lack of evidence it's not a lack
of logic it's a lack of consciousness on your part
truth is not something your brain as thinking or holding
truth is not something your mind is doing truth isn't
a thought a thought is part of the truth I
want you to consider the following interesting scenario if the
entire universe was destroyed the truth would still exist what
leo how could that be so because the truth would
be that there is no universe you see the truth
becomes whatever is the case remember what I said truth
is that which is the case so if it is
the case that there is no universe that's the case
that's the truth if it is the case that there
is a universe that's the truth see truth is a
really slippery beast you might think well Leo but what
if there just isn't any truth but you see you
contradict yourself if you imagine a scenario in which like
let's say you imagine an alternate universe where there never
was any truth at all a non truth universe if
that's the case then that would be the truth the
truth would be that there is no truth see in
this way like I said before the truth is inescapable
and it's absolute you cannot destroy the truth because destruction
itself must be the case if you imagine destruction if
destruction happens then that's what happens and that's what the
truth is the truth doesn't care about the details of
the universe the truth like that hard drive I was
talking about it doesn't matter if you flip all the
bits to off that doesn't bother the hard drive it's
just in that state it's sort of in an off
state so the universe can be in an off state
or an on state or anywhere in between it doesn't
matter that's what it is and it is that so
when we say that there is no universe you might
say well it's been destroyed and therefore there there exists
nothing but be very very careful about how you're thinking
about this in that example they're literally exists nothing which
is not the same thing as non-existence because remember non-existence
isn't a real thing non-existence is a concept non-existence has
to exist as a concept for there to be non-existence
so if you actually completely wipe the universe clean to
just a completely blank slate what you're left with is
not non-existence what you're left with is pure empty existence
pure isness pure formlessness which is pure absolute truth which
exists it exists because it is existence itself it is
what is the case truth is not a linguistic or
a semantic notion all things and all concepts depend upon
their first being truth truth is prior to everything else
including all physical objects time space and the universe in
fact all those objects time space and the universe energy
matter and all of that that is just an aspect
of the ultimate truth now let's address another important objection
that you probably have which is the one about experience
so you might even be agreeing with various things that
I'm saying here but then of course you're coming from
the materials paradigm so you have to bring up the
objection of subjective experience something along the lines I believe
yeah okay you're describing our experiences here and maybe our
experience our human experience does work this way that you're
where you're talking about but this is just human experience
human perception why are you placing so much importance on
human perception it's just human perception people can hallucinate stuff
and you know this isn't the real world the real
world is out there behind the curtain of perception how
do we know what daddy is here is where the
ego comes in the problem is that the ego has
co-opted absolute truth or is Nisour being and has turned
it into a conceptual amalgam that we call conventionally experience
there actually is no such thing as experience or perception
as I have explained in my episode what is perception
go check that out for a detailed explanation but there
is no such thing as perception or experience there is
only absolute truth perception and experience is a second-order thing
that the mind projects on to the truth it's a
it's an illusion it's a delusion you might say because
you're committed to the idea that you exist so because
you think you were born and because you think you
exist as a human as a biological entity you think
that this truth here is somehow happening to you through
a system of of perception their sense organs there's light
molecules bouncing forth you know photons and so forth bouncing
into your eye getting interpreted the mind is creating all
of this this whole scheme that you have learned from
science and from culture this is all a self-involved fantasy
that allows you to believe that you exist as a
human being as a biological creature that was born in
time and in space that's the ego that's you that's
what you think you are so right now I'm telling
you that you're not real so to understand what truth
is you would have to stop believing that you're real
which which explains why truth is so rare and which
explains why truth is so little understood by by human
beings which explains why scientists don't know what the truth
is why philosophers don't know what the truth is why
many spiritual people don't know what the truth is because
they're committed to their existence and the only way you
will understand what the truth is is by realizing that
you're not real so what is the thing that's preventing
you from realizing everything I'm saying in this episode it's
your insistence that you are real it's your insistence that
you're a human that you're a biological entity that's an
illusion there are no biological entities there are no sense
organs there is no such thing as perception there is
only absolute truth and there is no such thing as
experience and there is no such thing as subjectivity there
is only objective absolute ultimate truth this truth is so
objective that it's true across the board for the entire
universe for all living beings because all living beings are
solutions so here's the trick that your mind has been
playing on you it's been telling you that this this
world of colors and sights and sounds and ideas and
personal feelings and emotions and pains and suffering and all
of this human all of this animal stuff that you
thought you were experiencing which wasn't the actual real world
you thought the real world was somewhere behind a curtain
this is the real world this is the universe this
is reality the universe reality is acting like a human
or like an animal and it's having feelings and sensations
they can get horny and hungry and it can cry
and it can get angry and pissed off and they
can get his feelings hurt it could be happy it
can be sad it can be depressed the universe can
be all these things the universe is all these things
because look here it is you're doing it actually you're
not doing it it is doing you are you getting
this make sure you don't misunderstand me when I say
that there's no such thing as experience or perception I
am NOT saying that if you realize this that all
the colors and sights and sounds will disappear all the
emotions and feelings will disappear and you will be in
some sort of black hole that's not what I'm saying
I'm saying all the colors and sights and sounds and
feelings and emotions will all be here exactly like they
were before but the only thing that will be missing
is you you will be gone you so imagine that
we took the universe and we kept it precisely as
it is we took your entire perceptual field that you
thought was the purpose perceptual field and we keep it
precisely as it is nothing changes but the only thing
we do is we take a magic wand and we
hit you over the head and you disappear you disappear
I don't mean your body that your body doesn't disappear
you disappear that thing you think you are inside the
body that thing that thing I'm pointing at that that
right there that's not the body nor is that colors
or sounds or shapes or feelings the thing that is
experiencing all the colors and sights and feelings the thing
that I'm pointing my finger at right now is that
thing that thing that you think is you that thing
that you think is gonna die that thing you think
was born that thing imagine that we got rid of
that thing and everything else stayed the same are you
getting that then what would happen if we could get
rid of that thing is that experience would be recontextualized
perception would be recontextualized into pure objective absolute truth subjectivity
would disappear from the universe there is no such thing
as subjectivity unless you imagine that you exist so if
you're wondering we'll Leo how is it possible that a
human being could access absolute truth objective truth it seems
impossible because we're stuck in subjectivity but what you're not
realizing is that you're only stuck in subjectivity because you
imagine that you're a subject stop imagining that your subject
and subjectivity will cease to exist and then you will
be left with pure objectivity what you thought was subjectivity
will become objectivity and through this way we can access
absolute truth even though were just mere humans of course
the reality is that were not mere humans we imagine
that were humans if we were actually humans you're right
we could never access absolute truth fortunately enough for us
we're not humans because humans are imaginary it's a lot
to take in I understand I know it's a lot
to take in but uh there's no other way let's
just go for it directly why beat around the bush
right by the way if you're having an emotional reaction
against this notice that your mind is designed with elaborate
sophisticated ingenious defense mechanisms to prevent you from understanding what
I'm saying so if you get angry depressed fearful if
your start if your heart starts to pound and race
if you make a little panic attack if you little
taste of existential terror you're right on the right track
those are defense mechanisms fear is a defense mechanism anger
is a defense mechanism criticism of me is a defense
mechanism every reaction you have against this information as a
defense mechanism that is trying to distract you from the
truth penetrating right through you and annihilating you see because
you're trying to survive the truth is that you're not
interested in the truth you're interested in survival and it's
it's hard to bust through that veil of disinterest that
you have contrary to what many Western philosophers believe the
truth is not an epistemic EnOcean truth is actually metaphysical
but also really what happens is that metaphysics and epistemology
as a duality these two they they must be reconciled
and they must interpret rate and unify into one and
so that's what happens in non duality that's what happens
at a non dual state truth is non dual truth
is the unification of all dualities and so what we're
doing when we're eliminating the the you we're eliminating the
experiencer of experience we're eliminating the perceiver of perception such
that all that remains is just pure experience or per
your perception but what is pure experience or pure perfect
perception it's absolute truth here are some interesting features of
absolute truth absolute truth has no opposite absolute truth cannot
be proven by scientific experiment absolute truth cannot be captured
in a symbol absolute truth cannot be captured in a
mathematical equation absolute truth cannot be quantified enumerated or formalized
in any way absolute truth cannot be communicated absolute truth
cannot be taught absolute truth is infinite absolute truth is
one singular total absolute truth is utterly paradoxical and illogical
and it makes no sense to the mind absolute truth
must necessarily negate itself any quality that you ascribe to
absolute truth is both true and false and both and
neither that's the paradoxical nature of truth because absolute truth
possesses all qualities including the quality of having no quality
and so when you ask what is the isness what
is existence what is truth Lia what is it you
still haven't told me what it is it's nothing isn't
anything there it's consciousness consciousness is nothing right now put
your consciousness on your consciousness put your awareness on your
awareness and ask yourself what is awareness what is this
mysterious thing called awareness do it right now and notice
that there's nothing there that's pure existence pure isness pure
truth awareness you can't find any form or quality to
awareness because the quality of awareness is that it has
no qualities but also it has all qualities and all
forms say it goes full circle it's very paradoxical don't
worry if you're not getting it this is like I
said this is some of the most advanced stuff that
you'll ever hear me say this is one of the
most advanced teachings that you could hear as a human
being this is a very tricky stuff so it'll probably
take you years to understand everything I say here don't
worry about that you know we gotta just start somewhere
just jump right in try to figure it out and
then you know some of you will actually get it
but you might be lucky and you'll get it for
a second and then you'll lose it that's usually how
it works you'll get it for a split second or
you got it for a minute and then you lose
it don't worry about that - that's all just part
of the process you're gonna have to keep piercing through
that veil over and over and over again until this
this this understanding stabilizes we're just we're just getting you
started here are some other aspects some important aspects of
truth truth is consciousness truth is the whole universe truth
is God truth is love truth is uncaused a mechanical
and self created truth is eternal meaning in us outside
of time truth is not localized it's not limited to
space truth is intelligent and sentient truth is good absolute
good with a capital G truth has no beginning or
end there is nothing beyond the absolute truth truth is
everything and simultaneously nothing truth is form and formlessness truth
includes all dualities and distinctions and differences truth is all-powerful
it creates everything because it is everything truth is now
the present moment of now is the truth truth is
impossible to avoid truth is mysterious and mystical by its
very nature truth is not knowing truth is utter mind
[ __ ] truth is enormous truth is life transforming
truth is so important that it is beyond importance truth
is so meaningful that is beyond meaning truth is life
and death truth is the only thing there is and
could ever be truth cannot be turned into an ideology
truth is radical truth is awesome and terrifying at the
same time truth is paradise and total perfection truth is
self-awareness truth is self-illuminating self knowing and self-evident truth is
omniscience truth is totally direct it has zero process method
or mechanism truth is a solution to all human problems
truth is the aim of all philosophy and spirituality truth
has many practical implications which I won't be getting into
in this episode but just know that they exist many
many practical implications truth is you you are the truth
truth is not something you think or know truth is
what you are pretty cool huh now I said a
lot of deep stuff there I equated truth with many
different things and you're probably scratching your head about some
of those and I just don't have enough time right
now to go into detail on each one of those
things that I equated truth with just know that what
I said is correct if you investigate this stuff for
yourself for years eventually maybe after a decade or two
you will discover that everything I just said in that
list is correct but if you have to really work
at it one of the trips was truth is that
it's multi-dimensional it's got layers to it it's got aspects
to it it's got degrees to it and so what
that means is that even if you understand one aspect
of the truth that doesn't mean you understand all the
aspects of the truth there's a lot there so I
through a lot of different aspects at you some of
them might still be mysterious and puzzling and confusing to
you that's okay just understand that I'm just kind of
giving you a road map you know a high-level road
map that you'll use for a decade going forward in
your in your work so now let's do a little
FAQ first question Leah where did the truth come from
like how did it get here it must have come
from somewhere right who created it was it the Big
Bang was it God what it didn't come from anywhere
because anywhere it might have come from is a place
that you have to imagine and anywhere it goes to
is also a place so you need two places but
these two places they are the case remember anything is
the case is the truth so if there are two
places that already is the truth so where do those
two cases come from nowhere not only are they coming
from nowhere they are nowhere now everywhere is nowhere no
when no how no thing the truth is nothing which
is everything which is infinity which is what all of
this is what is infinity everything that's precisely happening right
now exactly as it is and the way that has
always happened throughout the whole universe throughout all of human
history that is infinity everything is infinity the definition of
infinity is your life you're living it you're living through
infinity your life is like one wormhole through a giant
ball of infinity this is what infinity looks like your
life my life your parents life your dog's life and
so forth that's infinity where did it come from it
didn't come from anywhere because it's actually nowhere and it's
nothing and how is that possible it's possible because there's
no difference between possible and impossible and that's God where
did God come from God always was its eternity it
existed forever it can't go anywhere because it has nowhere
to go because for it to go somewhere it would
need to have somewhere to go but how can I
have something where to go if that's somewhere to go
is already part of it see can't go anywhere it's
stuck it's stuck for eternity you're stuck here for eternity
you exist forever sorry to break it to you next
question but Leo what if you're deluded all of this
sounds nice but couldn't you be wrong you talked about
LSD and psychedelics isn't that just delusions yeah there's just
no way to get around it you see the problem
here is that it's like you're sort of like that
donkey I'm pointing to your reflection I'm showing you the
reflection and you're asking me but Lea what if you're
deluded what if I'm not the donkey what if I'm
not the reflection and how do you answer that you
can't answer it it just is what it is you
can't explain truth any further truth is the most fundamental
thing there is so I understand if you think I'm
deluded you might have your reasons for believing that I
totally understand but the truth is just the truth I
can't really you know come up with a little story
for you do a little song and dance for you
to convince you that Debbie what is this this is
not what we're doing here well I'm doing here I'm
not trying to convince you of anything I'm trying to
just show you things that you're overlooking the most obvious
things that you're overlooking in your direct experience right now
and so my claim is that if you want to
know what I know just do the things that I
tell you to do well use the techniques I tell
you to use and you will come to know the
things that I know all right it's not complicated this
is exactly how science works you know like if a
scientist tells you that there's a new planet that he
discovered in our solar system an 11th planet or whatever
and you tell them well but what if you're deluded
the scientists will say well look here I have a
microscope or telescope go look into the telescope and there
it is and if you tell him but but what
if you're deluded about telescopes what if telescopes are delusionary
well nobody can help you dude if that's your position
you can't be helped you're stuck you're [ __ ]
you're like that dog you can't understand see what you
need to be much more worried about is not my
own delusions but yours what if you're deluded what if
this is the absolute truth exactly I'm telling you but
you're so deluded you're so attached to being yourself that
you think this is all subjective you think this is
your personal experience yeah you know what that's called that's
called egotism daddy is the very heart of delusion so
the irony is that you're projecting your own delusion onto
me what I'm telling you what I'm pointing you to
is absolute truth you're too deluded to understand it therefore
you call me deluded that's a defense mechanism we already
talked about those next question but Leo what if there's
something beyond absolute truth aha I have you I have
you Leo how do you know how can you possibly
know that there can't be something beyond absolute truth you
can only ask this question when you don't know and
aren't conscious of the absolute truth absolute truth is infinity
its boundless it's everything there can't be anything beyond it
because it is all things you got to understand that
if you don't understand that then to you you have
absolute truth as a concept in your mind when you
have absolute truth as a concept in your mind then
yeah you can imagine something beyond it but that's because
you didn't actually have full consciousness of it it was
just a concept in your mind of course you could
have another concept another concept in your mind but what
I'm telling you is that absolute truth is the sum
total of all possible concepts you could ever have so
if you can imagine something beyond absolute truth the absolute
truth is that it includes that already and if you
can imagine something beyond that it includes that as well
it includes everything you could possibly imagine because it is
your very imagination the imagination you're using to come up
with these objections is itself the absolute truth that doesn't
mean your objections are true it just means that you're
deluded you're confusing conceptual truths with absolute truth next question
but leo how come science doesn't validate what you're saying
what you're saying here sounds so radical and it sounds
so significant and important that surely if this was true
you would get alike a Nobel Prize or something right
but who would give me a Nobel Prize if the
people handing out the Nobel Prize are themselves unaware of
what truth is how are they gonna validate what I'm
saying they can't the very nature of truth is that
it can't be validated because it's you you got to
get it you got to get it it's sort of
like you're asking you know imagine that donkey Bachelet that
donkey could talk and he was very skeptical about this
idea that that this image in the mirror is actually
him so he was talking back to me and you
know coming up with cute objections and one of his
objections was something like this well Leo if that image
in the mirror really was me if I was that
donkey then this is the most radical radical discovery ever
you should get a Nobel Prize for that why don't
you get a Nobel Prize well because the people who
are running the Nobel Prize Committee are also [ __
] donkeys just like you and when I show them
the mirror they also will say the same thing you
see the delusion is so thick that it's very difficult
to escape you can't depend upon other human beings validating
this for you sorry that's not how truth works why
do you assume it should work that way what if
absolute truth is only something you can access personally yourself
what if what if that's true that means that all
of your appeals to science mathematics professors Pope's and priests
and Zen masters and gurus none of it will help
you none of it will help you and that is
in fact the case next question leo what is the
relationship between absolute truth and relative truths like science and
mathematics are you saying that all of science and math
is [ __ ] how can that be the case
because you know science and math they seem to work
we sent a man to the moon or so so
people believe if you're not a conspiracy theorist you know
science has accomplished some amazing things that's true science has
some accomplished some amazing things and the reason that is
is because science is full of relative truths and math
is full of relative truths and relative truths in the
relative world the world that we live our life in
are very handy and useful and important and they can
help you to survive but it's not absolute truth science
is not based on absolute truth because the interesting thing
about absolute truth is that it's not necessary to know
absolute truth in order to live life in order to
do science in order to just kind of like engage
in the relative world knowing the absolute truth is not
important for that but also it is important because relative
truths do have to correspond in some way with absolute
truth there is some sort of tracking that's going on
between scientific truth and actual isness and being you know
when we say that the sky is blue we are
saying some sort of partial truth we're capturing some essence
of the absolute the absolute is the actual sky and
it's actual color but when we have a second-order conceptual
statement about it like the sky is blue or whatever
yeah we're capturing some aspect of it but never the
whole relative truth are always finite an absolute truth is
infinite and so you can keep discovering more and more
relative truths till it until the end of time and
you will never exhaust all of them nor will you
ever get to the absolute because the absolute is right
here right now you don't get to the absolute by
an accumulation of relative truths you get to the absolute
by realizing it's everything at once and science and math
are just not in that business they're in a different
business they're not in the business of finding absolute truth
they're in the business of studying relative my new show
in the world they're in the business of studying form
and all form is relative contingent it's changing all the
time it's dependent upon perception and experience and all this
it's dualistic see science doesn't care about and doesn't study
metaphysics and what we're talking about here is metaphysics yet
at the same time I'm there really isn't a difference
between metaphysics and physics or between your everyday life unless
you believe there is which is the case with science
next question well Leo it sounds like you're saying that
there's two truths there's the relative and there's the absolute
isn't that a duality shouldn't reality be non-dual like you
said all the time in the past isn't that the
highest truth that everything's non-dual but then you pause these
two different truths how can that be again this is
the the paradoxical nature of truth is that it's both
its non-dual and its dual ultimately when you're at the
highest level of non-dual consciousness there is only one thing
there's only absolute truth there are really no relative truths
even all the relative truths sort of collapse into and
just become one aspect or facet of the absolute but
most of us most of the time are just sort
of in a in a in an ordinary conventional dualistic
state of consciousness and we're just going about our lives
and so in that sense it's helpful to talk about
the relative and the absolute as though they're two separate
things they're not really two separate things but it's helpful
to distinguish them precisely because we need we need not
only the whole truth but we also need partial truths
partial truths are useful for manipulating reality see you can't
really manipulate reality effectively when you know all of reality
as one whole you can't do anything with it you
got to like break it up into pieces and chunks
then you can shift those chunks and pieces around in
the same way that you know if you just have
one solid harddrive of date of like all ones and
no zeros you can't do anything with that hard drive
the function of the hard drive is precisely in that
you can do subdivide all the different bits into little
pieces and then you can make a very complex soup
of ones and zeros which creates the thing that you're
working with and you can shuffle those around using software
and then that allows your computer to do sophisticated stuff
so that's kind of how is working and not just
science but ordinary human life you know there's truth in
science there's choose within business there's truth within relationships this
truths within your everyday life like you can ask your
your spouse hey did you go to the grocery store
to pick up the milk and the spouse can tell
you yes or no and we can correlate that with
stuff that's happened with evidence and all that that's all
relative but also it's all it's all absolute as well
it's just that the relative is a part of the
absolute it's sort of like if I have my hand
here I can either talk about the entire hand or
I can talk about one of the fingers but the
finger is not different from the hand it's just one
part one aspect of the hand see so when I
called the finger a hand I'm not lying the finger
is a hand it's just a part of the hand
get that next question Leo how is absolute truth useful
or practical this is tricky to answer because on the
one hand it's not useful and practical at all that's
not its function on the other hand though what you
have to understand is that usefulness and practicality itself is
a part of absolute truth if there was no absolute
truth usefulness of practicality couldn't exist because there would be
no world so if you want to know what is
the function of absolute truth the function of absolute truth
is to be the substance of the entire [ __
] universe you see the problem is that when you're
in the universe and you take you to the universe
for granted when you take existence for granted then you
can sit around and you can wonder well Lea what's
the usefulness of existence but do you realize the stupidity
of that logic because if if you're treating existence as
though it's not useful well that means that the existence
of your daughter is not useful the existence of your
parents are not useful the existence of sex is not
useful that means money doesn't exist and it's no longer
useful what is usefulness usefulness requires existence so it's so
useful that is useless of course it goes full circle
the absolute truth is so useful that it's useless which
is precisely why nobody cares about it nobody pursues it
and nobody gets it next question leo why should I
pursue the truth what's in it for me first of
all that's a stupid question what's in it for me
stop asking what's in it for me all the time
that's your problem right there you'll fix 50% of your
life problems by just stop if you just stop asking
what's in it for me the other answer to your
question here is that you shouldn't there is no should
if you want to pursue the truth if you're curious
if you're interested if it's something that appeals to you
then pursue it and if it doesn't if you don't
give a [ __ ] then don't go away do
something else go watch some stupid cat videos on YouTube
I won't care that's what most people do anyways there
is absolutely no reason for why you should pursue the
truth that's the truth but also at the same time
I don't want to make it seem as though pursuing
the truth is a completely frivolous activity which will not
improve your life in any way it'll improve your life
enormous ly in many ways and I've talked in past
episodes about how Awakening can benefit you in various selfish
ways primarily the benefit to defining the truth beyond just
the beauty of it and the wonder of it is
that it eliminates suffering that's probably your most selfish reason
to pursue it suffering is an illusion suffering is falsehood
so when you discover the absolute truth it cuts out
a lot of suffering for your life and in fact
that's most why most people end up discovering the absolute
truth if they do is because they suffer so much
that the suffering leads them desperately to want to escape
it and so they end up stumbling their way into
the truth although I don't really recommend that approach first
of all to this very painful second of all because
there's a higher motivation if you want to pursue the
truth pursue it because you care about it pursue it
because you value truth for truths sake pursue it for
the beauty pursue it for the love of it pursue
it out of curiosity not because you want to escape
some suffering next question leo how can I discover absolute
truth for myself what do I need to do you
need to begin to meditate and develop a laser focused
concentration ability you need to do yoga I recommend Kriya
yoga I've talked about it in the past I have
guides about it on the forum go check out the
forum where there's some threads about how to begin create
you go I have books on my book list about
Kriya yoga check that out powerful technique you need to
start doing psychedelics probably the most powerful technique for discovering
absolute through this psychedelics you can start doing self inquiry
you can start contemplating using a journal I have an
episode about that how to contemplate using a journal I
also recommend you start to read some books on my
book list about truth and about non-duality about spirituality about
consciousness watch more of my videos put in the time
and actually do the practices meditation concentration self inquiry psychedelics
yoga that's basically how you get there if you're not
doing those practices you'll you'll not get there so start
doing them and there's other methods you know there's a
lot of different spiritual techniques out there but these are
the ones I feel are the most powerful the ones
that I'm most familiar with so that's what I recommend
but you can find crazy stuff like you know Jesus
supposedly went out into the desert and spent 30 days
or 40 days how long I don't know he was
out in the desert with no food and no water
you know that's a classic spiritual technique it's called the
Vision Quest that could work again it's very painful I
don't I don't recommend it but you could do that
you know Jesus also did baptism you know what baptism
is not that not the [ __ ] they do
today real baptism is when somebody grabs your head dunks
you into a river full of water until you start
to choke and suffocate on the water until you're right
at the brink of asphyxiation and death and then they
pull you out that's real baptism that's a spiritual technique
again I don't recommend you use that it's kind of
dangerous these days you know cut up barbaric but hey
that's what people used in the past to to awaken
to the truth next question Leo how will I know
that I've actually discovered the absolute truth and then I'm
not just deluding myself that's a very good question it
certainly is possible to delude yourself as you go about
pursuing absolute truth but at the same time there is
a moment where you will actually have a genuine authentic
awakening to the absolute truth and it will be self-evident
you will know it because you will be it it
is self validating it is the highest authority in the
universe sustains our universe what other authority do you want
do you want the Pope to come validate your Europe
your awakening you don't need it by the time you're
awake you don't need anyone to validate your awakening but
until you get there yeah you could delude yourself so
be careful don't worry it's to be a massive massive
massive epiphany when you understand absolute truth you understand the
entire universe in a sense you know that's a big
deal very big deal it's not something that you just
like accidentally it happens to you and then you you
know you you sleep through it and it's like damn
it Leo I I got I woke to the absolute
truth but I slept through it or I was just
distracted watching television or something you know my dog was
barking ayat I overlooked it and now I don't know
what it is like it doesn't work this way next
question Leo how can a psychedelic reveal the app so
the truth isn't psychedelics just a chemical in the brain
no it's not you think that a psychedelic is a
chemical in the brain but a psychedelic has nothing really
to do with chemicals or brains it just does the
answers it just does it won't make sense to you
try it and you'll see it the proof is in
the in the tests we run the tests and see
what happens I will guarantee you that if you do
enough psychedelics you will be revealed the absolute truth it's
just it's just the case it's just a fact I
can't give you a little cute story about why it
is the way it is it just is this [
__ ] way and it can't be explained to you
because you're not awake once you awaken then you'll understand
it'll be so shocking that you'll understand why I couldn't
explain it to you next question Leo how can truth
be love isn't love just an emotion this is a
deep question I I don't really want to go into
explaining it too much sure I'll have dedicated episodes in
the future about how truth and love are connected I'll
just say for now that they're absolutely identical love is
not an emotion love is not a human thing love
is the very substrate of existence love is consciousness love
is nothingness love is truth I know that sounds outlandish
you don't believe that the universe can possibly love leo
how can the universe love this is silly it's so
new agey well you're deluded so it can't be explained
to you until you awaken you need to have an
awakening into the nature of what love is and just
because you had an awakening into the nature of truth
does not mean you understand what love is that's an
additional little wrinkle right there next question but Leo if
I go pursuing the truth like you say and then
I find the truth isn't it possible that my truth
will be different from your truth like maybe you know
different people can have their own truths no that's not
possible you can interpret it in different ways you can
conceptualize the apse of the truth in different ways you
can speak about in different ways you can use different
metaphors you can access different aspects of it but it
itself is singular and if you really go deep with
this and you discover all the aspects you'll see that
it accords with what I'm telling you here so you're
not gonna have this problem next question but Leo is
what you're saying in this video is this the truth
or not because if what you're saying here is the
truth then you contradict yourself because you say the truth
can't be spoken and get Leo if what you're saying
here isn't the truth then why am I even listening
to you because everything you're saying here is false and
it's not the truth and you also contradict yourself because
supposedly you're telling me what the truth is here and
yet you're also trying to tell me that this isn't
the truth so which is it are you saying the
truth or not yeah now you understand the the paradox
this is the paradox see you're stuck in your mind
you're stuck with these dualistic categories like I told you
the truth cannot be communicated and of course I'm not
above that limitation all the words that I use are
not the absolute truth but also they are you got
to get it if you're still stuck debating with me
here it's because you're stuck at the level of language
you're stuck at the second order you need to move
to the first order where you read between the lines
where you don't look at the finger you look at
the thing that my finger is pointing at you look
at the moon and the last question is but Leo
isn't it egotistical to say that you know the absolute
truth I thought spirituality enlightenment was all about being humble
and modest and you seemed so arrogant and narcissistic you're
not modest at all shouldn't we be reasonable and admit
that we just don't know leo shouldn't you just if
you were honest wouldn't you just admit that you don't
know isn't that what the truth is see you're very
sneaky here and clever no the truth is just what
it is you can be humble or not it doesn't
[ __ ] matter to the truth I'm just being
direct and blunt with you I'm trying to frame these
teachings in a way that appeals to ordinary people I
try to be a little bit dramatic I tried exaggerate
sometimes I try to play it up sometimes I try
to be emotional sometimes I try to be cute with
you whatever I act out sometimes yeah to make this
stuff interesting for me and for you I don't want
to be up here just you know reading you a
boring lecture about truth trying to make it kind of
interesting so sometimes I'm in your face I'm provocative I
like to deliberately provoke you sometimes by making outrageous claims
but in the end if you go through this whole
journey which what you'll discover is that every outrageous claim
that I've made is gonna pale in comparison to what
you will discover so I'm sometimes I exaggerate I bloviate
and I do the sort of stuff I huff and
puff because what I'm trying to communicate to you I'm
not trying to strew strictly just like be too literal
sometimes when I'm trying to be is be more poetic
and I'm also trying to communicate to you on an
emotion level the significance of what this is because it's
not like you just discover the truth the absolute truth
of the whole universe one day and then you just
say like oh yeah okay cool I got it let's
just go about my ordinary life like it's not like
that it transforms you and I'm trying to get across
to you the significance of that transformation because the whole
point here is to inspire and to motivate you rather
than just to to strictly give you some formal definition
of what the truth is it is not egotistical to
say that one knows the absolute truth if one does
now if you have never experienced the absolute truth if
you never become conscious of it directly then sure you'd
be lying and you might wonder well Leo how do
I know that you've actually experienced the absolute truth I
can't know that of course you can't nor am i
asking you to know it that I know it I'm
asking you to know it for yourself or rather even
I'm just I'm just inviting you I'm proposing this as
a possibility I'm suggesting that it might be something worthwhile
for you to pursue it's all I'm doing here it
would actually be untruthful of me if I said that
I don't understand what the absolute truth is because I
do either you do or you don't and of course
there's there's shades in between you can have different degrees
of understanding I'm not saying I have the ultimate understanding
I'm not saying I can't go further I certainly feel
like I can but at this point I feel like
I understand it enough that I am that I can
I can share with you what I'm sharing with you
now and be fairly confident about it now let me
conclude this episode by giving you some warnings about truth
cuz truth is a very very sneaky tricky thing there's
nothing more sneaky than truth number one warning beware of
anyone who claims to know the truth and touts the
truth and uses truth as part of their brand name
or teaching there are a lot of Devils in the
world who like to construct various kinds of ideologies they
construct these ideologies and of course all these ideologies claim
to be the truth to know the truth to be
the most truthful the most authentic be extremely suspicious in
this this is the devil's number one tactic is to
co-opt the truth of course the irony here is that
I talk about the truth a lot so you're probably
wondering well leo so does that mean I should be
wary of you yes you should be aware of me
from your perspective I could be a deluded a cult
leader as far as you know I could be insane
you don't know you have no idea I could be
a murderer you don't know so yeah beware beware be
skeptical validate everything I say don't don't take anything anything
here as Dogma beware warning number two if you think
truth is a property of the mind or the brain
you don't understand what truth is if you think that
truth is some human phenomenon you don't understand what truth
is go deeper warning number three truth is not merely
formlessness or cessation this is a problem I noticed some
meditators and Buddhist types falling into there are certain states
of consciousness that one can access where you can have
a total cessation of all perception for example total formlessness
they might call it and this might seem like the
absolute truth and well that's correct that is that is
the absolute truth but the mistake is to think that
dad is the absolute truth while this here this formed
world these colors and sights and sounds them spinning over
myself that that that cessation is separate from what's going
on here know what's going on here is precisely identical
to cessation form and formlessness are identical so don't fall
in that trap the entire relative domain is absolute truth
in disguise cessation of experience is not necessary for realization
of absolute truth although it could be a good a
good experience to have but it's not mandatory nor is
it the end-all be-all truth is right here right now
always at all times under all conditions no matter what's
happening whether you feel happy or sad whether you see
colors or don't whether there are aliens raping you or
not it doesn't matter the truth is always there the
truth just is the case of whatever is happening if
aliens are raping you that's the truth if all experience
has ceased and there's just pure empty void the NASA
truth warning number for one awakening does not guarantee that
you will understand absolute truth there are many aspects to
awakening in many degrees and depths to it so be
careful you might have had a single awakening and maybe
you have realized no self for example maybe you have
had some glimpses into the fact that you're not real
at your imaginary that you weren't ever born great but
that does not mean you understand what absolute truth is
you must go deeper in fact I suspect that most
people who have their initial awakenings and glimpses of no
self and and so forth they still don't know what
absolute truth is in fact I know I know some
Zen masters some meditation teachers who teach for decades they
teach and you know in my interviews with that might
my conversation with them I don't get the sense that
they understand what truth actually is even though I consider
them enlightened or awakened so you know to really understand
what truth is you got to go very deep with
this work and a little bit of meditation here and
there it's not gonna be enough warning number five you
will not access the truth without a change in your
state of consciousness so don't be wasting your time sitting
there and just kind of thinking your your way in
to the truth you're not gonna think your way into
the truth you need a change in your state of
consciousness and the easiest way for you to do that
is through psychedelics there are other ways there's yoga there's
intense concentration there's meditation retreats and so forth the pass
on uh all of those can help all those work
but nothing is as immediate and as guaranteed as a
psychedelic wish of course you have to be careful with
I don't recommend psychedelics for for people under 21 you
have to be mature you have to be responsible you
have to do it carefully so just don't get the
wrong idea here warning number six anything you think is
the absolute truth is probably a lie stop fooling yourself
the apps the truth is not what you think it
is also I want to connect this a little bit
with psychology because you might be wondering like at this
point well leo but this is getting so abstract and
so metaphysical that it's like what about just helping me
in my ordinary life what is true that to do
with that which is why I bring forth to you
this quote by Abraham Maslow quote all the techniques of
the therapist are in one way or another truth revealing
or our ways of strengthening the patient so he can
bear the truth and quote so he's talking about therapy
patience and your thing in yourself well Leo I don't
go to therapy I'm not a patient what does this
got to do with me what this has to do
with you is that all of us basically are therapy
patients it's just that some of us go to therapy
and most of us don't and it's the ones that
don't who are really screwed up all of this work
we're doing self actualizing it's therapy basically we're doing therapy
work if you want to fix your life if you're
frustrated with your life you need therapy but not therapy
with a therapist you need to do your own inner
therapy self therapy so what does that involve that involves
strengthening yourself to be able to bear more and more
of the truth as Maslow says here what is psychopathology
it's being dishonest with yourself the gap between you and
truth if it becomes too great all sorts of terrible
dysfunctions arise in your life emotional problems addictions frustrations hang-ups
bullying behavior cheating immorality devilry depression anger emotional problems laziness
nihilism all of these are just symptoms surface symptoms of
something much deeper which is your disconnection from the truth
why are you unhappy fundamentally in your life why are
you suffering why are you lost why are you confused
why are you running around like a chicken with its
head cut off because you're disconnected from truth and the
more you resist and deny the truth the more dysfunctional
you become and the worse it gets in your life
goes into this downward spiral and you suffer more and
more and more and more so this is why the
truth is important in practice this is why the truth
is not just some abstraction you need it to be
fulfilled because only by being conscious of absolute truth are
you conscious of your own true nature because truth is
what you are right now you don't know what you
are and so you are engaged in all sorts of
dysfunctional petty activities to distract from discovering what you are
which is your mission in this life is to discover
what you are and what the universe is but you're
so distracted by your survival needs that you've really lost
your way and no amount of success within your survival
needs will resolve this problem don't be fooling yourself into
thinking that if if I just get a an extra
hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars or if I
just get a few more cars or a better house
or if I get my dream girlfriend or if I
get my dream husband that that will do it for
me it's not gonna do it for you nothing will
do it for you until you discover yourself as absolute
truth that's what will do it for you and then
from there you can live a good life the wise
as human-beings pursue truth for truths sake not of suffering
everything else that you're doing is nonsense become a truth
seeker I promise you that it'll be worth it it
will be worth it I can't communicate to you how
much it will be worth it but precisely because the
reward is so great the cost is also so great
so you're gonna have to be willing to stomach the
cost of seeking the truth and the cost will be
yourself the cost will be your egotism but then again
that's real change that's transformation you want to change in
your life you want a significant improvement well you got
to figure you got to do something radically different than
you've been doing because if you just keep doing what
you've basically been doing but you just change the surface
of it you're not gonna get significant change what I'm
talking about here is significant change a very different way
to live your life alright that's basically it I just
want to leave you with one final warning that this
everything that I teach is not religion it's not even
science I'm not asking you to trust me I'm not
asking you to hold me as an authority figure as
someone who knows more than you I'm just a guy
who's pointing out stuff you can discover for yourself and
your job is to do serious inquiry for yourself and
to rediscover everything that I told you it does you
no good just to listen to me you got to
do the work you actually have to awaken and member
that everything I said in this episode is not the
truth but it also is the truth and this is
my finger pointing to the moon alright that's it I'm
done here please click like button for me and come
check out my website that's actualized that order right there
you'll find my blog where I post a lot of
interesting and exclusive content including vlogs that I shoot various
interesting YouTube videos that I share links that I share
resources documentaries this cool stuff check that out check it
periodically I update it multiple times a week check out
my book list check out my life purpose course and
come check out the forum and on the forum you
can get any your questions answered we have some enlightened
folks there who can guide you we have resources we
just recently opened up a new sub forum on conscious
politics and government and environment in society so we're having
discussions there about that all good stuff and the last
thing that I just want to reiterate to you here
is that actualized org is not pretending to be the
truth it might seem that way but that's not what
it is that's what it's never been that actualize that
org is just a set of relative partial contingent mental
scaffoldings which help to guide you towards a deeper understanding
of yourself in life that's all it is it's like
training wheels do not take these teachings too seriously to
literally their function is pragmatic it's not ideological I don't
have an ideological function with my content I'm not trying
to build some master philosophy and then program it into
your mind of all my viewers and then to build
the organization or religion around it or what I'm not
trying to do that it's just mental scaffolding you use
scaffolding to build the building and then you throw the
scaffolding away that's exactly how my videos work you don't
worship my videos you don't take them as gospel you
don't even take them as truth you just recognize that
these are helpful to you if they are if they're
not stop watching them if they are keep watching them
if they help to motivate you to inspire you that's
the point if they help to engage you and to
get you activated into into action into practices that's the
point if they get you to to read new books
and to study new videos and content and they expose
you to new sources of information that's the point and
then as you're going through the journey you're doing the
practices you're discovering the stuff for yourself you don't need
to go back and rewatch the videos unless you do
unless you need a reminder unless you forget something but
generally you don't need to go back and re-watch and
study this stuff the way that Christians study a Bible
you know you don't need to do that it's just
scaffolding if I had a Bible if I took all
of my teachers and I wrote it into a Bible
the Bible would be that you read the whole Bible
and the last page of the Bible would say and
burn this book so you would read the whole book
you would master everything in the book and then once
it is no longer useful to you you take that
book you throw it in the fire and then you
walk off into the sunset and you enjoy your life
that's what this work is so don't cling to it
too much you
