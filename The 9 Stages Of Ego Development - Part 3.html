[Music] the nine stages of ego development part three well
congratulations if you made it this far then you've made
it to the best part this is the most important
part we have two stages two final stages that we'll
be covering here we're going to jump right into that
in a minute but first of course i want to
give credit to suzanne cook greuter for her work in
doing this research she has written up an amazing research
paper it's 90 pages long go click the link down
below download it read it most of the material that
i'm presenting here is ripped directly out of her research
paper and i guarantee you that if you watch this
three-part series and you like what i talked about here
her research paper if you read it it will give
you additional insight more more insight than you get from
my videos alone so it's definitely worthwhile to read it
even if you watched this entire series and also i
should note that i am adding my own commentary to
her research in my videos right so sometimes i might
say something that maybe she will disagree with maybe that
wasn't in the original research paper that's because i'm again
anytime i'm presenting any kind of external source to you
guys what i'm doing is i'm filtering it through my
understanding of reality and our mission here of self-actualization and
uh i'm i'm adding to it or i'm removing things
that i think aren't uh aren't right or that aren't
you know helpful towards our ultimate objective here so just
understand that uh i'm never one of these like strict
scholars that tries to present you with some strict formulation
of somebody else's thoughts if i'm presenting somebody else's thoughts
to you it's always through my own lens through my
own mind because there's a larger objective here we're not
just studying the opinions or models of other people we're
looking to self-actualize and we're using other sources as means
towards that ultimate end all right so as far as
these stages go we've covered the symbiotic the impulsive the
opportunist the conformist the expert the achiever the pluralist and
the strategist what's left what's left is one post-conventional stage
that's called construct aware slash ego aware slash magician three
different names for the same stage this is roughly one
and a half percent of the us adult population and
then the final stage which is beyond the post-conventional now
into the post-post-conventional or you could call it the transcendent
or the trans-human i like that label sometimes so in
that category we have the one unit of stage which
is about half a percent of the u.s adult population
according to greuter's research so we'll be covering the construct
aware and the unitive here right now but just before
we get into that i want to go a few
general points again about this model it can be very
tempting and i notice people making this mistake in the
comment sections and so forth after they learn about this
model to want to rush through the stages because you
get this idea that well if there are nine stages
and the best ones are at the end then supposedly
like we should just try to like leapfrog our way
to the top and of course while in general that
is our mission is to get to the top to
these final two stages that's ultimately what we're trying to
get you to towards with this work uh it can
be counterproductive to want to rush this process it's easy
to fool yourself to think that you can skip stages
or that you're higher and more developed than you really
are again we're dealing with the ego mind here and
of course the ego mind because it likes to think
of itself as superior and good and important and great
and all this it will tend to evaluate itself as
higher and more developed and more mature than it really
is and it'll also especially earlier stages of the ego
might want to get competitive and try to like you
know be the best and try to just achieve you
know that achiever ego it might want to go through
those stages as quickly as possible to achieve the ultimate
stage thinking that that's where the happiness is at the
ultimate stage and that's not quite correct really life is
about development your whole life is a developmental process there's
an arc to your entire life if you're living it
properly if you're self-actualizing and one of the things i
especially learned in last year too is to not rush
to get towards enlightenment or towards awakening or some of
these highest stages that you hear teachers talking about because
when you try to rush it prematurely without having gone
through the lower stages and really exploring them fully what
ends up happening is that actually you're not able to
sustain the higher levels anyways and you just frustrate yourself
because you you you sort of reach for them even
though you're not up to the task it's almost like
you're in fifth grade and then you're trying to learn
calculus you're not going to understand calculus at fifth grade
the proper thing there is to realize that mathematics is
a deep feel of study and there's plenty of time
and you don't need to feel bad for not being
able to understand calculus in fifth grade just you know
pace yourself this is a long process you've got many
decades to your life so therefore you've got time to
you know spend a couple of years on each stage
at least maybe even five maybe even 10 years on
each stage you've got time for that most of you
do at least see so um don't be don't be
in too much of a rush at the same time
also of course don't dawdle and don't just sit around
twiddling your thumbs and don't be lazy and complacent and
not grow so of course if you feel like you
need to go to the next stage go to the
next stage and i would push you to to you
know to get out of your comfort zone and push
yourself into the next stage even when you don't feel
quite ready for it yet but also not so much
to the point where you are not fully experiencing the
stage and not fully learning all of the material and
insight in the stage because you want to skip it
to get to the next one you see it's sort
of like you want to skip geometry to get to
calculus you want to skip trigonometry to get to calculus
you want to skip algebra to get to calculus and
if you do that you're not really going to have
a solid understanding of calculus because it's built upon understanding
algebra and geometry and trigonometry and all that basic stuff
you see but at the same time you don't want
to be studying geometry for five years either you don't
want to get stuck on geometry so find that balance
you have to find that balance it's a little tricky
and it's hard to say you know whether you're going
too fast or slow only you can evaluate that another
general point is that use this model these stages to
help you understand what kind of people you're dealing with
in your life this is one of the most useful
functions of this model before this model before spiral dynamics
before you knew developmental psychology which is what this is
you interacted with people in the world including your family
your parents your siblings your colleagues and friends your co-workers
your teachers and professors and various youtubers that you watch
and others you know influencers and intellectuals you listened to
all these people but you didn't really understand their character
you didn't understand the level of their ego development but
now once you understand this model especially once you go
through many of these stages yourself you can look backwards
and you can see very clearly where the people you're
dealing with are at you know like maybe you're buying
a car at the car dealership used car dealership with
this model you'll be able to understand the level of
ego development of the used car salesman that you're dealing
with and that that will help you to understand where
he's coming from and also maybe help you to avoid
getting scammed and so forth if he's at a low
level if you're going into business with a business partner
and you're evaluating various potential people who might be your
business partners well before this model you could have picked
somebody who you kind of liked but they had a
low level of development which was not at your level
and therefore that would have destroyed the entire business eventually
but now you can be cognitive of that and you
can realize that ah this person is not quite at
the level that i need him to be at in
order to create this high consciousness business that i'm trying
to create for example or of course in intimate relationships
this is super valuable normally you would just sleep around
and get into relationships with people based on their physical
appearance or maybe how much you like them or so
forth without very much conscious awareness of who you're getting
into your relationship with now though you've got a much
better sense and you can use this to filter out
who are going to be good potential life partners for
you people who you should get into long-term relationships with
and then those that you shouldn't and then of course
you have to discipline yourself also to actually to actually
follow through on that and not just to sleep with
you know the hottest person um or the most handsomest
person or the most confident guy or or the most
beautiful girl you know not to get seduced by those
appearances but to look deeper beneath the surface to to
see is this person really going to be compatible with
me are they going to be at my level are
they interested in self-actualization how developed is their ego because
if they're if your ego is is this developed and
theirs is this developed there's no way that's going to
work and that is what leads to a lot of
divorces and abusive relationships and you know wasted years and
decades in that domain of your life so so use
it for for that and you can use this again
for all sorts of people that you deal with this
makes it a lot easier to to make sense and
to wheat to sort of sort the wheat from the
chaff weed out all the bullshitters out there who are
preaching to you teaching to you trying to convince you
from a low level of ego development the nice thing
about ego development is that it's very hard to fool
you once you understand how these stages work it's very
hard to fool you the ego tends to be quite
transparent in the way that it manifests itself and so
you can quite clearly see where people are at with
their egos people don't really hide their egos too well
part of the reason is because they're not even aware
that they have an ego or what an ego is
or how it works or what the level different levels
of it are all right so this gives you a
huge advantage in business and relationships and in family life
like you're dealing with your parents uh chances are that
many of your parents have a very relatively low level
of ego development you need to take that into account
that doesn't mean that these are bad people it just
means you have to take into account you have to
develop strategies for dealing with different types of people at
different levels you see and then certain people you have
to just cut out of your life because their level
is too low for you that that's also an acceptable
strategy now i'm not saying you do that all the
time with everybody um because that itself could be a
sort of a an egoic move uh but certainly some
people are going to be such a low level that
you're going to want to cut them out of your
life and then the last general point here is that
use this model to determine what kind of teachings you
need so whatever stage you peg yourself at right now
you need teachings at that stage and maybe one stage
above that stage if you try to go for teachings
that are below that or too high above that like
two or three stages above where you're currently at it's
not going to be as effective all right and honestly
what i teach is very advanced stuff most of the
stuff that i teach with actualized.org these days is uh
the last two stages that we're going to be covering
here right now and honestly for most people this is
too advanced because most people are stuck at the conformist
slash expert achiever stages and they need something that's maybe
at that level or one step beyond most people what
they're looking for on youtube for example most people are
looking for self-help advice which was at the achiever level
or at the pluralist level and there's nothing wrong with
that advice i have personally read and purchased many books
and courses and studied a lot of that kind of
advice that's very important if you're at that level but
then there's something beyond that see so maybe what you're
gonna have to do is you're gonna have to come
back to my teachings later on in your life after
you spend some time shoring up and solidifying your achiever
stage and the pluralist stage or even lower than that
all right i do notice that some of you are
falling into the trap that you have zero personal success
in your life you're struggling just to find a job
just to get some sex just to get some intimacy
in a relationship just to get away from your family
and go off on your own and be independent you're
struggling with with these things um and yet you're talking
about now enlightenment and awakening as though that is what
you should be doing in your life this is this
is too much for you you're biting off more than
you can chew and the consequence of that is going
to be that you're not going to you're not going
to become this super advanced human rather you're going to
stagnate and you're going to get very frustrated pursuing awakening
when you don't have any sort of just basic survival
foundation built up so i do recommend you focus quite
a bit on the achiever stage make sure you exhaust
the [ __ ] out of the achiever stage and
you get everything out of it that you want or
need that your ego craves burn through that karma so
that you can get beyond it get it out of
your system you see because if you're stuck on sex
and money and financial security and this sort of stuff
uh you know what what enlightenment is there going to
be there's not going to be any enlightenment for you
not realistically see unless you're a super super exceptionally gifted
mystical person which some of you are maybe one or
two percent of you are maybe five percent of you
are but the rest of you are not so just
just take that into account right and you can use
this model to evaluate every single book you can go
into a bookstore and you can evaluate in you know
in the self-help aisle you can walk through and say
okay this book you can flip through and read a
few pages like okay this is the achiever book for
achievers you can look at another book oh this book
here is for pluralists oh this book here is now
more more more of a sort of a strategist book
and this book here is more of a sort of
transcendent unitive book and so on and you can do
that with youtube videos and you can do that with
courses and seminars and workshops and you can do that
with teachers you can peg teachers at different stages and
you can see whether that teacher fits the stage that
you need him to be at and if he doesn't
or she doesn't then upgrade your teachers or maybe downgrade
your teachers okay but of course also i always encourage
you to push yourself so if right now you're stuck
at the achiever stage uh sure of course and you're
interested in awakening and you're interested in some of this
deep metaphysical stuff that i talk about that's great too
you can you can do both at the same time
all right you can work on the achiever stuff and
then you can also you know set your sights high
it's always important to have a higher vision even if
you're working on your business or you're just working on
basic financial independence type of stuff you know sort of
material basic self-help it's still always good to have a
long-term vision of what you're going to be working on
in five or ten years and to start to maybe
chip away at that and start to lay the foundations
you can use that to generate motivation to inspire you
of like well if i handle my business affairs over
the next five years then in 10 years i could
be working on this advanced metaphysical stuff that leo was
talking about see so um so it is important to
talk about stuff that is beyond you as well it's
just a matter of how much of it can you
tolerate all right so enough of the general points now
let's get into uh the first stage for today which
is the construct aware ego aware slash magician this is
one half percent of the us adult population so i'll
be referring to this as the construct aware stage because
that's really what the stage is about it's about becoming
aware of the constructed nature of reality so basically what
your ego and your mind is starting to understand now
is that everything that you were learning in your life
from childhood through adulthood all the stuff that you took
as certain rock solid physical reality all the science all
the human history that you just took for granted as
true as a given as this external material physical world
that exists out there independent of you independent of your
mind this objective reality which is separate from feelings and
separate from intuitions and separate from all the humanness you
realize that there never was such a thing material reality
and your mind are integrally interwoven in a complex entangled
relationship such that they can't be separated and it's this
realization that turns your whole perspective and relationship to life
upside down inside out now you're starting to see how
much your mind was playing a role in constructing reality
and of course the biggest trick that your mind plays
on you is convincing you that no no no i
haven't been constructing reality that's just the facts that's just
objective truth that's just science man science is not constructed
by the mind sciences is the most objective thing we
know well now at this construct aware stage you you
realize that that's an illusion there's now a preoccupation at
this stage with inner conflict around existential paradoxes intrinsic problems
of mind language and ego you start to realize that
life is not some objective thing life is a deeply
subjective personal thing and that your job here in life
is is to deal with these deep existential problems involving
the mind language how you think about the world how
you interpret the world various tricks that your mind plays
on you various kinds of ideology and belief systems that
you buy into you realize that all of this is
is subconsciously underneath the surface of your consciousness has been
constructing reality and shaping reality it's been shaping how you
feel how you think the meanings you attach to things
it's been shaping your ideas about good and evil right
and wrong it's been shaping your political opinions your religious
beliefs your scientific notions um your your notions about what
is important in life whether it's sex or money or
fame or status all of this was subconsciously shaped in
a sense and so all of the world views that
you developed you realize you didn't consciously develop your worldview
your worldview is sort of an unconscious amalgamation of various
things that you pulled from culture and mostly you've just
been programmed with beliefs and ideas that were never truly
your own and you did this because you needed to
construct a sense of reality and without this where would
you be what would reality be without this entire construction
process so this is what you're starting to realize at
this construct aware stage at this stage you're concerned about
what it means to be alive and the significance of
your existence existential questions become the most important and then
questions about how to make money or how to survive
or how to manipulate somebody or how to get a
better car these they become very shallow questions you can
still be interested in them to some degree because you
still have to survive you know you have to pay
your electric bill and you still have to go to
the grocery store and buy food but this is all
secondary tertiary stuff now and your life really becomes about
exploring the the existential aspects of your existence there is
now an all-pervasive uncertainty within you everything held as true
up to this point is called into question once again
you start to question all of your ideas about religion
and science and the world and your place in the
world and relationships and politics and society and culture and
how you were raised and your parents and you start
to question all of this all over again all of
your judgments all the judgments you've made about people and
life and about yourself you start to question all of
this as well you start to wonder how much of
these judgments are actually valid and how much is just
my own mind bullshitting me playing tricks on me how
much of my understanding of reality is actually just an
illusion that i have spun if we think of of
a spider as a creature that spins webs we can
think of a human as a creature that spins narratives
about reality that's like our thing you know the spiders
have their silk and their web weaving and it's a
beautiful sophisticated intelligent process the way a spider weaves a
web pretty amazing uh but humans weave webs conceptually with
our minds and now we're starting to realize that much
of what we've considered reality and facts and science has
just been us unconsciously weeping this web in our own
mind and then confusing that for reality and so now
we start to really get a deep understanding of this
web weaving process that our mind is engaged in at
this stage truth via symbolic representation is realized to be
always partial perspectival geocentric human-centric and biased biased so this
idea that mankind is somehow discovering universal truths about the
universe this this this notion falls away there's nothing universal
about mankind's understanding of the universe there's nothing universal about
science these are all highly human-centric geocentric very partial limited
ways of understanding truth and you become hyper aware of
this of course one of the trade-offs here is that
once you realize how much of reality is constructed by
your mind reality starts to feel intangible and groundless because
if you stop the constructing process or if you even
do some deconstruction work what are you left with it
seems like reality starts to lose its ground you don't
know what's real anymore you don't know what's certain anymore
you don't know who to judge you don't know whether
that thing's bad or good anymore because all your criteria
for what was good and bad all of that is
being questioned as something that may not be certain and
valid maybe it's something that you constructed for your own
ego's benefit you see there's a keen awareness now of
how the ego mind distorts reality and comes up with
models of reality and understandings and narratives about reality to
suit itself for the purposes of its own survival i
go into a lot more depth on that in my
two-part series called understanding survival part one and part two
go check those out very important very foundational episodes so
reality starts to feel groundless there's a realization that all
objects are human-made constructions including abstract constructs such as purpose
time and ego all are based on layers upon layers
of symbolic abstraction even simple notions like bed or a
cat or a man or a woman are seen to
be gross over simplifications earlier stages would just take an
object like a bed or a cat or a woman
as just hey they're just givens you know the universe
consists of beds and cats and women but at this
stage you realize no these are all highly loaded highly
biased notions that can only have meaning and only make
sense relative to a deeper background set of assumptions and
epistemic and metaphysical a sort of a framework that makes
sense of all that and that in fact no two
people on this planet have the same idea of what
a bet is even though conventionally we act like we
all know what a bet is simplistically we do a
child can tell you what a bed is but really
when you start to look into what is a bed
you know is is it is a couch that unfolds
into a bed is that considered a bed or is
that a couch see does a bed need to have
four legs or can it have three does a water
bed count as a bed or is not a bed
what about a hammock is that a bed you see
so you start to you start to the boundaries between
all these different concepts starts to blur and what before
it seemed like a very clear cut objective reality now
you start to see that it very much depends on
how you look at things so literally what a bet
is changes depends depending upon how you define it how
you think about it how you contemplate that notion and
you can have very simplistic notions of what a bet
is you can have very complex notions of what a
bet is and no matter how simple or how complex
your notions are none of them are the same as
an actual bed so there's a keen appreciation of the
difference between the map and the territory as alf alfred
uh korzynski famously said the map is not the territory
and you start to appreciate the significance of that statement
more and more at this stage at earlier stages you
kind of heard that statement and it sounded interesting and
kind of profound but here you really start to realize
oh it's really profound it's way more profound than i
ever realized you start to realize how much language shapes
your reality and understanding of the world you become cognizant
of the pitfalls of language as well as its tremendous
gift to mankind so language is not bad language is
not good language is a technology it's a it's a
deep technology that most of us take for granted we
don't even consider it a technology we think of phones
and computers as technology we don't think of language as
technology but language is a sophisticated technology which which shapes
how humans relate to each other and to life how
we even relate to our own selves and yet none
of us has been taught have been taught what language
is or how it really works in school nobody ever
taught you what language is of course they taught you
language they had they taught you how to use language
to accomplish some goal they taught you grammar they taught
you spelling they taught you vocabulary maybe they taught you
a second language or a third language you know in
high school i learned japanese i went to a community
college and i learned japanese not very well i don't
know very much japanese but that was my third language
um but uh but yeah i mean um you can
you can go learn japanese or chinese or whatever but
you're still not gonna have a damn clue what language
actually is how it actually works and how significant it
is to shaping your view of reality see language itself
comes with baked in implicit hidden assumptions and epistemic and
metaphysical frameworks language divides and categorizes the world in different
ways and different languages do it in different ways and
therefore literally shaping what you can think about because you
think using language mostly how you communicate and as it
turns out the limits of your mind are are oftentimes
the limits of language of course it doesn't have to
be you can certainly go beyond language with your mind
the mind goes way beyond language but for most people
conventional people language is the limit of their mind and
so their mind is straightjacketed by language and this continues
even to the post-conventional stages and i mean languages is
situated so deep inside of us it shapes us so
deeply we use it so unconsciously we take it so
for granted that we don't realize how much it shapes
us but at this stage you're starting to realize that
and so there's pros and cons to this uh so
on the one hand you with language you're sort of
like damned if you do damn if you don't you
can't just not have language not use language because all
of our societies built upon that you can't function without
it but at the same time as you're functioning with
it it limits you in various ways and so now
you're becoming more cognizant of these limitations and now you're
becoming more skillful as sort of playing with language and
not getting stuck in various cul-de-sacs that language can create
and you also appreciate language for its beauty for its
complexity just like that spider web language is something very
similar um even more beautiful and even more elaborate once
you really start to contemplate it and i will have
a separate episode about language in the future because it's
a very very deep topic and i've touched upon it
before in other episodes of mine especially the one about
uh called jacques dereda deconstruction uh i forget it was
a long title i gave it but it starts with
jacques deconstruction non-duality something like that go search for it
you'll find it we go in there we go i
go into some depth there about language so you also
realize this construct aware stage the arbitrariness of labeling reality
uh and it's recognized how crucial this is to any
knowledge endeavor including self-knowledge so of course knowledge is intimately
tied in with language and of course knowledge is necessary
for your survival and living life in this advanced 21st
century society so again how do you go about acquiring
knowledge in the correct way without deceiving yourself and also
not getting trapped by language and not being limited by
language it's realized here now that concepts only make sense
in conjunction with their surround and their polar opposites so
good only makes sense relative to evil tall only makes
sense relative to short duality only makes sense relative to
non-duality human only makes sense relative to the non-human self
only makes sense relative to other and so forth i
have a three-part series called understanding duality where i talk
about hundreds of these different dualities i give you giant
lists of them and explain how they work so you
start to become very sensitive to the dual nature of
all linguistic categories and concepts there's now an awareness of
how abstractions and concepts get made by your mind and
there's now a taking of responsibility see at the earlier
stages people weren't responsible the ego mind wasn't responsible it
wasn't willing to take responsibility for language for how it
creates categories and concepts and abstractions these were just taken
as as a given they were just adopted blindly from
culture but now you sort of take responsibility for that
this is both challenging it's also liberating because it opens
you up to now explore new ways in which your
mind can work outside of the limitations of your culture
and your language this stage the construct aware stage is
really hitting up against the the limits of the human
mind and you would think that you can't go beyond
the human mind because the human mind i mean we're
humans right so and we have minds so how can
a human go beyond the human mind but as it
turns out there are minds beyond the human mind and
that actually you're not a human the idea that you're
a human is just part of a construct that you
took for granted as part of your culture you never
really questioned whether you were a human or not actually
there's no scientific evidence that you're a human if you
really think about that deeply you'll realize there's no such
thing after all what is a human what is human
what does it mean to be human why can't you
go beyond human turns out you can and so now
you're starting to realize these possibilities before such possibilities seemed
like woo-woo nonsense seemed like airy fairy new agey unscientific
pseudo-science [ __ ] deepak chopra type stuff but now
you realize wait a minute there's actually something deeper something
truer to what deepak chopra is saying and that there
really is something beyond the human mind that you can
reach you can access if you're willing to let go
of your human identity but that's a big if but
of course at this stage you're starting to let it
go because now you're becoming aware that the human identity
is just sort of a facade or a mask that
you've been wearing and you can take it off and
actually taking it off has many amazing advantages it allows
you to to really let your mind flourish and go
beyond the human whatever that is and at this point
you don't really know what that is it's it's it's
open exciting territory to discover new and exciting territory for
you to open up and explore at this stage uh
the conventional belief in a permanent objective external world starts
to be questioned literally the notion of a material world
starts to break down the distinction between mind and body
self and reality starts to break down i'm not a
separate self who happened to be born into reality but
rather i was always entangled and part of reality objective
and clear self-identification starts to be questioned at this stage
this stage has a flexible continuously deconstructing non-reified notion of
self what does that mean well it means the self
is not a physical object that was born but rather
the self is sort of like a an amalgamation of
ideas and beliefs and concepts and abstractions that were cobbled
together in an ad hoc fashion sort of like a
a snowball rolling down a hill or like a katamari
demasi one of those katamari demasi balls just you know
collecting stuff as it rolls along the ground getting bigger
and bigger and bigger that's sort of like what the
self is and so this self of course is not
a permanent thing it's constantly changing as the ball rolls
through the you know through town the katamari demacia ball
um it it you know it clings on to couches
and cats and dogs and fire hydrants and it accumulates
at all trees and so forth and it becomes just
just this giant tangled mess and that is the self
but of course you're always rolling even right now as
i'm sitting here my mind is changing my self is
changing even as i'm teaching you by the time i'm
done recording this i will have learned something about this
material that i didn't fully realize or fully understand you
know deeply yet when i started recording and myself will
actually slightly change from having made this recording and then
when i publish it i read all the comments and
feedback that i get which i i do your feedback
will further deepen my understanding of this material because i
will hear from you what kind of stuff you like
or don't like what you understand what you misunderstand i
will hear all that feedback i will incorporate that and
that will further change my sense of self it'll make
me question certain things that i say or it'll make
me you know it'll validate certain things that i said
in my own mind it'll make me contemplate deeper this
material and in this way i'm always changing and you
are also changing by the time this episode is over
your ears having received this information will have transformed your
brain and your mind and your sense of self will
slightly shift just from listening to this talk now of
course that's just the beginning you have to do a
lot more work to really change yourself but but hey
in and of itself just listening to this material to
advanced material like this in and of itself is is
self transforming yourself is changing as you're watching these these
videos because this is profound material it just is if
it wasn't profound i wouldn't be talking about it at
this stage there's an acute awareness of how life is
an endless interplay of polar opposites the construct aware mind
is good at cross-paradigmatic thinking it's good at integrating multiple
systems and paradigms so for example it's at this stage
where you can really start to appreciate and understand religion
comparative religion you can really take a deep look into
christianity and the various branches of christianity and then buddhism
and hinduism and judaism and other types of mystical schools
and you can take the exoteric religions and the esoteric
ones and you can you can kind of lay them
all out and you can look at them you can
see ah so this is what they were talking about
here and that's how they were talking about there and
you can draw connections you can see how all of
these things interconnect and interrelate and you can see subtle
commonalities and subtle differences between them and you can evaluate
all this without judging these paradigms you can shift from
one perspective to the to the next you can see
the world through a christian perspective you could take off
that lens you could see the world through a buddhist
perspective you could see it through both at the same
time then you could take all those off you could
see it without any of those perspectives you could see
it through an atheist perspective and you can integrate atheism
and theism and agnosticism and skepticism and rationality and mysticism
all of it can be integrated together and it all
works and this is both amazing it's very satisfying to
be able to do this with your mind because you
interconnect so much you integrate so much there's a sense
of unity that comes about intellectual unity in doing this
uh and no longer are you playing these games of
demonizing various systems or worldviews because you're able to embrace
them all and see them from a higher meta perspective
and you're able to appreciate their strength their strengths and
you're also keenly aware of their limitations and the ways
in which they're corrupted in the ways in which they're
deluded or self-deceived and you're able to go beyond them
all while incorporating lessons from them as well the construct
aware individual has a global historical perspective uh there's a
stepping back and observing of meaning making from an even
higher altitude and a bigger picture view than in the
previous stages you take responsibility for the meaning that you
give to the world into your life no longer the
situations and people and things have inherent meaning but rather
you realize that the meaning that they have is what
my mind is projecting what my mind needs for its
egoic purposes for its survival is what i'm projecting and
i can change what i'm projecting if i'm willing to
change myself that's a huge huge new way of interfacing
with reality when you can make that shift but of
course it takes a lot of responsibility taking which can
be scary and uncomfortable and most people don't don't take
they don't want to take that much responsibility so when
your girlfriend or boyfriend leaves you or when someone insults
you or when a terrorist attack happens or when you
see some political news somebody won an election somebody lost
an election before at the earlier stages you would tend
to think that all these things have inherent baked in
meaning like terrorism is bad and evil and you know
when my girlfriend or boyfriend leaves me that's because she's
being a [ __ ] or whatever and then and
that's bad or you know when my boss says something
some criticizes me all that's you know the boss is
being critical of me blah blah blah and so you're
playing these sorts of games but now you start to
realize that this construct aware stage that oh wait a
minute i'm assigning meanings to all these different things and
i can change that such that i'm not being driven
by this by this unconscious meaning making process but i'm
more conscious about how i give things meanings and you
can start to question the kind of meanings you give
to things maybe some of the old meanings you gave
to things weren't very resourceful or were very limited didn't
have enough a big enough perspective and maybe now you
realize that it was just all meaningless at this stage
there's a realization of our human need for map making
in trying to organize experience and knowledge into ever more
complex matrices and meta theories at this stage as soon
as one becomes aware of one's need to reify experience
and to tell a good self-story with the permanent self
as its main actor one deconstructs any such identification so
at this stage you're not completely transcendent of the ego
you're still mostly living from ego at this stage and
you fall into traps of the ego at this stage
but the difference is at lower stages when people are
acting from ego they act from ego so fully they
are so hypnotized by ego they don't even understand what
they're doing but at this stage there's enough distance detachment
and self-awareness that one is able to say oh yeah
in that argument that i had with my girlfriend or
boyfriend yesterday i fell into ego and then i constructed
a story about how i was the good guy and
and she was the wrong that she was wrong and
i was good and she was doing something wrong to
me and i blamed her okay i realized what i
was doing that was my ego acting up again and
i was creating a narrative about how i'm i'm the
i'm the victim in this situation and i was creating
this whole story about it ah now i'm aware enough
to realize that that's something i'm doing i can take
responsibility for it and i can tell myself to stop
it and i can maybe apologize or i can sit
down and have a communication with with my partner i
can say hey you know yesterday i let my ego
get the better of me and uh i started you
know creating these stories and i started to act like
a victim i fell into my old patterns but i
realized that i was making a mistake so you know
i'm going to make an effort to change that i'm
not going to do that anymore and i realize that
that that um that things are not the way that
i thought they were yesterday you see and so in
this way you can catch yourself you still make mistakes
you still fall into self-deception but then you catch yourself
and you relatively quickly make corrections this is a huge
huge difference to be able to do this versus a
person who's not able to do this this is this
is huge this will change your whole life if you're
able to do that of course not just in relationships
but everywhere across your entire life so at the early
stages of development you have no idea that you're deceiving
yourself at the higher stages of development you start to
get a little bit of an idea of how much
you're deceiving yourself but you still are mostly clueless then
at even higher stages of development you realize holy [
__ ] i'm so much deceiving myself and i'm aware
how much i'm deceiving myself but i can't stop deceiving
myself because i'm attached to it that's huge to be
able to get to that stage um and you feel
real bad because you can see yourself getting deceived by
your own mind but you still can't quite surrender the
attachment to the deception you don't really know yet how
to escape this is the deception every time so and
then at the very ultimate stages you will be able
to just um you'll be so quick at seeing the
self-deception you'll be able to stop it before it even
starts but that's really going to be in the next
unitive stage not not yet here not fully here at
this stage you're becoming aware of the self at the
center of this construction process of the mind right so
the self is warping all of reality to suit itself
so that it can survive as a self because the
self is not a physical thing it's merely the amalgamation
of all of its ideas about itself in a sense
if you stop thinking about yourself you'll disappear as a
self which is why the self is constantly thinking about
everything including itself relating everything back to itself in order
to construct a sense of self and this is how
you construct your entire life this is how you were
actually born birth is not a physical activity that happens
to you birth is the process of thinking about yourself
as a self and therefore you create the self and
of course death is the same thing that is not
a physical process of of physically dying death is a
process of uh the cessation of thinking of yourself as
a self yeah think about that think about what would
happen if you went through your life never thinking of
yourself as a self again never thinking that you were
born never thinking that you had a past never thinking
about your memories never thinking about you and what you
want and your desires and your needs and how everything
relates to you imagine if you just never engaged in
that mental activity ever again what would be left of
you would there be anything left so see at this
stage you're starting to see the potential for this but
you're not quite yet able to do it you haven't
actualized this but you can start to see that this
is the road you know this is the slippery slope
that we're going to be sliding down here with this
deconstruction as the deconstruction continues you're going to realize that
it's going to destroy the self it's going to annihilate
the self and that that can be challenging because you
don't want to get annihilated that's scary you don't know
what comes after self annihilation and you can get confused
or you can have all sorts of twisted mistaken notions
about what that's gonna mean for you um but of
course that's the trick it's not gonna mean anything for
you once you're gone it only means something to the
self that the self is going to be gone if
you didn't have a self it would mean nothing to
the self that there is no self but of course
that's theory in practice though you're stuck on yourself and
you don't know how to get unstuck so at this
stage you're constantly questioning your own questioning process very meta
it's very meta stage there's a last-ditch effort by the
ego to create the most comprehensive maps and models of
reality possible ego thinks that well if i just if
i just read a few more books if i just
incorporate a few more things i can construct this grand
theory of everything that will explain absolutely everything there's still
this hope of the ego that it can do this
but of course this is not going to work because
reality is infinite and you can't encapsulate the infinite in
the finite all maps and models are finite by definition
so that's not going to work but at this stage
you're not probably aware yet of the infinity of reality
yet so uh you still think that you can maybe
get away with them with a really nice complex very
complex model some sort of meta model a model of
all the models a map of all the maps the
meta map and so at this stage you're constructing ever
more comprehensive theories of everything of course i'm very guilty
of this this is a passion of mine i love
to construct theories of everything and models of models and
meta-meta models i love that sort of stuff yes it's
it's a bit of a of an addiction it's a
sort of a mental masturbation it can turn into that
but at the same time it's also useful it's useful
to have meta models for example this thing we're talking
about now these nine stages of eco development this is
sort of a meta model a model of various models
it's a sort of a map of various maps and
uh on the one hand it's it's quite amazing it's
quite accurate and it's quite powerful at helping us to
navigate and understand humans ourselves and life and giving us
direction in how we should grow on the other hand
what you're going to realize once you reach this stage
is that even this model itself and all such models
like spill dynamics and so on any kind of models
of enlightenment and awakening that all of these models still
are gross over simplifications and ultimately are just a map
and not the territory itself and you're gonna have to
let these models go if you want to go even
higher reach even higher levels going beyond the human mind
but of course you're very addicted to these models because
they're intellectually stimulating they're they're interesting they're powerful they're useful
you can make money creating these models and selling these
models and teaching humans and you can help a lot
of people with these models but helping a lot of
people is not the same thing as truth it is
not the same thing as the territory helping people is
still in a certain sense ego manipulating reality to get
its needs met just in a higher way so now
you're becoming aware of this of course this kind of
puts you in a bind should i be learning these
models or shouldn't i well yeah you're confused you're kind
of groundless you don't know what to do you have
to contemplate and do some deep soul searching you have
to try various things experiment at this stage theories incorporate
other theories and become ever more complex one's worldview becomes
extremely complex at this stage which is one of the
reasons why my videos are so long and tend to
be so long-winded and complex because i have a very
complex worldview because i live in this stage a lot
most of my life is lived from this construct aware
stage a sense of isolation that comes at this stage
as almost nobody is able to understand you and your
complexity everybody else seems so simple-minded and naive which is
why you can feel lonely at these stages it can
be lonely to self-actualize so you have to deal with
with the loneliness problem find solutions to that which i've
discussed in other episodes i won't go into that here
pretty big topic in and of itself sort of dealing
with the loneliness of the spiritual path dealing with the
loneliness of self-actualization at this stage you begin to see
the absurdity inherent limits of making ever more complex maps
and theories you start to see that i'm gonna have
to surrender them to get to the next level and
you start to transcend the symbolic and the mental domain
you start to get little glimpses of what it's like
to go beyond language consciousness beyond language non-symbolic consciousness and
of course as you're dealing with all this this can
create a lot of suffering because you're hitting up against
the limits of the human mind and you're not quite
sure how to go beyond it and you don't have
a lot of good role models or examples of people
in your life who have done this and who who
can talk to you genuinely about the real obstacles you
know there are serious existential obstacles and questions that need
to be addressed in order to go beyond the limits
of the human mind but chances are that you don't
know anyone in your life personally who's done this so
you can't sit down with them face to face and
really ask these questions and really dig in into it
so you got to go read books you got to
go watch videos you got to kind of struggle to
figure this out for yourself you're not quite sure who
to trust you realize at this stage that an altogether
different relationship to knowing is necessary so you start to
take epistemology very seriously you start to question what knowing
is how anything can be known at all what are
different ways of knowing what kind of ways of knowing
exist beyond the rational beyond the human beyond the linguistic
beyond beliefs beyond maps and models even how can a
thing be known beyond a map or a model beyond
science beyond symbols beyond words beyond numbers beyond quantification see
that's mostly where science stops these days mostly science admits
of the reality of things only if they're quantifiable if
they're modelable if they're predictable easily predictable if they are
kind of gross and brute and and anything that doesn't
fit those requirements of science is not considered real but
of course you realize that well why would reality be
limited by those narrow human constraints i mean after all
humans invented those constraints science was invented by humans didn't
you know it didn't come to us from god uh
so we invented it and so of course we invented
its own limits how do you go beyond the limits
of science there's an awareness at this stage that all
meaning is invented by the self for its own purposes
at this stage you viscerally get the absurdity of trying
to understand reality via the human mind and representation you
start to see that it's like a chasing your own
tail sort of process you're trying to grasp reality with
symbols and with the mind with models but you realize
at this stage you're too aware and you see that
the models in the and all the grasping that it's
not actually succeeding in fully grasping reality and the reason
that is because reality is infinite so it's always spilling
out over any container or vessel that you try to
put it in whether it's a human mind or a
model or map or an equation it's always going to
go beyond that and so now you're struggling with this
sort of slippery notion or the slippery nature of reality
and you're not yet quite clear about how to how
to how to work with it you might have an
idea that well if only i just try grasping harder
i can grasp onto it and i could succeed of
course that's not going to work but you don't know
that you're going to actually try it before you realize
that it's not going to work and why it doesn't
work so the mind here still clings to maps and
abstract meaning making but also here explanation starts to break
down you start to realize what is explanation itself what
does it even mean to explain a thing like if
i'm going to explain the existence of that bed right
there how am i going to explain that bed you
realize that every explanation isn't sufficient it's always finite it
doesn't fully explain everything how do you explain the entire
universe you go back to the big bang okay well
where did the big bang come from see so science
is always dealing with this problem of explanation science is
always pushing the problem back science has always started sweeping
the loose ends under the rug to pretend as though
um everything's okay if we just do more science we'll
be able to explain everything without realizing that no no
matter how long you do science if you do science
for another million years you're never going to get any
closer to explaining reality that's the problem with science that's
the problem with all a linguistic knowledge or maps or
models there's an acute awareness of all the ego's tricks
and defensive mechanisms for self-preservation at this stage there's a
realization that ego functions as the cpu for all incoming
stimuli and as the central reference point for all identity
formation literally everything you see every object every person every
tree every car every color is all getting filtered through
the lens of the ego mind and distorted by the
ego mind you're not really getting a true objective unbiased
view of reality ever even when you're looking at a
bed you're not getting the the raw truth of that
thing what you're getting is you're getting a sort of
an object called a bed that has a certain human
function that has a backstory that has all these conceptual
overlays to it and how it fits in with your
life and what it's good for what it's worth what
it's not worth is it good is it bad what
does it mean to me what doesn't it mean is
it meaningless all of these things cloud the raw truth
of what is there to begin with and so now
there's a sort of a a possibility opens up of
can i reach the raw truth of what's there prior
to all of these layers of interpretation and conceptualization abstraction
and self-bias and so now you're struggling to to bust
through the ego to get to that raw truth but
you're still not really adept at doing that at this
stage there's an experience of one's full and inevitable egocentricity
you realize how deeply you're stuck in the ego and
how you're almost helpless and powerless to break out of
it the ego at this stage starts to desire ego
transcendence but it feels stuck even in its own desire
the more one tries to break free the more one
gets stuck and this becomes the sort of tricky paradoxical
nature of zen or meditation work where you try to
sit there and quiet your mind but the more you
try to quiet your mind the more noisy your mind
gets the more you try to get rid of the
ego the more the ego strengthens itself so it becomes
sort of this kind of a twisted counterintuitive process where
the more you try to detach from reality the more
attached you get because detachment itself becomes a new attachment
and so you struggle with this you you have to
just kind of grapple with it and go through it
and experience what that's like as you experience that whole
struggle consciously mindfully you learn to let go and to
surrender and to and to sort of take a different
approach rather than trying to control and manipulate everything you
realize that i can't attain ego transcendence through the old
mechanisms of the ego where the ego is trying to
manipulate its way towards everything you can manipulate your way
towards lots of money or sex or a big house
or a successful business or whatever or a nice body
with big muscles and things you can manipulate your way
to all that but you can't manipulate your way towards
ego transcendence so you need a new paradigm shift in
your approach and what is that you don't know it's
unknown there is now an awareness of the profound paradoxes
and splits inherent to thought itself every time you think
of thought you can immediately reflect back on and realize
wait a minute that was so limited it was so
partial it was so dualistic and split off from other
parts of reality it was so incomplete so you start
to be more suspicious of your own thoughts and you
start to see the dualistic nature of your own thoughts
how your intellect and mind is carving up reality with
every single thought all conscious thought all cognition now is
recognized as constructed and split off from the underlying non-dual
territory even the concept of ego now becomes questionable there's
a deep appreciation that the map is not the territory
and this can be painful for the mind to realize
and to accept there's an effort that is made to
become fully alive and open to experience free of linguistic
filters but it's difficult to do this because the mind
is stuck with its linguistic filters how do you shut
off those filters that's very challenging that's what meditation is
for for example but uh most people suck at it
takes a lot of practice usually takes years and decades
of practice to be able to shut off those linguistic
filters good and evil life and death beauty and ugliness
are now recognized as two sides of the same coin
which mutually necessitate each other lower stages usually tend to
think of like well there's good stuff and there's bad
stuff in the world if we can just get rid
of all the bad stuff and increase all the good
stuff that'll be great and then you realize no you
can't have the good stuff without the bad stuff or
you know some of these scientific materialistic oh well if
we can just genetically alter our dna or if we
can invent some new medicine or some some technology that
will allow us to humans to live forever to become
immortal that will be you know that will be a
new revolution and that will solve all of mankind's problems
it's like no you can't have life without death see
death is is necessary for life if you don't realize
that then you get yourself into all sorts of problems
and absurdities and calamities there's a deep awareness of how
one's automatic judging habit creates much unhappiness and suffering and
so there's a lot of shedding and letting go of
judging but your mind is so stuck on judging you're
judging all the time in such subtle ways but now
you're becoming aware of it and it can be very
frustrating because now you realize how stupid judging is how
much unhappiness it creates for you and suffering but you
can't quite let it all go either at the same
time that takes years of work to let it all
go because suffering happens at very gross levels and also
very very subtle levels a person at this stage seeks
deeper compassion for self and others has a dynamic and
multi-dimensional understanding of human nature and the complexities of human
interaction a person here is living at the edge of
meaning and meaninglessness you're sort of stuck in the middle
you're damned if you do and damn if you don't
if you treat life as totally meaningless that's going to
create problems for you and yet if you buy into
all the meanings blindly that's gonna create even more problems
for you so what do you do well you gotta
you gotta work through that dilemma there's an awareness of
one's own emotional and rational processing patterns you realize how
much your emotions manipulate you and also how much your
rationality and your logic manipulates you and really you can't
trust either yet at the same time you have to
use them both you can't stop being rational you can't
stop thinking and you can't stop emoting and you can't
demonize these things because they're inherent aspects of you and
they serve a valid function so what do you do
well you have to integrate them somehow and learn to
to deal with them in a mindful and skillful way
there's a lot of this sort of sense of like
well here my ego goes again here it goes again
and you just kind of watch yourself you know you
might be in an argument and you you watch yourself
as you're arguing here my ego goes again or you
might be on youtube typing some nasty comment and then
you as you're typing that nasty comment you realize oh
that's my ego typing this nasty comment i'm about to
click submit click the submit button and just before you
click it you realize all that look at look at
what my dko is doing then you delete it or
maybe you click that submit button it'll take you a
few days to realize oh [ __ ] i need
to go back and delete it whereas the earlier stages
were so unconscious and so oblivious of this that that
they couldn't even do that they were too arrogant to
do that too close-minded so at this stage you must
learn to live in a tension of paradox relativity meaning
and meaninglessness all habits of mind thinking and theory making
start to be seen as elaborate defense mechanisms against knowing
the impermanence of the embodied self the predicament of living
in language is felt and seen there's an awareness of
the pseudo-reality created by words rational and objective explanation of
reality and self are seen to be futile and impossible
language itself is seen as a tool of the ego
constructing and defending itself there's an awareness of the fundamental
limitations of all rational thought and the limitations of language
there's an appreciation the vital function of language in shaping
reality and human affairs there's a capacity now to draw
from and appreciate insight from non-rational sources this capacity significantly
increases beyond earlier stages so there's now access to intuition
bodily states feelings dreams archetypal and other transpersonal material increases
these trans-rational non-rational non-quantifiable sources of insight and knowledge become
more important than rational deliberation and logic you're becoming a
more whole organism interfacing with reality by integrating feelings and
intuitions and visions and dreams and uh hunches and also
rational deliberation all of it gets integrated together to create
the the best of of all those possible modalities and
you're able to be sort of flexible and fluid in
how you use that entire mechanism of understanding in different
situations in reality you know if you're dealing with a
relationship problem you might rely more on intuition or on
feelings if you're dealing with a business problem you might
rely more on rational deliberation but also still informed by
some sort of higher vision consciousness right so you're not
just chasing money now your rational deliberations are serving a
higher conscious purpose of like maybe helping to improve the
health of mankind or something like that at this stage
there are momentary experiences where the knower and known merge
and the personal self disappears so these are your first
glimpses of mystical experiences unitive experiences non-dual experiences but these
are usually fleeting temporary they're not permanent and there's of
course now a desire for such experiences the ego gets
you know the ego starts to fall in love with
these experiences it wants more of course the ego doesn't
fully understand what it's getting itself into here it doesn't
understand how deep this slippery slope will slip uh experiences
of non-ordinary states of consciousness are now becoming real through
meditation and things like psychedelics maybe through yoga there are
temporary moments of freedom from the ego's constant efforts at
control but they're just temporary the ego can usurp transpersonal
episodes and mystical experiences at this stage for its own
perpetuation and glorification so there can be sort of a
spiritual ego that gets developed here as leaders people at
the construct aware stage tend to build their own novel
organizations and to work alone to make the best contribution
to humanity that they can they take the role of
catalysts and transformers inside of organizations so at this level
in a sense your job is to catalyze mankind to
develop itself in some fashion that doesn't mean to become
a self-help teacher or something there are many ways in
you in which you can become a catalyst or a
transformer many many different ways these people tend to be
consultants mentors therapists and coaches of course you're not limited
just to those things but these are common professions for
people at the construct aware stage this stage is seriously
open to not knowing unlike previous stages there's more comfort
with not knowing more comfort with the mystery of life
and reality if you don't know something you're much more
likely to admit you don't know it and to be
comfortable with that rather than trying to pretend or coming
up with some belief or some some theory or some
speculation to cover up that gap in your knowing there's
a profound humility about the limits of knowledge at this
stage there's a less of a need to defend yourself
and to look good this this need for defensiveness starts
to melt away there's an ability to be open and
vulnerable about one's own foibles there's less of a need
to impress others or to manipulate others depression at this
stage is about man's existential aloneness and inability to create
lasting meaning through the rational is sort of the depression
of hitting up against the limits of the human mind
this stage is capable of perceiving the structure of its
own thinking and feeling habits the language that construct aware
people use is much more complex vivid authentic and playful
than previous stages it's more direct and raw responses of
these types of individuals tend to have a stream of
consciousness quality to them there's an attempt that's made to
let go of conscious structuring of what one says or
does you're starting to get into the flow of life
the construct aware person catches himself in self-deception but then
quickly catches oneself and autocorrects or self-corrects using this lapse
as a growth opportunity so self-deception really is an opportunity
for you to learn about how other people fool themselves
if you didn't deceive yourself constantly you wouldn't know how
self-deception works so in a certain sense it's a blessing
every time you catch yourself deceiving yourself you catch yourself
you correct yourself and then you make a lesson in
your mind you record a lesson about ah that's the
trap i fell into and that's the trap other people
fall into and i can now use that information to
help guide other people to avoid this trap see you're
sort of jiu-jitsu or aikido-ing self-deception here to to serve
a higher purpose ken wilbur often uses two terms here
when when referring to this stage vision logic and the
centaur so vision logic is a combination of logic and
vision and intuition uh and the centaur what what is
meant by the centaur is that it's you know half
half animal half man half lower half higher so the
centaur if we think of a view as a centaur
if you're the centaur that means you're you're in touch
with your animal side all of your animal impulses your
sexuality your hunger your food your desire for money and
approval and all that kind of basic human stuff so
you're connected with that but then so half of you
lives there and then half of you lives in the
higher existential metaphysical realms the spiritual realms where you care
about love and compassion and and god and consciousness and
all these sorts of things and helping mankind you have
a sense of purpose and intuition and you have art
and beauty and morality all these things and so you're
unifying these together into one cohesive being see where one
is not at the expense of the other see when
you're first learning this you tend to either have one
half dominate the other half whether the lower dominates the
upper or the upper down when it's the lower but
as you become more integrated and whole the full centaur
so to speak the two parts learn to coexist peacefully
and to actually work together such that you don't need
to walk around hungry you don't need to deny your
sexual urges if you have them um you don't need
to deny the the need or desire for money all
these things are are normal and necessary functions of survival
but at the same time there are lower functions and
you don't want to have your entire life dictated by
those you want to have the higher functions like your
desire for truth and love and beauty and consciousness you
want those to run your lower your lower function so
there's a certain you have to have a certain hierarchy
of priorities and it takes time to to find that
proper balance at this stage one questions the need to
make order out of chaos earlier stages were just fixed
on order order order order because chaos was bad and
evil but at this stage you realize life is about
actually flowing with the chaos there's a sort of a
a chaotic rhythmic nature to reality and this is not
a this is not a bad thing it's not an
evil thing not a problem you have to learn how
to sort of surf those waves of chaos and it
sort of turns into a sort of a semi-controlled chaos
and you're basically learning to surf on the chaos this
is one of the problems with jordan peterson you can
see he has built a sort of a shadow side
out of chaos in his books and writings and so
forth he speaks of chaos as like the bad part
and then order is the good part and so he's
he's very fixed on order because he hasn't really reached
this stage of his ego development yet where he actually
integrates you know it's the yin and the yang it's
the sort of a concept of wu way where you're
flowing through life surfing on the waves of chaos at
the ego construct or sort of the construct aware stage
you're able to think of reality as an undifferentiated whole
and there's a realization of the infinite interconnectedness of all
things the more you examine and contemplate everything a car
a tree a table the earth mankind politics morality terrorism
whatever you think about all these things and you start
to see how more and more they get interconnected all
into one unified universal thing and that's amazing in itself
that's a profound profound experience so overall this stage is
extremely very very profound very very profound that's i think
probably the biggest payoff to getting to the stage sure
it's challenging there's a lot of responsibility taking you can
feel confused and lost and and it can feel impractical
sometimes but the payoff is that it's super profound and
then of course it leads to the next stage which
is the final stage the unitive stage so let's talk
about that this stage can also be called the cosmic
stage the ego transcendent stage the transhuman stage the awakened
stage so here truth is imminent in the present moment
and can be witnessed and apprehended but not grasped by
the rational mind there's a direct consciousness of absolute truth
at earlier stages the notion of absolute truth was taken
as a dogma or as a belief like christians believe
in god is the absolute truth or in jesus and
muslims believe in allah is the absolute truth but now
at the unitive stage you realize for the first time
you become conscious directly conscious of what absolute truth is
and that's a game changer that changes your whole life
if you want to know what what truth is i
have multiple episodes about that i have one episode called
uh what is truth go check that out that's the
direct answer to that question i have another episode called
how to know what is true or how to discover
what is true that's also a very powerful episode i
have another episode called what is actuality which guides you
towards the absolute truth so i have many episodes to
talk about and guide you towards absolute truth but ultimately
it can't be explained you have to you have to
have an awakening to absolute truth to understand what it
is can't be explained to you at this unit of
stage there's now the ability to witness the whole song
and dance of life uh and of prior ways of
understanding and meaning making with compassion and equanimity you sort
of see the whole process for what it is and
you start to understand the ins and outs of it
and why it's so complicated and why there's so many
traps and pitfalls why it works the way that it
works the previous ways of viewing reality solely from oneself's
perspective and through the medium of language is now transformed
you step outside of the human mind witnessing and being
is the primary mode here at the stage without a
need to defend or to justify any kind of experience
all experience is seen as valid many different kinds of
experience but none is better than any other one per
se in the absolute sense and there's some value in
experiencing any kind of experience even the bad ones even
the ugly ones even the painful ones there's value to
it still this is recognized and this helps one to
navigate difficult challenging painful experiences at this stage you are
open to fully experiencing whatever enters your consciousness you're not
preoccupied with avoiding certain experiences at this stage you relish
in the mystery of being there's a profound sense of
awe and wonder that overtakes you reality becomes magical becomes
mystical what was the mundane and the ordinary like a
kitchen knife a fork a glass of orange juice a
piece of bread a tree a dog on the sidewalk
a car these things were all taken for granted at
earlier stages but now with breakthroughs into mystical consciousness you
realize the true nature of all these things and how
miraculous and amazing they truly are and you stop taking
them for granted so even the most mundane and simple
things stop being boring they become interesting they become profound
they become spiritual experiences for you you can look at
a fork and and start to cry because you realize
the how amazing the existence of a fork is lower
stages of ego cannot even comprehend such a thing like
a fork what's so special about a fork why would
you cry about a fork see but you take the
fork for granted you don't really appreciate what a fork
is there is a cosmic perspective now at this stage
which serves as the organizing principle of your entire world
view and life at this stage you experience yourself and
others as part of an ongoing humanity embedded in the
creative ground fulfilling the destiny of evolution the unitive individual
can take many perspectives and shift focus effortlessly among them
and among many different states of awareness mystical and unitive
experiences are no longer merely glimpses but steadily established peak
experiences now have a familiar and comfortable quality to them
rather than being scary or alien or something weird or
foreign the peaks of earlier stages now become the ground
everything becomes mystified from moment to moment only the present
is real you're you're fully grounded in the present it's
almost sort of a solipsistic state uh you also feel
embedded in nature you feel like you're one with the
universe you're part of the universe not something separate from
it the unitive stage manifests a deeper security about being
than is possible with a rationally generated identity so there's
a deep sense of fulfillment and completion as a self
you don't feel like you need other things to completely
uh sorry to complete you you don't need a house
to complete you you don't need the hottest clothes to
complete you don't need fame and fortune to completely complete
you you don't need a family you don't need a
spouse you don't need sex you don't need money you
don't need anything to completely to complete you you don't
even need to improve yourself to feel complete because by
definition you are the entire universe you are infinity and
so you can't be more complete than you already are
you just need to realize that uh the unitive person
can perceive the concrete limited and temporal aspects of an
entity simultaneously with its eternal and symbolic meaning from the
unitive stage later stages are not taken to be better
than earlier ones because all are necessary parts of an
interconnected reality and the overall evolutionary process of mankind so
at the unit of stage you don't judge those ignorant
people at the very low stages you realize that they
don't know any better and that's just their level of
consciousness and so there's a deep deep acceptance of that
from which comes a great peace because all the other
stages are busy demonizing and criticizing each other and only
really when you get to the ultimate stages here do
you surrender that fully and let it go and go
beyond that this stage is non-controlling it tends to have
a lot of humility and grace it has a down-to-earth
quality with simplicity on the other side of complexity your
models become so complex and so overwhelming that at some
point you you just drop them and you transcend them
in a sense and then things become a lot simpler
things become more zen there's an awareness at this stage
that all of one's personal achievements and strivings are but
one drop in the ocean of human endeavors and evolution
so your life purpose is important as it is it's
just a speck of a speck of dust in the
cosmos and yet you still go about it with passion
that doesn't mean you you get depressed about your life
purpose you say oh well then i have to quit
my job and quit my career and all that life
purpose stuff that i was talking about it's all poor
[ __ ] and illusion no uh as carlos castaneda
beautifully writes and says and i'm just paraphrasing here um
his character don juan talks about how having a a
life purpose is a controlled folly he calls it a
controlled folly he says the man of wisdom undertakes a
conscious controlled folly which means that you're aware that your
life purpose is completely meaningless in the grand scheme of
things you're aware that your work your life's work and
your career means absolutely nothing you're aware that your family
and all the time you put into them and raising
your children it all means absolutely nothing you're completely conscious
of that and at the same time you make a
conscious effort to be passionate about these things and to
still do them because what's the alternative laying around on
the couch getting lazy watching netflix eating cheetos that's the
alternative you realize that that is not the way that
a wise conscious person lives life so you live fully
engaged with life you still do things you sell help
people even though you realize that helping people is completely
pointless and meaningless so if this seems like a paradox
or a contradiction to you well yeah it is a
paradox but that's just something that you're gonna have to
deal with that's part of part of your work you
have to work through that paradox and ultimately come to
integrate it and to accept it and to be comfortable
with it that will probably take you some years to
do that personally for means it's always felt quite natural
i never understood why people have a problem with this
yeah i can i can i can create actualize that
organ i can invest thousands of hours and all this
energy and effort into creating all this material for people
to help them even though that i know that it's
all a complete [ __ ] illusion in the game
of course it's all a game of course it's a
game life is a game it's a video game but
then again why the [ __ ] do you play
video games you know that there's no stakes to a
video game you know that a video game is just
pixels on a screen it means absolutely nothing when you
go watch a movie you know that the movie is
a complete fiction it's just an illusion it's just light
dancing on a screen and yet you get invested in
you enjoy the movie so why can't life be the
same way you enjoy it but ultimately you realize it's
completely empty and meaningless and that's in fact that's not
something to bemoan that's not a depressing thing this is
the greatest [ __ ] way that life could possibly
be structured because that i mean i never understood why
people want life to be real the desire for life
to be real to me that's insanity you want life
to be unreal you want it to be an illusion
that's the coolest way reality can be and that's what
it is so just flip your mind around 180 degrees
and everything's good don't get depressed about this this is
see you would need to be depressed if life was
real if murder and rape and terrorism and all these
things if they were really important and they were really
meaningful and getting your way in life was so important
and real that's what would be depressing because then you'd
have to be attached to it but the fact that
it's an illusion and you can become conscious of that
that's what allows you to detach from it you're you're
living inside of a dream that you're attached to you
call this dream material reality you're dreaming that material reality
isn't a dream but of course that's the dream it's
the dream of no dream you're dreaming that you're not
in a dream which is the dream it goes full
circle it's a strange loop so these unitive people at
this stage can come off as aloof and detached as
not engaged enough with goals pursuits achievements and human problems
so people at the lower stage especially the achievers in
the audience they will oftentimes criticize me for example for
like oh leo it's all just mental masturbation it's all
just philosophy it has no real world consequences this stuff
isn't important blah blah blah blah so most people when
they run across an actualized video they don't watch it
they don't continue to watch it they don't subscribe and
stay tuned for more content simply because it's too impractical
the things i talk about are just too existential too
metaphysical too epistemic too long-term because their concerns are just
like how do i satisfy my needs for pleasure for
the next week for the next month for the next
year that's what most people 99 of people are only
concerned about that so it's hard to recruit you guys
to keep watching me um because um it's just at
the stage you're at it's perceived as too impractical but
then again practicality itself the desire for practicality you have
to see that that's a bias why would the practical
be more valuable than the impractical why should things be
practical maybe your problem in life is that you're too
practical you're too obsessed with the practical and you're living
your whole life at the level of the practical at
the level of the material such that you're missing the
spirit of life literally your your your life is hollow
of spirit spiritless a soulless life and that's what you
see around you that's what your family members your colleagues
your your friends your co-workers isn't that a perfect description
of of their life they're living a soulless life literally
completely detached from spirit because they're just preoccupied at the
level of survival they're living like animals you see but
then they turn that into a strength and when a
teaching comes along that teaches you how to live like
not an animal what's the most common criticism of that
teaching but it's not practical that's right because you've defined
the practical as that of being an animal so i
mean if [ __ ] and eating and [ __
] are what you define as as as life then
anything that teaches you something beyond that you're going to
think as impractical as woo as new age as mental
masturbation as philosophy and and you're going to ignore it
you're going to click the next button and you're going
to instead subscribe to some channel or listen to some
guru or teacher um who is sort of like a
tony robbins style teacher who just teaches you about success
how to be more successful how to be more of
an animal see that's lateral development not vertical development i'm
more interested in teaching you a vertical than lateral development
as we talked about i think in part one of
this series we made that distinction the unit of individual
tends to act as a catalyst for shaping human lives
these people tend to be concerned with global justice spontaneity
existence and creativity these people have an intense non-demanding relationships
with people regardless of their development age gender or any
other identifications because all of these things like gender and
age and things like this that others used to get
stuck on the lower stages get stuck on all these
different differences all of this is seen through as being
irrelevant unimportant and so the unit of individual sees the
dignity in all manifestations of life doesn't matter if it's
a human black white asian latino gay straight trans young
or old sick or healthy poor or rich man or
woman animal bug ant spider whale elephant alien doesn't matter
it's all seen as as in a sense from the
absolute perspective it's all equally valuable equally valid ways of
living life um yeah when you get to this stage
and you see like a spider in your house whereas
before you would just stomp the spider without giving you
a second thought here you're gonna probably try to like
get a plastic cup catch the spider in the cup
and then throw them outside not to hurt them because
you realize that there's no reason there's no there's what
is the difference between stomping on a spider and slitting
a human's throat what's the difference the only difference is
your own egoic bias if you get rid of the
biases the egoic biases there's no difference there's no difference
between stomping on a spider and slitting the throat of
your children but you like to pretend like there is
also at this stage other people feel worthy and whole
in your presence because you're not condemning them you're not
judging them you're accepting them and loving them and appreciating
them for exactly who they are you don't need to
change them or manipulate them you're not trying to tell
them to be different than how they are so the
person feels very accepted in your presence and this is
a powerful place from which to teach personally that's something
i'm working on still i know i can be arrogant
and condemning and cocky and sometimes i can browbeat you
that's a bit of my style but i've been moving
away from that if you haven't noticed in the last
few years i've been moving away from that more towards
uh this sort of more holistic more accepting more loving
way of interacting with you guys because i can see
the limitations of the old way of doing it i
can see this this is a more powerful way to
do it so as i'm moving more into the unit
of stage i'm going to be doing uh more of
that and my teachings you're going to see my teachings
are going to soften up they're going to become more
love centered they already have in the last couple years
but more so i'm going to be able to embody
that even more i'm still working on embodying it um
you know there's there's bad habits i've got to get
rid of you know like eight years of bad youtube
habits of um you know being a bit cocky and
condescending towards you guys um yeah but you'll see that
that's gonna get corrected in the next five or ten
years as i continue teaching that will you'll see all
that go away as i am mature and fully enter
into the unitive stage i'm still not fully living in
the unit of stage i'm sort of outside halfway between
unitive and the construct aware there's no longer these people
are no longer driven by desires to be one way
or another or to achieve one state or another there's
a deep feeling of being complete a profound self-acceptance and
self-love such people are are able to let go of
unattained goals and desires and are able to rest in
the experience of being just sitting silently feels like bliss
just sitting silently and basking in your own being becomes
the greatest pleasure you don't need drugs you don't need
sex you don't need these sorts of things now of
course that doesn't mean you can't have sex once in
a while or you can't eat some good food once
in a while you can do all these things but
the more conscious you become the more satisfaction you derive
simply from just sitting and being aware of awareness itself
at this stage there's a non-attachment to outcome because it's
seen as essential and as a liberating aspect of witnessing
and um spontaneous insight becomes common you just get bombarded
with insights from source from god we might say insights
bombard you all day long if you sit in silence
you'll get a bunch of insights about the nature of
life yourself relationships people animals the cosmos evolution society government
politics everything at this stage reality is seen to be
a universal mind mind with a capital m mind as
the only thing that exists everything is mind everything is
consciousness there never was a material world there was only
a mind with a capital m the infinite mind this
mind is god this mind is what you are this
mind is the universe this thing happening right now as
you're sitting here listening to me this is mind and
there is only mind because mind is infinite so there
can be nothing outside of mind the universe is recognized
not as a material clockwork machine but as a conscious
alive intelligent sentient mind it's consciousness everything is consciousness a
table is consciousness a chair is consciousness a fire hydrant
is consciousness a car is consciousness there's nothing but consciousness
at this stage you have a direct consciousness of god
at the lower stages god was conceived as some sort
of other as a bearded man in the clouds something
separate from yourself something beyond you something that you're unworthy
of something that has power over you and something that
is different from the material world but here at the
unit of stage because now you have direct mystical experience
you become directly conscious of the absolute truth you realize
that the universe is god you realize that the present
moment is god and that you are god and now
there is a deep ownership a process happens where you
realize first you realize that god is real then you
realize what god is and then you realize that ever
deeper levels that you yourself are god and you take
full responsibility and ownership of yourself as god which means
that you are the creator of the entire universe this
can seem absurd to the lower stages because they can't
possibly conceive of how one could be god leo if
i'm god how come my life sucks so much that's
because you are god but you're not aware that you're
god and you're not taking responsibility for your life so
therefore you're leading your life in a very ungodly way
and that's why you're being a devil and of course
that's why your life sucks so much it's basically hell
you're living in your own self-created hell yeah that's what
happens when you're not conscious and you don't take responsibility
for your life so yeah you start taking responsibility for
that it's a staggering life transforming insight to realize that
you're god this is not a belief see the lower
stages can't understand what i'm talking about here in many
cases because they think what i'm talking about is a
belief system they think like oh leo has deluded himself
into thinking that he's god because he's some sort of
narcissistic uh uh a new age cult leader who thinks
he knows so much about the universe and he though
now and now he thinks he's better than the christians
and the buddhists and everything and then and now he
has crown of course his ego has crowned himself as
the top as god but that's not what's happening at
all there's sure there there is that as a trap
that could be a trap i could be doing that
but i'm not doing that what i'm talking about is
i'm talking about you becoming directly conscious that you're god
it is a fact that you're god you can become
directly conscious of it or you can sit there and
deny it now this is not a belief system it's
not an ideology it's not wishful thinking it's not something
i hope is true it's not speculation it's not philosophy
it's you your god it can't be explained you have
to become directly conscious of it if you want to
know more about god check out my many episodes about
god i have what is god part one and part
two and then i have many others where i talk
about the nature of god at this stage the unity
of person marvels at the intelligence and perfection of all
of creation the mundane becomes the supernatural the supernatural is
not something that exists in some other dimension this is
the supernatural ordinary life is the supernatural there's a deep
appreciation of the fundamental mystery of everything you realize that
nothing can be known because being and truth are prior
to knowing you actually can't know the truth you can
be the truth you are the truth truth is but
the knowing of the truth creates a duality between the
thing being known and the knower of it such that
that already creates a split and therefore breaks the truth
to get absolute truth you have to you have to
heal that split to unify all possible dualities and splits
such that there's only a single unity left when there's
a single unity you can't quite say that you know
it because there's no longer a knower and in it
to be known you become it you merge with thing
that you're trying to understand the thing that you've been
trying to know your whole life you cease trying to
know it you cease trying to grasp it with your
mind but rather you become it you merge into it
and then it's just one you realize you were it
the whole time every object word thought and feeling and
sensation and theory is now understood to be a human
construct separating out creating boundaries where none exists giving names
to experience and making distinctions is now seen as necessary
for human growth study interaction and communication but at the
source there is nothing to distinguish ultimately there's literally no
difference between anything there's no difference between a taco and
a kangaroo other than in your own mind reality only
consists of differences that you conceive of or imagine in
your own mind the unity person feels tolerance compassion and
affiliation with all manifestations of life she respects the essence
of others and therefore does not need them to be
different from how they are she is in tune with
goodness truth and beauty she has visionary experiences and comprehends
things in holistic ways analog ways in addition to grasping
them through the filter of the personal ego and rational
thought the unit of person has great wisdom as opposed
to high iq or specialized technical knowledge a lot of
uh expert and achiever stage people they don't understand this
distinction between wisdom and consciousness versus high iq and they
tend to really value high iq uh but they don't
realize that you can have a very high iq but
you can also have a low level of ego development
or you could have a high iq and you could
have a low level of consciousness and wisdom or you
can have a sort of an average iq or even
a low iq but very high wisdom and uh very
high consciousness and so this this preoccupation that we see
online with people getting obsessed with iq scores this is
very very unhealthy this is stage expert and achiever levels
of looking at the world that's the wrong metric the
right metric is how wise you are what we need
is a wisdom test not an iq test and just
because you have a lot of specialized knowledge in science
or in physics or in computers or in mathematics or
whatever this this is a completely separate variable from your
consciousness your wisdom your capacity to love and your stage
of ego development all of this is way more important
than any kind of specialized technical knowledge the unitive person
has the ability to channel deep insights and wisdom directly
from source or universal intelligence you develop a personal relationship
with source and universal intelligence it's almost like you're able
to speak to god telepathically but of course it's even
trickier than that because the one you're speaking to is
yourself so it's not like god is up there in
the clouds and you're you're imagining talking to god rather
you yourself are god so when you're talking to yourself
in your own mind you are talking to god but
you can develop a sort of a high bandwidth connection
where you are able to channel you know god can
talk to itself in in sort of low fidelity ways
and high fidelity ways so you can develop these high
fidelity channels to tap into superhuman levels of intelligence wisdom
insight that will just blow your mind it's really this
is one of the most appealing aspects of this stage
is to to is to be able to to develop
this high bandwidth connection to universal intelligence it's almost like
going from from the old internet of the 90s that
used to be dial-up modems you you you young zoomers
you probably don't even know what that's like to to
dial up on the internet um to a website um
yeah i'm just i'm just reminiscing about the good old
days of aol and and how i would go to
ebay log into ebay through aol waiting for that stupid
dial up connection anyway so yeah so there's that that
way of interacting with reality that's most people by the
way 95 of humans have a dial-up connection to universal
intelligence such that they don't even perceive it as universal
intelligence and then some of us have a gigabit connection
i actually i recently got gigabit internet in my in
my house i got a new house with a gigabit
internet connection uh and i before that i had a
pretty fast high speed cable connection but when i upgraded
to this gigabit connection oh my god it how it
changed my life is amazing so this video right now
on my old cable connection which was still high speed
it would have taken maybe 12 hours to upload a
two hour video now i can upload this video within
15 minutes on my gigabit connection it's amazing it's worth
it totally worth it um so that's what it's like
you can develop this gigabit connection to universal intelligence and
then you can get all this wisdom and insight and
that's why if you're wondering how can some of these
teachers like you know saad guru or acharatola or whatever
these mystics and so forth or maybe you wonder how
leo where do you get all these insights it seems
like you could just talk for hours and hours and
hours and your insights don't end and you have just
all this profound wisdom pouring out of you how do
you do it well i just developed this connection it's
completely intuitive you you become conscious enough that you develop
this intuitive connection with universal intelligence and you just get
it doesn't stop it's just like a torrent what you
what you see for me what i'm able to actually
communicate to you i don't even have enough energy really
to to articulate all of my insights i get so
many more insights i maybe only articulate five or ten
percent of all the insights that i get on a
weekly basis uh from universal intelligence i'm just bombarded with
them it's it's so much i have hundreds of pages
thousands of pages of notes of insights and even that
all my notes are just a small fraction of all
the insights that i get i get so many i
can't write them all down so that's to me that's
one of the most rewarding things in life is is
that and one of the things i hope that actually
already helps you to do is to develop this sort
of connection it feels amazing it's really amazing and it's
not coming from me you see anything that i teach
you really anything wise or important or profound that i
teach you you have to realize it's not coming from
leo it never came from leo it was always universal
intelligence speaking through me so it's a very humble process
um i never like really take credit for it in
my own mind i never think like oh yeah i'm
so cool because i got this amazing insight no the
way i see it in my mind is like no
the universe is so cool because it's giving me all
these insights but then of course i realize but i
am the universe so in a sense i am generating
all the insights so really i am so cool but
not in the leo is cool sort of way but
that the universe is cool sort of way see like
um i'm as amazed by the things that come out
of my mouth as you might be because in a
sense i'm hearing them for the first time as you
are and yeah it's amazing it's profound stuff now when
i say my stuff is profound again it's not coming
from an ego place it's actually coming from a very
humble place because it's not really my stuff it's the
universe's stuff these are the universe's teachings coming to you
it's profound because the universe is profound not because leo
is profound any profundity that comes out of leo is
just the profanity of the universe but of course leo
is just a manifestation of the universe to begin with
so it's all one and it's all interconnected and so
of course i'm profound because the universe is profound and
because i'm connected to the universe you are profound you
will be profound you will actualize your profundity once you
yourself become conscious enough to realize that you're the whole
universe and then you'll develop this profanity if you want
if you want it you can develop it at this
stage one of the reasons we call it unitive is
because you feel interconnected and one with all living beings
there's actually no distinction anymore between you and another human
being or an animal there's literally no difference once the
ego dissolves enough there's no boundaries anymore you are all
living beings in the universe this is not a theory
it's not wishful thinking it's it's absolute truth you got
to become conscious of it people at the unit of
stage tend to work for justice fairness and benevolence towards
all such people realize that there are infinite numbers of
different ways of being which are all valid in a
sense every organism every creature in the universe is being
in its own unique way and none of them are
bad all of them are beautiful and so one's job
is to embrace all the diversity and multiplicity of ways
in which beings are a worm is one way to
be a snake is another way to be a bird
is another way to be a human is another way
to be a nazi is another way to be a
murderer is another way to be a drug dealer is
another way to be an alien is another way to
be they're all ways of being who are you to
judge them the universe is the sum total of all
ways of being and there are an infinite number of
them and your job as god is to embrace all
of that with love and compassion and understanding the unitive
person starts to see that all conflict is a lack
of perspective all conflict in the world amongst humans is
a is a matter of a lack of understanding of
differences in perspective there's a deep understanding of the ignorance
of others the lower stages would condem others for being
ignorant but at this highest stage you realize that this
ignorance is absolutely inevitable necessary couldn't be otherwise now that
doesn't mean an increment person can't grow and change but
they can only grow and change when they are ready
to grow and change until then they're ignorant and the
reason you have a deep now compassion for ignorance is
because you look back at your own trajectory through life
you look at all these stages you ascended through and
how difficult it was and uh you know sometimes you
were depressed sometimes you were on the brink of suicide
or whatever but you persevered and you realize damn that
was you know that took me a good 20 years
to accomplish all that uh and i can really appreciate
how ignorant i was at the very beginning of this
journey and maybe i'm still ignorant in many ways you
can see that and then as you realize that then
you get a deep empathy for the way in which
people are stuck in their own ignorance now of course
it doesn't mean you have to accept their ignorance sometimes
people think that well leo then why do you ban
people from your forum for saying stupid things shouldn't you
just accept them no that doesn't mean i'm gonna accept
people saying you know ridiculous things that doesn't mean i
have to accept holocaust denial it doesn't have to mean
i have to accept trumpism and other forms of stupid
conspiracy theories and so forth which are obviously wrong and
delusional and coming from a lower stage i'm able to
separate those out and when need be i'm able to
cut those people out of my life right because like
if i wasn't banning idiotic people from the forum the
forum would turn into into a uh a hive of
villainy and depravity and devilry as most online forums do
unless they're heavily moderated for quality at this unity stage
spontaneity and straightforwardness or straightforward simplicity becomes an essential element
of wisdom and ego transcendence the unit of person stands
out outside the desperate need for meaning making that is
common to all the earlier stages this person now has
a vast mental space to roam the mind is jail
broken and freed up when i talk about jail breaking
the mind as i have in certain episodes this is
what i'm talking about is getting getting to this place
here becoming so aware of how your mind constructs reality
that you're able to outwit your own mind remove all
the fetters there's a following away of most defense mechanisms
and manipulations at this stage there's a letting go of
control the need to control circumstances other people and even
oneself there's a sort of a it feels like free
fall going into free fall there's there's a great quote
i forget exactly who it was by maybe it was
by thick nan han or one of these one of
these modern like invited teachers and i'm paraphrasing here but
he said it awakening feels like uh jumping out of
an airplane without a parachute but realizing that there's no
ground and so you're just in constant free fall for
the rest of your life there is now a mindful
non-evaluative attention to to what is now in the present
moment you're able to just experience things without constantly judging
them or interpreting them or trying to change them to
suit you you just experience it for what it is
finally your ego can handle that your ego can tolerate
the truth where before it had to manipulate avoid deny
and play various kinds of games at this stage there
is usually a profound integration of the masculine and feminine
sides of oneself whereas before like if you were a
man you probably had a feminine shadow side and if
you're a woman you probably had a masculine shadow side
now you integrate the two you realize that the masculine
and the feminine are just two parts of your own
mind and then this this pacifies the whole gender war
situation which is common these days at the lower stages
so you're no longer at war with yourself that's one
of the biggest fruits of this stage all the other
stages are constantly at war with themselves with their parents
with their co-workers with the opposite political party with the
opposite gender with the opposite nation with the opposite ethnicity
with the opposite race with whatever they're always at war
with each other they can't get along because they're blindly
acting out their own selfishness without realizing that the self
is an illusion and so of course this creates a
bunch of needless conflict and then they always they judge
and blame each other for it because they don't want
to take responsibility for the fact that they're creating the
conflict to begin with but at this stage you realize
that all conflict in a sense is self-created and you
can take responsibility for that and therefore you can stop
the conflict just by realizing that you're being a selfish
[ __ ] and that's all ultimately what all conflict
boils down to is just selfishness unconscious selfishness at this
at this stage there's a collat kaleidoscopic response uh kaleidoscopic
responses that bridge different levels and types of contrasts for
example the difference between the concrete and the practical is
bridged between theoretical and the philosophical between the personal and
the global the serious and the humorous the mundane and
the sublime the physical and psychological and the metaphysical all
of these dualities and and rifts are healed and made
whole the unit of person uniquely identifies as a participant
in the evolution of the cosmos there's a cosmocentric perspective
not just global but the entire cosmos all of creation
creation with a capital c there is a disillusion of
notions of evil and enemies at this stage you realize
that evil does not exist it never existed because evil
is nothing more than a projection of the biased ego
mind if you get rid of all the biases in
your mind evil will cease to exist and you will
no longer have any enemies there is now a realization
that the only solution to evil the only way to
defeat evil is not externally but by slaying your own
self biases and you realize now why evil seems to
exist the reason evil seems to exist is because 99
of people are self-biased acting out their blind survival agendas
and they have no awareness of this nor are they
interested in introspecting to correct this fundamental self-deception there is
a realization at the stage that all of reality is
imaginary including the physical and the material there's no difference
between dreams that you dream at night and your body
or the wall or the chair that you're sitting on
right now all of it is different levels of imagination
nothing is taken seriously or personally anymore there's nothing personal
about life life becomes impersonal that's an amazing realization to
have is one day if in this work if you
go far enough you will realize holy [ __ ]
life is completely impersonal why did i ever take anything
personally it's a total illusion taking anything personally is a
total illusion and yet we all get wrapped up in
it so easily this unit of stage is where you
start to tap into true happiness true satisfaction tranquility and
equanimity you don't even know what happiness is until you
reach this stage at this stage of course is when
enlightenment tends to occur awakening tends to occur the buddha
mind as they call it that doesn't mean you can't
have awakenings and enlightenments at earlier stages you can you
can have mystical experiences at earlier stages in fact i
would probably say most of the mystical experiences that happen
in the world don't happen at the unit of stage
they happen at the much lower stages at the conformist
stages probably but again remember like i said it's going
to get filtered your awakening is going to get filtered
through your ego mind still and interpreted and expressed and
manifested through the mind so if the mind is at
a limited stage of development your awakening is in a
sense not going to be fully realized as it could
be you're still going to get stuck there's going to
be going to be traps there's still going to be
pathologies that can happen even if you do have awakenings
and mystical experiences at the lower stages at this stage
there's a realization that birth and death are imaginary there's
a realization of absolute love you realize that reality is
love you start to understand what love is for the
first time in your life there's a realization that self
is other literally self and other are identical and indistinguishable
there's a realization of the aloneness or oneness of yourself
you are the only thing there is you're one but
contrary to how people frame it as solipsism it's not
truly solipsism because solipsism assumes that there's a self but
there's not even a self not only are there not
others there's not even a self the self and others
are one so it's not that others aren't real it's
that others are the same as the self they're literally
identical and indistinguishable therefore you have oneness but oneness is
not in opposition to twoness oneness includes twoness and threeness
and fourness to infinity so this is a meta oneness
this is a one absolute one it's a oneness that
transcends and includes everything down below it it's the reason
you're one and you're so alone is because you're so
together with everything imagine that if we took every living
being in the universe and we completely smushed them together
just one to one until every atom was in the
exact same location of every living being so to speak
uh what would we get we get one being but
notice it's one it's alone but the reason it's alone
is because it's so together so sometimes people get hooked
or stuck on the aloneness not realizing that aloneness and
togetherness are actually indistinguishable and the same um there is
also a realization at the stage that all fear is
an illusion there is a realization that all judgment is
ignorance there is often an awakening of the heart you
could have an awakening of the mind or you could
have an awakening in the heart awakening of the heart
in a sense is even more powerful and more important
than awakening of the mind that's awakening to love there's
a sense common at this stage of this is the
end i'm done i've reached the end of life i've
won the game of life there's also a realization and
an understanding that the good life is simply to live
selflessly that's all the good life is selfless living and
the bad life is selfish living it's just that simple
there's a realization that the point of life is selflessness
goodness love and consciousness there's a realization of what reality
ultimately is reality is ultimately infinity you can become conscious
of infinity directly you can realize that consciousness is infinity
there's uh an understanding of and compassion for all human
suffering conflict argument war violence disagreement and evil because now
you understand all of it and where it all comes
from it all comes from the ego mind and from
selfishness there's a complete understanding of why humans behave as
they do human behavior is no longer mysterious to you
you understand it because you've fully deconstructed your own ego
you've fully penetrated the light of awareness through all of
your self-deception mechanisms and all of your egoic biases and
now you realize that it's just that it's all those
biases and all that unconscious material that most people have
not processed and looked deeply into that is causing all
of their weird wacky insane and self-destructive behaviors and finally
at this stage there is just silence profound silence the
mind realizes that the universe is too profound to speak
of and so whereof one cannot speak one must remain
silent as the famous wittenstein quote goes all right that's
it in conclusion here we have completed these nine stages
now you understand the entire human development process hopefully that's
clear to you there's a lot of material here congratulations
for watching through it all if you have but this
is still just the beginning you have a lot more
work to do to really understand what was said here
it'll take you probably years and decades to really understand
the significance of just these three episodes in this little
series so i recommend that you download that research paper
by suzanne cagroider i recommend you read it i recommend
you print it out i recommend you highlight it and
underline it take notes on it i recommend you you
re-read it at least once a year for the next
five or ten years as you're developing i recommend you
track your ego's development along this uh set of stages
and uh i recommend that you actually use this as
a roadmap all these things i said they weren't just
interesting descriptions you can literally use each of these bullet
points that i gave you to evaluate how good are
you on this bullet point where are you faltering where
could you use some improvement and you can actually deliberately
work on each bullet point to rise yourself up through
these different stages for example how good are you at
tolerating paradox maybe not so good okay well that's that's
a point you can work on how judgmental are you
well maybe you're you find yourself being quite judgmental okay
that's a point to work on how um for example
um how good are you at connecting intuitively to universal
intelligence versus just thinking logically and rationally about things well
that's if you're weak in that area that's something you
can work on now of course i hear you saying
but leo how do i improve all these things well
that's where some of the work lies i can't tell
you every single way in which you can work on
these things it would take me hours and days to
explain it all it's too much material of course i
cover that in certain other episodes that i've released and
i'll cover more in the future we still have a
lot more work to do with this model we're not
done by any means using this model towards our growth
we've just we've given you a foundation here now you
can use this foundation but i will also talk in
the future a lot more about um you know how
to do some of these things and how to use
this model and put it more into practice so uh
but in the meantime again don't get hung up on
how to do something if you don't know how to
do something that's not the big problem the big problem
is you not even wanting to do it or not
even knowing that it's important to do so first just
convince yourself of the importance of doing some of these
things get motivated and inspired to do some of these
things and then you won't so much be limited by
how you can always find how you can go google
it you can search for it you can find videos
you can find books you can find courses you can
find seminars you can take psychedelics there's a million different
ways how you can find how to accomplish something that
you don't know how to accomplish don't let that stop
you from setting your mind to accomplishing it the vision
comes before knowing how it's going to happen and then
just be comfortable with not knowing how for a while
trust that you'll figure it out might take you some
months or years to figure it out you will figure
it out don't expect me to tell you how to
do every single thing in your life there are way
too many things to do and you don't want to
be that reliant on me we have to be careful
here that i don't over explain things and i don't
i don't make you codependent on me you in order
for these teachings to be effective and to achieve the
necessary aims that we have here you these teachings need
to not feed you the fish but to teach you
how to fish you see so so don't always just
come to me asking for a fish sometimes i deliberately
don't want to give you a fish i just want
to point you in the right direction and have you
figure it out for yourself the very process of figuring
it out is how you grow if every single time
you're facing an obstacle in your life and you come
to leo or to some other person asking for an
answer to how to fix that specific problem what are
you why are you even alive at that point you're
asking me to figure out and solve all your problems
for you that's not how life works start taking responsibility
for finding your own solutions my job is to give
you very high level pointers and advice and then your
job is to actually live and figure out the nitty-gritty
details of your life i've got plenty of little details
in my life that i'm figuring out every single day
i got enough of my own little details to figure
out to take on all of your details you got
to be able to bridge that gap between the high
level advice that i give you between wisdom and how
to actually implement it in your life i'm not going
to give you a step-by-step formula for how to implement
it this is this would be counterproductive you think you
want that you don't actually want that because your job
is to actually be creative with your mind and to
figure out how to implement this advice because the advice
is necessarily general and abstract and for you specifically in
your life you need to apply this advice in a
way that fits you your unique personality strengths gifts talents
inclinations desires predilections and whatever else and that's going to
be different right so as much as you might think
that you want for me a thousand page manual on
how to live your whole life that's not what you
really want what you want from me is some general
pointers you want me to point out various traps and
things um about how to not screw your life up
certain directions in which to go certain techniques and ideas
certain perspectives and and stuff like that you want me
to open up your mind more for you but you
don't want me to tell you uh you know those
micro details you want you don't want me micromanaging your
life so take responsibility for that now of course you're
wondering is there anything beyond the unitive stage and actually
there is there's a lot there's there's a lot beyond
the unit of stage but remember this is a scientific
model from susannah greuter she made this model using questionnaires
that she gave to actual real people she surveyed them
when you're using that sort of method and you're surveying
the general population by definition what you're going to get
back is you're going to get sort of a bell
curve most results are going to be in the middle
somewhere so you're going to have a bunch of average
mediocre people giving you results you're going to have very
few cases of the most advanced developed humans on the
planet when we're talking about going beyond the unit of
stage the amount of responses that she would get to
that would be so small that it would be impossible
to make a any kind of scientific model based on
that to understand what's beyond the unit of stage what
you need to do is you need to study the
most advanced humans on the planet we're talking about one
in a million one in 10 million types of humans
uh of course i love studying that stuff i share
much of that with you as i study it check
out my book list for for more on that if
you want uh so there's a lot more material beyond
the unitive uh it's difficult to talk about you're not
going to really be able to understand it or apply
it if you're already not at the unitive or at
least somewhere at the construct aware stage and um and
really a lot of those stages the beyond the unit
you have to explore those for yourself these are going
to be transhuman highly mystical stages you can explore them
through psychedelics and advanced yoga techniques and advanced meditation techniques
um but uh but this is very rare stuff it's
difficult to explain there's not a big audience for it
personally i myself am limited in my understanding of those
stages i mean i i will i anticipate i will
have much more understanding of those stages in the next
10 or 20 years um i'm still figuring that stuff
out and honestly mankind as a whole is still figuring
that stuff out these stages are so advanced so rare
that it's the cutting edge of of everything that mankind
knows and so it's very challenging to figure these stages
out but again don't get too far ahead of your
skis if you can even reach the unit of stage
by the end of your life that will already be
a massive achievement and you will be in the top
1.001 percent of the global population but if you stay
tuned with me i will share it i have shared
some things that are sort of beyond the unit of
stage so we'll talk about that more as we keep
going all right that's it for me please click that
like button for me come check out actualize.org that's my
website on there you will find my blog the book
list the life purpose course all of those can be
powerful resources for you that can transform your life uh
the forum sign up to the forum it's free come
ask your questions um we have interesting discussions there we
share interesting resources and techniques and it just it helps
with that problem of feeling so isolated when you're doing
this work the forum can help you find like-minded people
maybe you can even find some local people in your
town that you can meet up with and the final
thing that i want to say here is that we
are not really done with this model i consider this
a foundation now for all the future content that i
release i will be referring back to this nine stage
model in various ways similar to how i do with
spiral dynamics in a way i prefer this model over
spiral dynamics i find it a little bit more nuanced
especially at these higher stages i feel that the the
the ego or sorry the um the construct aware and
the unit of stages as described by this model are
more accurate than the turquoise spiral dynamic like the turquoise
and coral of spider dynamics um i feel this model
is better in that respect and that is mostly what
we're concerned with with this work so that's why i
like this model more uh it feels a little bit
more personal whereas biodynamics feels a little bit more cultural
and a little more collective so i will be referring
to this mod a lot more and i will be
trying to help you to actually use this as a
roadmap um i will try to make some future episodes
where i actually break down every stage and i tell
you like here are the actual steps you can take
to move from the conformist to the expert from the
expert to the achiever from the achiever to the pluralist
from the pluralist to the whatever and then i will
also point out sticking points and traps even more so
than i did with this series because this was just
what i consider an introduction this is just an introduction
here all right so so much more uh work left
to be done with that but you don't have to
wait for me to do that for you you can
you can get to work on that yourself already i
think there's enough detail here and also in the paper
for you to do that and uh and so now
what i can tell you is this now see now
you can understand the following thing that i tell you
is that now you understand that actualize.org as a teaching
is focused on moving you up into the post-conventional stages
by jail breaking your mind that's what all of my
teachings really were intended to be from the very beginning
i'm not really interested in the lower stages i'm interested
in getting you to post conventional and then taking you
from post-conventional into the construct aware and into the unitive
so we spend a lot of time on the construct
aware stage with actualize.org we spend a lot of time
talking about epistemology about how how the mind works about
self-deception mechanisms and ways in which you fool yourself in
various traps we spend a lot of time deconstructing various
concepts and notions like freedom like morality like spirituality like
religion like god you know we deconstruct all this stuff
we talk about belief systems we talk about ideologies we
talk about cults hopefully you can see now and you
can appreciate what my teachings are trying to get you
to do they're trying to get you to see how
your mind is constructing your reality trying to get you
to start to introspect and in that process jail break
your mind such that then you can become open to
mystical experiences and awakenings and the deepest existential questions about
life and then you're going to be open to the
most profound aspects of reality consciousness and love and uh
develop developing this high bandwidth connection with infinite intelligence and
so all of my work is trying to move you
in that direction so i try to sort of catch
you at the achiever stage maybe and then move you
from achiever into pluralist strategist construct aware and then ultimately
unitive and then maybe in the years to come we'll
go beyond unity as well that's what all the techniques
that i share are about whether it's psychedelics or meditation
or concentration practices or journaling or shamanic breathing um that's
why we take so much time sharing these different maps
and models so that you can see how all the
pieces fit together we're trying to interconnect everything show you
the unity of everything at the level of mind but
then once you get it at the level of mind
my hope is that you're going to see the need
to transcend beyond the level of mind and then once
you start to get beyond the level of mind in
a certain sense you're gonna go beyond my ability to
teach you because teaching is inherently limited we're using words
it's dualistic we're trying to be logical linear here the
way teaching works is very limited ultimately you want to
get to a point where you're able to teach yourself
that's why psychedelics are so powerful because psychedelics are a
non-linear organic hyper-dimensional infinitely intelligent non-trans-linguistic trans-human mode of teaching
and communication you can learn directly from infinite intelligence itself
from the universe once you discover how to learn from
the universe itself once you open up a channel to
god itself you in a sense won't need me anymore
and that's ultimately where i want to get you to
but don't worry you've got years and decades of work
to do before you transcend my teachings so don't get
ahead of yourself thinking that you've already understood everything no
there's i guarantee you there's there's there's a decade more
of content that you haven't understood so stick around for
that there's still many many many advanced and interesting and
mind-blowing topics that we're going to be covering in the
future you
