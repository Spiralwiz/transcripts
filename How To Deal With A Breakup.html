hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
we're going to talk about how to deal with a
breakup so you're going through a breakup and it feels
miserable it feels shitty you want your ex back you
wish she could take you back you wish he could
take you back you just wish that if if only
one little thing was changed if you did one little
thing different or if she or he did one little
thing different then everything would be smooth and everything would
be okay and you wouldn't be going through this torment
that you're going through now that you're in the middle
of this breakup and it feels awful it feels like
[ __ ] you feel like [ __ ] I've
been there I don't know if I've ever shared the
story with you guys but the reason that I got
into getting better with girls learning attraction learning female psychology
and really not just that but that led me into
personal development as well in a sense really got me
serious about personal development was because of a breakup that
I had just about three or four years ago or
so yeah and and I want to tell you a
little bit that story because I was feeling some of
the feelings that you're feeling now if you're going through
a breakup and what was important for me not through
even my own strength but was that I made a
couple of important decisions right then and there at the
end of this breakup which truly transformed my life and
I think that your breakup can serve you in this
really positive way here as well so in this video
I'm going to tell you a little bit about how
I got involved with that and what happened in that
situation and then we're going to go in we're going
to tell you you know what is the deal with
breakups how do you use a breakup to actually move
yourself forward in life so you're no longer that same
miserable pathetic needy person that you were when you were
in the bad relationship because let's face it if you
two are broken up that didn't happen by accident you
might think like oh well this little thing happened here
that just made us break up no that's not what
happened here what happened and the reason you two broke
up is because there's weaknesses inside of you that you
need to resolve and there's learning that needs to happen
about relationships and about the opposite sex and that this
is a journey that you need to go on so
let me tell you let me back up for a
second let me tell you a little bit about my
story here so I wasn't really interested in girls for
most of my life not because I don't like them
sexually I love them but is because I was very
focused on my own life for a long time I
was really focused on my career I'm very life Purpose
Driven so I was working so much on that that
I didn't really date through high school or college because
I just wasn't interested in my mind was elsewhere I
was also insecure I had insecurities about my looks and
about my confidence I was kind of a shy person
because I am naturally introverted and because I wasn't socializing
a lot through high school in college because I was
so focused again on my life purpose and on my
career so in a sense what happened was that after
I got out of college and after my career started
to take off and turned into good financially then I
saw myself with quite a bit of free time and
now I've got the resources and the time and the
money to actually go out and do something I'm like
okay I should really start dating and it was very
funny because just right at this moment as this was
happening was kind of serendipitous I was going to the
gym a lot I was a regular at my local
gym and there was a girl at the counter there
that always looked at her ID since we walked in
and back and forth she was kind of like a
receptionist girl there and what happened was that she developed
an eye for me and it was funny I remember
I was I was on the treadmill on the upper
floor of our gym and then she there was also
like a reception desk up there on the second floor
and she kind of just like found some random reason
to come over and talk to me and it was
interesting like it floored me because at that point in
my life I never had a girl ever hit on
me before and like it wasn't over the top was
just me it was very subtle the way she approached
me but obvious it was obvious she was interested in
me and so of course you know I'm like oh
cool cool I was a little bit nervous because I'd
like I had very little experience with girls at that
point and I hadn't really dated many girls at that
point so but you know I kind of just fumbled
through it fumble through it we went on a couple
of dates here and there I was very reluctant and
like very slow to pull the trigger with her even
though she was very into me I was very slow
to pull that trigger because I was insecure about myself
I didn't feel like I had that confidence that I
need to have and what ended up happening was that
over the next few weeks it all ultimately came out
and turned into about a month I think that we
were kind of dating and talking back and forth and
texting and stuff and what ended up happening is that
one night she came over to my to my apartment
and we made out a little bit actually made a
lot and I should have pulled the trigger then but
again in my mind I thought like well I don't
want to be pushy on this girl I'm gonna be
that nice guy that knight in shining armor that she
probably wants and so I was playing that role because
I didn't know better and what happened was that she
left that night and then I got a little bit
antsy with her on the text the day after because
I'm like I was angry with myself that I didn't
close and so I'm like oh when are you coming
back when you coming back I want you back at
my place and at that point she saw that I
was getting so needy with her that she just texted
me said you know what I don't think that we're
going to work out and I'm not really looking for
a relationship right now and we were done and I
didn't even proceed that we were done in her mind
we were done in my mind it was like oh
she just may be you know being a little bit
coy I can still get her back this kind of
stuff because I see her all the time at my
gym so I'm like oh it's not a big deal
you know we'll just work it out but then here's
the real dagger in the heart of this story is
that I'm looking on Facebook and we were Facebook friends
at that point cuz she gave me her facebook earlier
after we started dating so I look at my facebook
and it says her status changes to a in a
relationship and this happens literally a week after she breaks
up with me her status changes the in a relationship
with a little pink heart and she's glowing about how
she's in love with this guy and that's not me
I'm looking at this and I'm like oh that's like
a that that [ __ ] like it's like a
dagger in my heart right because I still in my
mind thought that I was courting her and I still
had a chance with her but now this was like
oh I have no chance anymore and so at this
point I recognize that wait a minute there's something very
dysfunctional here I'm very insecure about myself my skills with
women are really bad I don't have the experience I
need I need to get this handled and I recognize
that I was at such a point with so little
experience that I needed more than just a you know
reading a couple of tips on some website or in
some some magazine like I needed serious professional help and
I was willing to that at that point to go
and do whatever it takes in order to get good
with girls and I remember like in that in that
area of time when I saw that that Facebook update
where I was feeling like so miserable I was feeling
like I only I can be with this girl like
my life would be perfect everything would work out like
how could I be so stupid to make a couple
of these mistakes like I wish I could just turn
back the time a little bit and just make a
couple of course corrections and at that point I was
still kind of scheming and plotting for how I can
get her back because in my mind I thought like
I literally didn't see myself having other opportunities because I
saw that I don't have the skills I need to
attract girls plus girls don't come and approach me this
was once in my entire life that a girl came
and approached me so to me it was like a
very rare opportunity that I blew and I was really
beating myself up for and I feeling really bad about
it but I made this important decision and the important
decision I that I made was that I'm going to
get better with girls and yes I want this girl
back but you know what if I don't get her
back I'm going to get better with girls like I'm
going to work on myself I'm going to take the
control of my own hands and make it make it
happen I'm not going to leave it up to fate
anymore because this this fate thing it's too painful it
doesn't work out too well so from this I really
went and I got really involved I was started going
out approaching lots of girls at nightclubs and bars I've
been and I've been doing that for a couple of
years and developing the skills and I got good and
a lot of other amazing stuff happened along the way
so it wasn't just about going up and hooking up
with girls but it was all it was mostly about
the the biggest benefits I got from it was just
like the personal growth that I experienced as a man
and also like building my character building my confidence learning
more about personal development learning about relationships learning about sexuality
learning about dating learning about attraction but then learning about
stuff like meditation and learning about being masculine and this
kind of stuff which was incredibly rewarding and ultimately that
led me into life coaching that led me into shooting
these videos so my life changed dramatically from that point
where I made the decision to get with that not
to get with that girl but to to forget about
her and to focus on my future so what does
all this have to do with your breakup well this
pertains directly to your breakup because right now you're in
this point where I was at several years ago you're
in this very painful point and you want to end
the pain by going back to your ex you want
to do that or you want to retreat in some
other way and what I'm here to tell you is
I want to introduce this idea to you that what
you're experiencing now yes it's painful but recognize that it's
a good pain there is good pain in life and
this is one of the rare moments where the pain
is good and you got to recognize it this emotional
suffering that you're going through it's actually a good thing
you're beating yourself up you're feeling needy and lonely and
desperate and all this stuff maybe you're feeling angry this
is good I want you to use this because I
want you to look at breakups from now on after
you watch this video breakups are a good thing they're
not a bad thing they're a good thing and if
you're feeling painful and miserable even better that makes them
even better now it's easy for me to say that
now because I'm not feeling the pain but you know
what I was wise enough to see it several years
ago and I've had breakups afterwards too so this is
not like my own break up I've had some some
break up so I was really miserable driving myself nuts
but I was still wise enough and I was using
my future as a way to console myself in the
present so right now you know you're feeling miserable or
whatever you're feeling very lonely but I want you to
use this as motivation to move forward in your life
and to paint a bigger picture for yourself the way
that I did a few years ago and the way
that I honestly did a few breakups leader just not
that long ago maybe a year or two ago so
what does this mean well like I said earlier you
didn't break up for no reason if you broke up
you broke up for a good reason there's weakness inside
of you that you need to work on there's stuff
within your personality you need to work out there's learning
that needs to happen you need to learn about how
the opposite sex thinks how they work you also need
to learn stuff about yourself now this breakup could have
happened for you know a hundred different reasons we can't
cover all of them here but what you need to
do is you need to discover why this breakup happened
what's your responsibility in it not blame the other person
take full responsibility yourself for what was going on here
and then you need to learn those lessons and you
need to tell yourself okay I know logically what the
lessons are I figured it out i sat down I
worked it through so maybe it's because I'm needy or
maybe it's because I'm lonely all the time or maybe
it's because I get into fits of anger and this
person didn't like that or maybe it's because I don't
understand how men think or how women think identify the
problem but then you have to commit to not just
knowing about the problem but commit to really fixing this
area in your life permanently so here's what you're doing
you're actually using this breakup that you have right now
to create like an inflection point in your life there's
going to be this divergence there's the path that you
could have stayed on which is just your normal everyday
life you're comfortable you're doing what you're currently doing nothing
much is changing you're in your relationship and if you
go back into the old relationship the way you want
to right now because you're feeling lonely and you're feeling
needy then your life isn't going to change is just
going to keep going and you're not going to learn
much it's just going to keep going you're going to
feel comfortable oh yeah you're going to feel comfortable it's
going to feel nice but you're just going to keep
going on the same trajectory but if you set a
big vision for yourself the way I'm gonna tell you
to do here in this video in a second then
you've got a chance to really boost your life supercharge
it to make this a point that you can look
back on five or ten years from now and say
oh man that breakup was the best thing that ever
happened to me I'm not just being Pollyanna when I'm
talking about that because literally right now when I look
back on my breakup from three or four years ago
I feel that way I feel like that is the
best thing that could have happened to me and if
if only I stayed with that girl if only that
girl took me back that would have been the worst
thing because I would have been my weak self to
this very day so let's talk about some of the
things that you're going to be doing here you're going
to be making some bold new plans for yourself and
I want to give you some ideas on what you
should focus on with your personal growth this is an
opportunity for personal growth for you so here are the
things that I want you to take stock of and
to ask yourself do I need more work here and
if you do you're going to go to work on
them one learning attraction especially if you're a guy learning
how to attract women is super important because if you're
like the regular guy then probably the thing that you're
facing is that you just don't have as many options
equipment as you'd like you're not meeting the high quality
women you want you're not approaching the women and women
aren't approaching you so you're just getting very few opportunities
and this makes you needy this makes you insecure about
yourself so learning what actually attracts women and it's probably
not what you think it is unless you've really studied
it because a lot of this stuff is counterintuitive if
you're a woman then it's not really your job so
much to attract the man you do it through your
look so there's not much you need to go and
change about that but it still helps to learn a
little bit about you know what men are actually attracted
to versus again what you think they're attracted to because
they're probably not attracted to the things that you think
as a woman they're attracted to so that might be
also i opening for you so learning about attraction next
is build a stronger social circle this one is especially
important if you're a woman because as a guy we're
expected to go approach women so that's culturally acceptable that's
cool I can tell guys to go get better with
girls sort approaching girls in bars and clubs they'll get
better women don't do that women don't approach guys so
as a woman how do you get more high-quality men
into your life that you could potentially date well through
social circle most women meet most of their boyfriends and
their husbands and whoever else they're dating or having sex
with through having a big social circle the bigger your
social circle the more people you're running into the more
opportunities you have for dating so if you're a woman
that's how I would go at it is working on
your social circle building a big circle so you know
lots of people then you have lots of opportunities as
a guy you can also build a social circle so
this is not a woman exclusive thing a lot of
guys actually most guys regular guys who aren't into pickup
they also attract girls through social circle just friends of
friends that you know you meet new people they introduce
you to their friends and you go on dates you
get opportunities from that so work on your social circle
next you got to learn better relationship skills after you
attract that person where are you faltering in your relationship
skills where are the areas that you're not good it's
probably communication you probably don't know how to communicate well
with men or with women you need get better at
that there are books you can read there are seminars
you can take there are classes online that you can
purchase their videos you can watch you there are people
you can talk to they're coaching and therapy that you
can get so learning better relationship skills this is a
subject that has been much studies much studied there's been
a lot of books written on this there a lot
of good theory about how to communicate effectively in a
relationship how to understand the way relationships work because again
this is not stuff that happens naturally being good in
a relationship is not what naturally happens what naturally happens
is that most relationships break up so if what you
want is a happy long-term relationship you got to work
on that next I want you to work on building
a better life for yourself this is really important and
it doesn't seem like it's important at first but it
is important because part of the reason that people don't
want to be in a relationship with you part of
the reason that your girlfriend or boyfriend left you is
maybe often because you don't have a well-put-together life and
it's not always that well your boyfriend or your girlfriend
looks at you and says well I don't like your
life you're not you're not the super successful person that's
not usually how it works usually how it works is
for example because you don't have enough friends in your
life you feel lonely and needy and so that lonely
neediness that's being pushed upon your partner in the relationship
that makes him or her feel bad and so they
leave you because they perceive you as needy and desperate
or maybe you don't have a nice career in your
life you don't have a nice career you don't have
a lot of sense of life purpose so you're not
really passionate you're kind of lazy you're slacking off you
don't have the kind of money that you want and
your partner perceives that and this lowers you in their
eyes and you know what some people don't want to
be with people who are lazy or who are slackers
who aren't passionate about life and so they leave you
maybe you don't have high quality hobbies in your life
there's nothing interesting that you do again what does that
do well that probably makes you a sour and bitter
and miserable person to be around maybe you're very negative
maybe you have a lot of childhood issues right and
so because of this you don't have hobbies presently in
your life you don't have a happy life that you
constructed for yourself so the other person he or she
notices that just because you are becoming a bitter and
sour person and that's souring your relationship so working on
your life this means getting a good career getting your
finances into shape getting your health into shape huge huge
probably the number one thing that a woman can do
to attract better quality men and to keep them in
her life is to just work on her on her
fitness and her nutrition and this kills two birds with
one stone because not only are you doing that for
the guy but you're doing it for yourself and for
your long-term health which is which is important too so
you know working out working out looking after yourself proper
nutrition if you're a guy I do that as well
you know girls appreciate a guy who's got nice muscles
and you appreciate it too so this one you should
be really doing for yourself get some nice hobbies get
stuff that you're passionate about and you love doing get
a nice circle of friends going so that you're being
happy in your life right when you have friends and
if friends make you happy get friends if you don't
if friends don't make you happy for example for me
out friends aren't that important then you don't need to
get them but just put the pieces into place in
your life that are making you happy and now don't
do it from the standpoint of like well I'm doing
all of this just to get a girl I'm doing
all of this just to get a guy know you're
doing this to make you the best possible you that
you can be to make yourself happy when you're happy
when you're confident when you're secure people get attracted to
that that's what attraction is based on people love people
like that people like that are rare in life I
don't know if you'd notice that they're pretty rare when
you meet when you meet a person who's really happy
really successful got everything together is doing stuff that he
loves and she loves in her life then like this
person they don't need anything to complete them and this
makes them extremely magnetically attractive so it's it's an amazing
thing because again you're killing two birds with one stone
you're doing it for yourself first and foremost but then
this gets you the attraction of the attractive partners that
you want to next you really need to focus and
work on your neediness issues now some of the things
about already here on this list we'll help you with
that but sometimes you need to go even a step
further neediness kills relationships if you're a guy in reading
with a girl that's that's like a death sentence for
your relationship women hate needy men that's the most repulsive
thing that they can encounter in a relationship is a
needy man they hate a needy man more than they
hate an abusive man it's freaky so you need to
really work on your neediness what does that mean well
I'll have other videos talking about that but just in
brief you know if you're needy and you all are
always desperate for sex you need to go up and
get that out of your system go have sex lot
of girls go date a lot of girls so that
you're not feeling this desperation for sex if you're a
woman and you're feeling neediness in the sense that well
you need a man in your life to be that
strong pillar that you want or whatever and you can't
bear to be alone you also need to work that
out and guys can feel that too so it's not
always that guys are only needy with sex there they
can also be needy they need companionship or whatever a
lot of times neediness if you're really stuck on neediness
is because you have old trauma in the past childhood
issues maybe you were neglected when you were young or
you were abandoned by your mother or something like that
or there was a divorce in your life and that
affected you in some way that now makes you always
needy for love and companionship but this is ruining your
relationships so work on that the next thing you should
work on is any neurotic emotional issues that you have
so neediness is one of those but also focus on
stuff like anger jealousy toxic negativity depression nothing will poison
your relationship more than one of these things that I
just said right when you're a toxic negative mean person
no one wants to be around you no matter how
much they love you even if you get someone into
relationship with you and they love you a lot ultimately
they're going to be forced to to reevaluate that decision
of being with you if you're extremely toxic and negative
and you're bringing them down in life a successful happy
person doesn't want to be around people like that so
you need to work those out and that usually involves
some deep work you might want some coaching for that
you might want some therapy you might want to buy
some books you might want to watch more of my
videos you might want to do some self therapy maybe
get some sake gnosis done NLP work you know there's
a lot of different ways to work on this stuff
but it's important to start to look at this and
lastly what I would tell you is work on your
bad habits so do you smoke do you drink are
you overeating are you eating really unhealthy foods do you
take drugs are you addicted to stuff are you addicted
to television and Internet and pornography all of these things
and more any kind of addictions that you have any
bad habits you developed these things also jeopardize your relationships
you know not always you don't need to be paranoid
about this stuff I'm not telling you that you need
to become the perfect person and again remember why you're
doing this you're really doing this as part of the
self actualization process self actualizing for you not for somebody
else so you should be working on your bad habits
anyways because they're already destroying your life the only point
I'm making here is that notice how all of these
bad things in your life that you don't want what
are they doing they're making you miserable and it's this
misery that's souring your relationship so that's ultimately what you're
weeding out of your personality is just this toxicity this
misery which isn't doing either of you or your partner
good appointees that we make about romance so you know
we grew up in a very Hollywood romance culture and
we're saturated by the media love stories and romantic comedies
and dramas and all this stuff and whether you're a
guy or whether you're a girl if you're in the
middle of a breakup you feel so bad and you
feel like like something special has been lost right like
oh this person she was the perfect one or like
he was the one he was doing I was supposed
to marry he was my knight in shining armor or
like she was that special girl I'll never find a
girl that I have that amazing connection with ever again
or maybe she was the mother of my children so
she was so special to me or maybe you know
he's he's my husband he's so special to me how
am I ever going to recover from losing this person
in my life here's the deal Hollywood romance is [
__ ] this feeling that you have right now it's
an illusion it's an optical illusion played on you by
your mind and you can know this you know this
deep down you're feeling so miserable you want that person
back but you know that that person is not that
special you've got chemicals going around in your mind and
you've also got ideas about this romance and how special
this person was and how there are there's that idea
that that's soulmate there's only that one other soulmate that
you've got well you know what I hate to break
it to but there are no one unique soulmates this
actually a really good news because if there was only
one soulmate that means that if you didn't click with
this person and you screwed something up and now they
abandoned you then you're screwed you're screwed your whole life
is screwed but actually I'm here to tell you that
your life is not screwed and that there are many
many many amazing people out there for you to attract
for you to develop relationships with and this person they're
not that special I guarantee you no matter how special
this person was no matter how much money they had
no matter how sexy and beautiful they looked no matter
what other kind of you know what I want amazing
sense of humor they had or whatever I guarantee you
that there are thousands of people just like that or
even better out there right now in your city waiting
to meet new people many of them are single and
you can meet them if you feel like this person
is so extremely special you'll never get that chance again
well you know what that what that signifies that signifies
that you have lack of abundance lack of options with
the opposite sex in your life which is what I
felt three years ago and it was real for me
that wasn't an illusion that was real that was a
real problem but this is one of the problems that
I want you to work on I want you to
build your abundance with the opposite sex or whoever you
prefer to to date if it's same-sex that's cool to
build your abundance so that you have the option so
that you're not feeling like there's only one or two
guys that come along in a decade oh one or
two girls that come along in a decade if it
your life functions that way it's because you didn't design
it right and that's okay you can go back to
the drawing board and fix that stuff which is what
we're having you do here so here's the bottom line
I want you to have a big vision for what
your life is going to be your life because of
this breakup is now going to be much bigger and
I want you to keep reminding yourself of that every
single day as you're going through the pain that's breakup
so this breakup the pain of it maybe it lasts
a couple of weeks maybe a couple of months well
keep reminding yourself I've got a big vision now my
vision is that I'm going to make myself stronger I'm
going to use this to grow myself I'm gonna work
out every single sticking point in my personality I'm gonna
self actualize I don't need somebody else to be there
for me to self actualize I'm gonna work out myself
I want to work on my sexual abundance I'm going
to get better in relationships I'm going to learn how
to attract the opposite sex better I'm gonna get into
shape I'm gonna work on my bad habits I'm going
to work on my childhood neediness and anger issues and
then I'm going to be a really strong individual a
couple of years from now not in six months a
couple of years from now I'm gonna be this amazing
strong individual that's my vision that's how you think from
now on as you're going through this pain and finally
the most important point of all because I know how
much you want to do this right now do not
go back to your ex if you do that that's
going to destroy everything we've talked about here it'll destroy
all of it because if you go back to your
ex none of this stuff will happen you're telling yourself
like that right now something like well Leo this is
all amazing but can't I have all this plus get
my ex back wouldn't that be the best-case scenario so
I'm going to go I'm going to work on my
self and do all this but I want my ex
back give me my ex back I'm just going to
try let's see maybe she'll take me back I'm gonna
try doing all this self development but let me just
see if the ex will take me back if you
do that what's going to happen is that you're not
going to develop yourself you're not you're not going to
have the motivation necessary what's going to happen is going
to fall back into your comfort zone and the stuff
that we talked about this amazing vision of yourself your
highest self this stuff actualized self that you could be
two years from now this amazing sexy beautiful self with
all the sexual options that you have or maybe you
want that husband or that wife or that girlfriend or
that boyfriend whatever you want you could have that in
two years time with work but if you go back
to your ex you're not going to have that what
you're going to have is you're going to have a
dysfunctional relationship a codependent dysfunctional relationship so in summary do
not go back to your ex do not go back
to your ex do not go back to your ex
focus on your vision focus on the vision all right
