hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about what is spirituality what
is spirituality I'm excited about this video because this is
something that I wanted to talk about for a long
time and this idea of spirituality is a very advanced
idea that I'm excited to share with some of you
guys out there but it also has to be treated
in a delicate manner because a lot can go wrong
when you're discussing spirituality so in this video we're gonna
do is we're gonna talk about the fundamentals the just
the very basics I want to basically give you an
intro on spirituality I'm gonna tell you what it is
we're really going to compare spirituality with religion compare and
contrast those two and see how they're very very different
in fact they're they're almost the polar opposites and we're
gonna talk a little bit about how to do proper
spirituality I'm gonna point you in the right direction so
that you can go off and start to do some
of the research some of the searching that you will
have to do to do true spirituality yourself because in
the end spirituality is something that can only be done
individually and I want to cover some of the details
of that right now because a lot of people are
so so so confused about what spirituality is and that's
for some very important reasons which we're going to cover
and I want to dispel some of the myths that
are surrounding this if you are a religious person I
warn you this video will probably shock and offend you
deeply so this is not a video that you want
to watch if you're a religious person or unless you
really want to find the truth and you're ready to
put aside all the religious stuff that you've been doing
for perhaps your whole life or for many many decades
and go on a real personal journey to understand what
the nature of you is and reality is and that's
ultimately what spirituality is that's my definition of it allottee
is different for religion because religion is concerned about many
different questions and there is a little bit of overlap
but there's a very different way in which religion goes
about answering some of these questions and also some of
the questions that religion tries to answer are not important
to spirituality so let's start to compare and contrast this
stuff for spirituality what's really important is to understand the
truth of reality it's to come into direct contact with
reality through whatever means is out there being totally open
minded to whatever's out there and trying to grasp reality
however you can as close to the source as you
can the reality here is basically deep existential truths about
nature the universe that we live in and ourselves and
consciousness and how does all that intermingle and come together
that's what spirituality is concerned with what is religion concerned
with religion is concerned with that to an extent but
it's also concerned with a lot of other stuff religion
is concerned with morality issues of what is right and
what it's wrong religion is concerned about preservation of certain
traditions certain belief structures religion is a lot of times
concerned with ritual and upholding various traditions and doing things
in very specific ways religion is concerned about questions like
good and evil right and wrong also it's concerned about
where the universe came from what is reality what is
the substance of it what is the source of this
creation and what is our relationship to it so you
can see that there is some overlap there but religion
is a lot more expansive than spirituality spur travel is
a lot more focused so now that we have that
down the next important point to make here is that
spirituality is really something that is done with a scientific
mind with a scientific attitude and what that means is
not scientific in the sense that scientists today a lot
of science today is actually very dogmatic a lot of
science today is based on a lot of beliefs and
a lot of theories and people will choose size and
and debate and how all these kinds of arguments which
are all based in in logic in knowledge and thoughts
that's not what I mean by spirit by by scientific
approach by scientific approach I mean the empirical approach that
early scientists took which was you know back way in
the day even in the day of let's say Aristotle
even back then philosopher started to understand that one way
to understand reality to understand nature as it actually is
and not as we like it to be or as
we wish it to be or as we fantasize or
we believed it to be but actually how it is
one way to do it is by direct observation you
can listen to it you can literally hear the sound
of nature you can look at it you can observe
whether you're observing with your eyeballs or you're observing through
a telescope or microscope there's some sort of observation going
on or even if you're running some sort of experiment
where you're not maybe doing a direct eyeball experimentation and
observation but you're experimenting on something and a computer is
tracking the results of that so it's observing the results
for you and then it gives you back numbers then
you can look at those numbers and makes them maybe
some sort of conclusions based on those numbers that's what
we mean by scientific empirical approach it's very sensory it's
very first person there's something powerful about that empiricism and
this is where a lot of even science but especially
religion starts to veer off course is that they try
to understand truth and reality by thinking about it by
philosophizing about it building theories building models and ultimately what
this does is it creates the opposite effect because there's
something that you have to consider here here's something to
consider to alter there's two alternatives to consider one alternative
which is the alternative that you currently probably believe which
is this that we live in a in a reality
in a universe and this universe we happen to be
inhabitants of it and we have this mind we have
this brain we have all the stuff that that we
see but then we interpret it through the thoughts that
we have so we all our beliefs that are our
theories and models and the current model that your kind
of operate under the paradigm really it's more than a
model it's a paradigm you're so immersed in it is
that you can grasp the truth and truth simply means
reality that's all truth is truth is just reality you
can grasp reality and you can understand it and you
can experience it through thought that's what the paradigm is
this is the scientific paradigm this is also the religious
paradigm what does this mean this means that literally you
think that if you're thinking about nature if you're thinking
about a physics equation for example you're thinking about a
math equation or you're thinking about history or you're thinking
about a fact of the world that if you're thinking
about it then somehow you can get to the truth
of it through thought and you think yourself well certain
certain models of the world are faulty they're not very
accurate other models of the world they're more accurate they
tend to produce better results if you're working under those
and so you tend to say well the ones that
are more accurate than ones that actually tend to produce
the results in life those tend to be the true
ones and so you will take something like maybe Einstein's
theory of relativity or you will take some sort of
mathematical axiom or you'll just take some sort of general
truth about life you'll take that and you'll say you
know what that is very accurate we can use that
to make predictable results about reality and therefore that is
the truth and you think that you're connected with the
truth and that you've got it so let's consider that
that's that's of one possibility that could be a ray
that reality that we live in is that our mind
is capable of actually grasping the truth through logical thought
and language the other alternative though is the following and
here's where I need you to be very open-minded because
you need to really seriously consider this other alternative and
here's the other alternative the other alternative is that reality
is so vast so inch and so complex that it
cannot be grasped at all with thought or language or
logic which are all pretty much the same thing really
consider the ramifications of that what if we live in
a reality where you can't actually grasp the truth of
it through thought so maybe your thought is useful to
you in many circumstances of life maybe it's useful for
you to take care of your kids and to do
your job and to to get a promotion and to
lose some weight to do some personal development or whatever
that's fine but what if all of that thought had
absolutely zero truth in it there was no reality in
it it's kind of a scary notion because once you
start to accept this notion which is actually true by
the way once you start to accept this notion then
your whole paradigm starts to change about what reality actually
is and that's the problem here is that spirituality is
concerned about with access to directly direct reality to the
truth and your thoughts if you do a careful self
investigation you'll discover that your thoughts are not going to
allow you to do this why is this the case
you might wonder well consider an example consider an example
where we take a piece of fruit let's say we
take an orange if I taste this orange I get
a sense of what this orange is I get a
sense of its flavor its color of its smell of
its feel of its texture of its essence I get
I get that when I interact with this orange now
if you never interact with an orange and only I
interact with it and you never see this orange you
never hear about it you never ever tasted an orange
in your life and I go and I try to
explain what an orange is to you is that going
to be possible what you'll discover is that it's not
possible I can make some sort of general and vague
analogies about or I can tell you what it might
be similar to that has been in your experience but
actually the orange itself you don't know it and you
will never know it through the words and language that
I use so no matter how poetic I am I'm
not going to get across the taste of an orange
to you or the the tartness of its peel or
the way that the texture of that orange feels and
this is a very this is a very troubling thing
because it means that you need direct access to the
orange in order to to feel it to see it
to really interact with it to experience the truth of
it and that my words in my language isn't going
to do it any justice so this is kind of
like an analogy this is an analogy that I'm using
to help to under to help you to understand what
we're talking about here because spirituality is actually a very
very advanced concept this is the most advanced concept that
you will ever run across in your personal development or
in any domain of life it's very advanced because people
have all sorts of very confused notions about it and
the people that think that they're spiritual the people who
are religious and believe they're spiritual and the people who
just think that they're spiritual without the religious component they're
all very mistaken about this 99.99999% of anybody that you're
gonna find out there is not going to be able
to give you an accurate and proper explanation of spirituality
because they're very confused about it themselves because it's very
very tricky the whole point of spirituality is that there
is a reality in this reality it literally is not
communicable that means that there are truths that cannot be
communicated that means that no not only can I not
communicate it to you but it also goes even deeper
it goes deeper than the orange example because in the
orange example you could just look at the orange and
experience it it goes deeper than that though because your
own thoughts that you're having about this orange are actually
impeding you from experiencing the truth the raw truth of
what this orange is because you have a lot of
mental filter that you put on top of this orange
you think that's an orange you put a label on
it you put certain other mental labels and associations on
oh it tastes sweet oh it's sour maybe it's bitter
maybe it's rotten maybe it's pretty maybe it's round maybe
it's something else but this is all that your mind
is adding on top of it it has very hard
to remove the mental filters that you've got to get
to the direct experience of the orange if you could
do that consider the possibility that's possible if you could
do that what would you have you would have a
pure direct it wouldn't even be an experience because experience
is layered with lots of mental labels it would be
something that's more pure than experience it would be direct
it would be just a direct contact with truth this
is what true spirituality is this is extremely different from
religion and it's even very different from science but the
scientific and empirical approach here is still very useful so
all that means is that you're doing observation spirituality is
not about thinking stuff it's not about believing stuff it's
not about having faith it's not about any kind of
rituals it's not about going and praying with somebody it's
not about becoming a hippy it's not about meditation it's
not about any of that all it is is its
direct contact with reality that's what true spirituality is and
very very few people understand this and even fewer people
actually practice this it's very difficult to practice this your
mind is ingenious at preventing you from direct access to
truth it's a reality now you might say valley oh
how is it possible to have direct contact with reality
is that even possible or and I always going to
be experiencing it through some sort of a perceiver perception
type of paradigm and there's going to be always some
sort of mental filters or even if not mental filters
then can't we say that this experience of this orange
that's particularly as a human being wouldn't it then be
different for example for a monkey or it would be
different for another human being you know maybe I see
the orange in a little different way than the the
next guy or girl sees that orange so aren't I
always stuck in at least having to go through my
perceptions and what our perceptions our perceptions actually true how
how can you say that the perceptions that you have
here for example that color that I see or this
person that I interact with how can you say that
those raw perceptions that that's reality what about the stuff
that's underpinning that what about the matter that's there the
substance right what is that person actually aside from the
way that I see that person that's an interesting question
that's a question that you're gonna have to really study
hard that's not something that you can be closed-minded about
like most people are what you're actually going to find
if you're very honest with yourself and use this investigation
is you're going to find interestingly enough that there is
a possibility of direct access to reality and that's a
very amazing thing and very very few people understand this
and very few people have had those kinds of experiences
but they are possible so I'm just throwing that out
there for you as something that you might want to
pursue for yourself and start to look into if you're
curious about this kind of stuff if you're really curious
about what existence is you can find out not through
a book not through philosophy not through Theory building or
beliefs or chanting or any of that kind of stuff
but through the right experience so consider this possibility that
there's something in reality that you can't communicate and in
fact if I experience reality real reality I can't communicate
it to you every attempt that I would make would
have to go through language through thought and that would
instantly destroy the truth that was there it's very interesting
that this this is this is how it is I
want to go into a little bit about the history
of religion because people will hear this and then they'll
start to wonder well how does this connect with religion
or is there any truth within religion it seems like
there's some sort of spiritual component within religion but then
there's a lot of stuff that people don't like about
religion there's a lot of different religious factions how do
we start to reconcile this is there one truth these
are multiple truths what you're going to discover is that
there is only one truth but let's talk a little
bit about the religions and how they started see the
problem with these spiritual truths because they're not communicable that
creates a very big barrier it creates a barrier of
transference that means that there's this block this wall that
literally that if one person gets it he can't pass
it on to the next person that other person has
to work and do exactly the same thing that this
person did in order to get it here's what happened
with religions at least this is kind of my my
theory about it every religion every major religion we've contract
to being started by a prophet so Jesus started Christianity
you had the Buddha we started Buddhism you've got Muhammad
and Islam and every even lesser religion that's not as
well known tends to be centered around a prophet why
does this happen it's interesting because of this logic and
language barrier that we have there's basically two types of
people when it comes to spirituality there's the person who
actually has direct experience so let's take this orange for
example you got this orange you've got direct experience of
the orange you got the truth of the orange there's
that type of person the second type of person is
the one that doesn't have that experience he doesn't have
the truth and so you've got these two types of
people and here's what tends to happen is that the
first type of person is very genuine the first type
of person he goes he experiences this orange and when
you actually experience reality directly it's a amazing experience it's
an awestruck experience it will literally strike aw in you
it's a very powerful experience it's so powerful in fact
that it's going to leave you silent it's gonna leave
you dumbstruck but inevitably what happens is because this is
such an awesome experience what happens is that this original
person this prophet he goes he has this experience then
he gets really excited about it after the fact you
know this is a really amazing thing this changes how
you see your entire world imagine if you saw truth
like that you saw truth that changed literally the paradigm
of how you saw the entire world it could really
transform how you feel about the entire world could end
a lot of your suffering in life it made you
feel a lot of love and compassion for everybody else
out there because you felt at one with everybody so
you get this truth and then you're thinking yourself man
it would be really nice to share this with people
I wish others around me could get in on this
could see this amazing thing and so of course in
your eagerness you go out there and you try to
you try to point you try to tell people hey
look look at this thing that I saw it's amazing
other people look at you and they kind of look
at you they see it as a little bit weird
a little bit wacky because you your ways are a
little bit different than theirs but they sense that there's
something about you something kind of genuine about you there's
some genuine passion and it sounds like you're really convinced
that you saw something amazing what could this be they
wonder so they start listening to you though I don't
come tell me tell me tell me what you saw
and so this person who saw this experience will start
to go go and talk he'll give a lecture I'll
give a sermon he'll paint a nice a nice picture
maybe he'll write a poem he'll write a story and
allegory I use a metaphor whatever means of communication he
uses that person who hasn't experienced it he's gonna have
a problem because all he's got is he's got the
story and he's got the belief so it's like me
telling you what an orange is without you ever having
seen an orange what's gonna happen if I talk to
you long enough eventually you can start to feel like
oh I know what an orange is yeah an orange
it's kind of like yellow it's kind of maybe like
a lemon I've seen lemons so I can imagine it's
kind of like a bigger lemon and it's not yellow
it's maybe a little bit more like it's reddish so
it's maybe kind of similar to an apple but kind
of halfway in between an apple and an orange and
it's a citrus so I have some experience with citruses
so maybe a little bit like that and they say
it's sweet so it's sweet kind of maybe like sugar
okay yeah I know what an oranges the undisciplined mind
will do this it will jump to all sorts of
conclusions and it'll say yeah you know I know exactly
what you're talking about yeah I know that orange I
know what an orange is like I know where no
one's just like Alex maybe all experience in orange sometime
but I already know what it's like and then that
person who says yeah this is an amazing orange look
at this orange that person who's never experienced it and
then he'll run off and he'll tell his friend he'll
say look I heard about this amazing fruit it's called
an orange let me describe it to you it's like
this it's orange and it's round and it's like a
citrus colleague Oh kind of like a lemon kind of
like an apple somewhere in between it's sweet like sugar
and it's got all these other properties and that person
will go oh man that's that's an amazing thing I've
never seen an orange before but I can picture it
I know you're talking about man that's really cool so
there's an orange out there okay great let's let's let's
tell our other buddies about the orange let me tell
my wife let me tell my kids about this orange
and so what happens is that this idea spreads throughout
people and everybody starts to believe like they know what
an orange is but really only the first person who
was speaking about that orange knows that's the person who
is the Prophet and this is how religions get started
is you have someone like Jesus or we have someone
like Muhammad or you have someone like the Buddha he
does the hard hard hard direct observational empirical work that's
necessary to pierce into the truth of reality he does
that work it's difficult to do that he does that
and then that makes a little bit weird that makes
him a little bit different because to do that takes
an exceptional human being most of us in life we're
very concerned about our survival we're very concerned about raising
our kids having sex and making money and getting some
entertainment in living a comfortable lifestyle and dying happy and
living happy that's what we want most of us but
see that's survival that has nothing to do with reality
consider that possibility as well that your survival and the
fact that you're surviving in this world and doing whatever
it is that you're doing running your ordinary everyday affairs
but that has absolutely nothing to do with what existence
is and that knowing existence and experience the existence directly
that this might not have any practical value to you
whatsoever it might not make you any wealthier or any
happier or any better at interacting with other people or
any better at your job or any better at your
relationship or anything else so maybe has absolutely zero value
but maybe it's the truth consider that truth might have
zero value to you it's an interesting consideration because a
lot of people are so busy chasing value that they
don't look at where the truth is and if you're
only looking in this direction because you believe that value
is here there's no value there but the truth happens
to be there then are you ever gonna look that
way you won't and that's what most people do in
life is that they never look this way but the
profits they do so someone like Jesus he starts a
religion based on this and the problem is that it's
very hard to Pearson this is truth and so everybody
that he's talking about maybe a couple of people will
go and actually do the hard work that he did
to Pearson this truth but most people 99.999% of people
who you tell this to will not do that their
mind is very dogmatic it quickly jumps and passes on
a belief and it says oh that's right I believe
in that I have faith in that I know exactly
what that is it was clearly explained to me I
read it in a book i memorize these scriptures I
practiced this ritual I do this prayer I do this
chanting I do this meditation and therefore I am I
am in this truth but actually you're not an actress
at all that's just a mental word game that you're
playing in your mind and this is the offensive part
because this means that all of your religious beliefs and
all your religious ideas are nonsense they mean absolutely nothing
and they count for absolutely nothing it doesn't matter whether
you're Christian or Buddhist or Islam it doesn't matter all
of this is just belief if you're an atheist that's
also belief if you're a scientist and you believe in
scientific theorems that's also belief so right now you're drawing
fine distinctions between oh well that person he's Islamic so
I don't believe what he believes but I'm Christian so
this is right or screw both those guys you might
say I'm scientific I'm a I'm a scientific minded person
I'm very realistic very hard-nosed that'll bias any of that
mystical nonsense none of those scriptures so it's the science
but in the end all that has something very much
in common and it's the belief structures it's the logic
it's the language and there's something that's much more fundamental
that you're totally missing out while you're doing those little
language games of yours and that's all it is it's
just a language game so every religion basically looks like
this you have this original nugget of truth right here
right what the original profit or founder discovered then what
happens after that is it starts to spread it's an
interesting truth people are caring about it stories get built
rituals get built cultures get built around it societies get
built around it and so it spreads from one to
the next to the next person and it spreads hundreds
thousands hundreds of thousands millions of people as that's happening
what's happening is that you've got the original person who
is after a little bit no longer there he's dead
and then you've got his little messengers running around and
spreading this message and really what they're doing because there's
this two type two type of person and they're all
based in dogma and beliefs that they are just blabber
mouthing it's called blabbermouth arre when you flap your mouth
talking beliefs thinking spots talking language and believing it's so
strongly that you think it's real when in fact none
of it is real at all your thoughts and your
language has no connection to truth truth is something you
directly experience so people start blabbermouth thing and one blabbermouth
to the next to the next to the next to
the next there's a very strong tendency I notice it
myself I like to blabbermouth - I'm gonna be careful
that to hold myself back a lot of people aren't
very careful and they love to blabbermouth I'd love to
blabbermouth it's a very natural human tendency we're very social
creatures so blabber mouth re happens and what happens is
from this original kernel of truth gets built all this
nonsense all this blabbermouth through all this theory and philosophy
gets getting built and built and built rituals get built
traditions get built it all gets built up until there's
this little nugget of truth down here but everything above
it 99% right here is just total nonsense and then
the rest and the majority of the population then work
and live from this area they have no connection whatsoever
to this to this nugget they are living up here
in this cloud of total nonsense and what's worse is
that they really believe that it's true they really believe
that they're really stumbled onto something when in fact you
haven't stumbled onto anything at all and it's really ironic
because the original point of religion was to help to
spread this truth this beautiful profound awesome truth to help
other people see it to spread it but ironically religion
ends up doing the complete opposite because once you start
going down the path of believing in thoughts attaching yourself
to thoughts to beliefs once you go down that road
there's almost no coming back it's very hard to come
back from that and so what religion ends up doing
and I think every religious prophet would agree with this
if they were alive and they really saw what was
going on whether with Christianity with Islam or with Buddhism
anything else they would see and they would they would
really denounce the religion because the religion is doing the
exact opposite thing it's making people dogmatic and closed-minded and
it's keeping people with the rituals and the traditions and
the beliefs that's keeping people from doing the empirical investigation
that's necessary to actually pierce into the truth it's kind
of like if I wanted to go to new to
New York and I'm standing in Los Angeles if I'm
in Los Angeles I want to go to New York
I need to head north and I need to head
east the Northeast direction that will take me to New
York but if I get the wrong map and I
start heading Southwest from Los Angeles I'm not reaching New
York I'm gonna get very very lost I'm going the
exact opposite direction and the best I can hope for
is maybe Australia which is very far from New York
and so this is what's happening to you if you
are taking part in organized religion this is actually what's
happening to you if you are taking part in science
any kind of beliefs will put you in the opposite
direction right now it's hard for you to appreciate this
because you need to do a lot of conscious self
investigation very honestly this is not easy work you need
to do that just to start to see the level
of corruption that's going on in your own belief systems
how fundamentally flawed your understanding is of life and yourself
so back to this point about the religion getting built
right we had these blabbermouth they were talking they they
built this religion within a certain social context so it
was a certain time there were certain cultural traditions so
based on that the religion grew up and every religion
has its own peculiarities its own customs its own things
that it holds as taboo and as evil and it's
bad or it's wrong and so you've got these things
popping up all over the world and then those religions
splintered and factor fractured in many different ways and so
you had this kind of multiplicity and expansion and evolution
of these various religions but in the end they're all
belief based so then you might ask well Leo what
are you talking about here so you got this religious
stuff okay I can kind of maybe see that but
then what is this what is a spiritual experience that
you're talking about what is this spirituality is this some
sort of mystical God is this some sort of afterlife
that you're talking about did you have some sort of
religious experience what are you talking about here and also
aren't you blabbermouth thing right now I mean you said
that it can't be communicated so what are you communicating
here to me what I can say is that it
can't be communicated so I've had some some some little
taste a little taste of what it could be like
to really tap into the truth I've had a little
taste of it it's very powerful it makes me want
to go out there and blabbermouth that's how I know
this stuff happens the way it does because it's very
clear once you once you get to this point you
see it it's pretty clear about how all this stuff
works how these relations get created and that's something that's
very advanced that's something I'm gonna cover in a lot
of videos the reason I'm talking about it here is
not that convey any truth to you I'm not conveying
any truth to you right now anything that I tell
you including this whole video it's a story it's just
a belief you're either gonna believe it or you're not
gonna believe it but whatever you do it's not gonna
help you to see the truth the truth is something
that I can't communicate to you and I'm also in
the process of finding it out for myself so for
me this is not done this is just the beginning
but what this video can help you with is it
can help point you it can help dispel some of
the [ __ ] that has really been pointing you
in the wrong direction it's kind of like me giving
you a better map so right now if you're headed
to Australian you want to get to New York does
the map you're using is not going to do it
but maybe this map that I'm giving you will help
you now don't make the mistake like you usually do
with everything else in your life of assuming that this
map is the territory this map is not the territory
this map is not New York the little the little
path that I drew from LA to New York that's
not actually the path that you're gonna take that's a
conceptualization that's a model that's a belief that's not the
truth the truth is the path that you actually take
the truth is the destination you actually reach it's New
York City when you're in New York City that's when
you're actually there that's what you're experiencing it when you're
looking at New York City on a map or in
a photograph that's not actually in New York City and
that's the whole point here is that you are so
so so busy in your life looking at false images
rather than looking at directly what you're after so you
might ask well what is what is it that I'm
after what is this spiritual truth that you keep alluding
to so vaguely ultimately it's this and again keep in
mind that this is just gonna be a story for
you but it's this the truth is that your ego
you who you think you are yourself but that is
an illusion that that is a fiction created by your
mind and that this is not actually exist in reality
what exists is reality in the present moment without any
mental labels or conceptualizations what exists is something very interesting
the traditional model that we have of perceiver I'm the
perceiver and I'm perceiving something so perceiver perception that model
is not correct there is no perceiver and perception distinction
there is only one substance the perceiver is the perception
and who you think you are your identification with yourself
and with your personal history and your physical body and
your mind and your thoughts and your understanding of the
world that this is a complete fiction and that the
control that you think your thoughts have over your life
is a complete fiction and that the separation that exists
between you and other people and other objects is a
fiction so what does that leave you with that leaves
you with life for you are life life is one
there's been a lot of names and labels for this
and they're just names and labels God infinite consciousness oneness
unity yoga non-duality there's a lot of different labels and
all the different religions and cultures about this but this
is all that they're really alluding to is this now
this is the most threatening thing that you can hear
it doesn't matter whether you're religious or your spiritual type
of person or you meditate or you do yoga or
you fancy yourself an atheist or an agnostic it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter if you don't partake in any
of this philosophical debate if you hear what I'm telling
you it's gonna deeply deeply shock you if you actually
consider the truth of it and you say to yourself
oh man this could be a possibility if you open
your mind to it and you say oh man could
that actually be true is it it sounds far out
there but could it be true if you open yourself
up to that it's very scary in the end the
truth is very beautiful but it's gonna initially be very
scary to you because your ego is scared shitless that
it will be found out the whole problem here is
that you're very very identified with yourself see religions religious
people will say well I really really believe in God
you know I really put my faith in God or
scientific personal say well I really I really put my
you know I really know the truth of this mathematical
equation or this mathematical experiment actually that's not what's going
on there it's very deceptive if you're very keen and
observant what you're gonna find out is what's going on
in all those situations is that you're not really believing
in God's and mathematical equations are sign of experiments what
you're really truly believing in is an ego yourself what
you're really believing in is thoughts and with the spiritual
understanding if you do the direct investigation what you're gonna
find is that who you are who you think you
are right now this body that you think you are
all the experience that you've had in your life all
the stuff that you did all the willpower you have
to control and direct your life that all of that
is not real but it is a thought story it
is a very very elaborate and very very tricky and
sneaky highly deceptive story and it's possible to shed this
thought story and when you do that's when you get
a state of enlightenment that's when you get an awakening
that's what it's called the reason it's called that is
because you raise your consciousness high enough you become so
observant that you see the oneness that is here and
you see that this ego is an illusion as soon
as you see the ego as being the illusion that
it is then something clicks in you and all of
a sudden you expand you expand from this little little
piece of space that you occupied in the universe that
you think you occupy now you expand from that and
suddenly your everything you expand to everything and it's a
very powerful powerful experience and that experience cannot be explained
that experience cannot be detailed no one can force you
to believe it it's not something you have to have
faith in this is something you either experience or you
don't if you don't then you're stuck in this dualistic
way of thinking of really being totally attached your thoughts
your thoughts of who you are your ego your need
to preserve yourself and in the end you don't experience
truth and this creates a lot of suffering in your
life in fact all suffering in your life is created
from this very core very fundamental problem and this is
your first time hearing this then it's probably gonna offend
you shock you make you outraged notice that notice what's
happening there notice that there's a voice inside your head
doing a lot of talking right now coming up with
a lot of counter points a lot of arguments a
lot of reasons a lot of evidence a lot of
good logic about why this can't be the case also
notice the voice inside you saying but Leo how are
you telling me all this you're telling me that all
these beliefs are false but yet you're you're out here
you're talking you're communicating all these beliefs that's right but
I'm not telling you to take my words at face
value my words are not what's true my words are
just a map for you if you want and if
you want to pursue this investigation further then this is
what's going to put you on the right track the
empirical approach the shedding of all your beliefs the shedding
of all the different things that you think you know
the real questioning of how much you can attain through
thought through law through logic and through language I want
to shoot a lot more videos on this topic because
it's a very advanced topic and as I'm progressing I
consider myself right now a newbie in this area as
I'm progressing I want to maybe throw some stuff out
there that will help you progress too I can never
do it for you nothing I say will ever be
the truth for you but it can point you in
the right direction and what's important for you is to
not mistake my pointers for the truth not get caught
in this trap because this trap is extremely tricky and
this whole exercise of doing careful observation it's all about
seeing the deception that is going on in your own
mind because that is all that it is it's a
very simple deception the truth is right there and right
in front of you right before your eyes right now
if you want to you could see it right now
if you got rid of the deceptions but in practice
getting rid of those deceptions is very difficult so that's
something that requires a lot of discipline this is something
that requires extreme extreme self honesty when I first heard
about this I read I was reading a book and
I first started to get a sense that this could
be a possibility because I myself was an atheist for
a long time didn't really care about religions then really
believed that nonsense of religions considered myself on the right
path I did a lot of study with philosophy so
I've studied all this stuff and was very fascinating to
me in my youth but then later just a few
years ago when I started to read this stuff and
I got a sense that this is a possibility this
ego thing this ego deception is a possibility I literally
like that week I spent a-- I spent some days
lying on my couch in a fetal position literally in
a in a like a cloud of depression because of
this and that is an ego defense mechanism as well
so your ego will do everything everything in its power
this could be the most emotionally challenging thing you've ever
done in your life your ego will do absolutely everything
to deceive you of your current truth it will do
absolutely everything to make sure that your current paradigm stays
in place and you have to be extremely self-absorbed and
extremely open-minded to spot these deceptions that your ego is
creating all the time it's creating it all the time
every single minute of your life this is happening I'm
gonna show you a lot more video on this stuff
so if this hopefully piqued your interest then join me
sign up and more will come as I discover more
of myself for now this is it I'm gonna be
signing off is what I have to say about spirituality
what it is and some comparisons to religion go ahead

hear from you and then also please like this share

free content I can post for you guys and finally

that I'm releasing to my subscribers every single week we
build into this extremely advanced topic of spirituality but besides
this really my bread and butter is helping you to
design an extraordinary life I think spirituality can be a
very powerful component it's the most powerful component if you
actually get there but a lot of people will not
be ready to go there quite yet a lot of
people just simply need to work on their psychology work
on their neurotic thinking work on their negative thinking work
on their depression work on their anger problems weird on
their money problems work on their health problems and I've
got a lot of mindsets that will help you to
do that I'm very results oriented so this is kind
of an atypical video for me because with this I'm
not focused on results with this I'm focused on so
having you see the truth with my other videos I'm
more focused on getting you practical results that help you
to create an extraordinary life so if you're interesting that
stuff sign up and you'll be all set on track
