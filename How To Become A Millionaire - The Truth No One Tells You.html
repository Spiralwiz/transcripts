hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to tell you how to become a
millionaire alright let's talk about how to become a millionaire
and I'm not going to talk about some gimmick or
some get-rich-quick scheme or some sort of cheat for how
to become a millionaire what I'm going to talk about
is something that you need to know in order to
actually become a millionaire this video is intended for someone
who's actually serious about it none not a dreamer not
someone who's looking to win the lottery but someone who
wants to be a real millionaire for me that has
been a goal and I'm going to achieve that goal
in my life I'm confident that I will I haven't
yet and to get there I've done a lot of
studying about what it takes to get there and there
are some very core principles that millionaires operate on that
the rest of the world doesn't it's generally safe to
assume that if you do what the majority of people
do then you're going to get the results the majority
people get and I don't know if you've looked around
but the majority people are not millionaires and that is
not because of luck that is not because they weren't
born into the right family that is not because they
don't have the right connections that is because they are
not following the proper principles for how to become a
millionaire so when you start to get these in line
and then you go out and you work them you
have to work them there's no magic pill you have
to work them really hard when you know the principles
and you work them really hard then your chance to
become a millionaire increase exponentially and it's pretty much guaranteed
that if you want to become a millionaire and you
really work towards it that you will become one in
your lifetime so let's talk about how to actually do
it not the the real principles involved so first of
all the first principle is that there are no secrets
there are no shortcuts there are no gimmicks and that
luck is not a factor all right a millionaire is
someone who is a boss and by boss I mean
not just in lawyer of people but I mean a
bosses in the sense of he or she has has
power has authority over themselves right they are in control
a millionaire's in control of his own mind and he
does not buy into this idea that somehow by luck
he's going to become wealthy and successful no definitely not
if you've coming from that mindset then that's pretty much
an end to it right there that guarantees that you
will never become a millionaire or even if you do
by fluke luck you're going to lose all that money
anyways so it's going to be of no value to
you to become a millionaire what you need to do
is is really be serious with yourself how wealthy are
you right now if you're coming from a middle-class background
or a lower middle-class background or even poverty if you're
coming from a place where millions of dollars seem like
oh my god that's amazing it's impossible to even dream
of that that would be a dream come true if
you're coming from that kind of place then then here's
what you're going to need you're going to need radical
self growth to become a millionaire this is what's going
to be required I'm going to talk about some business
aspects later in this video so this video is not
just about personal growth but personal growth is the core
of it the reason you're not a millionaire and the
reason that you're never going to become a millionaire doing
what you're doing right now is because basically you're not
resourceful enough your psychology is not going to permit you
to do it you have too many limiting beliefs you
have too much social conditioning you have you have a
groove that you're kind of set yourself in financially and
in other ways in your life and basically you're going
to run along that groove and to become a millionaire
let's face it if you're earning let's say fifty thousand
dollars a year right now it's kind of an average
salary or even if you're earning a hundred thousand dollars
a year well I mean that's nice but if you're
at that place then that's that's ten to twenty fold
of an increase you need just to reach a million
dollars that's not going to happen through just a series
of promotions you're not just going to get promoted and
become a millionaire one day almost guarantee that it's not
going to happen to reach the status of millionaire you
need to reach millions of dollars to reach millions of
dollars you need to start doing something radically different with
your life and to be able to do something radically
different with your life that means you need to be
able to do something radically different with your life most
people can't do that because their psychology won't permit them
it's their mindsets it's not even so much about you
know the work that they're doing out in the world
because a millionaire does the same kind of work that
a that a non millionaire does except that a millionaire
has all different slew of mindsets and habits and practices
that are completely a completely night and day from what
the average person is doing with their life so first
of all I want you to completely forget about outer
circumstances I want you to completely forget about the economy
the lack of money that you currently have luck any
lack of education that you have any kind of lack
of social status or social connections any kind of limitations
you might feel from the family or the country that
you grew up in or the the bad boss that
you have or the mayors that you're in or the
the relationship that's holding you back or that that bad
childhood event that you had all of it has to
go you could not be a victim and be a
millionaire at the same time you have to choose one
or the other most people are not millionaires simply for
this reason is because they cast themselves as victims they
don't take full responsibility you need to take full and
utter responsibility for absolutely everything in your life not just
money but especially money especially career and especially business because
those are actually what's going to create millions of dollars
but you need to take responsibility for the other aspects
as well and you need to take responsibility for all
your negative thoughts for all your neurotic behaviors for all
the ways in which you get angry and upset and
fearful you can't you can't keep those as excuses because
you have to work on every one of those parts
of your life in order to raise yourself up to
earn millions of dollars in a sustainable way so you're
going to have to work really hard on yourself is
where people make a mistake is that they think that
they're going to work really hard on their job they're
going to work really hard on their career and that's
going to produce millions of dollars well the problem is
that most people can work till they're blue in the
face on their career for decades and they'll still never
be millionaires and that the reason is is not because
their career doesn't have the potential to earn the millions
of dollars it actually does most careers if you structure
them properly and you come at them with the right
thinking can produce millions of dollars except most people are
not equipped with the mindsets they need in order to
capitalize on that so they're never going to actually go
out there and do it right so working at your
job harder that's not how you become a millionaire that's
a trap all right now I'm not saying you should
quit your job right now I'm not saying that you
need to go slack off at your job I'm not
saying that you shouldn't study and be better at your
job and do it excellently you should but just realize
that to become a millionaire is going to take something
a lot more it's the mindsets here's the thing is
that you have a thermostat in your brain that actually
has a set point for what you're earning per year
it's not the external circumstances it's the inside where you
have this little subconscious thermostat level which has you pegged
somewhere it's got you pegged at 20,000 a year 50,000
a year 70,000 a year a hundred thousand whatever is
that you're making and you have to assume you're going
to stay at that level if you want to shift
that thermostat you're going to have to do some internal
work right stuff is going to have to happen and
radical stuff radical because you can't get from fifty thousand
a year to a millionaire that's like it's not going
to happen if you don't be serious with yourself and
tell yourself that you know something really major has to
change with your life and it's kind of changed on
the inside first so what you got to start to
understand is that millionaires have a different mindset and a
different philosophy and they take philosophy serious they take their
mindsets very seriously they take their own personal growth very
seriously what they do is they fundamentally work on themselves
to make themselves more resourceful so that then they can
go and create value for the world a millionaire is
going to value education he's going to be a lifelong
learner right critical for being a self-made millionaire beliefs a
millionaire is going to have very healthy empowering beliefs about
money about success about his own ability to control circumstances
around him right he has to feel empowered you can't
just go out there and eight an extraordinary business or
generate some sort of product or do something good for
the world that's going to generate a lot of value
and bring you money back in return you can't do
that if you feel like you're a victim and you
have no control so you need to start to work
on your beliefs if you have beliefs around scarcity lack
of money how money is evil how how corporations and
businesses are evil how the only people that are rich
are the ones that have scammed others and have done
something nefarious you know if you have these kinds of
mindsets then you're basically you're never going to become a
millionaire because you are you are so stuck in your
limiting beliefs that they're not that you simply can't I
mean could you imagine being a millionaire and thinking all
those things it would be so incompatible your self-image would
be so incompatible with your external circumstances that there would
be just complete discord and you would basically drive yourself
nuts and you would you know something catastrophic would happen
basically you would have to you would lose all that
money is what would happen you your subconscious mind would
sabotage in such a way that you would lose that
money because it would be too painful for you to
hold on to it while you're preserving these beliefs so
something has to go either the beliefs have to go
or you are going to stay where you're at but
you're not going to have the millions of dollars personally
I would much rather have millions of dollars then hold
on to shitty beliefs so I do everything I can
to eradicate every single last strand of negative limiting belief
that I have in myself I work very very hard
to do that because I know that I need to
to become a millionaire next is that we already talked
about millionaire need to take responsibilities that's very important but
a millionaire also has to have purpose we're not just
making you a millionaire just so that you have money
that's not how a millionaire gets made a self-made millionaire
doesn't become a self-made millionaire money right it's not a
valid motive not a valid reason usually millionaires and entrepreneurs
they're actually very focused on the world they're focused on
what they can do for the world they have some
sort of drive some sort of passion there's something they
love to do and there's some way in which they
love to influence the world because as a millionaire as
a business owner if you have a popular or successful
career that it's you that it gives you a 40
that gives you impact and you should use that for
some sort of greater good the reason that you should
do that is not simply because you're helping the world
oh that's niiiiice reason but because it's going to motivate
you to become a millionaire you have to work your
ass off you're going to work harder than you've ever
worked in your life not just on the externals and
on your business but also on the inside you have
to work really really hard on the inside and to
to have the motivation and the perseverance to do that
to have the willpower to go through that whole journey
of massive self growth you're going to have to have
a deeper purpose money is not going to be sufficient
money's never going to motivate you enough do all that
so life purpose very important I have other videos that
talk about that and the last one I'd probably make
about philosophy is that a millionaire is a very independent-minded
he cannot be hemmed in by what the market tells
him he cannot be hemmed in by what his family
is telling him he cannot be hemmed in by what
society is telling him by what the economy is telling
him right a Millionaire has to bust through that because
the obstacles to create a business that will earn you
that much money is a is gonna is going to
require you to be an independent or a critical thinker
be a bit of a maverick and a rebel so
that's also part of the philosophy be a millionaire so
you have to start to embrace that right stop relying
on the people to give you answers giving you easy
answers stop looking for easy stuff Amelia Nair goes out
there and he embraces the challenge of it any thinks
for himself I have another video on critical thinking that
would dovetail nicely here so you can watch that if
you just search for it so now we've got a
little bit of the mindset out of the way a
little bit of the philosophy now what does it actually
take on a practical level to start to earn lots
and lots of money right because this is not some
airy-fairy notion this is very concrete you need to have
seven digits in your bank account how do you get
there well this goes back to the point of the
fact that you can't really get there by by just
working harder at your current job if you're working a
nine-to-five job very few nine-to-five jobs will allow you to
rise to millionaire status very very few only if you
rise to to a CEO position or some sort of
very high-level management position within a large corporation can you
be earning that kind of money so the other option
then is to become self-employed that's basically what you have
to do you have to become an entrepreneur a business
owner or become self-employed now there's different classes of millionaires
out in the world some millionaires start businesses right they
start corporations it could be a small corporation of five
people could be a larger corporation of twenty people a
hundred people tens of thousands of people so there's a
whole spectrum and you can basically be earning millions of
dollars anywhere along in that that whole scale of sizes
but that's not the only way to become a millionaire
I mean you can become a millionaire just being a
one-man shop this is what a lot of celebrities do
this is what a lot of artists musicians do uh
bloggers people who own internet businesses a lot of these
types of businesses nowadays can be one-man shops where you
basically do everything and then you maybe outsource certain things
to other people you have a couple of assistants maybe
helping you but basically your business is you especially with
someone like a celebrity or an athlete right that's what
they're doing is they're they're making a business out of
their life and in that case you can you could
make a lot of money doing that in fact celebrities
are some of the some of the the most highly
paid people in the world compared to let's say a
CEO you know see most CEOs will never match the
kind of money that a celebrity will pull in or
the kind of money that a really big athlete or
a musician will pull it so that's also a very
valid path right you can become an author you can
become a celebrity a musician so if you're more artistic
then those things can can work really well for you
but either way you have to become self-employed it's not
going to work staying at your job this is another
reason why most people will never become millionaires because they
are too afraid to leave their job and they're too
afraid to face the risk of not having money to
pay the bills because it is challenging this is something
that I went through I'm self-employed and I finance independent
now but it is a real challenge to make that
transition from having a 95 stable career to then working
for yourself and having to worry about all that stuff
yourself see what a lot of people don't realize when
they're working a kind of a corporate job they don't
realize how much of the the really challenging stuff is
being done by the leaders of the organization or how
much of it has already been done you know decades
and decades ago by the original founders now they're just
kind of coasting on the company's success and they're just
typing away their computer and they can expect to get
a paycheck well when you become self-employed you quickly realize
that it doesn't work that way when you're self-employed it's
all about value how much value can give the other
person you're going to start to worry about Val you're
going to start to worry about legal issues marketing issues
you know logistical problems employment problems so all these sorts
of business issues basically all of them come into play
you have to worry about economics and paychecks and so
it's it's it's quite a lot to take on that's
stuff you have to worry about on top of whatever
work you're doing so that's that's all adding on top
of the workload that you've already got and it can
be really challenging to go through that stuff that's why
most people will never do it but the upside is
that if you do do it then you can position
yourself very nicely to be earning a lot more than
you would have if you would've been working at that
nine-to-five so right now if you're working a nine-to-five and
you really haven't rima become a millionaire you have to
start asking yourself okay how do I make the transition
you know start to look for different strategies and techniques
that you can use and opportunities that you can use
to start to move yourself out of that I'm going
to have more videos on that that's a very interesting
a fascinating topic I'll share my own experiences with how
I did that and you know the pros and cons
of the various approaches for how to do that but
you have to start keeping an eye out for it
because your nine-to-five is not going to do it and
the last the last principle that I'm going to give
you is the idea that you need to be generating
lots and lots of value in the market place to
be earning lots of money so you're not going to
become a millionaire by by by doing something that's low
value right high value means high return low value low
return that means if you're creating a product or a
service or you're writing a book or you're performing at
a concert or whatever is your you know your line
of work your business whatever is that you're doing that
has to have big influence on a large number of
people the more people you can influence with your work
and the more powerful your work is the more people
love your work the more remarkable your work is the
more chances you have of generating that massive value you
need in order to charge people enough money to be
getting millions of dollars back in return so this is
kind of a trend true principle of of wealth and
wealth building is that value equals wealth so what are
you putting out as far as value into the marketplace
I have another video that that's called how to become
rich you might want to check that one out where
I talk about more about how to increase the amount
of value that you're putting out but either way as
a millionaire your eye is always going to be on
value how do you create more value for the world
how do you create more value for your customer base
for your fan base that's what you got to work
towards that's what you got to think about when you're
an entrepreneur all right so those are the fundamentals these
are the rock-solid fundamental to becoming a millionaire you're not
going to get there through some sort of you know
lucrative investment lucky investment some secret stocked stock tip or
winning some lottery if you're very serious about becoming a
millionaire then you have to adopt all these ideas that
I told you if to go out and find even
more because I'm just barely scratch the surface but you
have to you have to take this you have to
embody it you have to start to live it you
have to work on yourself and then you have to
transition yourself out of your job into a business right
