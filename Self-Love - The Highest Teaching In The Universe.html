[Music] it's been almost seven years since I began releasing
personal development content videos this whole actualized org business and
in those seven years I was on this journey to
discover for myself how reality works what personal development is
what are the best ways to do it what are
the most effective teachings what does it all mean what
does all boil down to because when I began this
journey even of course much earlier than seven years ago
seven years ago I was just started to teach you
guys but before that when I was just trying to
figure out life for myself the big question was like
what are the principles that I need to learn to
get the kind of life that I want and it
seemed like there were so many different directions that we
could go in like we could pursue money we could
pursue inner self-esteem work we could pursue shadow work or
we could do therapy or we could do NLP or
we can do psychedelics or we can do meditation or
we could do yoga or we could like there's so
many things to do so how do you make sense
of all of that and so just recently in the
last couple of weeks I really have found for myself
what it all boils down to what the highest teaching
is this is the highest teaching in the whole universe
I've boiled it down to one single phrase it's so
simple it's shockingly simple and it unifies everything so what
is this highest teaching it's self - love self love
but this is no ordinary self love as you think
of it I'm gonna have to explain what this really
means because when you compress all of human development and
not just human development but all development of all conscious
beings in the entire universe when you compress that entire
that entire mission so to speak into a two-word phrase
self love of course a lot is lost a lot
of the detail is lost it's necessarily very high level
and very abstract and you don't know what to do
with it so I need to explain to you what
to do with it how to decipher it we got
to break this down that's what we'll be doing in
this episode but self-love I'm talking about capital uppercase s
self and capital uppercase L love so capital self capital
L love got it so if all of actualize that
our teachings could be distilled to one teaching this would
be it if you understood this one teaching properly you
would be able to derive all the other teachings and
understand how they fit in and what function they have
or you would understand that some of them are extraneous
and useless of course over the last seven years I've
gone through a whole inner journey of understanding reality and
every week basically for the last seven years my understanding
of reality has been growing and changing and radically transforming
which is why sometimes people accuse me of oleo why
do you contradict yourself so much well the reason is
is because I'm constantly growing so I'm not afraid to
admit making mistakes and saying things that are wrong and
changing my mind later because I would rather be right
in the end rather than insist that I was right
from the beginning you see so if you go back
seven years and watch my early stuff it's gonna feel
very different it's gonna sound very different and certain things
that I say are no longer applicable from the stand
point that I'm at now but also what I understand
is that I can only have gotten to where I
am now I can only have reached this sort of
pinnacle of understanding how it all boils down to self-love
by having gone through that process and making all of
those mistakes and you will - and every living conscious
being will of course they won't all make the same
mistakes I've made we all make our own individual mistakes
some of us make a lot more than another okay
and some of us are much more stubborn about cling
to our mistakes rather than admitting we were wrong so
of course but you're gonna have to go through this
process this is not something you can just avoid and
even though I'm gonna tell you the ultimate answer self-love
you can't just take that and now go run with
it and live your whole life with it not really
because what your life is is the actualization and the
realization of what self-love means and why it's important and
why it all boils down to this and not something
else and this is rather shocking because you know if
I traveled back in time and told my old seven-year-old
self I mean seven years ago not seven years old
just seven years ago if I told myself that I
would be teaching self-love and that's all that this will
boil down to my old self would have said no
way this is some sort of hippie dippie airy-fairy new
AG's nonsense it's not practical it's not realistic how is
this really gonna address all the problems people have what
have you been smoking I would have told myself that
because I had to go through the process it's it's
a huge process and you will too but also it's
helpful for you to understand that this is how it
is and I told you so so in 10 years
and 20 years when you finally figure it all out
if you get that far even you'll realize I told
you so and this will be helpful because maybe it'll
speed up your process so here's an interesting thought experiment
for you imagine that mankind makes contact with a highly
advanced highly intelligent alien species ask yourself what do you
think this species would teach mankind let's say we had
limited time limited bandwidth what would be the most important
thing that they could teach us now many materialists and
scientists like to go to some sort of gadgetry or
technology or some sort of technical scientific knowledge like well
they could teach us how to build a warp drive
and travel faster than light that would be a game-changer
or they would teach us what how to create super
smart AI that we could use to improve our life
or they would teach us how to cure cancer or
something like this but that's not what they would teach
us if they taught us that they would be a
rather unintelligent alien species because all of that stuff it
seems important if you're looking at reality from sort of
materialistic paradigm and you're bought into this technological fantasy this
tech utopia where we just have more technology that solves
all our problems but what you don't realize that it
doesn't solve anything because the underlying problem is a lack
of self-love a lack of understanding of what self-love is
so what I'm proposing is that if we ever make
contact with such an intelligent species and I don't I
don't claim that we will or we won't I'm agnostic
about that I've never met any aliens myself yet but
uh I mean it's reasonable that they're out there but
if we meet them the funny thing is is that
now I'm conscious enough to understand what they would teach
us self-love because that's what we're lacking the most and
because that is the ultimate lesson of the universe not
just for humans right what I'm talking about here is
much more profound than just simply some feel-good emotion for
humans that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about
an existential force that drives all of evolution every species
in the entire universe and other universes if they exist
beyond our own multiverses whatever else and what I'm telling
you is that you can become conscious of this for
yourself you have to believe me this is something you
will discover I'm just giving you a preview of what
you will discover and anyways the more intelligent these aliens
would be the more they would stress the importance of
self-love now it seems kind of weird and in fact
us humans you can you can almost imagine that imagine
sort of a movie scenario this would actually be a
really interesting kind of a movie scenario where humans make
contact with aliens for a brief time and these aliens
deliver this most important of messages but then the humans
you know and the aliens say here's our most important
advice for you the humans they receive this advice and
then the scientists they look at it like what is
this self-love now this can't this can't possibly be their
advice what kind of advice is this this is this
doesn't help us they're supposed to tell us about warp
engines and things and then they throw it in the
trash and they don't even communicate that message to the
rest of society you see this is the problem when
you run this through the materialist paradigm filters it takes
already a fairly high degree of development and consciousness to
be able to even appreciate such a teaching and not
to dismiss it as some sort of fluff but of
course interestingly you know this is not only a thought
experiment there actually are people who claim to have made
contact with entities and aliens through for example smoking and
nvm t and if you read their trip reports and
you talk to them about their life transforming experiences very
consistently what they report is that these entities that they
meet their greatest message is self-love is that just a
fantasy is that just a hallucination well don't believe them
don't believe me go check it out for yourself verify
for yourself it's not hard to verify this stuff if
you're really interested I mean after all when people make
such extravagant claims don't just sit there on your ass
and play the lazy skeptic where you're just skeptical about
everything because it doesn't sound plausible to you go try
it you see there's a big difference between making bold
outrageous assertions about life and reality which are unverifiable and
no method of verification is given versus other bold and
outrageous claims which of course I make a lot of
I make a lot of outrageous claims you know I
tell you that you you're immortal but what I also
tell you is I tell you that you can verify
it for yourself and I give you the methods that
you can use of course most of you guys don't
use these methods because they're difficult to use you can't
just go and do something for five minutes and then
you're done although of course actually in this case with
nn DMT you can literally you can go smoke it
into five minutes you can find out whether this is
real or not go find out if you if you
dare or let's just keep talking more about self-love you
know you don't have to do it if you don't
want to anyways so the only way that an alien
can be more intelligent than you is if it understands
self-love deeper than you if you understand self-love deeper than
an alien you're more intelligent than that alien you should
be teaching it not it teaching you but see us
humans worse or so poor at understanding and appreciating self-love
and practicing self-love that if we ever did meet some
some intelligent aliens if chances are very good that they
would understand self-love much much much deeper than we do
which is actually an interesting little practical rule of thumb
that you can use for this your life how do
you judge the quality of a teacher or a teaching
you know there's a lot of different teachings and teachers
out there who do you trust which books should you
read and which ones should you believe and which ones
aren't which ones are the good gurus and which ones
are the bad gurus how do you know which ideologies
are the good ones and which ones are the bad
ones it's very easy to determine simply by the degree
of self-love in that teaching rate the degree of self-love
in this teaching on a scale of 0 to 10
so we can take fascism we can take old-school Soviet
Communism we can take Nazism we can take white nationalism
we can take capitalism we can take socialism we can
take various kinds of ideologies various cults so we can
see Christianity we can take Buddhism we can kind of
put them arrange them all on a spectrum we can
take science but science in their biology chemistry physics all
that put it on a spectrum and give each one
a rating and see how they all line up and
what you're going to discover is the truest and highest
ones have the most self-love and promote the most self-love
and of course not necessarily in those words and I'll
explain what self-love means here in a lot of detail
in a minute I'm holding back a little bit to
tease you so so yeah we can arrange it like
that and then in this way you can you can
find very quickly what the highest teachings are and but
you don't need to be some sort of like scientist
who rates these systems you know you don't need to
be so scientific about your rating scale you can just
feel it literally you can feel it in your body
with your heart if you want you can just read
a teach and read a book listen to a teacher
and just ask yourself what's the degree of self-love of
this teacher and teaching not just in words but also
in speech in action in the way that they hold
themselves the way they carry themselves in all aspects of
their life in their relationships and their business and their
money-making and in their sex life all that and you
will get a really good sense of how pure this
teacher is to a degree which to which self-love is
lacking or any judgment or hatred is present in the
teachings that betrays the corruption of the teacher or the
teaching so you can look at something like Nazism you
can read Hitler's biography and and his autobiography read through
his teachings and listen to and then just ask yourself
is this coming for a place of self-love how much
so and of course you'll see that it isn't which
is why it's a problematic ideology and if you go
and you look at some waha beast a radical Islamic
ideology you'll also see the same thing is it coming
from a place of self love and you'll clearly see
that it's not see now of course it's a little
bit tricky because sometimes like for example with Christianity with
Catholicism for example they like to preach about love and
love is written in their Bible in certain parts at
least certain parts not so much probably more than the
New Testament they like to preach about you know Jesus
love and O's and so forth so in this sense
you might say oh well Christianity is the highest teaching
well in a certain sense it is in that sense
but there's still a problem because words are cheap it's
really easy to talk a big game about self-love but
then are you actually practicing it most Christians mouth Catholics
even most priests and Cardinals are pretty poor in the
implementation of the self love which is why there's corruption
and problems in the Catholic Church that's the corruption and
to the degree in which a religious teaching has any
judgment or hatred within it whatsoever hatred of gays hatred
of Jews hatred of Muslims hatred of Christians hatred of
Buddhists hatred of of poor people hatred of rich people
hatred of mm-hmm sick people judgment of criminals damning them
to hell and so forth or even hatred of witches
hatred of witchcraft and the occult fear of these things
of course hatred and judgment go hand in hand with
fear fear of any of these things if it's present
in one of these spiritual teachings that's your clue that
is a corrupted teaching maybe it was pure at some
point maybe it was a pure teaching when it came
out of Jesus's mouth 2,000 years ago but it ain't
anymore it got corrupted and that's how you know it
got corrupted really really handy rule of thumb so let's
return to this question of self love I guess the
question is how do you apply it because it's so
abstract and so compact it's hard to apply because of
this but believe it or not and here's my bold
outrageous claim which you can try to test for yourself
to see if it's true that all of mankind's problems
ultimately stem back to a lack of self-love but what
does this really mean how could this be the case
it seems like it's so impractical to say this it
sounds airy-fairy it sounds new agey it sounds like well
leo but you know the people in the Congo starving
children in the Congo you know they don't need self-love
what they need is food what they need is vaccines
what they need is a better economy they need practical
things they need technology they need clean running water this
is what they need not your [ __ ] self
love they can't live off self love but see here
now we're gonna try to define what self love is
self love is a much more robust notion than you
think remember capital s self and capital L love so
we're talking about the ultimate self not yourself as a
human identity I'm not saying that you need to love
yourself as Leo or whatever you are as a man
or as a woman or as black or as white
I'm saying you got to love yourself as the self
that you really are the awakened self which is the
entire universe so if you do that then all the
other problems will autocorrect themselves and I'll show you in
a lot of practical detail in a minute how that
works with specific examples right so I'm not just gonna
be bullshitting you here but first a little bit more
of the sort of the abstract theory so self love
has two components self and love so the two most
important aspects of understanding and implementing rather self love is
to understand what self and love actually are you need
to actually be conscious of what these things are to
understand them and you can't from your current state of
consciousness you can't do that from your current state of
consciousness you can't do that through thinking you can't do
it through reason and you can't do it through logic
and you can't do it through science not the materialistic
science that we all commonly know so the most important
element for implementing an actual izing self-love is to have
a proper definition of what self and love are and
see that is the first step and already everyone almost
everyone the plan has failed at step number one so
they can't go any further and they can't implement it
which is why it's so important to spend a lot
of time talking about what is the true self and
what is love of the capital l but of course
talking about is not nearly going to be enough really
what's required is a direct mystical experience of the true
self and love with capital l you need these two
distinct mystical experiences these are two facets of awakening I've
talked about that in my episode about many fast the
many facets of awakening these are just two there's more
than two but these are the two you need these
are the two crucial ones that you need of course
you could have them simultaneously together as one glorious insight
where they're fused into one because they are the same
thing ultimately but also you can see them as two
separate things you could glimpse one then the other and
vice verse and then you can glue them together and
and see how they interact and so forth see so
look with what with with the stuff that I teach
now it's it's so advanced that it it's just it
won't it won't change your life unless you have these
mystical experiences right so the reason I'm stressing this so
much is because I know that many of you are
watching and you're like you're trying to get it you're
trying to figure it out but you're just you're spinning
your wheels in the mud because you're lacking these mystical
experiences and nothing can substitute for these mystical experiences you
need a mystical experience of self and even mystical experience
of love then come back and you will understand what
I'm talking about and there will still be plenty more
to talk about and plenty more for you to understand
you're not gonna be done but you need at least
a glimpse of that right to start to take these
things I say seriously then they'll start to make sense
for you and then the real work begins the real
work then begins in embodying it and starting to apply
it in your life so I wish there was some
way that I could deliver these mystical insights to you
through a video or through speech or through writing but
it's just not possible all right so you're gonna have
to go do that I've given you many techniques in
the past for how to do it psychedelics yoga meditation
contemplation there is breathing techniques pranayamas and shamanic breathing and
so forth these might work some of these work better
than others you'd have to experiment and find what works
for you but now we're moving on because I can't
deliver the mystical experience to you here right now so
we're moving on with theory and actually now we're getting
two examples here are some examples of how self love
solves all problems let's take a look for example at
insecurity now these problems I'm gonna be listing here these
are some of the most common problems that people have
in personal development ordinary I'm not talking about spiritual lofty
stuff I'm not talking about enlightenment stuff now I'm just
talking about ordinary life the kind of videos you want
to see more of for me the very practical stuff
like Leo how do I get over my physical appearance
I don't like my physical appearance and I don't feel
secure and confident in myself Leo how do I get
over having a small dick because I don't feel secure
and my dick isn't as big as I want it
to be or Leo you know I have low self-esteem
and because this I keep getting into bad relationships or
Leo I'm not confident I'm shy how do i how
do I become confident around people and stop being so
shy how do I stop being so introverted and be
more extroverted how do I get better at attracting women
Leo how do I attract that husband that I want
that nice you know high-quality stable man in my life
who's not just gonna leave me for some bimbo how
do i how do I find that guy Leo how
do I manage my disagreements with people in my family
we keep fighting with each other Leo what about my
intimate relationship I keep getting into bad relationships and nothing
keeps working and my partner doesn't listen to me and
he's abusive to me and these sorts of problems right
so what I'm saying is that these the solution to
all of these is ultimately self-love so how does that
work well it's a little bit more obvious with insecurity
or low self-esteem for example literally low self-esteem is a
lack of love of yourself that's literally what it is
if you're worried about your physical appearance you think your
nose is too big your teeth are too crooked or
you don't like some freckle on your face or whatever
it is some feature of your body most of us
you know have something about our bodies that we wish
was better and then we live with that for a
whole life and we suffer through it every time we
look in the mirror it's like oh man my nose
my eyes my ears are too long or whatever it
is for you hair isn't the way you want it
to be luckily I don't have that problem so in
this case how do you apply self-love well you see
you're never gonna fix your low self-esteem externally you're never
gonna fix your confidence problem or your physical appearance problem
by changing your nose changing your ears changing your hair
I mean you can try and people do do that
but it doesn't ultimately work because even if you fix
one thing there's still gonna be something else about you
that you can't fix you can't fix everything even if
you get a nose job there's gonna be something about
you you can't change see and even if you do
change it and even if it looks good now okay
maybe you do a lot of cosmetic work on your
face you spend thousands of dollars doing this stuff and
then you're like well Leah look I improve myself and
now I have high self-esteem because finally I look the
way I should okay but what happens in 20 years
when you lose your good looks due to just natural
aging what happens if you get in a car accident
and suffer some scar what if you get some disease
that creates some you know disfigurement in your body or
in your face what what then then you're you're shattered
you see you're shattered you're gonna be lower than you
were when you started because there are going to be
situations in life where you can't change it some things
you can change but a lot of things you can't
change and up to this point in your life you've
been playing the game of manipulating life to get the
stuff that you want and then creating happiness that way
but this is a fool's errand you can't always win
with this strategy in fact you're guaranteed to lose right
so if you really want to address the issue of
low self-esteem are you tired of having low self-esteem are
you tired of worrying about your physical appearance every time
you look in the mirror are you tired of not
being confident around people because you worry that you're too
short or that you're too hairy or that whatever you're
too bald and because of this you can't talk to
that girl you want to talk to she she rejects
you and this is how you feel and you don't
feel good because when you go and you try on
clothes at the at the department store you're putting on
jeans but they look fat on you because you're worried
about your weight and all this sort of stuff and
it's just you're going through this and this is been
happening to your whole life basically see then not only
that but then you judge other people as well and
then that creates suffering for you as well because it's
not only that you think that other people judge you
for being fat or being ugly you yourself judge other
people for being fat and being ugly or whatever which
of course these are two sides of the same coin
if you didn't shut others you wouldn't judge yourself and
if you'd enjoyed yourself you wouldn't judge others so here
what's necessary to really address this issue at the root
is to really accept yourself start to accept yourself and
not just accept yourself but to realize the beauty of
what you are this machine is biological machine matter of
consciousness that you are that you can see in the
mirror when you see your reflection this is an amazing
creation it's an amazing thing but you overlook it because
you're so busy with with these social games that you
want to play see so here self-love is the answer
but of course you're not just loving yourself as a
human body that's of course a good starting place and
you know you could actually literally practices you could stand
in front of a mirror for five minutes every morning
for the next month and just look at yourself in
the mirror and just fall in love with yourself that's
a good exercise practice that but beyond that to really
fulfill the actualization of self-love here you're gonna have to
fall in love not just with your physical body cuz
that's a small part of yourself that's not the true
self that's a part of the self but that's just
a tiny piece of it the true self is the
entire universe so literally when we're talking about self-love we're
talking about falling in love with the entire universe as
it is not as you fantasize it to be but
as it is that of course includes your body but
that includes the body of your spouse the body of
your girlfriend or your boyfriend and not just their body
but their personality how they are and not just that
but country's political parties love that too because these countries
and political parties are also part of the cell they're
part of the universe just replace the word self with
the word universe he's it a part of the universe
while everything is by definition then that is you that
is the true self so love that and what does
it mean to love that it means to look at
it and to appreciate its beauty to accept it not
only to accept it but to embrace it and to
recognize and to become conscious of how amazing it is
how magical it is that this thing exists and that
this thing is you really what you're doing as you're
practicing self-love it's sort of like we're taking the same
situation that's happening in the mirror every morning you know
when you look at yourself um you know maybe sometimes
you look in the mirror and you say oh I
look I look good today I look handsome I look
attractive I look sexy whatever and all my ass looks
good my muscles look good my my face you know
my my beard looks good today I've done my hair
it looks nice today you know that and then for
a brief moment you like yourself maybe you even love
yourself for a brief moment well what I'm saying is
that that we're kind of get that little sliver of
love that you normally feel once a month or whatever
in your life for a brief you know second or
for a minute we're taking that or like for example
when when someone pays you a compliment maybe some attractive
person finds you attractive and they say oh I like
your purse I like your shoes I like your you
know well you know people give give you couple it
and then when you get that compliment you feel really
good because you know you can love yourself because they
gave a little love to you well that we're taking
that dynamic of looking in the mirror at ourselves and
we're expanding that to the entire universe you are the
universe looking at itself everything is your own reflection people
trees cars animals countries planets stars all of it is
your own reflection this is your own body or mind
that you are inside of the entire universe is part
of your own mind and so really what self-love is
is the practice of the appreciation of your infinite mind
which is generating this amazing show this amazing dream that
we're in that it's generating you're generating it you don't
know how you're generating it but you are and the
more conscious you become the more you realize how amazing
it is that all of this is generated by you
and is you see that then puts into proper perspective
and context your physical body because so long as you're
preoccupied and only look at your physical body as yourself
there can't be a deep love there because you're judging
your body as to what it can do for you
like well can my body perform sex can my body
attract the right man can my body land me a
marriage can my body perform the kind of work it
needs to do or whatever this is all within the
realm of survival and this is not true love this
is all conditional love what we're looking for here is
unconditional love love for a thing simply for its existence
not dependent on what it can do for you so
you can love a person because they do stuff for
you that you like or that makes you feel good
or that helps your survival for example many of you
express your love to me but you're not doing it
because you actually unconditionally love me you're doing it because
I'm very useful for you in your journey to unravel
the perplexity of life the videos are useful in that
case you love me and then if I shoot a
video that's not useful and then you hate me or
if I shoot a video that offends you then you
hate me you see this so your love for me
has nothing really to do with true love your love
is not about me it's about you to truly love
me would be to love me just for my being
for my existence now just expand that to the entire
universe and recognize that what you're really doing is you're
not loving me you're not letting some man or some
woman or some some amazing politician or whatever or some
rock star what you're loving is your own self disowned
parts of yourself right so as your sense of self
expands and your sense of love expands they start to
fill up and take notice of the entire universe until
literally you become infinite and your identity becomes one with
the whole universe and your love becomes unlimited and totally
unconditional and at that moment is when you reach your
deepest awakening and at that moment is when you feel
most complete when you feel happiest not just happy but
ecstasy bliss orgasmic levels of joy if you were able
to love that deeply but of course most of us
are not and really now when I'm talking about this
I'm talking about mystical States right this is not ordinary
ordinary emotions we're beyond ordinary emotions here we're talking about
mystical States it's not about feeling good in your body
that's not our goal it's not our goal to always
be feeling good about our own body or about the
world our goal is to be so conscious that we
appreciate our consciousness creates the appreciation of all of these
different elements of life and reality you see it's loving
reality simply for the sake of reality not because of
what it can do for us and not because there's
any reason to and not because we want to feel
good it's not even that we're just literally becoming conscious
of how amazing something is so what I'm saying is
that if you became so conscious that you were conscious
deeply conscious right in this moment of what existence is
of what your body is of what I am of
what the universe is if you really became fully conscious
of that you would feel deep deep deep love existential
love but right now you're not conscious of that but
of course you've had these moments everyone has had these
moments where you're looking at a beautiful sunset or you're
looking up at the stars and you get the sense
of profundity you're looking at a giant mountain and you're
looking at its size and you're so sworps you right
you're looking at this epic mountain and just it's amazing
and you're like wow that's what I'm talking about in
that moment what's happening that your consciousness is registering something
about the scope of what existence is that normally you
don't register because you're just preoccupied with mundane [ __
] petty squabbles and meeting your basic needs and so
that that feeling is lost but it's not just a
feeling that feeling is a byproduct of your consciousness see
like have you ever looked at an animal or the
living creature and just looked at it so so long
and so deep that you just you marvel at this
is an amazing creature it's not you're not looking at
it like you would look at a dog or a
cat normally or just like oh it's a little pet
that I can pet it's like no you're looking at
this this is an an incredible bio-organic machine which has
taken billions of years to evolve and here it is
and look at how amazing all of its hair is
its whiskers and its ears and the way it moves
and you're just look at that it's like it's incredible
what this thing is it's not just a kitten it's
like it's incredible what it is it's not just cute
it could be an ugly you know quote-unquote ugly creature
it doesn't have to be some cute kitten you can
look at and just appreciate it for what it is
like you can look for example at the eye in
fact maybe try this with your own iris go look
in the mirror at how your own iris works and
just how amazing it is in a structure how beautiful
it is and and even not just how it looks
witches can be amazing especially if you have some nice
nicely colored eyes you can see that in your own
eyes but also look at how the pupil dilates like
it's amazing we just sit there in the mirror just
look at it for a few minutes and you'll notice
that it gets contracted and it expands it's doing this
you could even you know fade the lights in and
out you'll see the pupil changes and it's doing all
this automatically like it's incredible that this is happening and
you have no conscious control over this you don't know
how you're doing it even though you believe it's you
you believe your eyes are part of you and you
still have no idea how they actually work what's controlling
that dilation of the pupil is all happening on autopilot
it's so amazing see and then when you realize that
it's like oh wow I really appreciate that that's thing
that I didn't appreciate I was taking it for granted
well this now applies to everything you see and what
needs to happen there is a consciousness so back some
more practical examples so you see we're going from the
practical to the sort of existential and then back again
because that is our work is to bring the practical
into the existential and vice versa and to merge the
two together so that all the mundane stuff like cats
and dogs and forks and knives and toilet paper so
that all of this gets recontextualized as the miracle of
consciousness of spirit which you've been taking for granted your
whole life so let's talk about how to apply self-love
when it comes to dating and attraction many of you
guys who watch me are struggling to attract females understandable
something that I've faced myself I think most guys face
this problem in their life so a very common problem
of course you ladies also struggle to attract the right
kind of man and spouse into your life so so
the problem with trying to attract women specifically is that
you're doing it from a place that lacks self-love you're
trying to get from the woman something as a big
guy you're trying to impress her you're trying to extract
sex from her you're trying to manipulate her to like
you to go on a date with you to sleep
with you to be with you it and all this
and this becomes a very frustrating game you start to
it you know go out there start hitting on girls
and and and so forth and you keep failing you
don't know why do I keep failing why don't they
like me well a big component of is that you
don't like yourself how can they like you when you
don't like yourself see women are really good at reading
off of you as the guy whatever you're feeling subconsciously
so when you lack self love the woman smells that
off you because your tone of voice is weak it's
not confident she reads that off you within seconds your
eyes are shifty they're not steady and focused you're smiled
you don't have a smile because you're afraid when you're
talking to her and you're anxious and you're nervous and
all this sub communicates to the woman that you're a
weak guy and the reason you're a weak guy is
because you lack self-love but it goes even deeper than
that you might say Oh Leo what I did a
bunch of pickup and I slept with a hundred girls
and now I love myself and I think I'm the
I'm the boss you know I got the big dick
and I walk into the club and I I hit
on all the girls and I pull home a girl
at night and at the end of the night and
then I'm it's amazing and I'm so good and Leo
I fulfilled yourself love imperative no you haven't you're just
being a narcissistic dick see that's not true self-love because
what you're still lacking is again your sense of self
is still this limited pickup identity that you've created as
a man that's not the true self true self-love here
would be to be so loving that you love all
women as a whole you love every woman that you're
with you don't try to manipulate her because if you
truly were practicing self-love you couldn't practice manipulation you see
you actually care not about her as a sex object
to satisfy your needs but you actually care about her
needs you care about her agenda you care about her
feelings what she's thinking what she wants what kind of
life she wants to create with you what kind of
relationship you guys are in see that's a very different
dynamic than what most pickup people are doing you can
be great at attracting women but you're still you're gonna
be failing over and over again you're not gonna be
satisfied I've known guys who are so good at pickup
that they slept with 200-300 women they could go on
any busy night on a weekend they can go to
a club and they can that their chances of pulling
a girl are really high shockingly high disturbingly high but
I don't I don't envy these people because they're not
satisfied they're not satisfied and they don't know what to
do about it they think that they already have self
love no you don't have self-love your self-love is so
limited because your sense of self is so limited and
your sense of love is so limited and the reason
that is is because you haven't had these mystical experiences
that need to be had in order to understand what
self and love really are now for you ladies who
struggled to attract a high quality man who's gonna stick
around and be stable and want to commit to you
right that's what you want most you so how do
you do that well a lot of you can't do
that because you have very low self-esteem you don't love
yourself enough and then of course the man reads that
off of you it's very easy for a man to
to tell what a woman what a woman isn't confident
about herself her appearance or other aspects of her life
and then many men will not hesitate to manipulate and
to take advantage of that so in both these instances
the males and the females both of us need to
learn self-love and then your relationships will go a lot
better in fact you might even you might even reach
such a high level of self-love that you won't even
need sex or relationships anymore because those will actually limit
your ability to just radiate self-love of course most people
aren't there so there's nothing wrong with some sex or
some relationships to hold you over until you get there
how about disagreements with family and other people what's missing
when these disagreements happen in fact in general when arguments
of any kind happened what's really happening is a lack
of self-love is being exhibited by usually both sides sometimes
one side more than the other but in general both
sides are guilty of it it's just a question of
degree C you want to get along well with people
without arguing without harsh disagreements practice more self-love again what
this means is that you're not just loving yourself in
the argument which everybody does that's what the ego does
all the time you're loving the other party as well
because you recognize that there's nothing special about you there's
nothing special about your position in this argument your position
is just as important as their position from the sort
of that metaphysical perspective right when you're coming from a
loving place many of these arguments and disagreements melt away
a lot of families get destroyed by this maybe your
own mother and father chances are quite good probably 50%
chance that they got divorced why do they get divorced
a lack of self-love ultimately see probably your father couldn't
fully love himself and your mother and your mother probably
couldn't fully love herself and your father now of course
it doesn't mean that getting a divorce is wrong per
se you could decide to get a divorce and that
could also be an act of self-love so self love
does not mean that you stay in an abusive relationship
and that you love the abusive guy even though he's
keeping keeps abusing you and ruining your life no see
if you fully love yourself you would understand that to
honor my my full self and to love to honor
my capacity to love others and to love myself and
to have respect for myself I need to set some
boundaries and this person if he keeps crossing these boundaries
then the most loving thing in the situation is not
to keep being with him but to cut it off
and move on with my life because otherwise I'm gonna
be stuck in an abusive relationship and what kind of
self love is that is that loving yourself to create
justifications for staying in abusive relationship that's not self-love if
you really love yourself you would want the best for
yourself not in the short term but in the long
term you'd want yourself to grow see you'd want your
partner to grow how about the problem of dealing with
death suffering illness injury wrongdoing injustice that's done to you
how do you deal with these problems again these problems
arise because of a lack of self-love if you get
a serious illness what you need more than anything is
self-love now of course you can take medication and chemotherapy
and so forth and maybe that will help you maybe
it won't it's a dicey game but regardless you're gonna
heal much faster with self-love of course you can still
take the medication and so forth but having self-love in
that situation is critical for your battle with this cancer
or whatever and even if you lose the battle I'm
not saying that just by loving yourself you're gonna win
the battle and now you're immune to cancer don't get
me wrong but you need to be kind to yourself
appreciate yourself be understanding of your situation like if you
let's say break a leg you can react to it
with anger and hatred and say oh god damn it
how could I be so clumsy and so stupid I
tripped over that banana peel and broke my leg oh
my god this is terrible you can do that whole
thing which then robs you of the resources you need
to to be able to to deal with the situation
and to recover better whereas if your understanding and you
understand that well yeah of course yeah I slipped on
that banana peel it's kind of silly but also you
know yeah we all do silly things sometimes I can
I can appreciate that I do silly things other people
do silly things let me love the fact that I
do silly things other people do silly things were all
clumsy sometimes sure this was a stupid thing but but
let me just let me love it let me let
me learn from it what kind of lessons are there
here see that's a much healthier attitude and that will
lead you to a faster recovery and to better things
and in fact that breaking of the leg even though
it'll hurt and it'll be inconvenient for a while you
might learn some profound spiritual lessons from that about suffering
about pain about maybe empathizing with others now when you
see somebody else with a cast now you empathize with
them see it helps you to be more loving to
suffer or when some injustice is done to you you
can judge it and hate it and resist it and
demonize it or you can embrace it with love you
can realize that the the one who is doing injustice
to you is none other than you from an existential
perspective right the universe is doing this to itself so
if someone broke into your car and saw some stuff
this actually happened to me I'm I'm I'm bringing this
up because it actually happened to me a couple of
years ago I was driving with my ex girlfriend we
were on a hiking trip we drove through Fresno yeah
I think it was Fresno California mm-hmm and we just
stopped there for the night and my car was packed
to the roof and to all the seats and all
the trunk everything was packed with gear cuz we were
on like a hiking trip it was kind of late
fall so it was cold so we had jackets and
boots and all sorts of stuff and then yeah somebody
broke into my car and stole everything and I remember
I remember like it was painful for a few days
after that event especially the day of the event like
it was almost like someone like stabbed me in the
heart by stealing all this stuff like they stole my
GoPro camera they stole I had this I had some
fishing gear with me I had this tackle box of
fishing supplies that's like probably 20 years old I've had
it since I was like a kid with my dad
we'd go on fishing trips like this had a lot
of sentimental value to me I had like old fishing
lures and stuff like that in there and like this
is irreplaceable stuff I had like a little notebook of
every fish that I caught like recorded in there like
like this is decades old and some some ass stole
this stole this fishing box and all my stuff so
yeah it was heartbreaking but then also what helped me
is that at that moment you know I I was
I was conscious enough I understood enough of these principles
of spirituality and self-actualization so forth that I tried to
actually empathize with the person so rather than hating him
actually in that incident I discovered that Fresno Fresno California
is apparently the meth capital of the world so there's
a lot of meth addicts there it's it's a terrible
situation they have a lot of these sort of carjackings
and car break-ins because everyone there is like hooked on
meth and opioids maybe as well and yeah it's just
a terrible terrible situation and they don't know what to
what to do to help these addicts so when I
thought about that I actually thought about how oh okay
so this must have been like a a method a
desperate meth addict who broke into my car and you
know yeah okay he stole some stuff he stole my
jacket my favorite jacket and some of my clothes and
my blankets but then I'm thinking like well but now
he's probably sitting there in the cold in my jacket
with my blanket at least he gets that out of
it you know gets a little bit of relief of
his suffering there and I can totally understand why he
would do that cuz meth is a very addictive and
so in this sense you know I was practicing self-love
there by by empathizing with the situation and seeing it
not just from my personal ego perspective but seeing it
from a sort of a universal perspective so it's actually
quite sad not for me personally that my stuff was
stolen it's quite sad just as a condition of the
social system in America that we have all these opioid
addicts and drug addicts meth addicts on the streets living
homeless they don't have care nobody the government's not helping
them that neither political party really wants to help them
with poverty and the way capitalism works in all this
you know they're just living outdoors in the cold suffering
dying overdosing catching HIV and so forth with these needles
and whatever else like that whole situation is very sad
love that that is you that is yourself that is
the universe that's what it is love that that's self-love
when you when you can connect with that if you
can connect with that if you can have that level
of detachment and perspective that level of consciousness and this
takes consciousness then it's very hard for people to do
you wrong this is the ultimate antidote here now granted
is difficult to practice this how about the problem of
killing yourself at work by overworking how many of you
are workaholics I know your type so this is a
very practical problem people ruin their health by working too
much eating junk food at work chugging down cokes and
diet cokes and snicker bars and all this nonsense Cheetos
and Doritos and all this [ __ ] you're destroying
your body see so you're not practicing self-love at work
you think you love your work but really that's a
very limited definition of love there if you were really
practicing self-love in this situation you would love not just
a little sliver of your work but you would love
also and recognize the importance of the entire situation so
it's not just that there's work that needs to be
done and money that needs to be made it's like
no there's work that needs to be done there's money
needs to be made I'm also doing it because I'm
passionate about it also my body needs to feel comfortable
and good doing it I need to feel well rested
so that I can be at my most creative I
love being creative so if you truly loved yourself you
would not want to put yourself in a situation where
you are working 80-hour weeks doing grunt labor and just
chugging stuff out and killing yourself in your body and
your emotions in the process and maybe even your family
and all this if you truly loved yourself you wouldn't
put yourself in that situation and you could correct that
you could find new ways of working or different types
of jobs or get entirely different careers you see so
this self love you might wonder well leo it's so
impractical but it's not impractical when you have a very
robust understanding of of this concept and how to apply
it it's not impractical at all what I'm telling you
is that any problem you have in your life look
at that problem and then apply this robust notion of
self-love expand your sense of self in that situation expand
your sense of love and then ask yourself okay what
should I do next practically what should I do about
this see for example let's say you're working at a
nine-to-five job that you hate Starbucks or subway or someplace
and you're just you detest this job you got to
get up every morning you're barely there you're not motivated
you hate yourself you feel like you're trapped and you're
in a corner and all this but you got to
do it for the money right so in this situation
now you're feeling bad you might even start to feel
depressed you might even contemplate suicide if this goes long
enough you know 10 20 years so what's the solution
self love expand yourself love what does that practically mean
well if you really love yourself would you keep working
at that job if you really loved yourself could you
muster up a vision a new vision of a new
job a new career and you own a new way
you could retrain yourself of course you could you see
but you need that vision where does a vision come
from from love you need to have a new love
something you're passionate about you're not gonna get out of
that miserable situation unless there's some extra passion that you
have that can motivate you and push you through some
difficult time to get over that hump so maybe you're
gonna have to work two jobs now because you now
you expand your self-love and you say okay I'm really
passionate about making music that's what I really want to
do but I don't know how to get there so
Leo how is self-love gonna help me with that I'd
need more money not more love but to get more
money you need first more love and a deeper sense
of self because right now your little how did you
get in this shitty situation in the first place see
by lack of self-love the reason you work in a
subway or a Starbucks is because you didn't spend time
earlier in your childhood in your youth really loving yourself
in developing a sense of passion about life because if
you did that I guarantee you you would never end
up in a Starbucks or a subway see people who
get there they get there by accident because they didn't
plan anything didn't have any passions they'd really follow through
on it see they didn't have a large enough sense
of self a large enough sense of mission large enough
sense of life purpose where does life purpose come from
from self love you have to love yourself so much
you have to love reality so much that you want
to contribute to it in a meaningful way not by
working at Subway and and so if you want to
get out of that situation we're gonna have to do
and like literally I I did this is I worked
double I had my main job nine to five job
and then on the weekends and at night I would
come home and I would work double to start my
own business but the reason I could do that is
because I had a vision I had a passion I
had a love for myself and I I knew my
own potential and I knew that I wasn't living up
to my potential and my potential I knew was so
great that I knew that staying 95 job was was
just unacceptable it was unacceptable I loved myself too much
to accept that and then from there that led to
a lot of good stuff a lot of very practical
stuff money came from that I made hundreds of thousands
of dollars that are sitting in my bank account from
a higher sense of self love than most people which
enabled me to have a deeper sense of life purpose
than most people which enabled me to work harder than
most people which enabled me to be more creative than
most people which it enabled me to be more passionate
in my work than most people which allowed me then
to become financially independent that's how you do it expanding
your sense of self love what about if you have
fear of starting a business seems like a very practical
situation it's likely oh I want to start a business
but I'm afraid I don't know what if I'm gonna
go broke and so forth what are you gonna need
to overcome that more love you're not gonna overcome fear
with fear fear is overcome with love you're gonna have
to love your idea for your business so much you're
gonna have to love your vision so much you're gonna
have to have such a sense of purpose that this
business is really gonna change the world in some meaningful
way that you believe in and the only reason you
can you can motivate yourself like that is because you
have to really genuinely love the world love reality if
you're not if you don't love reality if you don't
love the world if you don't love life if you
don't live human beings how can you create a business
that helps them and if you don't create a business
that helps them what are you know you're gonna create
a business that hurt them well good luck creating a
successful business that hurts people now of course that still
doesn't stop a certain a big pharma companies and big
oil companies they it is actually possible in a Wall
Street and so forth it is possible to start a
business that is successful and that hurts people but first
of all it's not a sustainable business all those businesses
will go out of business pretty soon within a matter
of decades and also it's a terrible way to live
life because even when you win you lose even if
you get all that money you're still going to be
miserable and depressed the only way to really win a
business is to create a business that helps people that's
your payoff for business the payoff for for a great
business is not the money it's the smile you put
on people's faces that's the payoff if you're doing it
correctly and to to have that motivation you to really
love yourself and really love other people and love reality
see so actually the reason that many of these sleazy
business people types these sort of Wall Street types or
these sort of scammers that run Ponzi schemes and so
the Bernie Madoff and so forth some of these sleazy
CEOs and you know who take giant you know compensation
packages and so forth these people they're not conscious people
these are miserable people they might seem flashy and successful
on the surface but deep down they're miserable they're empty
they're hollow inside and the reason that is is because
they don't really love mankind they don't love the world
as much as I do for example so they are
happy working in a job where they are just scamming
others or exploiting others manipulating others whatever they're happy doing
that where I was like I would never be able
to sustain that because my love is too high see
I love myself too much and I love the world
too much to do that I don't want to start
a business like that but many people they don't care
so how do you get yourself out of this if
you're one of those types who right now has a
job where you're not really doing any good for a
mankind in fact you're probably doing something bad like you're
selling them sugary drinks working at Pepsi or something if
you're some VP of Marketing at Pepsi for you to
get to the next level in your human evolution and
in your happiness and to be able to be a
good father to your children and a good spouse to
your wife and all this what neat what you need
to have have happened is you need to raise your
level of self-love expand your sense of self beyond your
family beyond money beyond having a car in a house
expanded to include mankind as well the environment animals all
that expanders themself and expand your ability to love so
you're not just stuck in your head calculating numbers figuring
out how to squeeze and manipulate people and sell them
more sugary drinks and ruin their health but you gotta
love people so much that you become so conscious that
you realize that why am i ruining the lives of
millions of children selling the sugary drink when instead I
could be putting my brain power and my creative vision
into coming up with a new beverage that might be
healthy a healthy alternative that would actually help all those
kids and you know help millions of people to wean
themselves off of soda which is causing obesity and cancer
and God knows what else diabetes and so forth see
but the only way you can make that evolutionary leap
is by expanding your sense of self love so really
if you're working at one of these for lack of
a better word a devil jobs one of these devil
jobs you're lacking self-love your self is too small and
your love is too small and you're so preoccupied with
business and with money and marketing and sales you're not
leaving any room open to inquire into the metaphysics of
reality into spirituality you're not leaving yourself time to meditate
to contemplate to do psychedelics to go on a retreat
in the rainforest because you're so busy selling your stupid
[ __ ] soda so that you can make next
quarters you know benchmark of profits and then you could
get a little bit more of a compensation package some
more stock options or whatever it is that you don't
even need anymore because you've already got enough way more
than you need to be fulfilled but you can't help
yourself why because you're afraid and the solution to fear
is self-love if you have money problems this is a
self-love problem I know it sounds ridiculous it sounds new
agey to say this because what could be more utilitarian
than a money problem leo those poor kids in Africa
they have a money problem they have an infrastructure problem
they have a HIV problem they don't have a love
problem but all those problems are love problems to have
money you need to have a right economy to have
a right economy you need to write society to have
the right society you need to have no tribal warfare
to have no tribal warfare people need to respect each
other people need to be open minded people need to
be able to listen to each other that requires self-love
an expanded set of self and expanses of love many
of the most impoverished parts of the world are parts
which are crippled by corruption and by tribalism and by
ideology these create a sort of an a trifecta that's
really difficult to resolve and that creates a really bad
econ economic situation with little Economic Opportunity and and then
of course yeah of course in that situation yeah they
need money but how are we gonna solve this are
we gonna solve this money problem by just dropping buckets
of cash from the skies it's not gonna work because
even if you did that in these countries they are
so corrupt so tribal and so ideological that even when
the UN air drops in food supplies and aid and
all this sort of stuff the local dictator or the
clan leader in the region will just take all that
food sub and he will sell it and just make
a profit for himself it won't even go to the
hungry kids so what's the problem there well part of
the problem is that these clan leaders they're usually tyrannical
they basically run a mafia and they're totally corrupt and
they're authoritarian why is that because they're extremely selfish their
sense of self is very limited and their sense of
love is very limited see they're wrapped up in survival
now of course I'm not blaming them for that that's
just how it is and you need to love that
as well but but the only way that situations gonna
exchange is if that nation changes its culture changes this
society so that there's an expanse of the self first
what that's gonna entail is that the two or three
or four factions that are engaging in this feudal clan
warfare with each other they need to expand it to
themself such that they recognize that wait a minute guys
were a unified country we're not four different tribes were
one country we're one people we have more in common
than we have that differentiates us it's like the different
factions of Muslims the Sunnis and the Shiites and so
forth they realize that oh we're all actually Muslims let's
get together and actually create a Muslim society that would
be one step up then the next step up for
them would be to realize like oh it's not that
she's more Muslims and then they're they over there are
Christians or they over there are atheists and infidels it's
like no we're Muslims and they're Christians and and and
they're atheists but that's all me that's all myself so
myself expands to include all of that so now all
of a sudden as a Muslim I don't have to
fight with the Christians in the atheists I can realize
that oh well people have different perspectives and ultimately in
the end it all still all leads to self love
see and then you could expand even further beyond that
so that's how ultimen that's the root solution to many
of those problems of course that's difficult to do I'm
not saying it's easy it can't just be done on
a purely individual level has to be on a collective
level as well but that would be a way to
go about it how about political problems problems with government
problems in international relations well obviously these are self-love problems
I hope you can see this almost all political problems
are a debate between two sides these two sides hate
each other misunderstand each other do not listen to each
other are closed-minded to each other's perspectives and needs and
different levels of development and so then of course there's
there's combat and warfare and dirty politics and tricks and
manipulation and selfishness and devilry and corruption and all this
see how do you overcome that how do we as
Americans for example in America overcome this polarized time that
we're living in with Trump and the different factions of
Democrats they're all fighting with each other and all this
how do we resolve this by expanding our sense of
self and loving the whole situation more loving the other
side more as sappy as that sounds that is a
problem is that there's not enough self-love going around in
this time see and that's that's perhaps the the biggest
tragedy of of Trump's influence on American politics and even
global politics is that he infected it with his own
lack of self love see pitting people against each other
pitting factions against each other demonizing anybody who disagrees with
him demonizing anyone who stands in his way of course
Democrats are also guilty of that to some extent but
Trump is the king of that how about if you're
doing spirituality you're meditating a lot you're doing solo retreats
you're doing psychedelics you're doing yoga but you're not getting
the results you want it's taking longer than you thought
you're having ego backlashes you're backsliding you're you're struggling to
meditate you keep falling off track and what's the solution
is it to hate yourself more no its self-love more
self-love be more kind to yourself be more understanding be
more loving of the entire spiritual process don't just be
meditating just to meditate like a machine like a robot
enjoy the meditation see why aren't you loving your meditation
session the whole point of meditation is to get you
into self-love but the way you're doing meditation is so
mechanical and so regimented and so empty of love that
of course how are you gonna get there a bad
trip on a psychedelic what do you do do you
go cry about it no more self-love now of course
crying could be a part of self-love nothing wrong with
crying but yeah the the only thing you need after
a bad trip is more self-love and the only reason
the bad trip happened in the first place is because
of a lack of self-love because the trip was tried
to expand your sense of self and expand your sense
of love but your ego was so scared he was
holding on it was resisting or maybe you overdosed or
whatever because you were careless in which case it was
too much right the self love became so great that
actually turned it to hell because you weren't prepared for
it you know so what's the solution to that more
self-love after a bad trip the best thing you can
do is wrap yourself in a warm blanket make yourself
some hot cocoa sit by the fire or just go
out look at the Stars maybe chat with some good
friends have some laughs maybe watch a comedy whatever this
sort of stuff but you're not gonna be able to
do that if you're gonna be hating on yourself or
worrying you see worrying hate fear these put you into
very unrests from which you make stupid decisions and you
don't do the obvious things little practical things that could
soothe your situation and bring you out on top and
then mistakes happen for example you have a bad trip
and because you don't love yourself enough you're not able
to soothe yourself and consult yourself properly after that you're
not able to heal and get over it you know
you you're left wounded and then you say notice I
can I look forever and you miss out on this
amazing entire domain that could have transformed your life you
say no to it why because you didn't love yourself
enough violence crime mass shootings terrorism racism abuse how do
we deal with this sort of criminality by hating it
by judging it of course not this look the worse
your problem is the more self-love you need the problem
is is that when your problems are really serious you're
least likely to take self-love seriously you're more likely to
say olio but you're just talking airy-fairy [ __ ]
no I'm not it's just really hard to do and
when things get really bad like you have terrorism or
mass shootings and violence and racism and so forth yeah
the reason that situation is so bad is because it
lacks so much self-love and it needs a massive infusion
of self love but of course the ego when it
has little self-love it can't tolerate a lot of self-love
infused into it it literally has a sort of a
backlash bad trip reaction so if you really are serious
as if we're serious as a society we want to
stop all these mass shootings if we want to stop
violence if we want to stop poverty and terrorism what
do we do self love and all the ways that
manifests if you really expand your sense of self to
include the terrorists to include the mass shooter you would
be able to empathize with their situation understand how they
got to where they are see that doesn't mean we
have to allow it to happen but you can understand
more properly why it's happening why are people so upset
with their lives that they're willing to go into a
school and shoot up children that's not just some random
thing you see that that something has to be seriously
wrong in society such that we don't support all citizens
properly such that some of them fall through the cracks
so deeply that then they become suicidal this way and
take others with them see so really if we cared
about this we would create a sort of a safety
net that would catch a mechanism that would catch those
people that are falling through the cracks we would identify
what the cracks are we would actually be curious enough
because we would empathize with them rather than just saying
that all they're just psychos or they're just scumbags if
you treat them as psychos and scumbags you can't solve
the problem you can't help them you're blaming them for
the problem when really maybe the problem isn't them but
it's their environment it's their conditioning it's what they've been
taught it's how their mother or father abused them and
the reason the mother father of use them is because
they didn't get the proper parenting education or maybe because
the mother was in such poverty she had to work
three different jobs she didn't have time to spend with
her child when he was young she couldn't afford daycare
for him and so he grew up with the wrong
kind of you know gangs and then whatever and then
you know god it's drugs and got into other things
and that led to to a bad situation that spiraled
out of control see so all these things especially we're
talking about these large social problems that keep recurring again
and again and again like mass shootings and terrorism and
racism these are systemic problems they happen because the way
that our society is structured is creating as a function
of its structure these side effects if you will so
we need to look and change the structure but to
be able to change the structure we have to be
able to expand our sense of self and expand our
sense of love how about the environmental problem that we
have is our problem that we're pumping out too much
co2 I mean it is from a sort of a
technical scientific perspective with global warming but the deeper problem
is the lack of self-love that's why we're pumping out
the co2 even though most people know that pumping out
this much co2 isn't good the giant oil companies have
known about this since the 1970s they have their own
internal reports where their own scientists knew that this would
be a a future possibility a future problem to deal
with but they did it anyways why is that because
the people that run these companies don't actually love the
environment they don't love animals they love money more and
that's because their sense of self doesn't incorporate animals and
environment instead they go hunt animals for trophies on safari
that's how they show their quote/unquote love for animals but
of course you wouldn't do that if you really loved
animals if you really expand yourself to include them in
the environment see most people take the environment for granted
they don't they don't actually treat the environment as they
treat their own body or you know some people treat
their own body so bad that that's exactly how they
treat the environment which shows you how deep the problem
goes if if one third of Americans are obese which
i think is roughly correct although don't quote me on
that then and of course yeah is this a surprise
that we treat our environment so bad when we can't
even treat our own bodies well and it but is
it the fault of the obese people no it's not
their fault per se again it's it's all part of
the system because of all the fast food the soda
the drinks the marketing of food bad food that happens
on TV all the time with no consequences see I
would bet that 90% of the stuff that's marketed on
TV and on YouTube could no longer be marketed if
only the people that were marketing it expanded their sense
of self love the only reason they can market it
is because they don't love themselves and they don't know
what the self really is what's the solution to depression
suicide self-love what's the solution to addiction self-love what's the
solution to various ideological disagreements self-love was a solution to
parenting problems more self-love see you think that your child
is unruly and causing problems and not getting good grades
and hanging out with the wrong kids and that really
likely oh no my child's problem is that he's he's
hanging out with the wrong bad influences and they're gonna
get him into drugs and other things that's the real
problem not a self-love problem but the reason your child
is so disconnected from you he's because you've been nagging
him and criticizing him his whole life telling him how
bad he is and what he's not supposed to do
but then he's developed this rebellious streak he he doesn't
even communicate with you anymore because you weren't able to
see and love him for who he is and now
this alienation has created you have to work extra hard
to overcome that alienation how do you overcome that alienation
through more self-love and the reason you judge your child
and kritis appoint out all the wrong things that he's
doing how foolish he is and how he's doing all
the obviously dumb stuff the reason you're doing that is
because you yourself are so self judgmental and you hate
yourself so much and you don't accept all these aspects
that are in your child that you've seen your child
those are all the aspects that you've denied in yourself
that's your shadow so you're projecting your shadow and your
your you're projecting your shadow onto that child and what
that child really wants is love but since you're not
providing it his friends are providing it the drugs are
providing it his you know toxic girlfriend is providing it
his gang is providing it the tattoos he gets that's
providing it because you couldn't provide it yeah that's tough
it's tough it's real tough for a parent to admit
that they don't actually like their child cuz it's like
it's supposed to be automatic that all everybody loves their
child and in a sort of says you love your
child but now another sense yeah you love your child
or at least you say you do but you don't
you don't accept them unconditionally which is the number one
mistake of parenting is not accepting your child unconditionally and
that's because you don't know how to because you haven't
accepted yourself unconditionally a lot of these problems would autocorrect
if you expanded your sense of self love so I
want you to notice that every time that you're not
happy in whatever situation doesn't matter what context self-love is
lacking in that situation what's the most important thing you
can teach your children self-love what's the most important thing
for a successful relationship self-love what's the most important thing
for artists creative types and even business people successful business
people what suppose more than self-love what's the most important
thing for conscious politics as I've talked about in my
four-part series for that to work self-love what's the most
important thing for leading other people self love if you
don't love yourself you can't lead others if you don't
love yourself you can't be a great artist or be
great at creativity and you can't be a great business
person you might think that no olio that's not true
there's a lot of people who make themselves but are
good at business or very narcissistic and selfish but think
of how much greater they could have been a business
if they love themselves more being great at business is
not measured by how much money you make being great
at business as measured by the impact your business makes
on the world so I don't care if some Wall
Street type runs a hedge fund that earns a hundred
million dollars a year that's not being great at business
because that hedge fund is just leeching money without offering
any serious value it's not creative work to be really
accessible business as somebody who's contributing something new to the
world and is passionate about the work that they do
and isn't it just doing it mechanically for money or
some external reward someone who is putting smiles on people's
faces not at the expense of others but you know
in a truly win-win sort of way in a constructive
way not a destructive way because you know it's easy
to put smiles on on on the faces of some
some rich person by you know getting them a lot
of return through your hedge fund but then that comes
at the expense of all the other people you stepped
on in order to take their money because that's the
zero-sum game there what's the most important thing for healing
and helping other people self love what's the most important
thing for dealing with criminals and evil self love no
amount of money success Fame a house sex a family
or Beauty physical appearance I mean can compensate for a
lack of self-love and people desperately try and try and
try and to manipulate to get all those other things
but fundamentally they're lacking self-love but they don't realize that
because when you lack self-love you don't know that you
lack of self-love and actually you're a denial about it
you think that what you really lack is some external
material so stands like money more a house so there
cannot be happiness without self-love and that basically means the
whole spiritual path boils down to learning self-love self-love is
the ultimate strength in the ultimate power so this is
how you judge the development level of a human being
is how deeply is he or she able to self-love
and it's really just as simple as that but why
is this the case why is self-love so powerful because
it's the ultimate truth it's not a feeling it's not
an emotion it's an absolute it's what reality is is
self-love consciousness the only substance that exists out of which
every universe and multiverse is made out of which every
physical objects make consciousness this conscious so she's right here
right now constructing this very moment this consciousness is the
same consciousness that's constructing all possible moments and this consciousness
is in love with itself constructing this grand infinite dream
that is the very essence of what consciousness is anything
less than total self love is falsehood corruption and delusion
separation and division and partiality and bias to reject any
part of yourself or reality is ignorance foolishness fear and
coming from limited consciousness so this infinite mind which is
God which is this present moment at all possible moments
that ever will or have occurred this is what it
is it is pure consciousness and God is equivalent to
self-love now you might wonder why why would reality love
itself Leo couldn't reality just be a physical thing why
do you have to bring love into it see this
is this is your question from the materialist paradigm I
get you I understand the hesitation and the concern and
the doubt here's here's why what you understand is that
reality has to be itself a thing can't be itself
and at the same time not be itself it has
to fully be itself so really to say that reality
loves itself and that God is self-love all that is
being said is basically that a equals a if we
have a a has to be a a can't be
be a can't be C a has to be a
so if we have all of reality as a whole
think of it as one particle if we compress the
entire universe into a single particle and we look at
it from afar which we can't do but if we
could like this that little dot that contains every possible
thing that exists that little dot is precisely what it
is a equals a that dot is the dot and
that is the love because this little dot is occurring
within consciousness consciousness if it's fully conscious has to be
conscious of the fact that it's conscious and what it
is to be conscious and everything that is within the
contents of its consciousness to be conscious is simply the
unfolding of self love so an infinite consciousness which is
what God refers to an infinite consciousness cannot hate itself
judge itself reject itself or wish ill on itself or
exclude itself because that would be insanity it would be
like a denying that it's a so from God's point
of view here's how God looks at it I am
God I am exactly what I am I am a
complete necessity a complete tautology I can't be anything other
than what I am which is infinite consciousness as infinite
consciousness I have to be exactly how I am which
means that I have to accept myself exactly as I
am dad is in other words the truth the truth
accepts itself as the truth the truth can't deny itself
what it is because the truth is just what is
so what is has too is and now we're reaching
rock bottom below which there's nothing you can't get any
lower than isness so is this just is consciousness is
what it is is not just the way you imagined
is materialist you imagine well Lea we can can't we
just have like some material universe out there somewhere outside
of consciousness outside of God who cares about God and
all this love none of this matters what if there's
just like a material universe and it just exists well
let's go with that let's imagine a scenario where there
is no conscience whatsoever let's imagine a universe with no
consciousness there's only what you would call matter dumb lifeless
unconscious matter so what's going on here you might have
planets and stars and so forth but no humans and
no animals for simplicity sake so in this situation that
you're imagining you just imagine it well that could just
exist right it could just be like that with no
conscience no love nothing is there it is no you're
wrong because the only reason you can imagine that is
because it's happening in your consciousness and for for that
thing too is for that thing to be even if
it's just a material object it's the truth of it
is that it still is exactly what it is a
equals a so if it is that thing that means
that it has to accept itself relative to itself it
has to accept itself so the material the material universe
as you are calling it has to accept itself for
what it is and that's consciousness I know it's probably
not very convincing to doesn't sound logical at some level
because it's you can't you can't put this into words
I'm kind of I'm trying to hint at it maybe
you can get it maybe not but yeah you just
have to realize that for something to be it has
to be the truth and that is what consciousness is
stop thinking of consciousness as some biological phenomenon that is
happening in the brain stop thinking of it as a
as a byproduct of living creatures that's not what consciousness
is consciousness is simply what is living creatures are not
conscious you are not conscious rather that human body that
you think is you is being imagined by universal consciousness
which is not had by any entity or creature or
being it is just is it's the truth it's the
absolute truth and it has to accept itself see what
I'm saying is that just for a physical object to
exist like this finger for it to be here right
now it has to accept that it's here it's a
little weird to say it that way because usually we
attribute acceptance to a book to a psychological function of
a human but you have to you have to see
acceptance as a sort of a metaphysical existential thing as
a physical thing physics is acceptance like reality has to
accept itself to allow itself to be itself I don't
know how else to say it hopefully that cleared it
up if you're confused I understand you need mystical experiences
we can't go any deeper with words so it's not
enough merely to accept yourself though you might think like
well leo so what's the difference being self acceptance and
love aren't they just the same thing so why don't
we just say acceptance instead of love why do we
have to bring love into it it sounds too girly
and too emotional but it is love we're not merely
talking about acceptance here you can't get more to see
problem with talking about love is that it there's nothing
there's nothing but love so you can't explain it anyway
because anything you're using to explain it is itself it
so you must enter into an ecstatic union with yourself
when consciousness realizes what it is when consciousness becomes conscious
of itself it enters into an ecstatic union with itself
it recognizes its own existential Beauty you as consciousness recognize
how amazing you are and you are amazing we are
amazing we are consciousness we are the only thing that
will ever exist could ever exist and we have existed
for eternity we are it we are consciousness we are
loved and the only problem is that some of us
don't recognize it some of us recognize it more than
others some of us recognize it then we forget and
we recognize it again a year later than we forget
then we recognize it a week later than we forget
and then some of us aren't recognizing it all the
time 24/7 those would be the Mystics in the Yogi's
who've done a lot of work on themselves and are
really awake do you realize how amazing this is right
here how amazing you are how amazing everything is even
all the stuff you hate how amazing it all is
just the fact that it is and it's been forever
and that this is a function of infinite consciousness this
is so amazing there's it's so amazing there's nothing else
to compare it with it's infinite amazement that's what we
are we are infinite amazement and I'm suggesting that your
job is to recognize that more and more and more
and the more you recognize that the more amazing your
life gets how do you create an amazing life by
recognizing that life is already amazing under all conditions unconditionally
amazing and when you recognize your own amazement the amazement
of the whole universe you fall in love with it
literally you are falling in love with yourself for eternity
that's what God is that's what life is that's what
we're doing here that's the only thing that can ever
be done in reality nothing can ever be done that's
not that all the technology we create all the wars
we fight all the societies we build all the people
we help all the cherries we contribute to all the
children we save all the diseases we cure all the
animals we save everything that we ever do and will
ever do as species will be us falling deeper in
love with our own selves because there's nothing else to
do but recognize our own amazement more and more and
more see every new scientific discovery that's made every new
photograph that's taken and put on the on the Internet's
and that you marvel at you know they they take
a photo of a black hole or they take a
photo of some nebula it looks pretty well they took
some photo of a planet you know we fly by
Pluto or Neptune or something snap a photo from a
satellite we we go to Mars you know the first
man on Mars in 50 years or whatever you know
maybe it's L on Musk he's standing on Mars with
this photograph you know he takes that photograph that he's
gonna post it on on Twitter or something and and
what are people gonna do they're gonna oh wow it's
amazing or like Ellen Musk reveals the stupid cyber Trek
god I think it's ugly he reveals that thinking it's
like oh wow amazing everyone's like amazing even the people
that hated are still like oh it's amazing but what
is that that's just a new aspect of yourself being
revealed to you see he doesn't matter if it's a
truck or if it's a a kitten or if it's
a planet or whatever it is new stuff is being
revealed all the time new technology new creatures are evolving
new ideas are occurring in your mind all of it
is amazing always even the stuff you hate it's still
amazing you just hate it cause you're selfish cuz you're
biased but from God's point of view nothing is hated
it's all amazing it's all equally amazing it's all equally
great this is infinite love consciousness in love with what
it is forever exploring itself tada that's what we're doing
here let me just underscore that self-love does not mean
that you become a doormat you can still take action
you can still have boundaries it doesn't mean anything goes
in fact if you're a doormat that's because you lack
self-love if you're if you struggled with people pleasing your
whole life it's because you have low self-esteem and you
lack self-love otherwise you'd have boundaries self-love is also not
a feminine quality make sure you don't make that mistake
think that all leo but you're gonna turn me into
some sort of girl some sort of woman or some
sort of soy boy you know I'm a macho man
I'm sort of a Joe Rogan type I don't want
this self-love I want something you know something like I
want some meat and some barbeque and some testosterone and
some sports muscle cars this is the kind of stuff
that I'm interested in not your girly self-love it's not
girly self-love self-love is truth self-love is the ultimate truth
it's more true than physics it's more true than mathematics
I want you to open your mind to that possibility
mathematics and physics is something humans invented self-love is prior
to the existence of the universe it's not a human
thing it integrates everything it's both feminine and masculine it's
both strong and weak it's both rich and poor and
everything else that you can think of this is not
gonna make you girly if anything this will make you
the strongest man you can be if what you really
care about is being a true man although really you're
not gonna be man at this point gonna be God
you want to be God you want real God mode
self-love [ __ ] that's God mode acting macho and
tough that's not God mode that's that's man mode in
fact that's juvenile man mode that's boy mode man boy
mode is what that is god mode is self-love God
mode is integration of everything including found in masculine together
and transcending all that you don't even know what an
orgasm is until you've realized they've got and that you
are self-love self-love is like an infinite orgasm that never
ends also don't make the mistake of thinking that self-love
is egotism or narcissism this is not truly self-love this
is small s self and lowercase L love which is
in fact the obstacle to the self love that I've
been talking about up to this point so like I
said to expand or to practice self-love how do you
actually practice it you must expand your sense of self
and you must expand your sense of love and so
here's a practical way to do it you're gonna take
a wristband like this put it on your wrist and
for the next week you're gonna walk around every time
you notice this wristband on your wrist you are going
to remember that throughout the next week you are looking
for stuff that you hate or that you judge and
anytime you notice something that you're hating or you're judging
you're judging a car you're judging a picture you're judging
a celebrity you're judging some politician you're hating in whatever
you're gonna flip that around and you're gonna accept and
embrace that thing that you're judging and hating you're gonna
accept that first of all as yourself you're gonna expand
your sense of stuff to include that thing so if
you're watching the news and you see Donald Trump up
there lying and bullshitting whatever he's doing you're gonna expand
yourself to include him as you so he's you can
you accept that if you see some Tesla cyber truck
and you think it looks ugly great now notice this
and realize oh that's me that's part of the universe
so let me accept that as myself too and then
as you expand yourself also love yourself so first you
expand your set of self to include that object that
you've been disconnected from your shadow integrate that shadow object
and then I'm not telling you to love that object
directly instead I'm telling you to love yourself right so
if ordinarily let's say I look at this I look
at the Tesla cyber truck I think it looks ugly
okay that's sort of coming from my ego then I
pause for a moment I see this and I realize
oh okay that truck is actually me I expand my
system self to include the truck I look at that
truck and I say ah okay that's I'm looking at
myself now I'm looking at basically I'm I'm looking at
that truck as though I'm looking in the mirror as
though I'm looking at my own face and then I
feel myself with love for myself but my self is
no longer just the leo unit and body here it
includes the truck and maybe more stuff as well includes
all that probably the whole universe so feel love now
for the whole shebang as a whole feel love for
that and recognize just remind yourself you don't even need
to have mystical experience to do this this is just
their ordinary exercise you can practices just then remind yourself
using your inner talk from your mind remind yourself that
this is what I am and this is what I
love is being myself exactly how I am I don't
need to change myself if that car it looks ugly
whatever I love it anyways like that if your child
does something you don't like okay fine but then expand
your sense of self to include child and say okay
but I love the whole situation and a good question
you can ask yourself to do this is ask yourself
what is something I find ugly about life does something
come up for you right now do it do it
right now with me think of something that you find
ugly about life I don't just mean physical appearance ugly
is a is a broad term I'm using it more
figuratively in metaphorically here than literally for example maybe you
find racism ugly maybe you find religion ugly I don't
know whatever so bring that up to mind and then
remind yourself now that that is you that thing that
you think is ugly is you now embrace that ugliness
because it's true you see this is this is the
connection between love and truth I'm trying to point you
to it can you see this it's a little subtle
if you love the truth you love reality exactly as
it is and not some other way exactly as it
is see to be able to accept reality exactly as
it is you have to love what is you see
otherwise you can't accept it therefore truth and love are
are literally identical to have the truth of something is
to love it at the same time the love is
what allows it to be true and vice versa see
reality and consciousness is such a remarkable thing it's so
infinite it includes so much infinite diversity it includes cockroaches
and snakes and aliens and humans and planets and stars
and it includes rapists it includes murderers and terrorists and
includes Hitler it includes Stalin it includes everybody you don't
like and and a million more things it includes all
of that that's what consciousness is its infinite it has
no limit its endless creativity that's you can you accept
that can you accept yourself this is your true face
when you take the totality of everything that that is
the good and the bad and you look at all
that and you look at it and you say now
I'm really looking in the mirror before when I looked
at my face in the mirror that wasn't my real
face my real face is this entire singularity of every
[ __ ] thing this is what I am this
is God looking at God and then saying it to
itself yeah this is what I am and I love
it I don't need it to be different and can't
be different it's a tautology it's infinity it can't be
different because it is everything it is all possible difference
that is the pinnacle of self-love when consciousness understands and
accepts all of itself that is the full reunion to
which you'll ultimately want to get to and then only
by reaching that reunion that ultimate reunion of all of
all divisions of all differences then from that you can
you can come back into the world of difference and
division and everything is recontextualized because you realize that you're
just exploring your own interspecies as God in various limited
ways as a human as a cockroach as a bird
as an alien whatever it is as a trashcan consider
the possibility that it's possible for you to exist as
a trashcan and to be conscious as a trashcan being
a trash can sound weird and impossible yeah anyways the
deeper you go in this work the more you will
see that it's all about self-love right now you are
hearing this maybe for the first time you haven't had
these mystical experiences you haven't had this grand you reunification
you haven't recognized yourself as God so right now you
can't appreciate what self-love really is you need a reference
experience which is empty for you right now it's too
abstract and that's fine five years from now ten years
from now you'll come back and you'll you'll understand and
you'll see how this played an important role in planting
a seed in your mind that ultimately sprouted into this
grand reunification now you might say but Leo so you
say that self-love is the only teaching but don't you
teach a lot of other stuff that isn't about self-love
like you talk about epistemology you talk about quantum mechanics
sometimes you talk about Google's incompleteness theorem you talk about
cults and you talk about psychedelics or you talk about
politics or you talk about life purpose or you talking
about spiral dynamics you know Leo would what does what
does quantum mechanics or Spile dynamics have to do with
love all of these things I talk about are gonna
converge and lead you towards the realization and embodiment of
self-love so even the stuff that doesn't seem like it
it has to do with self love of course from
a strictly technical standpoint you know if you if you're
studying quantum mechanics it doesn't talk about love so I'm
not saying that you know quantum physicists understand love or
that are they're proving love no not at all you'd
have to go way beyond all that but it's gonna
be a stepping stone for you eventually you'll understand how
all of it came together led together and all these
areas techniques and concepts that I've shared with you they
were all in some way playing a small part a
little stepping stone that helped you to climb the ladder
up to the top of Mount Everest and look down
below and see all of creation underneath you as you
you looking at yourself see and all these different tools
and models and theories and concepts and and techniques and
things that I've shared with you these were just just
helpful little tools to get you there if they were
some of them might not be helpful some of them
might be a distraction so you have to figure that
out for yourself well you know what works for you
I want to leave you with this self love is
your touchstone in life it's your compass it's the thing
you return to when you're lost when something is going
wrong in your life terribly wrong and you don't know
what to do you're confused you're befuddled bewildered overwhelmed remember
to ask yourself how is self-love lacking in the situation
but remember to keep a very robust notion of self
and love in the back of your mind write very
robust notion very broad notion sort of an existential notion
of it not an egotistical notion so it's not always
that you need to act more from your ego in
fact usually not but just ask that question how is
self-love lacking here notice that self-love is not taught in
school or in university at all it's not taught at
work or business at all it's not taught in marketing
and sales at all it's not really even taught very
much within dating advice or relationship advice it's hardly even
taught in churches isn't that amazing isn't amazing that of
all the different teachings that there are all the different
institutions we have you know we have churches and schools
and universities we have Harvard at MIT and we have
we have think tanks and we have magazines and journals
and we have all this but none of them teach
self-love isn't that amazing and then we wonder why is
the world so screwed up why is their societies so
screwed up this is why now of course I'm not
saying I'm the only one who teaches this I mean
many Yogi's and sages and mystics and religious leaders have
taught and demonstrated self-love to you from the beginning of
time for over 10,000 years the Hindus have done it
the Christians have done it the Jews and then every
this is what religion is in its purest truest uncorrupted
form the problem is that he gets so corrupt so
quickly and so few people really ever understand it personally
rather they take it on as beliefs and dogmas so
forth that it gets drowned out and in fact those
very mechanisms that are supposed to be teaching about self-love
they teach you the opposite you can even go to
a guru you can even go to an enlightened master
you can go to an enlightened Zen master and he
will tell you that love doesn't exist that love is
an illusion you can go to some neo at Viton
teacher and he will tell you that all love is
just an illusion and once you awaken you will realize
love is nonsense right because they haven't awoken to love
yet so they'll tell you that with a straight face
and they'll mislead you not because they're evil people just
because they don't know what they don't know and there's
many flavours degrees and versions of awakening they're not all
the same and it took me quite a few awakenings
too so to really lock down this this notion of
self-love here's a homework assignment I'll leave you with besides
the you know you're gonna do this wristband thing I
hope and then also I would like you to make
a list of all the ways in which you don't
love yourself it could be your physical appearance it could
be your personality it could be moral failings it could
be stuff you've done in the past it could be
the way you treat other people could be your health
condition that you have whatever all the ways you don't
love yourself make a long list get them all out
of your system on this beast paper and then at
the end of that decide to love all of that
embrace all of that as what reality is this is
what you are you're a lot more than just that
but you are that too so embrace that and as
you're trying that you're gonna struggle notice that there's a
struggle notice it's hard notice that the ego and you
resists accepting all that because you you want to be
some sort of ideal self you want to be the
way you imagine yourself on the silver screen in a
Hollywood movie that's what isn't that's untruth you see why
truth and love have to go hand in hand because
for something to be true it has to be exactly
the way that it is and not some other way
that you want it to be or imagine it to
be so maybe you imagine that I shouldn't say the
word [ __ ] or maybe you imagine I shouldn't
talk about rape or maybe you imagined that Liam should
have more hair or maybe you imagine that leader should
have a smaller nose or maybe you imagined utley you
should look younger or older or do his beard different
or whatever you imagine all of that is not true
what's true is exactly what's here right now this is
what I am like it or not and there's only
two options we can either accept it or we can
reject it if we reject it we cut ourselves off
from ourselves do you see the insanity of rejecting it
to reject any part of reality is literally insanity you
are saying that what is true is untrue and you
are saying what is untrue is true and that is
the very definition of what I call devilry that's how
the devil is born by rejecting the truth for a
fantasy and the reason that happens is because the devil
can't stomach the truth exactly as it is he needs
it to be something else and from that all evil
manifests from untruth evil is untruth evil is self-denial lack
of self-love which is why the only ultimate solution to
evil is a reunion a reintegration of all of your
shadows and total self-love that's you coming home that's what
you've always been that was the truth it's just that
the truth is so big it got disconnected from itself
confuse itself with falsehood but eventually it came home the
truth cannot not love itself it must love itself otherwise
it's not true this false and that is how love
and truth are actually identical at a metaphysical essential level
and that is why there is no full awakening without
the realization of love if you think you're awake or
enlightened and you haven't realized love you haven't fully realized
truth you've only got one side of the coin you
think you have truth but you're missing the love and
conversely if you are an emotional person and you find
it easy to love people to love animals to love
children and yours a sort of lovey dovey type yet
your whole life you know you've been loving maybe you're
this probably is more appropriate to women or to more
feminine leaning men you know women tend to be more
lovey dovey and that tends to be their approach to
spirituality it's likely oh I don't like talking about truth
you know truth is so bleak and harsh and brutal
love love is what I want I want more love
in my life I want the spiritual path towards Awakening
through love I don't really care about the truth Leah
why should I care about the truth it's just a
some philosophical my new show or it's some sort of
technical thing this truth that you keep talking about I
don't care about I just want love but what you're
failing to realize is that love is truth your love
isn't complete until you realize that the thing you love
the most is the truth otherwise what are you loving
if you're not loving the truth you're loving falsehood which
makes you a devil and your love is your love
is divided it's not total truth in love or one
don't forget it learning self love is the point of
human life if you love yourself completely you would have
no more problems left in your life let me repeat
that again if you love yourself completely you would have
no more problems in your life this is true really
think about that contemplate that one is it true and
if it is what does that mean what should you
do about it alright that's it I've done here please
click like button for me and come check out actualize
that org that's my website you'll find the life purpose
course the book list my blog where I'm posting new
stuff you can also click the link down below in
the description for the patreon link if you'd like to
support this work help me to spread it in the
future I'm building a little bit of a nest egg
that will help me with an advertising budget and so
forth try to expand actualize that already in the years
to come I think that will be a little handy
and we can spread the word get more people to
realize the power of some of these teachings because they're
pretty rare and otherwise it's difficult for people to find
them and I just want to leave you with one
last sort of tip or warning I guess be careful
with watching only a few of my videos I have
a lot of content at this point over 300 videos
you don't need to watch them all of course not
but there's a trap here the trap is that you
come in and you watch a couple of my recent
videos and the stuff that I talk about now is
so advanced that it's very easy to get lost and
to misunderstand various words or phrases that I use because
you have to understand that we've been kind of on
a journey here with actual network for seven years some
people have been growing with me throughout this whole process
if you just watch one or two episodes you're gonna
easily easily take things out of context easily misunderstand things
make wrong assumptions about me make wrong assumptions about these
teachings certain things you know I'm this this work really
is a deep body of work that builds upon itself
we're building very we built a very deep foundation over
the years you do have to go back and watch
some of those very deep foundational episodes about epistemology about
metaphysics about quantum mechanics and other things you know groundwork
has been laid and I can't rehash all of it
every single time in every new episode so especially if
you're new to this and you've only watched a few
of the recent episodes you're gonna have to if you
want to get the full value of this work to
really understand it you're gonna have to go backwards and
really dig through my work yeah it takes time it
takes time that's one of the biggest challenges of this
work is that it's so voluminous it's enormous it's huge
organizing it all is a nightmare it's really difficult to
organize this stuff and to break things down into separate
little episodes and to put them in order of which
you should watch them it was really difficult to do
that that's one of my biggest struggles with this Iraq
my mind over it every every week about what's the
best way to organize this material and it's very difficult
to organize it because it's just so sprawling that you
could spend a year organizing it and then by the
end of that year you think okay I'm done but
then you realize that oh well that's just a little
piece and now I have to reorganize even that piece
because there's more pieces that come into play and so
every time there's new pieces coming into play and everything
needs to be reorganized and you know people are coming
in in this at different times at different points so
they have to kind of line go through this giant
web and crawl the whole thing to really get a
sense of what its shape is it's enormous it's almost
like we're trying to look at an elephant through a
microscope you know every episode is a little a little
peek at an elephant through a microscope and to get
a sense of the whole elephant you've got to probably
watch at least 30 50 videos maybe a hundred of
my videos to start to see the full elephant well
even that's not gonna enough I mean it's just gonna
be an outline just a guess for you usually gonna
have to do with a lot of the practices it's
not just gonna be videos you have to read books
I mean I'm asking a lot of you guys and
that's because the whole channel from the very beginning has
been about depth depth that's one of my top values
in life is depth the videos are deep they're long
because I wanted to be deep I don't want to
do videos that aren't deep I want to go deep
I want to go balls deep in this [ __
] that's what I'm interested in you know if if
I'm having sex I don't want to just like stick
the tip in and then like be okay cool good
ten little 10 10 minute video about God or ten
minute video about love that's like sticking the tip in
once and then coming that's what that is that's the
equivalent of that in the bedroom like you want a
good deep [ __ ] that's what you want and
you want it to last for a good hour that's
what you really want right I mean if you if
you love life if you love sex that's what you
want you want that depth but of course that depth
takes commitment from you takes work is it worth it
huh I think it is give it a shot study
it for 10 years and then and then let me
know you
