[Music] you welcome to the next installment in this mini-series
on spiral dynamics where we will be talking about stage
green make sure you watch the prior episodes stage blue
and stage orange so the progression that we're dealing with
here on the spiral is beige purple red blue orange
and now we're at green which I will be giving
you many many examples probably over a hundred different examples
of in this episode and this is another one of
those episodes like orange which is gonna be very useful
to you because the majority of you are probably within
stage green somewhere now I know I said that within
stage orange as well but you know what upon thinking
about a little bit more what I came to realize
that many people when I started off actualized or and
five years ago resonated with me who were orange because
that's the kind of stuff I was talking about success
space achievement oriented sort of self-help and then I transitioned
into more metaphysical topics more stage yellow topics and that
probably alien at a lot of stage orange people because
they would have found these metaphysical topics to be very
impractical so anyway is probably many of you are stage
Orange or I mean sorry stage green and actually just
like most people in first world countries you're probably stuck
somewhere between orange and green and very likely you are
50% orange 50% green or some combination thereof that's what
a lot of people in developed first world countries are
in especially if they're not in the rural areas not
in the country but in the suburbs or in the
urban areas and especially those people who would have gone
to college and have college degrees and are from sort
of a middle class and well-educated sort of areas because
your level of development corresponds to your level of education
so this stage is going to be very important for
you to hear about because you're gonna hear about all
the limitations of stage green and how to go about
transcending it into yellow which is tier two thinking which
is going to be some very advanced stuff so this
is going to be exciting again I want to give
credit to Claire graves dawn Beck and Christopher Cohen for
developing the bulk of this model but I will be
supplying a lot of examples and insights here that I
sort of developed myself by thinking about this a lot
just in trying to understand this model for myself what
is the essence of green we could say that it's
relativistic caring communal and environmental so the pendulum has swung
once again as it does with every stage it alternates
between serving the self versus serving the collective and this
oscillates back and forth so blue was serving the collective
orange was serving the self and now green swings back
to serving the collective but in a more elevated way
a less dogmatic way than blue was doing it so
for green were now sacrificing the self not for some
afterlife ideal of heaven but we're sacrificing the self to
create a more human community here on earth and to
be accepted by this community be a part of this
community green recognizes the validity of other cultures and species
which blue had some real problems with Green recognizes the
validity of different races it's very multicultural and cosmopolitan in
this manner and green is all about equality and peace
for all world peace justice for everybody so green is
sort of reacting to the in justices of blue and
of orange green is a rejection of shallow materialism which
came with orange and it's return to humanity and to
spirituality which also orange rejected so green is sort of
shifting away from just the cold logical rationalist scientific metaphysics
into a more new agey hippie sort of semi spiritual
but not religious in the dogmatic sense that blue is
religious and green is all about love for your fellow
man if you want in caps all of green into
one word it could be either peace or love well
that's two words so when does Green emerge why does
green develop well like we were talking about in the
previous episode about orange is that orange takes capitalism and
materialism and rationalism to its pinnacle and it turns out
that when you do that you start to see some
nasty limits and then green starts to emerge as those
limits become obvious and we see that we can't solve
all of the world's problem by more money by more
economy by more factories by more pollution by more Wall
Street shenanigans right that's not going to solve the world's
problems so Green emerges when materialism and success success fails
to feed the human spirit you got a bunch of
money in orange but then you realized money doesn't buy
me happiness and there's still a hole inside of myself
I thought I would be happy and complete after I
got my trophy wife and after I got my big
house and after I got my fancy sports car and
after I banged a bunch of girls and after I
got myself a Rolex and all this but then I
discovered that's like man this is very disappointing it's so
Hollow so I've chased success I've achieved success and now
I'm asking myself is that all there is could there
be more to life what am I missing here wait
a minute and then I start to realize that hey
wait a minute science and technology and capitalism are not
all there is to life and that actually I've been
chasing the wrong thing I've been chasing success when really
what I should have been chasing is I should have
been chasing connection and relationships life is not about things
life is about people it's about relationships it's about deep
human bonds that's what's really satisfying and that's when I'm
starting to move into green and as orange I was
always in this sort of competitive dog-eat-dog world of business
and now I'm starting to find that that gets weary
and competition is draining it's actually bad for your health
wouldn't be nicer if I just was able to cooperate
why don't we all just cooperate rather than competing with
each other is that a smarter way to live since
we're all part of this community see green is waking
up to the sense that hey it's not just about
my own success it's about the success of the whole
community and now for green the community the sense of
what community means has expanded beyond blue because blue if
you remember was also about promoting the community except for
blue is more about promoting the civilization my civilization and
so it was my civilization against all the other civilizations
but for green this has been softened and now the
sense of community is not just my race it's not
just my country or my state it's the entire world
we're all human beings there's no real boundaries between this
is matter what race you are what gender you are
does it matter we're all part of the same community
we all basically want the same things we want happiness
we want love we want to live peacefully with each
other everybody basically wants this so let's give it to
them that's what's Greens about so green develops the sort
of desire for human connection and love or rather orange
develops that desire and that's what moves orange into green
there's recognition of this larger global community and now as
this happens green starts to notice all the inequality and
oppression in the world that was caused by blue and
by orange materialism and that starts to disturb green it's
like wait a minute why is there so much poverty
and why are there these sweatshops and why are you
being exploited so slavery in the world this is this
is a travesty we need to rise everybody up we
need to equalize the playing field also orange as it's
moving into green starts to realize the environmental impact that
orange has been having and this starts to disturb orange
and that's what turns it green because orange didn't care
about the environment didn't care about drilling for oil in
Alaska didn't care about oil spills didn't care about pollution
didn't care about global warming know this stuff mattered because
all that mattered was how much money I could get
so if I could pollute a little bit here and
there on who cares I'm just cutting corners to advance
my success that's what orange is about but green now
develops sort of social consciousness and now Green says wait
a minute were destroying Mother Earth so there's this sort
of sense of ecology now and now or instructs I
feel a little guilty about all the collateral damage that
orange has done and that moves them into green there's
a realization that orange is unsustainable we can't keep doing
what we're doing forever we can't keep polluting we can't
just keep fishing we can't keep killing all the whales
because everything's everything's gonna die and we're gonna live in
a in a sort of bleak dystopian future we need
a more human heart centered approach and also what moves
orange into green is sometimes a health crisis because orange
was working so hard and eating all this toxic food
and living in this toxic environment that a lot of
times Orange has serious health issues some kind of disease
gets poisoned gets overstressed gets burned out from overwork and
now orange realizes no I got a I got a
chill out a little bit I've been too neurotic with
chasing success and I got to start to enjoy life
because look I've been working 80-hour weeks that I've been
acquiring all this money but I haven't even had time
to enjoy my money I haven't even had time to
go on a nice vacation or to spend time with
my children I spent 10 years working my children went
through their through their early childhood years I didn't even
get to them because I was working so hard on
Wall Street now I'm gonna take some time off and
spend it with the kids going to the zoo it's
that sort of mentality if you really want to understand
the core of green think of green as a shift
from the heavy left brain thinking of orange now into
right brain thinking or think of green as opening up
of the heart that's really what it is it's a
flowering of your humanity it's the flowering of empathy and
compassion and a sense of community within you also you
could think of green as mellowing out orange because orange
was just too addicted to work and success and achievement
and was not engaging enough with actually enjoying the journey
and savoring the human qualities or aspects of life now
let me give you a list of green values this
is all the stuff that is near and dear to
Greene's heart if you're green all of these are gonna
resonate with you you're gonna feel like this is what
life is about this is what reality should be about
this is what our politics should be about this is
what education should be about this is what the books
that I read be about this is what the videos
I see on YouTube should be about so here's green
values and you can use these key words to really
make a deep rapport with a green person love heart
soul empathy intimacy kindness compassion mercy and leniency humanism liberalism
social progress equality gender equality racial equality economic equality social
equality green fundamentally believes that everyone is equal Galit arianism
and democracy these are huge for green Green is anti
materialist anti-consumerist and anti greed Green values having a social
conscience green values supporting humanitarian causes green values activism and
protests Green has a live-and-let-live attitude Green is sort of
chilled and laid-back although not always remember that these are
generalizations and so don't expect every single green person to
fit this list perfectly and don't expect yourself to fit
this list perfectly this is sort of green distilled down
to its essence green values diversity and multiculturalism green values
cosmopolitanism green values flattening of hierarchies which were developed in
blue which blue valued so much green values cultural relativism
which just means that green values all sorts of different
cultures and green doesn't believe that its own culture is
superior to every other one the way that blue did
green really values relationships and human bonding pacifism and peace
finding common ground amongst people so rather than fighting what
we should do is we should sit down and talk
it out and find common ground green values harmony living
in harmony with your environment and also harmony between people
green values human well-being interpersonal skills warm interactions hugs when
you see green people hugging each other and it makes
you uneasy that means you're in orange you're not comfortable
with hugs with human affection and for a lot of
left brain thinkers that's a that's something that you need
to get over so you're just warm interaction that's something
that's foreign to many autistic type of people who sit
at home playing video games all day yeah of course
if you spend 10 20 years playing video games then
you don't even know how to hug a human being
it feels uncomfortable to you but that's what green is
all about when you see a big convention of green
people gathering together how do they greet each other with
big warm hugs and kisses and and this sort of
stuff which you don't see in the business setting can
you imagine a corporate boardroom in orange corporate boardroom where
everybody walks in and hugs each other no it's all
formal and stiff and mechanical so Green is bringing the
humanity in the heart back into human interactions green values
pleasing everybody in the group we're trying to build the
consensus here we're not trying to exclude anybody green values
sensitivity femininity and this one is huge because stage blue
well really even even before that stage red and blue
and orange were all very patreon patreon and sort of
an exhibition of alpha male values it was all about
power and dominance in various different ways and green is
finally where femininity is allowed to flourish and again a
lot of left brain dominant autistic type men and nerds
have a big problem with this because they're sort of
hooked on this sort of alpha out alpha everybody else
mentality you're trying to be alpha he has a young
man you haven't found her identity yet and so you
have a problem with being feminine you think that that's
somehow emasculates you or makes you weak when actually in
fact which you realize when you go to the bottom
of I mean to the to the top of orange
you realize that actually if I add femininity in with
my masculinity that's gonna strengthen my masculinity that's actually gonna
make me a stronger man so green also values teamwork
dialoguing sharing ideas and feelings mind-altering drugs psychedelics and weed
so forth exploring altered states of consciousness which is something
that blue was too scared of that was taboo for
blue and orange didn't care about either because in oranges
mind there's only hard physical reality so exploring altered states
of consciousness this is some sort of woowoo stuff that
orange doesn't want to do green values spirituality Green can
be spiritual but not religious in the way that blue
was and especially green values a communal sort of spirituality
so you see people coming together in your in yoga
circles meditation circles and doing spirituality it's sort of communal
way green values environment and ecology going back to nature
learning lessons for mother nature the wisdom of nature green
values sustainability recycling human centered and heart centered communities rather
than cold heartless machines where the human is just a
cog in the machine here every human in this little
organization that green creates is gonna know each other there's
gonna be connections it's sort of a social network rather
than a top-down hierarchy green values protecting the vulnerable and
helping the downtrodden because when you're empathetic and your heart
opens up you realize that's who I should be caring
about I should be caring about the poor and the
hungry and the diseased and the crippled and and and
all this because the rich people don't care about them
so who's gonna care about them other than me green
values - redistribution of resources and leveling the playing field
so everyone has an equal chance because Green is sad
to see all the gross inequality that capitalism has created
green values inclusiveness so that everybody in the group gets
an opportunity to express themselves and to speak their agenda
so Green doesn't want to exclude anybody and Green is
very big on tolerance green values open-mindedness being open to
new ideas green values free love and intimate sex sex
is deeper for green than for orange for orange sex
was just like blowing your load and then getting on
with life it was about the excitement of it whereas
for green sex is gonna be more about the intimacy
and the connection that's the difference between I guess left-brain
sex and and right brain sex green value sex education
because Green is not shamed by sex the way that
blue was Green is comfortable talking about it green values
cooperation versus competition green values animals children the disabled and
minorities unlike the prior stages green values creativity beauty and
art for art's sake not art to make lots of
money but just art for the sake of doing art
so for green art is more true because art comes
from the heart it doesn't come from cold rational business
strategy green values gurus there's a lot of guru worshipping
going on with green green values bringing people of the
world together green values socialism green values crying and expressing
vulnerable emotions green values intuition / logic the right brain
like I said and green values health food and exercise
more than the prior stages so here are some characteristics
of green Green is about we the accepting versus I
the capable orange was I the capable I am the
capable one and now it's not know what we as
a community are going to be accepting and loving of
everybody green is sacrificing the self for this social network
community for green feelings and caring's superseded cold rationality green
is about joining a community to experience shared growth together
so that we're not just growing individually I'm not just
doing partial developed by myself that I'm doing personal development
together with the community and that enriches the entire process
of personal development green reached reaches decisions through reconciliation and
consensus which sometimes can take a long time Green is
all about getting together and voting on stuff and talking
it out rather than somebody just handing you down orders
from up on high because there's no hierarchy in green
or a flat hierarchy Green is about dialoguing and mutual
understanding Green defines goals and objectives in human terms so
rather than judging my success or progress based on next
quarters profits or rise in GDP or some cold quantitative
metric like that Green is you gonna use some kind
of qualitative metric like happiness or love or peace something
soft and fuzzy like that which of course drives orange
mad because orange wants to quantify everything into orange doesn't
make sense how a goal or an objective can be
something like love or happiness this is fuzzy stuff for
orange doesn't compute so if you want to think of
orange like data the the robot from Star Trek it's
kind of like that he can't really understand emotions even
though he tries to he's trying to use his logical
left brain to understand emotions but really the only way
you can understand emotions is through the heart Green is
characterized by seeking personal growth and introspection so there's more
emphasis on personal development than there was even in orange
because in orange personal development was just like personal development
to improve my skills so I could be more successful
whereas in green personal development is oriented more how do
I make myself more aware of my emotions my shadow
side how do I become more loving and compassionate human
being it's sort of softening of the orange style personal
development Green now is open to new age concepts that
used to freak orange out stuff like the soul spirit
reincarnation Buddhism the Tao yoga shamanism karma consciousness love intuition
EQ or emotional intelligence energy Qi finding God within alternative
medicine Reiki past live psychedelics astral projection channeling channeling mist
mysticism Indian gurus healing crystals all sorts of organic stuff
veganism Gaia mother earth as a living being all of
these concepts which were antithetical to oranges metaphysics now become
very acceptable for greens metaphysics and green loves this stuff
and actually green tends to go overboard with all this
New Age stuff which is where we get this sort
of stereotype of the New Age hippie green is characterized
by connecting with nature green is characterized by development of
compassion and social networks green is taller and accepting of
different views green seeks to communicate not just content but
also feelings and again this is something that's different from
orange because orange didn't care about feelings when orange people
talk to each other they're very pragmatic it's like two
computer programmers talking with each other what do they talk
about they just talk about the cold hard facts and
then they move on to their computers right they don't
talk about their feelings about the cold hard facts it's
like just give me the cold hard facts whereas green
is like no let's take the time let's make the
space to discuss our emotions how do you feel about
this which can drive orange nuts it's sort of the
difference between the way that in a relationship a man
and a woman might talk to each other you know
the man is gonna talk more from a left-brain perspective
just give me the facts and the woman is gonna
talk more from a emotional perspective like how do I
feel about the facts I don't care for the facts
as a woman I care about how I feel about
the facts the story behind the facts Green is characterized
by entrepreneurship but tempered now with heart and humanity so
it's not that Green is against business entirely there are
many entrepreneurs who are green or moving into green there's
actually many entrepreneurs for example in Silicon Valley who are
right at that cusp between like 50% orange 50% green
they have one foot in both worlds and so this
is the type of entrepreneur maybe like a good example
would be L on Musk someone who is very success
or II nted and still all about money and technology
and all this stuff but still he's now thinking about
how do I create technology and how do I use
my business in a more responsible manner such that I'm
actually advancing mankind and I'm creating the kind of technologies
that are actually gonna help sustain the planet rather than
destroy the planet so that would be the difference between
an entrepreneur like Elon Musk and an entrepreneur like someone
who runs some big oil company or a giant bank
on Wall Street Green is characterized by nurturing employees for
orange employees were just cogs in the machine for green
green actually cares a green CEO will actually go he'll
talk to his employees he'll actually ask them how they
feel he'll ask for input it'll be a more democratic
process Green is characterized sometimes by being emotionally needy that
can be a weakness Green tends to reject displays of
affluence so green isn't so much about getting the fancy
Rolex and the gold chain and the sort of stuff
it's more about developing yourself on the inside for green
it's not what's on the outside of a person that
matters it's more what's on the inside that matters and
this is very different from orange so an orange person
like it when an orange man pursues a woman it's
all about her appearance how hot she is and so
he's gonna rank her on a scale of one to
ten and if she's above seven maybe he'll sleep with
her and below that he won't so this is how
an orange guy thinks but a green guy is gonna
actually sort of start to abandon that whole notion see
the toxicity of that and say you know what it's
not about just them the outward appearance is also about
what's on the inside it's about her psychologies about how
compassionate she is how much she cares about animals in
the world and all this how good of a person
she is what kind of energy and find but she
give me so it's it's it's a deeper connection and
Green is characterized by being individualistic in a conformist way
which is an interesting paradox individual in a conformist way
and of course this is definitely possible you see this
in high school all the time is you have high
school kids like certain subcultures like the Goths or the
punks or something like that which are trying to be
individualistic but they do it in a conformist way so
Green is also sort of doing it that way in
blue conformity was very strong and everybody wore uniforms and
it basically everybody conform to the to the strict dictates
of their culture whereas in green it's all about yeah
there's different cultures we can pick and choose a little
bit here and there Green everybody will dress differently and
be individualistic but still they do it in a conformist
sort of way so they will all dress and they
will all wear you know like feather or jewelry or
some sort of hippie tie-dye clothes or some sort of
natural cotton fibers or Lululemon yoga pants you know something
like this you ever you ever see that every girl
in in Whole Foods wears Lululemon yoga pants I mean
it's not a problem but it's just it's funny it's
like you're trying to be individualistic but really in a
conformist sort of way all right so let's now get
into all the juicy examples of green right at the
top of the list I have for you perhaps the
epitome of green if you take green to 11 and
you still want a healthy functioning green Burning Man is
the perfect example if you haven't heard of Burning Man
I highly recommend you check it out go to YouTube
Google some Burning Man videos watch some documentaries about it's
a pretty amazing pretty amazing little community that event well
it's a large community so it's this giant hippie City
that gets created every single year around August time in
the northern desert in Nevada it's just like in the
middle of nowhere up north almost bye-bye Oregon in a
corner in the north west corner of Nevada everybody in
the world comes together and they create a makeshift city
in the middle of the desert and it's like 50,000
people they have photographs from AirPlay aerial shots from airplanes
of the city it's gigantic it's like a and they
bring everything there because there's no facilities nothing it's just
literally in the the desert and this whole thing is
like a a celebration glorification of all of Green's values
it's all these hippies that come there and they're all
doing psychedelics and drugs and and mute there's music festivals
and they're they build these artistic sculptures and all sorts
of wacky costumes everybody is dressed like Birdman and feathers
and flowers and and lights and flashy stuff so like
it's crazy and they do this for a week and
then they leave and of course as they leave they
pick up every scrap of trash and litter that they
left behind so they leave the desert completely clean the
way that it was when they first arrived because these
are green people so they're environmentally conscious right they're not
gonna trash a desert so look at that that's a
really really good example of healthy green and in fact
if you want to really grow into green and to
know what green is all about I recommend you go
to one of these Burning Man style festivals they have
the Maine Burning Man which is in August every year
tickets can be hard to get they tend to be
expensive because they so many people want to go there
it's just this like this amazing cultural phenomenon every year
it's getting hard to sustain it but but they also
have smaller Burning Man type festivals all around the world
in different states around the US and all different countries
all throughout the year so Google for those check them
out and go there and just see what it's like
meet those kinds of people and see how they think
they will think along this whole list of values that
I'm talking about here they're gonna be very anti Orange
so of course other examples include the hippies the entire
New Age movement and all the New Age stuff that
there is that you've heard about the Green Party Greenpeace
vegans and vegetarians liberals progressives Democrats Bernie Sanders is a
really good example of Green President Obama was definitely an
example of green I put him at somewhere between green
and yellow he had those sorts of qualities he also
of course had orange qualities but the reason that the
conservative right hated Obama so much was precisely because blue
reacts very negatively against green because green is sort of
a letting loose and this is kind of free love
and it's a lack of discipline whereas Orange was all
about discipline and conformity and Dogma and kind of like
sticking to to cold hard like biblical scripture Green is
kind of like letting your love loose and that freaks
blue out blue is not comfortable with that so that
is the difference between if you want to boil down
the difference between a conservative and a liberal is that
a conservative skews more blue and a liberal skews more
green whereas the businesspeople are sort of in the middle
and so the American political parties the Republicans and Democrats
the Republicans are mostly halfway between blue and orange and
the Democrats are mostly halfway between orange and green and
so they are in this sort of Perpetual tug-of-war with
one another and the more right-wing you are the more
blue you skew and the more left-wing you are I
feel like a radical progressive than the more full-on green
that you skew so a great example of this is
TYT The Young Turks YouTube channel everybody there is very
progressive they have a very progressive political ideology and so
they're a really good example of Green Bill Maher The
Daily Show Jon Stewart Stephen Colbert also sam cedars the
majority report have you watched that one it's a smaller
sort of progressive youtube channel about politics actually really good
I highly recommend it sam cedars is a really good
example of a healthy version of green because he's not
one of these green people who's just like totally radically
unrealistically idealistically liberal and progressive but it's sort of progressivism
and liberalism which embodies all of the green values but
in a still in a rational manner such that the
policies are mostly rational and and very well explained very
reasonable so it's it's a perfect blend between like right
brain and left brain so you can check that out
John Oliver of course Democracy Now is on the YouTube
channel which is of all the liberal news media that
the the Fox News and the Conservatives are are up
in arms about like CNN MSNBC these of course skew
green and the reason that they skew green is not
because they're bleeding heart liberals many of them are really
I mean not that far away from orange because you
can understand CNN MSNBC first and foremost these are orange
companies because they are out to earn money they are
not radical progressives that want to equalize and level the
playing field no they're they're very corporatist and in that
sense they're they're rather conservative they're there to preserve the
status quo but they appear like a liberal news media
to people who are within the blue orange range you
see how you view other people will depend on where
you are in the spiral so it looks liberal when
you're very conservative so it's relative you see these judgments
are relative you've got Vox vise these organizations who talk
a lot about politics they're quite progressive the New York
Times MSNBC host like Rachel Maddow and Chris O'Donnell CNN
hosts Keith Olbermann Michael Moore Al Gore Donny Deutsch Noam
Chomsky no chump he's a really good example of a
green intellectual like really top-notch top-notch green a healthy green
example Sean Penn Al Franken social workers community organizers spiritual
meetup groups university culture so when you hear about universities
being very liberal and progressive that's what I'm talking about
the social justice warriors political correctness LGBTQ rights gender pronouns
protecting minorities post-modernism feminism all of this that I'm talking
about here now is getting into the Jordan Peterson territory
what he calls the neo-marxists now just very quickly the
problem with this Jordan Peterson is a complicated figure again
I can't really go into all the nitty-gritty details here
but just so you kind of understand the big picture
a lot of the scientific stuff he talks about he
talks a lot about psychic all psychological studies and and
Jungian archetypes and all this sort of stuff that's fine
it's not a problem most of that stuff is accurate
and you can learn some good lessons from that the
problem is that trade pearson sneaks in his sort of
sort of conservative political agenda into all of that in
a sort of sneaky way and what he does is
he actually demonizes all of green he takes this green
category which is this very broad category of all sorts
of people and most of them are very sane very
rational very down-to-earth people they're not crazy radical leftists right
most people are not that but he demonizes them because
of some negative experience that he personally has had within
universities fine he had a few negative experiences okay I'll
grant him that but that doesn't mean that now every
green or progressive person is a neo-marxist the problem with
calling green people neo-marxists is that the people who are
listening Jordan Peterson tend to sit in the blue to
orange end of the spectrum on spiral dynamics so when
they start to hear nero marxist they start to think
of marxist the soviet Marxists the Communists so that triggers
in them that sort of stereotype and now they have
this knee-jerk reaction against all the green stuff now Jordan
Peterson Innocents radicalizes in these people and now these people
get more stuck with in blue and with an orange
and they start to cling to that and they are
now not opening up to the next stage they need
to pass through see Green is not the end stage
Green is the stage you will pass through does green
have excesses and dangers of course of course are there
unhealthy manifestations of green of course every stage on the
spiral has unhealthy manifestations the danger is to overly focus
on the unhealthy aspects of the stage above you because
when you do that you demonize that stage you judges
so much that you can't actually pass through it and
so Jordan Peterson himself was suffering from this because what
he would really want to do if he wanted to
develop himself to the highest levels and to actually connect
with the God that he talks about so much in
theory if to connect with it in practice is that
he would actually need to let go of his political
agenda against the neo-marxist let that go and then go
and actually like go to burning and hang out with
these people realize that these are these are fun-loving cool
people they're not crazy radical leftists and you will realize
like oh there's something I can learn there I need
to open my heart I need to open theirs I
need to open the the intuitive capacities of my body
in my in my mind and I need to become
much more right brain than left brained I need to
see the limitations of orange and blue that I was
stuck on and then I will go into green I
will join green and I will ultimately pass through green
and so or into yellow and turquoise and so forth
you see so the problem is that there's sort of
this barrier Peterson is creating the sort of barrier for
other people not to pass through including for himself and
that's a shame so that's that's my gripe with Peterson
and Peterson has some elements of yellow as well but
he can't fully enter yellow because he's still so busy
judging and being angry you can see the anger and
the bitterness just in his tone you can feel it
there's some kind of deeper shadow side anger issue that
he hasn't resolved and that's why he's got this ax
to grind against the neo-marxist so what I recommend is
that you drop this label neo-marxist because really Green it's
a real disservice to call them neo-marxists because Marxists were
actually blue and red those were Soviet Marxist these green
that we're talking about they are not going to create
some sort of radical revolution to destroy society the way
that Jordan Peterson paints it out to be it's not
gonna be like that that's not what they want what
they want is they want a softening of this just
stifle and capitalism they want a softening of that and
you may agree or disagree with the politics there and
you may have your opinions about how far green we
should go and that's all fine and you can criticize
some aspects of green because there are some excesses of
green that's fine but the main thing is that you
want to whoa into green and past green rather than
waste your time criticizing it and the more you start
coming up with these stupid labels like social justice warriors
and famine Nazis and all this and neo-marxist you come
up with these labels it doesn't help you to develop
yourself it only hinders you other examples of green abortion
rights Planned Parenthood pacifism ACLU it's a me-too movement and
Tifa that would be a sort of unhealthy radical example
the prob will be to think that everything I'm talking
about here falls under the label anti feh that would
be the big mistake that's the problem if you see
for example on Fox News whenever something with an Tifa
comes up they will use an Tifa as a way
to smear the entire green stage of the spiral which
of course is a big problem because they're in a
blue orange stage so really they have more growing to
do to just to get to Green but of course
the ego-mind loves to demonize that which it is afraid
of and that which would force it to grow and
to evolve to a higher level of consciousness other examples
support groups tree huggers bleeding hearts Care Bears animal rights
anti-war protests Occupy Wall Street that was a very green
movement charities nonprofits NGOs organic farming organic food recycling global
warming music festivals flower children of the 60s in fact
the entire 60s counterculture movement of the hippies that was
a very Green Haight Ashbury Woodstock the beatniks the Beatles
John Lennon Bob Marley Willie Nelson of course marijuana legalization
is a very green topic psychedelics Timothy Leary Terence Mckenna
ramadasa C psychedelics are not effective on blue people because
blue people are so closed-minded they won't be able to
to really appreciate the insights that psychedelics deliver because they're
not open enough and they won't really work on orange
people because orange people are so set on success and
personal achievement and sort of selfishness that they're too busy
to really delve into psychedelics in fact what will happen
to you as an orange person if you start to
take psychedelics and this is what happen to me is
that you're gonna be in this sort of business phase
where you're doing business you're working really hard then you
take these psychedelics these psychedelics open you up and if
you fully surrender to them you'll really like holy all
this work and business and money chasing sex that I'm
doing all this stuff is so shallow compared to what
the psychedelic showed me and so what's gonna happen for
you maybe for a year or two like what happened
with me is that your productivity is gonna tank and
if you're not prepared for this you might think oh
no this is a problem my business is crashing I'm
learning less money I'm having less sex I'm having less
sport I'm buying less sports cars your productivity is tanking
right but that's just because you're working less you're realizing
that working is so hollow compared to connecting with the
metaphysical aspects of reality and the soak the the psychedelics
what they do is they sort of slow you down
which is actually a good thing that's exactly what you
need but for orange who doesn't realize that that's exactly
what he needs that can create a problem so watch
out for that psychotherapy progressive schoolteachers liberal Supreme Court judges
the 9th district Circuit Court of Appeals socialists the redistribution
of wealth drum circles neo shamans communes actually let me
make a point about socialists so again the Conservatives and
blue-and-orange will make a big boogeyman out of socialism again
this conflate s' the socialism of the Soviet era and
the Chinese socialism which is actually blue it's a dogmatic
ideological hierarchical form of of socialism and actually that's why
I failed versus socialism at Green socialism at Green is
not interested in for example eliminating private property and confiscating
all your wealth that's not what it wants to do
yes socialists want attack two more yes they want more
government programs yes they have liberal policy positions you may
or may not agree with yes of course but don't
paint them as this boogeyman like they're gonna come and
they're gonna take away all your private property no look
at how socialism works in northern European countries for example
uh they still have private property sure they have high
taxes and stuff and maybe you don't want to go
there maybe you don't want that kind of politics in
America that's fine that's your prerogative that's your perspective as
blue and orange but don't paint this out to be
a boogeyman socialist societies definitely work we see examples of
them working in many ways they work better than American
societies those societies have better access to health care they
generally have more equality they have benefits for for mothers
maternity leaves vacation and all this so there's a lot
of good stuff that comes from those kinds of policies
so be careful into falling to the sword and Peterson
trap of painting the Socialists of green with the Socialists
of blue because Jordan Peterson will tell you like oh
but look at all the evils of the twentieth century
and how terrible that was and how many tens of
millions or hundreds of millions of people died under socialism
that is what I mean by creating a boogeyman that
is not what happens with green socialists leaning policies now
of course there can always be excesses at every stage
there can be excesses at every stage policy can be
damaging in different ways to different segments of society so
of course there can be excesses I'm not saying that
socialism should just be let you know free rein to
do anything it wants of course if you do that
there will be excesses and dangers but that's true of
any policy whether it's conservative or liberal you always need
moderation you always need balance you always need harmony other
examples Doctors Without Borders universal health care sensitivity training non-denominational
churches or green health food stores Whole Foods of course
a good bastion of green people go there one thing
I would say about Whole Foods is that it's really
sort of a a blend of half orange half green
it's not it's not pure green by any means it's
still a business and a lot of people who go
there are sort of upscale businessí types and you know
um yuppies and entrepreneurs like to shop there a lot
of orange people like to shop at Whole Foods just
because it has good food an interesting example about Whole
Foods which illustrates perfectly the mindset and value system of
green is the following I read that long ago in
Whole Foods early history they used to sell rabbit meat
at the meat section at the Whole Foods but apparently
the the green customer base who visits Whole Foods were
so offended by this because these were bunnies basically chopped
up bunny meat was lying there next to the cows
and the chickens of course there's no reason why a
bunny is is any more valuable or deserves more compassion
than chicken or a cow but but in Green's thinking
because it's sensitive because it's more emotional when it makes
that connection with seeing bunnies butchered at the at the
butcher counter it gets offended and so there was such
a brouhaha about this that Whole Foods was forced to
remove rabbit meat from its shelves and you know I
don't know I haven't gone to all the Whole Foods
all around the US but the Whole Foods that I
have been to in my area in California in in
Nevada in Texas I have not seen any butchered rabbit
meat there so I guess that's their policy but that
shows you sort of how Green thinks and a little
bit of the hypocrisy of green so if you are
blue or orange and you feel that Green is being
hypocritical we'll get to that we'll get to that at
the end of this video I'll be talking about the
unhealthy and excesses and dangers of green yes there definitely
is some hypocrisy within green but of course you gotta
also recognize that there's hypocrisy with every stage every stage
has its own forms of hip ah cracy so don't
be too smug and too self-righteous other examples western yoga
reiki Western forms of Buddhism massage therapy chiropractors nutri paths
meditation as a fad trans oh no meditation crystals Yanni
eggs juice cleanses detox green smoothies colonics spas scented candles
burning of incense aromatherapy tie-dye t-shirts kombucha probiotics soy gluten-free
products farmers markets non GMOs Fairtrade che guevara Oprah Winfrey
Nelson Mandela Pope Francis he's an interesting character because to
me he looks like he's got one foot in blue
and one foot in green which is actually kind of
cool I actually like this Pope because traditionally I wouldn't
like a pope because he would be all blue but
this Pope actually has heart like he comes out and
he has some very liberal positions on certain things he
cares about global warming he cares about the environment he
cares about children and this and that now of course
there's still a lot of corruption in the church so
I'm not saying he's he's flawless and he's perfect there's
still a lot of dogma in the Catholic Church which
I'm sure is imprinted in his mind for the rest
of his life so there's definite problems there but as
far as Pope's go he's a pretty good example because
his blue is tempered by green when religion starts and
religion and church groups start to move more into green
they become a lot more healthy and a lot less
susceptible to the criticisms that orange had of fundamentalist religion
because they stopped being fundamentalist and they actually start to
embody more the the core teachings of Jesus or other
spiritual teachers which was really just about love it was
about caring for poor people caring for sick people it
was about social justice I mean that's fundamentally what Jesus
was preaching it was social justice Jesus was a social
justice warrior flipping over the moneylenders table what is that
but social justice I mean Jesus was a socialist or
a communist in the most in the most like basic
sense what just so ironic because when you look at
the fox news audience and fox news anchors and they
talk about Jesus as being uh as though Jesus was
a conservative a conservative capitalist that's not what Jesus was
Jesus was a radical leftist he was so radically leftist
that if he were alive today he like the right
would completely tear him apart they would demonize him to
no end which is so ironic but of course that's
exactly what brew religion does because blew religion cannot deal
with the freedom and the radical open-mindedness and just a
radical openness of a deeply mystical spiritual person that runs
counter to all of the religious dogmas you see but
that's a topic for another day other examples anti-vaxxers Hollywood
politics which like I said in the orange episode is
distinct from Hollywood business Hollywood business is orange Hollywood Pollock's
politics that you see the actors giving those Oscar speeches
with very liberal values those are the Hollywood politics I'm
talking about for for this list saving the whales the
Esalen Institute but also that's or that's that's also a
yellow humanistic psychology transpersonal psychology cooperatives coops Montessori schools Scandinavia
Scandinavian countries the Scandinavian prison system which is very lenient
and liberal places like California San Francisco or again Austin
Massachusetts Sedona Arizona is a bastion of green super green
but also really cool City New York Seattle Hawaii Hawaii
Green Canada Northern Europe Germany Germany is doing some very
green stuff with their renewable energy which is cool the
Netherlands Switzerland Iceland so these are all the countries and
noticed these are very healthy countries by and large or
countries states or cities generally they're they're very well functioning
and in many ways they're more successful than their orange
and blue counterparts so that's the that's the counter evidence
to what or Peterson is preaching to you about these
radical neo-marxists you know they have they have pretty good
living conditions other examples of green denuclearization equal pay free
college for all universal basic income amnesty affirmative action gun
control the assault weapons ban green tends to be Pro
Union Pro EPA Pro cutting the defense budget they are
very much against the military industrial complex open borders higher
taxes lenient penalties abolishing the death penalty drug rehab centers
homeopathy astrology hypnosis the Bill Gates and Melinda Gates Foundation
tends to skew green because trying to help the world
with vaccines and so forth dr. Albert Schweitzer is a
really good example of a religious person who was heavily
green in a time when where very few religious people
were green this was over well almost like a hundred
years ago Martin Luther King JFK RFK these skewed green
life coaching tends to be a very green career choice
children's rights advocates protecting endangered species tends to be a
very green cause mentoring programs helping the elderly cleaning up
the environment the back to earth movement people wearing more
natural clothing cotton clothing natural fiber type stuff minimalism the
Peace Corps the plot from Avatar with those blue alien
creatures cat creatures who were supposed to like be the
embodiment of well actually they were they were purple sort
of purple leading but but the humans who were fighting
on behalf of the the blue cat aliens they like
the main the main character he was basically green and
his friends who were fighting the evil orange corporation civil
rights human rights watchdog groups the Prius Tesla the smart
car that little car they see driving around that's a
green type of car electric scooters commuting to work on
bicycles solar power wind power renewable energy the corporate culture
at Google and an apple tends to be more green
so if you're looking at examples of what does a
green corporation look like is green about abolishing corporations no
not necessarily there are green corporations you can find and
Google and Apple represent a couple of really good examples
of that now again be careful here I'm not saying
that Google and Apple are totally green they're still very
corporatist they still do a lot of manipulative and shady
stuff they're still very materialistic there's still a lot of
you know they're earning billions of dollars so and they
have abuses like Apple has those famous abuses with with
iPhones being manufactured in China and people jumping out of
windows and all this because of the cruel working conditions
yes that still goes on but still when you compare
apples culture and Google's culture here in America at least
at their campuses even though either campuses are structured when
you compare that with more traditional corporations like a giant
oil company or something you will see that they are
much more green in their values for example Google Offers
all sorts of socialist benefits neo-marxist benefits to its employees
like a free child care free cafeteria with healthy organic
food and like all this sorts of stuff right so
all this stuff you know that's what people love working
at Google and in fact Google has the or I
don't know if they still have it but they used
to have this slogan don't don't be evil that was
Google's slogan it's like we can do business but we
don't have to be be evil and cutthroat in the
way that we do business which which which is which
is right there I would say Google and Apple I
really like half half orange half green and if you
take a look for example at Tim Cook Apple's CEO
he's the first openly gay CEO I believe and and
you can tell in his value system a lot of
his value system the way he treats his employees the
way he thinks about the future of the company they
the way he thinks about how Apple serves a certain
a certain role within society not to let it be
abused by the government to spy on people that sort
of stuff these these are green values he's espousing so
he's got his social conscience other examples warning stickers safety
codes talk therapy grown men crying utopian communes the personal
development company mind valley are you familiar with that one
they do a lot of self-help courses it's a very
green sort of company the movie into the wild with
the main character Chris McCandless that is a great example
of the green mindset Chris McCandless was a very green
idealistic sort of guy so he abandoned his his fancy
college career and he just like abandoned his car he
just went hitchhiking and vague-abonding across America and ultimately ended
up I think in Alaska where he got caught and
trapped between some river that that melted and he got
trapped like on this little island all by himself like
camping in a bus abandoned bus and then he ate
some poison berries and basically he starved to death but
it's a really touching story of sort of the idealism
of green but then also how green can be so
idealistic that it goes wrong which is what happened to
him so it's kind of tragic and that is a
theme for green is that Green has all this heart
but there's also some some tragic access to green which
will we'll talk about in a little bit here the
United Nations scuze green although it's got plenty of oranges
as well cultural appropriation or at least people being upset
about culture appropriation is very green thing activists local coops
mental health professionals teachers have you seen the ultra spiritual
guy on YouTube so he is criticizing he's basically making
a mockery of all the excesses of dream that's what
he's doing and that's why his channel is so popular
so the problem with it though is that I get
the sense that a lot of blue slash orange people
watch the ultra spiritual guy and of course they laugh
it's super funny and everything he says this has a
a ring of truth to it but the problem is
that if you're at stage orange or orange blue and
you're watching these videos and you're laughing and you're ridiculing
green the problem is that again it's going to create
this sort of Jordan Peterson style demonization stereotype in your
mind of green and then you're not actual gonna be
able to grow into green because you've been laughing at
it for three years solid you see the problem with
that so I mean you can definitely make fun of
green but make sure that you're not taking that too
seriously like make fun of green but don't actually think
that green is bad because you should see yourself as
becoming green and then of course transcending green tantric sex
since very green thing ayahuasca retreats conscientious objectors very green
yin-yang and peace tattoos the peace symbol what is a
peace circle in it how about Osho Osho Ashram Osho
himself was was pretty advanced but his ashram if you
seen the documentary that I posted on my on my
blog and we talked about on the forum Osho's ashram
the Raj neecy's and in an Oregon that was if
you watch that entire documentary I mean Sheila was sort
of an outlier she was kind of a crazy character
but if you just look at the the vibe and
the culture and the the the values of that community
that was a very green typical green example Russell Brand
if you like him he's really good at embodying green
and then lastly again we come to Sam Harris now
I said in the orange video that Sam Harris is
a complicated figure and he is and the reason I
bring him up here again is because his metaphysics in
a sense of very rationalist and materialist which makes him
orange in that sense but I think that Sam Harris
is a liberal I mean he's got a lot of
liberal positions he's open to a lot of liberal ideas
and values generally so Sam Harris definitely has lots of
green in him as well even though he has a
lot of criticism against the excesses of green which some
of those are certainly valid and we'll be talking about
them here in a minute so notice that's the end
of our list of examples so notice all the different
shades of green there's a lot here a huge diversity
all right so be careful about stereotyping this or pigeonholing
people or calling all of these people neo-marxist also notice
that in our society today if you live in a
big city in a relatively liberal state in the US
for example at California in New York or Oregon or
Washington this sort of stuff Florida you see a lot
of orange fused with green in the sense that you
have orange consumerism which is fused with green values so
you have values like meditation and spirituality and yoga and
all this sorts of stuff but then you see it
sort of cheapened by this mass-market consumerism which is a
little bit of sort of like what Oprah does and
I'm not really criticizing this I think it's a it's
a necessary step in the evolution because our culture right
now really is evolving towards the sort of orange half
half orange half green stage and so of course you
would expect that orange consumerism and business would fuse with
some of the higher ideals of green but you also
have to understand the danger of this is that it
sort of cheapens and takes the hard edge off of
things like yoga it's really hard to find a yoga
teacher these days especially in the West who will teach
you a nice strong form of yoga that's actually designed
to enlighten you Moshe okay in the West is about
bending yourself into a pretzel and doing some some weird
stuff joining a class being part of a community I
mean and they don't even talk about enlightenment nobody in
those classes even know has a clue of what enlightenment
is even conceptually or if they have a conceptual clue
they certainly haven't realized the radical depth of what enlightened
really means and they've never really actually experienced it to
them it's it's just a belief so watch out for
that for that problem green consumerism all right let's take
a quick intermission here and we when we come back
we'll talk about some of the excesses of green and
then how to transcend green all right let's talk about
some slogans that epitomize green love conquers all sharing is
caring make love not war everyone is equal everyone is
beautiful in his or her own way every one is
right in his or her own way we're all in
this together live and let live give me your tired
your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free can't
we all just get along and now let's talk about
what triggers green every stage you have to understand has
its own trigger points people on the right and conservatives
like to criticize green because they say all green are
snowflakes they get triggered but the truth is that conservatives
also get triggered stage blue gets triggered stage orange gets
triggered by its own stuff and of course stage green
gets triggered now because Green is more emotional and it's
more sensitive to the the oppressed and minorities and civil
rights issues and human abuses like this then it it
is more sensitive in a certain sense to getting triggered
but again you know it just all depends it's very
easier to trigger a blue fundamentalist religious personally extremely easy
and you can also you can also trigger orange people
as well so don't think that triggering is somehow exclusive
to green so here's what triggers green though injustice and
inequality oppression of minorities the status quo and hierarchies of
power especially if the status quo is some sort of
old hierarchy which is fundamentally unfair or unjust to certain
groups of people like you might think of for example
the Indian caste system that kind of caste system would
be very upsetting to Greene because it marginalizes so many
people and keeps them down Green is also triggered by
when religion is used to justify oppression like when someone
in a position of power justifies their oppression of minorities
or children or of animals or something like that by
quoting scriptures from the Bible or in the name of
Allah that that can trigger green human rights abuses racism
bigotry fascism neo-nazis the KKK the Charlottesville example that happened
in America here last year incidents like this can be
very triggering to green which is why green will then
go out and will want to protest and will want
to go to these to these like white supremacist rallies
and do a kind of a counter protest thing because
they want to stand up to that because they're standing
up against human rights abuses in their eyes that's what
they're doing Green can be triggered by unchecked capitalism so
sometimes in the news we see these situations where some
drug company puts out a drug that they know wasn't
safe that kills lots of people or poisons lots of
people that sort of situation will trigger green or when
some company will get price gouge some children for their
drug that they need some cancer medication they raise the
price by 500% because they know they can make the
money or something so stuff like this also Green can
be triggered by consumerism various forms of corporatism corporate greed
Wall Street CEOs getting golden parachutes while their companies tank
sweatshops exploitation especially around the world in many third-world countries
there's a lot of instances where first world countries especially
America because of its capitalistic ambitions are exploiting third world
countries in making situations their much worse than they would
have otherwise been Green can be triggered by invent or
environmental destruction and pollution Green is triggered by lack of
empathy and cold-heartedness just generally speaking animal cruelty is big
for green that's a big trigger point Green starts to
develop a special connection with nature and with animals that
a lot of blue and orange people just can't understand
and you know a stereotypical example of how to trigger
a green person is to take a basket of kittens
and lower into a pit of lava that would trigger
green and that's something that an unhealthy version of blue
or orange might do just to amuse themselves just to
spite green you also notice this this phenomenon happening with
with orange blue people is that they sort of want
to stick it to green there's just sort of this
this idea that oh let's just do something to piss
green off to trigger green and because Green is sensitive
they know that oh if I just do something cruel
or I say something ugly or say something racist or
whatever then I can trigger green in this way and
you can but the cost of that is is that
if you're participating in that then really what you're doing
you're participating in a sort of very childish juvenile behavior
there and you're just entrenching yourself deeper into your blue
and into your orange when really you should be opening
your mind up to green because you're gonna have to
pass through green to get to yellow green can be
triggered by war genocide rape torture abuse school shootings mass
shootings and poverty fascism and authoritarianism the exclusion of people
from the group like if you don't let somebody speak
because you just want to exclude them Green can be
triggered by libertarians of course Donald Trump triggers green people
a lot he sort of is the antithesis of everything
that Green is about this kind of selfishness this narcissism
and there's this pandering to blue conservative Supreme Court that's
triggering triggering a lot of of green people these days
and just in general progressives are triggered by the backwardness
of society what progressives see is they see fifty to
a hundred years into the future of what society could
be like but because a giant chunk of the population
is stuck in blue and is also feeding into orange
that uh progressives are never really able to get the
kind of progress that they know we're capable of as
a society and so the frustration for many progressives is
like it's like we know what society could be in
50 or 100 years and we know that really if
people were more open-minded we would have that Society today
and it would be a more fair more democratic more
egalitarian society and it would be better for everybody on
the whole but of course there are elements of society
which are holding us back because the ego wants to
maintain homeostasis and in my episode where I talk about
collective ego I talked about how every political system every
social organization including of course all the progressive ones they
also have collective ego they are trying to maintain their
position but a feature of the progressives or the greens
collective ego is progress and evolution where as a feature
of the blue collective ego is maintaining the status quo
and so there's always this tension in society and there's
always more people in society who are stuck in traditionalism
and traditional values than they are in the future and
in progress and so this is not just some recent
development within American politics for example that I'm talking about
this this has been going on for 2,000 years there
was always in every single society and every single culture
there was the large majority of the culture which was
generally traditional and conservative and was just kind of like
satisfied with the way the culture is and they would
just want to preserve it and then there were a
few people a smaller segment who wanted progress and you
know there's there's a there's a range some people want
a little bit of progress some people want a huge
amount of progress some of the progress that people want
could be completely unrealistic can be unattainable in the timeframes
that they envision but nevertheless you know there's always a
progressive ailment that's kind of pushing society forward and so
there's this tug-of-war between how fast should we be going
forward the problem for conservatives in blue is that everything
in reality is always evolving so you can't stay the
same place forever because you're gonna go extinct but then
the question is okay so we're moving forward but the
question is how fast do we want to move forward
and the problem is that if you move forwards to
fast then you get ego backlash so it's this careful
balance every system now I'm not just talking about politics
here I'm not just talking about America I'm talking about
every single system whether it's your mind whether it's your
life whether it's your family unit or your business or
your your whatever your a political party it's always fighting
this tug-of-war between how fast should it evolve and if
it involves too slow it could die and also if
it involves too fast it could encounter all sorts of
problems with that as well so that's the that's the
balancing act that life plays out for us now let's
talk about the unhealthy manifestations of green and also its
excesses this is what happens when you take green too
far Green can get too easily offended and too sensitive
it would help green to develop a thicker skin because
not always will people play to your sensitivities and sometimes
reality is brutal and harsh and green can can be
a little bit unrealistic in terms of that green can
be too idealistic and too impractical sometimes Green has too
much heart and not enough head it cares a lot
but it doesn't really create a strategy or a plan
or it lacks the discipline to actually act out on
the feelings Green likes to talk a lot and to
get a consensus but just talking and sharing feelings and
getting a consensus and having a dialogue does not actually
produce the result which can be a problem for green
so it can be a little bit up in the
clouds and not grounded enough and so with green you
can get social revolutions but then they don't actually last
this turn into fats another excess and unhealthy manifestation of
green is a sort of groupthink or mob mentality that
happens green can be ideological in fact every stage is
ideological in its own way ideologies not reserved only for
blue orange has its own capitalistic ideology those are the
libertarians and Green has its own sort of progressive ideology
and it can also kind of just kind of get
wrapped up and caught up like maybe you're a student
on a college campus and you're just gonna get caught
up with some feminist movement that's going on there or
some civil rights movement or something else and maybe the
movement overall it's a good idea and it it had
some some good intention with started but then it can
go too far right you join a protest group and
then everybody starts doing something breaking windows whatever and then
you kind of get sucked into it and kind of
go into it and you just kind of buy into
it because remember Green was a shifting of the pendulum
into a sort of a collective attitude from away from
the orange individualist so of course the pendulum always overcompensates
over reacts and swings too far which is why this
Willem the pendulum then needs to swing back and so
with green yes conservatives sometimes criticize green because they can
be like a herd or like a mob and that's
true of course conservatives also fall prey to that exact
same problem just in in different ways so watch out
for that if you're green another unhealthy manifestation is that
Green tends to demonize materialism because Green has swung away
reacted against orange and oftentimes Green didn't actually fully integrate
orange it just reacted as a knee-jerk move away from
orange and so now Green thinks that all business and
corporations and money that that is the root of all
of our problems if we could only stop corporations then
everything would be solved for society that's not true of
course the situation is much more complicated and nuanced than
that and the fact is is that Green is a
stage that's built upon orange so Green doesn't replace orange
that's a big mistake Green is is the next step
up it it includes and then transcends orange so it's
it's not right to think of business as being evil
because then you're gonna start to judge it and then
what's gonna happen is that you're gonna have a dysfunctional
relationship with it and the fact is that society needs
business we're always gonna have business it's not whether we
should have business or not have business or whether we
should have capitalism or not have capitalism we will always
have capitalism it's a question of to what degree how
do you medicate it how do you soften it how
do you properly regulate it the devil is in the
details there so be careful not to demonize another problem
with green is that green tends to not appreciate the
necessity of the lower stages like I'm talking about blue
and orange are necessary those are the steps you take
to get to green sometimes what green will do is
Green will try to go to some third-world country which
is quite backwards and undeveloped like maybe in the Middle
East somewhere where many of the people in the Middle
East are enough even a purple and an in a
red not not even blue yet purple and red much
of their population is still there a very low level
of development very tribal culture they're just starting to move
into blue and orange and green tries to come in
there and tries to spread green ideals of animal rights
and civil rights and women's rights and all this and
it doesn't work it doesn't work because you're you're preaching
a level of development that cannot be sustained because there's
a lack of just basic fundamental infrastructure both cultural infrastructure
but also actual physical infrastructure you know like people in
Africa and in the Middle East many of them just
like need basic government utilities and functions they need to
be able to get a job they need to be
able to get vaccines for just like very basic stuff
they gotta fix that stuff before they can start to
care about animal rights and world peace and global and
green energy and so green can be so idealistic that
it fails to see that fails to appreciate those stages
and green might want someone from some like African nation
who is in purple very deeply tribal you know like
village society they want them to jump to green but
that's not gonna work and so if you go there
you try to maybe build a school or some charity
organization that tries to get those African kids to green
it's not gonna work you need a much more smarter
approach which once you get to yellow you start to
see that oh the entire spiral is necessary every stage
has a reason for being and so it makes no
sense to criticize the lower stages nor does it really
make sense to try to speed up the process too
much because if you try to get people to move
up the stages too quickly they won't fully integrate them
and actually it'll backfire and fail to work and that's
one of the problems that a lot of NGOs and
charities and nonprofit groups that try to work in the
Middle East or in Africa they face this problem they
try to they try to help from a green stage
when really they need to be working with the needs
of the people you got to meet the people where
they're at not where you're at which can be difficult
for an idealistic person to do Green can fail to
appreciate the complexity of economy of the economy sometimes green
thinks that off we just if we just raise taxes
or if we just do this or we just corporations
that that will solve the problems when in reality the
economy is a very complex thing and you have counterintuitive
repercussions so your policies need to be either very carefully
tested Green can be to relativistic which leads to a
sort of false equivalency effect where Green says all well
all cultures are basically equal they're all in the same
playing field and so therefore the culture in America is
it the same level you could Leo you can't say
that American culture is more developed than Middle Eastern culture
African culture that's not politically correct or right that's that's
you setting up a hierarchy and you may be Green
might even say that spiral dynamics you need to destroy
this hierarchy well the fact is is that there are
different levels of development and human beings and different cultures
have different levels of consciousness some are more developed and
more complex than others and that's not a moral judgement
I'm not saying that's good or bad I'm not saying
Africa is worse or the Middle East is worse than
America or Europe it's just different levels of development from
the biggest picture perspective there is no good and bad
here it's all just a very complicated bootstrapping process that
is unfolding its evolution unfolding within human societies and so
you don't you don't criticize the dinosaurs for being dinosaurs
and not being Birds or not being mammals or not
being Apes it's like you've got different animals who occupy
different niches and they need to be that way you
know we still have crocodiles and alligators and you might
say well the crocodiles and the alligators are so backwards
because they existed 100 million years ago and they still
exist today so how come they aren't more advanced creatures
how come they aren't Apes well because there are still
niches in the world where being a crocodile or an
alligator is the perfect fit and you as a really
good zoologist need to understand that and then of course
apply that to human societies another excess of green is
a sort of naive pacifism sometimes green because green loves
peace and love so much that they fail to appreciate
some of the hard and brutal realities of conflict they
think that love and peace can solve all problems when
in reality it's much more complicated than that love and
peace cannot solve all problems and so taking just this
kind of attitude that all we should just abstain from
all wars abstain from all intervention to Spain from all
violence and that will be the perfect scenario well actually
counter and totally what might happen if you do that
is that actually you will bring upon more war or
even more violence so you have to be careful takes
complex thinking to really understand how conflict works sometimes green
wants to flatten hierarchies too much sometimes a hierarchy is
necessary to have a functioning government or a functioning organization
or functioning corporation you flatten it too much then there's
no clear decision-maker there's no clear leader in the organization
and so the whole thing is just kind of this
this mushy mess decision-making takes a long time and takes
a lot of resources and so you have a lot
of dialogue and consensus building but in the end of
that no action gets taken sometimes green is not action-oriented
enough not pragmatic enough that can especially happen when Green
hasn't fully integrated Orange because really if you properly integrate
Orange you will learn the lessons of pragmatism there and
in fact you'd probably go overboard and in that case
you move into green and everything will be fine but
a lot of people these days they get sort of
imprinted with green values early on in their development and
education especially if you grow up in a progressive area
or with a with a liberal family but then you
you have not integrated all of the orange lessons and
even some of the blue lessons and this is where
you get some problems arising like you get the phenomenon
of the the deadbeat hippie who can't have a job
and who can't manage his finances and he just kind
of goes and mooches off his friends even though he
has high ideals of love and peace but he can't
even keep a job pay his bills that would be
an example of someone who fails to properly integrate Orange
so watch out for that trap Green can green can
have extremist elements because Green has that mob mentality a
bit it's collectivist so sometimes you get involved with a
group and like I said in my collective ego episode
individually as humans we tend to be pretty nice and
kind but when you get us into a mob all
sorts of mayhem happens it doesn't matter if it's a
a blue mob or an orange mob or a Green
mob so examples of extreme elements of green might be
PETA some of the actions of Greenpeace or an Tifa
but remember that these these are by and large rare
not all green people fall into this trap Green can
be too touchy-feely and too emotional sometimes greens emotions don't
allow it to do the things that need to be
done sometimes green is so compassionate that it falls into
the trap of only seeing compassion as feminine compassion I
have an older episode where I talk about the distinction
between feminine masculine passion and both of these have a
need depending on the situation feminine compassion is when you
you kind of Carla person and you kind of try
to soothe soothe them and and help them as much
as you can and then masculine compassion sometimes when you
deliver the brutal truth and sometimes that's what you need
is you need to deliver the brutal truth you need
to speak something harsh but then that harshness is actually
what gets the solution it actually helps the person and
it can it can actually be more compassionate the reason
it's more compassionate is because well like look for example
a lot of women had can have this problem in
a relationship like a woman can be in a relationship
with some let's say guy who's a jerk but because
she's very compassionate and she doesn't want to she doesn't
want to disappoint this guy and she doesn't want to
you know she doesn't want to not love this guy
by leaving him so she just justifies in her mind
staying in this relationship for another 10 years and so
it just keeps dragging on and on they keep fighting
and he keeps abusing her and being a jerk to
her and this whole thing you know it just turns
into a giant mess when the proper step there would
have been to realize in year one that this guy's
a jerk it is not gonna work and so let
me utilize some masculine compassion here and let me just
leave him let me just sit down and tell him
this these are the facts you're disrespecting my boundaries respect
my values I'm cutting you off that's it don't call
me I've blocked your number and we're done but see
a lot of women might feel that that doesn't fit
their sort of ideals of love and they've been taught
they should love and they should be supportive and all
this and so and so actually in dragging it out
you make it worse you have to find when the
right kind of compassion is necessary so you got to
be flexible and not rigid in your notion of compassion
also for green caring too much can lead to burnout
you care so much about about helping people maybe you're
a nurse in some Hospital and it's like you're trying
to help everybody you're helping this guy and that guy
that you're working overtime and all your patients and you're
just overworked you're and then eventually you care so much
you burn yourself out Green can be overzealous about social
causes Green can care so much about global warming so
much about animal rights so much about the Supreme Court
or so much about some issue that they either go
overboard they become extremists they can even go to the
point of doing violent acts although that's pretty rare for
green but it can happen you know you just got
caught up with it or you maybe if you don't
even do anything violent or extremists you just care so
much about this cause that eventually it backfires on you
and it starts to hurt you emotionally it's like you
care about something so much but it's not getting fixed
just because you care about it and maybe you want
global warming to end but hey the fact is that
we're in this world where a lot of countries are
underdeveloped right now and we're not gonna end global warming
anytime soon because new countries are coming online new factories
note new coal electric power plants those are still coming
online in China and in India all over the world
so those are some just brutal realities and sometimes green
doesn't want to face those brutal realities because it's filled
too idealistic another excess of Green is green guilt guilt
makes a comeback blue if you remember had a lot
of guilt in it it was a sort of puritanical
Catholic version of guilt then in orange orange moved away
from guilt and in some sense orange orange becomes guiltless
and shameless which is a problem because it's very individualistic
now the pendulum swings back towards the guilt direction of
course a different kind of guilt for green the guilt
is a sort of failure to live up to its
ideals of equality and justice for all so maybe you
feel guilty because you are wasting food or you're not
recycling and that's you not living up to your lofty
ideals or maybe you feel guilty for driving a gas
car and for helping to support the the big oil
industry or the pharma industry or something like that or
you feel guilty for the company you work at because
your company earns dollars or money and and maybe your
your company exploits some third world country labor maybe it
has some sweatshop so you feel guilty about that now
of course Green will say well Leah but I should
feel guilty about that well that's the whole problem with
guilt is that people who feel guilty they believe very
firmly that they should feel guilty for not living up
to their ideals but the problem is that that that
actually that robs you of your power and guilt is
not a very resourceful emotion from which then to act
and to change so rather than feeling guilty it's better
to release that guilt and then and then do the
right thing anyways Green can be a little too reactionary
reacting to situations that are happening rather than following through
on its own agenda on its own goals in its
excess Green can stifle independence and it can stifle entrepreneurial
spirit I've heard examples of this happening for example in
Scandinavian countries where in Scandinavian countries the culture there is
such that if you try to rise above the average
like in your school or in your university you try
to rise above average you try to be a little
bit of a maverick then the culture there is design
such that people will look down on you and maybe
you're an entrepreneur and you have some brilliant ideas but
then the culture you're growing up in it's a little
bit too socialistic and so what happens is that they
stifle your your creativity in your independence there can be
a sort of green restraint of individuality through harmony Green
tries to get a consensus and a harmony so much
that it actually ends up killing healthy forms of individuality
as it seeks to get everybody to a sort of
Green mob sometimes in its excess green can love to
talk about spirituality but actually be unable to embody it
this is a problem Green can go to yoga classes
Green can go to sot songs and listen to gurus
and watch mooji videos and talk about love and how
wonderful the world is and and peace and all of
this but green is not actually able to attain the
deep non-dual mystical states that are necessary to truly be
a vehicle of a very deep form of love unconditional
love Green doesn't yet understand conditional love Green's heart is
not yet fully open that will only happen at turquoise
with deep mystical experiences which green generally isn't disciplined enough
to attain because true spirituality requires enormous discipline and in
a sense that was a very nice strength of blue
but that has been sort of long left behind and
now with green there's a sort of uh there's a
sort of up in the air quality about green where
it's airy-fairy it likes to talk about aliens and UFOs
and chakras and crystals and all of this it talks
about this it burns incense and it maybe does some
meditation practices but it's not real like hardcore meditation it's
not hardcore yoga which is what enables true spirituality Green
can be too entitled a lot of green people the
reason they're green is simply because they grew up in
a culture and in a society which is rel the
affluent first world countries European countries in America we have
elements of green in our culture because we've gone through
all the other stages and green can sometimes forget that
green can forget that green is built on top of
orange and it can feel entitled to things and it
can seem like everybody else in the world should have
what green has but everybody else in the world can't
have that unless they go through all those steps that
your ancestors had to go through to build all the
infrastructure both the physical and psychological infrastructure to get you
and you know the economic infrastructure to get you to
where you are now most third-world countries do not have
the political infrastructure to allow green government's that has to
evolve through a painful process and green can be so
entitled that it forgets that green can deny differences too
much this is one of the things for example that
Jordan Peterson will rant about is how Green will deny
deny the differences between men and women between the different
curves there's curves and there's outliers and outliers can be
really extreme and very significant and that's true because greens
overarching bigger picture is that everyone is equal now of
course a concerted will say oh that's so ridiculous everyone
is not equal there's truth in both perspectives there's a
partial truth in both perspectives of course everyone is not
equal of course not all cultures are equal of course
not all races are equal of course not everyone has
the same IQ of course not all the features and
characteristics and strengths and weaknesses of men and women are
the same men and women are asymmetrical they have different
strengths and weaknesses but what Green is saying when it
says everyone is equal is it saying that everyone should
have an equal right to basic you know health care
housing economic prosperity so it doesn't literally mean that men
are equal to women and so there's a sort of
us up a false debate that then gets set up
between like blue and orange and green and they start
to argue and then like the blue and orange side
argues no we're all different and the green side argues
no we're all equal well they're really just talking about
the same thing in different ways and a lot of
times they they fail to see that because they're too
stuck in their own perspective the problem with green is
that it is too stuck in its own perspective this
perspective of equality that's an admirable perspective it's an admirable
intention but again you can't cling to anything too much
and when you start to turn it into an ideology
or a philosophy what it does is it restricts your
creativity it restricts your fluidity and then that creates problems
the name of the game here is to have a
flexible mind that's always been the name of the game
that's what I've been trying to teach you with actualize
dot org all this time when I talk about epistemology
I talked about freeing your mind of webs of belief
it's all about freeing your mind liberation that's ultimately what
you're going to you're trying to liberate your consciousness from
every single mental construct that holds you down whether it's
a blue construct an orange construct or a green construct
Green can have a sort of naive altruism that it
turns into a trap this idea that you can just
help everybody and the problem is that you can't help
everybody you can't just let every homeless person into your
house feed them clothe them take care of their medical
expenses give them a therapist for their mental illnesses and
help them with their drug addictions you know you can't
you can't do that for everybody and sometimes Green doesn't
realize that Casilla too idealistic Green can be too trusting
of red red can exploit greens empathy and greens tolerance
and so can orange to a certain extent Green can
romanticize stage purple too much green might look at tribal
cultures in Africa or the Middle East or other places
and tribalism is like is when I mean by tribalism
is is staged purple which is a very very basic
early stage in the spiral it's basically sort of the
way that natives live and in the Amazon or certain
tribes in Africa and it might seem like those people
live in harmony with nature and look they have medicine
men and and they live healthy the healthy food and
they treat animals nicely you don't have factory farming so
in Green's eyes that can seem like oh that's the
ideal but of course you can't have modern society at
the scales we have it at now also at purple
we it needs to develop to something different purple doesn't
work you're romanticizing it too much there are evil things
that happen within purple that green for example fails to
see for example purple is very tribalistic so if you
have two tribes living in the Amazon they will have
no problems whatsoever of butchering each other and holding each
other as enemies because they are tribes and that's where
we get the world tribal from their extreme they can
be extremely tribal tribes in Africa can be extremely tribal
and brutal to one another tribes in the Middle East
is that's one of the biggest problems they have in
the Middle East is that they actually don't have a
sense of individual nationhood because they have different tribes literally
the different families they have they're just like different tribes
maybe they fight with each other and so they're there's
too much disunity to actually just build a solid blue
civilization nation that has order and and hierarchy because it's
tribal warfare greens empathy can be exploited and manipulated and
that can be a problem for Green Green can fall
into the sort of doormat syndra where you become a
doormat and you let people walk over you Green can
be bad with finances Green can over regulate and over
tax Green can eliminate boundaries too much some green people
think that all countries we shouldn't have borders at all
just let all the immigrants in let let anybody go
anywhere they want but of course the problem is that
life is more complicated than that survival of every organism
depends upon having some kind of boundaries so it's not
a question of having a boundary or not having boundaries
the question of how much of a boundary the devil
is in the details of what your boundary should be
for example if you just let every single like I
said poor person walk into your house and do whatever
they want they would destroy your house they would steal
all your stuff so you do have to set some
boundaries the question is what kind reminds me of what
happened with Osho Ashram or road osho's commune in Oregon
if you saw that documentary then what happened there is
that at one point they started to actually hire buses
to drive around the entire United States and pick up
homeless people in every city United States by the hundreds
and thousands and to bust them into the commune well
one of the reasons they were doing that is because
they wanted to manipulate the local elections so that they
could they could win their political and and sort of
real estate battles there with the zoning laws so that
was sort of an orange move but still they were
trying to get these bums and these homeless people in
these mentally ill people and they started to try to
care for them they actually tried to rehabilitate them and
give them food and shelter and take care of them
and they tried to show that these people can be
loving members of the community so this was a very
lofty sort of high go uh ideal of green but
the problem that they ran into eventually is that they
didn't think through the fact that many of these homeless
people they weren't just homeless because they were lazy or
because they didn't get a chance by society it's because
many of them were hard drug addicts many of them
had serious mental issues psychosis many of them were violent
many of them were criminals and if you know and
it didn't really have a sense of ethics or morality
and so when you bus all those people with your
commune then these bums started to fight and they started
get so rowdy that eventually the leaders of the of
the Osho commune a had to actually put tranquilizers and
sedative drugs into the beer that they gave to these
homeless people to kind of keep them tranquilized and calmed
down so there wouldn't be all this fights and all
these violence so see that's that's an example of green
being too idealistic and not not not really thinking through
some of its some of its well intentioned and heart-centered
ideals it's it's it's nice to be able to help
homeless people but you also have to think through what
are the actual circumstances that lead to homeless people being
homeless how can we create systemic solutions that's what you'll
start to get to it's day George or sage yellow
how can we create systemic solutions to actually address those
problems in a way that's gonna be sustainable not just
because we love them and we care for them because
you know love and care doesn't feed a homeless person
and it doesn't solve a homeless person's mental illness although
sometimes it can you know sometimes all the homeless person
needs is just some love and that can cure him
and that's great and green is good at that which
is why green makes for good nurses and social workers
and and psychiatrists professions where you need a lot of
empathy life coaches but empathy doesn't solve all problems sometimes
you have a more fundamental you might say a more
material problem that your compassion not just gonna solve maybe
these mentally ill people actually need some medication more so
than your empathy or maybe what they need is they
need a job more so than your handouts in its
excess green can lie because it doesn't want to hurt
the feelings of other people Green can be unable to
tell the brutal truth and another potentially big problem with
green is at it it it becomes a lesser jihad
I've talked about lesser versus greater jihad in my understanding
Islam episode and it's a very important concept the idea
here being is that all of these lofty social causes
these political causes that green can have of civil rights
or saving the whales this sort of stuff it can
become a distraction from the inner work that you have
to do on yourself first ground yourself deeper in true
spirituality and mysticism have the non-dual insights become enlightened then
from that position you will be able to go out
and to spread love and and happiness and change all
throughout the world you can become a bodhisattva if you
want to but if you get too involved with the
political stuff you get into these mobs and you become
a feminist or this or that and you get so
wrapped up into that you care so much about that
that you forget to actually work on yourself the greater
jihad is what you should be really concerned with and
you should be very concerned with anything that distracts you
away from that here's some statistics about green about ten
percent of the adult global population is green with up
to 30 percent in Western Europe and in America it
especially depends on states and cities for example within America
Northern Europe tends to skew more heavily green and about
fifteen percent of the total world influence the cultural influence
is green so this is the influence that happens through
the media through entertainment through politics through business through charities
through non-government organizations the style of government under green is
a social network it's human centered it has a flat
hierarchy decentralized its socialist / capitalist hybrid not purely one
or the other it's liberal its globalist it seeks to
create a global community and it's a melting pot of
different cultures and different ideas with tolerance for all the
different elements of the pot whereas blue doesn't want the
melting pot blue wants to preserve its national identity its
heritage its tradition which is why blue is so against
Green the green elitist globalist what is this this this
is a triggering point for blue because blue wants to
maintain its identity of course the whole point of conscious
development the whole point of self-actualization is to destroy your
identity you see any identity you have was it's a
blue identity in orange identity a green identity all of
these are false identities your identity as a physical body
is a false identity your identity with your personal history
your story the idea that you were ever born so
false identity your self-image is a false identity all of
your cultural associations whether you think you're a feminist or
whether you think you're an all right conservative or whether
you think you're a Jew whatever race you think you
are whatever gender you think you are whether you think
you're gay or transsexual or bisexual or straight or anything
alpha male beta male insel female male it doesn't matter
all of these are false identities if you think you're
an American if you think you're a German if you
think you're an Arab if you think you're a Muslim
all of these are false identities and of course that
is very upsetting to the ego the ego is identity
it's all about identity it's about individual identity but also
collective identity your individual identity is very much tied in
with your collective identity no matter what stage you're at
pretty much so of course what I'm saying here is
gonna be unpopular with sage blue stay George sage green
it only starts to make sense to you when you
get to the really high levels to yellow and really
even to turquoise and you start to have some non-dual
experiences where you start to realize that all of these
identities are just masks they're all just roles it's all
just programming you have to leave it all behind don't
cling to any of it so how do you transcend
green well first of all read in-depth about green as
you read about green you realize its limitations and that's
important also reading depth about yellow because yellow is the
next stage you need to start to distinguish the difference
between green and yellow and you need to start to
see how much more wise yellow is than green and
if you're stuck in orange and blue and maybe you
don't like green because you feel like there are neo-marxists
and that they are too idealistic and they're too collectivist
well remember that the pendulum is gonna swing back in
the opposite direction with yellow it's going to go more
individualistic and so in a sense orange will resonate with
yellow much more so than with green but it would
be a mistake to try to skip over to yellow
without going through green first so for green read about
yellow which I'll talk about in the next episode so
I won't cover that much here also very important that
green stopped judging orange blue and yellow like with every
stage the biggest obstacle for you growing into the next
level is that you judge it too much what green
judges about yellow is that Green will think that yellow
is too dispassionate it doesn't care enough about social causes
and that yellow is too neutral green doesn't want neutrality
green wants to to to mobilize to go protest to
go be an activist whereas yellow steps back and yellow
says wait a minute let's think it through before we
start to protest and take all these actions and become
activist let's think through this very systemically which is something
that Green doesn't really know how to do and doesn't
appreciate stop demonizing corporations stop demonizing money stop even izing
conservatives stop demonizing religion this is a problem that you
will see for example with some of the progressive YouTube
channels that talk about politics like with the Young Turks
TYT you also see a little bit with sam cedars
majority report and democracy now they demonize orange and they
demonize blue too much and so what this does is
it creates a polarization you get this polarization happening in
our society now between between green and blue orange and
and that that creates a sort of stalemate creates a
nasty sort of politics where nothing really gets done so
we've got to be careful about that sometimes green can
fail to see why demonizing orange and blue is a
problem oftentimes the progressive will say leo but if we
don't demonize them and we don't speak out against the
fascists then we're not being proactive enough and they're just
gonna use their fascist tactics against us and they're gonna
steamroll us and then everything is going to go to
hell no actually that's a trap that's a trap when
you think that way what's happening is you're getting polarized
and the sort of polarization is actually the thing that
is keeping society in a stalemate so there are a
lot of counterintuitive mechanics here that go into really changing
society for the better and if you really care about
that you really care about making progress then try to
get to yellow as quickly as you can because it's
at yellow where you start to really be able to
solve society's problems you know in a systemic systemic manner
which tends to be much more effective than green stop
caring about social issues so much yes social issues are
important but also you need to see the other side
of the coin that they're not important at all society
is progressing at exactly the rate that it needs to
be progressing at society is perfect for this exact moment
in time that it is in that can be hard
to swallow notice that politics is still ego just because
you have some lofty green politics of of saving Mother
Earth and saving the animals and this and that and
whatever else this is still ego its collective ego sure
it's a better form of ego than maybe read politics
or blue politics and orange politics but it's still ego
and it's still gonna distract you it's gonna be a
red herring from doing the real inner self-actualization work that
we need you to do to go higher acknowledge that
business is necessary acknowledge that Green is not the highest
stage that there are higher stages beyond you acknowledge the
problem with Green mob mentality notice that green goes overboard
with its collective networks start thinking more for yourself start
seeing the world more from the lower stages points of
view start to understand why blue is blue and what
are the legitimate aspects of blue and white orange is
orange and what are the legitimate aspects of orange start
to empathize and see why people aren't each of these
stages and why they can't just instantly break out and
become green that will move you into yellow as you
start to look at reality from multiple points of view
and you start to see every point of us as
having a partial truth to it acknowledge that most of
the world wasn't as lucky as you they're not as
educated as you most people were not born in a
first world country and they did not go to a
world class or even a you know even any kind
of university not even world class any kind of university
most people didn't even go to a progressive liberal elementary
school middle school or high school like you did so
that's huge because education correlates with your level of consciousness
and your level of development very strongly here so you
know most people didn't have that privilege which means we
need to educate more people but educating people is difficult
because once you get the wrong education that education makes
your mind rigid such that then we can't educate you
for the right education for the more open-minded sort of
education so acknowledge that that's a very deep problem that
you're not just gonna solve by protesting or by telling
people that they're that they're close-minded or by telling them
that they're evil or they're fascists acknowledge that bigots and
racists can't help what they're doing people who are biggests
and racists they are acting out of ignorance as are
criminals as are all people we all act out of
ignorance this is not an excuse it's just the way
that it is so this is a sort of meta
understanding which helps you to understand and also stand at
a distance from some of these human rights abuses that
you see happening all over the world then you'll stop
you'll stop being triggered by bigotry and racism now of
course green will say ollio but I don't want to
stop being triggered by bigotry and racism because that will
just enable the racists and the biggest know what you'll
realize that stays yellow is that when you stop being
triggered and you actually understand everything including all the evil
in the world the so called evil this doesn't enable
the evil this counter-intuitively actually is the solution to the
problem you don't stop evil by fighting evil with evil
you stop it with love and with understanding and green
have a problem with this because green still hasn't learned
the lesson that you need to be so loving and
so tolerant that you can even tolerate intolerance the problem
with green is that green is intolerant towards intolerance there's
a lack of self-reflection there a lack of fully understanding
what intolerance is a lack of fully understanding what ignorant
is and why conflict happens it's very important as Green
that you seek to understand the deeper causes of war
violence cruelty and conflict these things don't just happen because
of evil corporations or evil politicians there are much deeper
dynamics beyond any individual at work that caused these things
in fact what you will ultimately realize is that all
of these things are the direct manifestation of the very
fundamental structure of reality God itself is the ultimate cause
of war violence cruelty abuse hatred genocide bigotry rape and
all of these things that you hate and that you
protest against and in fact all of these things are
a part of you you are it you are all
of it because reality is infinite and so it must
include all these things but you won't understand that until
you get much much higher up in your level of
consciousness but it's good to start to do a little
research to start to to see the complexities of all
this sort of stuff you can't you can't just react
against it with protests and with violence with with demonization
so stop hating the haters that's really tough to do
that's very counterintuitive start studying systems-thinking that's huge I have
a whole category on a book list called systems thinking
with with some really good books there as you start
to read about systems thinking you will start to realize
the limitations of green and that will move you into
yellow acknowledge that greens political actions are often very ineffective
there's a lot of commotion a lot of yelling and
screaming and emotions but nothing really changes so maybe there's
a better way acknowledge green hypocrisy what is green hypocrisy
well it's when you you demonize the big oil companies
for polluting the environment and yet what do you do
you drive a gas car and you go to the
Chevron gas station on the corner and you fill up
with your gas and maybe you also demonize giant corporations
for corrupting the political system with their lobbying and all
this sort of stuff but then where do you get
your paycheck you work for some company like AT&T or
you work for Verizon or you work for coca-cola or
you work for some other company and maybe you're in
some low position of your secretary or maybe you're just
a store clerk but nevertheless you're part of the problem
that's green hypocrisy stop acting self-righteous and Superior Green can
develop that problem in its excess there's a sort of
like air of morality about green in the same way
that blue also have this kind of air of morality
and self-righteous indignation but that's holding you back in your
development you need to see that we're really all in
this together we're so together in this that even all
the stuff that you see that's going against your social
justice warrior values that even all that stuff is still
you it's the all part of reality you can't just
have the good side of reality you can't just have
mother nature and rainbows and butterflies and unicorns and peace
for everybody but then have conflict and violence and war
and genocide and rape and theft they come together they
come as a package which doesn't mean we can't improve
the situation but if you're always triggered by it emotionally
that's a problem because when you're emotionally triggered you're not
thinking straight you're not really conscious and so you can't
really come up with the solutions necessary and also it
disturbs you on the inside you don't have peace of
mind which is ultimately what you're after just in general
be more idealist I mean be less idealistic and be
more nuanced and how you think about these sorts of
issues start practicing some serious meditation not as some group
setting but like really serious all by yourself series meditation
serious yoga not the stuff you see in in gym
classes self inquiry self inquiry can really help you to
go beyond green cuz it's it's it's a hard-nose to
practice there's not a lot of happening within self inquiry
you're sitting down it's just you you and the truth
and reality you're just breaking everything down breaking your identity
down breaking down all your beliefs and all your social
cause is breaking all of it down start reading yellow
and turquoise books and if you're looking for a good
list of those well check my book list I have
a ton of yellow and turquoise books on my book
list start reading spiral dynamics just reading about spiral dynamics
in depth can be enough to shift you from green
to yellow because spiral dynamics is the epitome of yellow
thinking this model to see all the stages how all
of them are necessary how all of them work together
how complex and nuanced it all is how tricky it
all is that's what moves you into yellow start to
study non-duality that's gonna be important to move you up
start to deconstruct meaning value and purpose ooh that's a
big one people have trouble with that see my episode
about understanding meaning value and purpose I have a whole
episode about that which tells you that you can be
constructed because your mind invented it and that is what
is ultimately underpinning your social causes and your fight for
equality and liberty and justice make sure you fully integrate
Orange and you don't just react against it or deny
it and one of the best ways to do that
I think is to start a business if you're green
and if you struggle with finances there's nothing better than
just starting a business and learning to deal with all
the challenges in reality to starting a business to have
a successful business and to maintain it that requires some
some real skill some real pragmatic thinking that a lot
of green people haven't fully learned how to integrate so
that can be great and once you do start your
own business you will understand why business works the way
that it works and why it's so problematic and why
is so difficult to get these corporations to stop doing
all this selfish and evil stuff because really wish you
start to understand when you really understand businesses to understand
that Oh what business is is business is just like
survival of the fittest except before two thousand years ago
we would be slitting each other's throats and now what
we're doing is we're just polluting a little bit and
we're suing each other in court and we're we're having
some little corporate disputes that's that's peanuts compared to the
way that business used to be done business used to
be someone slitting your throat exterminating your entire tribe and
enslaving all the women and children and raping them that's
what business used to be so uh-huh business has evolved
a lot in the last 2,000 years and it will
continue to do so and it helps for you to
start to understand that because you know what business is
just survival and you know what as long as you're
alive you got to survive you got to pay the
bills if you're green you fleu got bills to pay
you still gotta pay your rent and buy your food
and buy your gas buy your car and all this
sort of stuff pay for daycare pay for medical expenses
how do you do that by participating in Orange but
the problems and a lot of green people they participate
in Orange but at the same time they sort of
deny that they do it they just say Oh leo
I don't do anything evil I just go and work
for my corporation what is that that's contributing to all
the evil all the corporate lobbying all that stuff if
you work for a giant corporation even if you're just
like flipping burgers at McDonald's and you fancy yourself a
green person because you don't you don't you're not some
big wig CEO who gets some big corporate golden parachute
or some severance package or takes home hundreds of millions
in stock options you don't get that flipping burgers at
McDonald's but you're part of the system you're serving the
system that CEO couldn't exist without you being part of
the system so you gotta ask yourself how do I
break myself out of the system if I really want
to be truly green then I will make myself financially
independent and I will create my own job my own
business which is actually serving the community in a positive
way because if I have lafi green ideals but then
I go work for a corporation like coca-cola which which
basically sells sugared poison to to children all around the
world and is destroying their health then what you're doing
is you're participating in that but you tell yourself all
but I have to because if I don't do that
then I got no job right because you haven't taken
responsibility yet for creating your own job that's difficult to
do and to create your own job in such a
manner that you don't do it by exploiting other people
or exploiting the environment that's that's really hard to do
that's really hard to do very few human beings have
undertaken the task of creating a career for themselves that
does not feed off the exploitation of other human beings
or the environment so take on that challenge and if
you want some help with that check out my life
purpose course that's what that is about helping you to
design that because that's a that's what I did and
man is that rewarding that's so rewarding that's so much
more rewarding than having your lofty green ideals but then
working for some shitty multinational corporation so much more rewarding
to transcend green practice more neutrality it might seem that
neutrality is a bad thing but actually it's much superior
to being polarized neutrality at yellow you will learn true
neutrality true neutrality is not what you think it is
I will talk about it in the next episode on
yellow notice that protesting is not enough in many cases
yes sure sometimes protests work in the civil rights movement
protests were great they were important protests definitely have a
function I'm not saying never protest but also realize that
there's there's a lot of problems that exist in the
world that go way beyond protesting and that talking dialoguing
is not enough love and peace is often not enough
we need to think about these problems in a much
deeper systemic manner become a spiral wizard what does a
spiral wizard well if you read the spout that AMEX
book you will learn about what a spiral wizard is
a spiral wizard is basically someone who's at yellow it's
someone who who knows how to communicate and jump back
and forth between the spiral all the different stages and
knows how to design systems that accommodate all the stages
on the spiral rather than just advocating for his own
stage the whole problem with stage blue orange and green
is that they're all blind to the fact that they're
just one stage of a larger whole and so when
they advocate some sort of policy or a governmental program
or some sort of religious or spiritual teaching they they
they only advocate it as though they are the right
stage it's like Green is the right one or orange
is where I want or blue is the right one
and that whole thing misses the point there's a larger
higher meta point to see when you see the whole
thing from a bigger picture you realize oh the real
solutions need to not just be from my stage they
need to be for all the stages on the entire
spiral and that's when you become yellow when you really
grasp that and lastly the master key as with all
the other stages for transcending a stage is contemplation and
self-reflection carefully sit down and think through all the stuff
I talked about read the books check out my book
list take some notes and then contemplate Oh about it
journal about it think about how you're falling into these
traps thinks about the limitations think about which elements of
orange or blue maybe you skipped over you didn't quite
fully integrate think about what more within green you need
to act out in order to to to be at
peace with it so you can move on to yellow
I am not advocating that you skipped through green as
quickly as possible make sure not to make that mistake
people might get the sense that oh well the whole
goal of this model Leo is to become turquoise right
that's the best one so what I need to do
is quickly skip through all the stages to get to
turquoise no that is not the goal first of all
turquoise is not the best stage there is no best
stage so that's number one number two is that even
if turquoise was the best stage you can't get to
it by skipping through stages never mind skipping over stage
right now I'm talking about skipping through a stage that
means sort of just like speeding through it looking for
a shortcut don't look for a shortcut look to master
the stage so if you're in orange right now and
maybe you're only halfway through orange you got a mast
or the other half learn all the lessons that orange
has to teach you both its strengths and its weaknesses
when you're deeply intimately familiar with its strengths and its
weaknesses then you can move on to green same thing
with green now you're in green maybe you're just 1020
percent green that means you've still got a lot left
to learn from green so go into it spend a
few years fully mucking around in green read Greene books
go to Green seminars go to green music festivals talk
to green people befriend them join Green Facebook groups do
all that sort of stuff but as you're doing that
also keep an eye towards yellow so you don't get
stuck in green that's the danger with going too deeply
into a stage you can get stuck in it so
fully exhaust greens such that you naturally then want to
evolve into yellow all right so that's green in a
lot of detail in conclusion I just want to give
you a couple of caveats number one be careful about
stereotyping people using this model that is not the point
of this model notice how complex this model really is
it's a lot more complicated than you can even fathom
even now and you might already think it's complex because
I spent so many hours talking about it and we've
only covered three stages in like five or six hours
of talking so that tells you how complex it is
and we're still just scratching the surface as you read
the book and so forth and you read different other
books that supplement it you think about systems thinking you
will see more and more of the complexity so this
is not a simplistic model where you can just walk
around town and label people all that guy's blue this
guy's red that guy's orange oh look at that stupid
a green personal no that's not what this model is
for this model is also not for advancing your political
agenda in these episodes it might seem likely oh you're
talking about politics so much we're against so political I'm
getting political because first of all these are great examples
and I want you to actually understand what is going
on in politics but the reason I'm getting political is
not so that actualize that organ personal developing a political
thing but actually the opposite so that you can start
to see politics from a meta perspective so that you
can start to see politics from an ego perspective you
can start to see the collective ego operating within politics
and all the forces and then you can rise above
the fray that's why we get political here it's very
dangerous to mix personal development with politics because politics is
a huge distraction and like I said politics is ego
and personal develop is all about shedding your ego so
mixing these two together makes for a bad combination so
in the future I will I will be sometimes talking
about politics but again always when I talk about politics
is to get you to rise above it because otherwise
what happens that people just get into a mud flinging
contests like a giant food fight you're either on the
left or the right and you're just throwing throwing food
at each other this this is not this is not
gonna grow you this is this is not gonna solve
society's problems you need to rise above that you need
to see why is there a food fight to begin
with what's really going on why are people throwing food
at each other and why am I getting sucked into
the fight it's really hard not to get sucked in
because you do have certain positions and there are certain
things you really care about maybe you really care about
abortion rights or maybe you really care about stopping abortion
and that's fine you know whatever position you've got there
that's fine but also realize there's a deeper point is
that you're clinging to it and that that's an agenda
of your ego and that is ultimately something you're gonna
have to surrender and you probably don't like hearing that
and that's why whenever I talk about politics people criticize
me and say Oh leo but but look you you're
for this position your gets that position no of course
I mean I do have my personal political biases and
positions but that's not what I'm trying to imprint into
your mind I'm trying to show you something beyond that
much much much beyond that so that's green for you
yellow is the next stage which we'll be talking about
in the episode to come alright that's it for this
please click the like button for me come check out
actualized org that's my website I've got resources for you
there check out my blog check out the forum check
out the book list check out the life purpose course
all of those can can really change your life in
one way or another even just a little thing that
I post on my blog can contribute in sight in
you or can be a resource that you follow-up on
a book that you read or a video that you
watch that changes the whole trajectory of your life you
know it's the little things that add up and make
a difference and lastly just stick with me we still
have more stages to cover stage yellow is going to
be a really important stage a very advanced stage many
people not be able to understand it but you know
if you're watching actualised org then chances are you're already
around green and maybe you have a healthy amount of
orange or I mean oh sorry I have yellow but
you you haven't fully grasped what yellow is yellow is
such a deep and profound thing as I was studying
and preparing for all these episodes my understanding of yellow
has deepened even though I feel like I've been at
yellow for a long time I really love yellow so
yeah we'll talk about that next time and oh one
last thing I want to tell you is help me
to build a giant list of examples for each one
of these stages so on my forum I'm creating a
mega thread a special thread for every single color of
the spiral we've already done a blue one an orange
one we're gonna start a green one just after I
release this episode here and we'll have a yellow and
a turquoise one where we we just post examples of
YouTube videos that are like the perfect epitome of green
or blue or orange and someone can just go through
watch those videos see those examples and just really clearly
get a strong sense of what that stage is all
about so if you want if you if you know
some cool examples of green that you want to share
you can post that on the forum there or if
you don't want to post you can just go read
it and you will learn about what green is just
from reading that long mega thread you
