hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're gonna talk about positive psychology all right so
positive psychology what is it why is it important why
should we care about it this is a very fascinating
topic and this is something that can potentially transform your
life if you know about it and you do a
little bit of study into it this is a really
powerful idea so let's talk about positive psychology positive psychology
we need to distinguish between that and ordinary psychology or
what we might say is negative psychology but it's just
called normal psychology is the study of problems in human
behavior so traditionally from the founding of psychology back in
the late 1800s with with William James and with Freud
and with Carl Jung and all that kind of traditional
pop culture you know psychotherapy that we think about as
being psychology all of that was about helping people overcome
their neuroses helping people overcome severe crippling mental disorders so
it could be schizophrenia severe depression suicidal thoughts just all
sorts of anxiety and panic and phobias that kind of
stuff and that's actually not what most people are having
problems with most people in society are more normal they're
not abnormal they're not dysfunctional they don't have these severe
manic depressive episodes or or suicidal thoughts most people are
not that way so what positive psychology is is it's
a new movement really that started I would say in
the last 50 years but especially even in the last
20 or 30 years where psychologists research psychologists are now
instead of focusing on all the problem cases in human
society they're focusing on all the ways that we can
improve normal life functioning and we could take it from
a normal level to an optimal level so I'm actually
going to quote some of the founders of positive psychology
on what they define positive psychology as being and this
is Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi so what they say
is to find and nurture genius and talent and to
make normal life more fulfilling that is the mission of
positive psychology so it's to find and nurture genius and
talent and to make normal life for normal people like
you and me that are not severely dysfunctional how to
make it better I love this because this is well
what I'm about this is what the actualized org is
about it's all about how to take yourself from an
ordinary life to an extraordinary life right I'm not so
much interested in looking for people that have severe dysfunctions
I think that there's branches of old-school psychology that are
good at dealing with that what I'm interested in is
how to achieve peak performance in your life like if
I'm just living kind of a normal normal existence the
way I see some of my friends living the way
I see some of my my family members living or
I just see people in society living if I take
that and I say well what if I want to
live like an amazing life what if I want to
live a kind of life that I would be proud
to write about in a memoir what if I would
live the kind of life that I'll be proud to
write a book about what if I lived the kind
of life that people would look at and would say
like that person is doing something special something different there's
something different about that person and also the way that
you're feeling is different you're feeling more fulfilled you're feeling
more excited you're feeling higher levels of happiness there's something
going on there for me the question is how do
I achieve that because to me that's what life is
about it's living life big living life to the fullest
I don't know why people are living like small I
mean I actually dunno why but I don't want to
go into all those reasons right now the reason what
I'm ultimately after here is how to live a big
kind of life and that's what positive psychology is after
except the difference is that positive psychology of course is
is an academic branch of science right so this is
actually a science positive psychologists are out there researching and
looking at for example what are the scientific ways of
improving and increasing happiness what are the scientific ways of
getting higher performance in your life whether it's a business
relationships fitness whatever what are the ways to actually nurture
your genius and your talents what are the different mindsets
that you can have that make people resourceful what is
the difference for example psychologically speaking between a very successful
person maybe an entrepreneur who's earning lots of money and
is also fulfilled on the inside versus somebody who is
earning lots of money and has a lot of external
success so to say so to speak but isn't fulfilled
on the inside what's the difference between those two and
then of course why are there people that are so
struggling with their lives that are having such enormous difficulty
even getting to the point where they're able to pay
the bills on time and they're able to maintain a
healthy relationship you know what is going on there and
a lot of times that's not some horrible psychological dysfunction
it's something else it's you know limiting beliefs its habits
that we have it's a misunderstanding of how to how
to use their psychological resources to create the kind of
life that they want it's falling into a victim mind
my mindset so that's what positive psychology is about that's
what I'm about let me talk about a little bit
more depth of about positive psychology so really technically speaking
Martin Seligman is kind of quoted as being the father
of positive psychology he wrote a couple of really classic
books on on human performance and one of those is
called learned optimism where he talks about the the difference
between mindsets and pause and optimistic people and pessimistic people
it's a psychology classic then he also wrote a book
called authentic happiness which talks about the the scientific findings
that he has discovered about how to actually be happy
truly happy in your life so he's a he's a
college university professor there's also Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi very complicated long
name to pronounce but he's the author of flow and
he's also one of the founders of positive psychology classic
book flow talks about what it takes to get into
the state of flow and stages and flow is a
state that you get into when you become totally absorbed
totally in the moment totally focused for example when you're
when you're playing a sport or maybe you're you're really
killing it at the gym or you're killing it at
work or like you're writing something amazing and you're just
totally immersed in it and you're totally happy and you
lose self-consciousness that is the state of flow and so
he wrote a whole book on that and so the
two of them and also others like Sonja Lyubomirsky she
wrote the book called the how of happiness another awesome
book about some of the scientific findings about happiness which
I actually cover in my how to feel happy video
I cover a lot of her points so these are
some of the figures in positive psychology right now and
there's many others I'm not going to name them all
you can start to do a research and start to
immerse yourself by reading some of these books and you'll
you'll hear about other people right now that are really
forging a new era of psychology I think the 21st
century is amazing because the 20th century was all about
the psychology of dysfunction and that was good I'm sure
that helps many people who are dysfunctional but there are
far more people that are functional that want to be
optimal and the question and the challenge for the 21st
century is what do we need to teach them what
do we need to tell them to get themselves from
a functional to an optimal level and I love the
fact that there are guys out there guys and and
women that are out there right now researching this stuff
they're actually running scientific studies in universities they're they're doing
surveys they're thinking about this they're researching and they're bringing
those findings or publishing it in books or publishing it
in and research papers and they're giving talks about it
in places conferences like Ted where they give a lot
of be kind of the facts about how our psychology
works because this then informs the techniques that we use
the methods that we apply the things that we pursue
so thumbs up to those guys and gals that are
doing that right now I think actually what I would
say the father who the father is of positive psychology
I would actually say it's not more in Seligmann even
though he kind of coined the term and it has
been popularizing it I think it goes back to Abraham
Maslow who in the 1950s did some amazing just profound
work powerful work on self-actualization theory and self-actualization it's the
reason that I named my my website actualized org because
self-actualization is what it's all about this is how to
become the optimal human being how to achieve excellence as
a human being how to create an excellent life what
that entails psychologically speaking way too rich of a concept
to go into here I actually have many videos on
self actualization go ahead and search for those but I
would say that really positive psychology started with Abraham Maslow
and then it it started to take root from that
and now it's really in full force and I think
that over the next 10 20 50 years we're gonna
have a lot of new findings and a lot of
new information coming out of that from universities all across
the country and all across the world and I'm really
excited to read to read about more of that stuff
so awesome now we've compared old school psychology to this
new school psychology that we've got what about comparing positive
psychology to the self-help movement how are those similar and
how are those two different it's a fascinating question I'm
actually curious what my answer is so that myself and
I think I would say this positive psychology is the
research the technical research branch right this is the difference
this is done in universities they're actually doing studies they're
doing experiments they're doing science self-help movement is more focused
on the practicalities of helping you right now average Joe
Schmo figure out how to get some result in your
life that's what this help help movement is about positive
psychology is more about the science right because these positive
psychologists they actually want to know you know what is
the truth what is the truth about how to be
happier what is the truth about how to manage your
emotions you know is it is it better to use
one technique or another technique can we prove that objectively
through studies and research so doing that they're coming at
it from that perspective self-help is not about that self-help
is not as pedantic it's not worried about proving some
sort of cause it's not even worried about my covering
the truth self-help is worried about okay I am where
I am right now I don't have a lot of
money I have horrible health I have miserable relationships I'm
not happy what do I do to get myself out
of this rut and get me the kind of life
that I want what are the proven the proven methods
out there they're not proven by scientific research or studies
they've just been proven kind of in popular culture or
they've been proven personally and that is enough so that
is kind of the perspective that self-help is coming from
I actually think that self-help is is amazing and that
it's in many ways more powerful you might think that
well it's better to approach it's better to approach from
the scientific perspective because it's more rigorous there's more research
being done there's more scientific actually I think that if
you what you want is you want result in your
life which is probably what you're what you really care
about right is how to improve your relationship it's how
to get more money it's how to actually feel better
if you actually want that then I would say the
self-help movement is more of what you should be coming
at it from because it's much more practical it doesn't
worry about the pedantic or approving anything it looks at
all the different things throughout history that have worked by
various individuals and it kind of it finds the common
threads between all that and then you can find that
in a book self-help book here self-help book there there
are hundreds of amazing cell phone books out there actually
self-help dates back I mean we can date it back
hundreds of years but even thousands of years to old-school
philosophies like Buddhism and stoicism and various Greek and Roman
philosophies and in Eastern philosophies and even Middle Eastern philosophies
so there's there's lots of ideas there especially from ancient
times because people were really concerned back then not so
much about the science of being happy they were concerned
about how do I be happy how do I be
fulfilled how do I be successful to them it was
kind of a life and death situation you know they
had worried about their survival and some of them were
interested in how to be happy actually how to feel
it and so self-help has a long history that I
can't go into here but right now especially over the
last hundred years and even the last 50 years self-help
has just exploded because well because because it works because
people need to understand their psychology in order to improve
their life circumstances and that's what actualised org is about
so that's it I'm gonna wrap it up here on
positive psychology I hope that gave you better understanding of
what positive psychology is and how it's different from old
school psychology I hope it also peaked your interest in
curiosity not just on an intellectual level in positive psychology
but on a practical level and if it did then
what I want you to do is follow along with
me because actualized org is really built on the ideas
of positive psychology and it's built on the ideas and
really the ideal that Abraham Maslow espoused in in 1950
when he talked about self-actualization for me that is what
life is about if you want to create an amazing
life if you want to feel awesome if you want
to have the kind of success you want to have
you want to feel excitement you need to start to
master yourself master your own psychology when you master your
own psychology then the whole world opens up to you
you will be amazed at what can happen and you
don't need scientific theories and research experiments to prove that
to you it has been very well proven just through
individuals who go out there and do it and then
bring out their findings to us through self-help and I've
processed about $100,000 worth of self-help material from seminars to
books to audio products to DVD products over the last
few years and I'm continuing on that journey and I
want to bring all that goodness you there's so much
