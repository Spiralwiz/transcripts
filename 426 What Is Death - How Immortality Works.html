            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/1zjuDdysOL8' target='_blank'>What Is Death - How Immortality Works</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The concept of death is taken for granted</b>: In this section of the video transcript, Leo Gura explains that most people think of death as a given, a real fact of life that cannot be known or experienced until it happens. However, he encourages viewers to challenge these assumptions, questioning the certainty of death and the notion that its impossible to know anything about it. 
</li><li><b>Death equated with infinite love and consciousness</b>: According to Gura, when someone dies, they dissolve into an ocean of infinite love and consciousness. He presents the idea that death is synonymous with not just infinite love and consciousness, but also with concepts such as God, immortality, paradise or heaven, and complete non-duality. He argues that the fear of death is often based on a misunderstanding, considering it the worst possible thing that can happen, without knowing what it truly means.
</li><li><b>Challenging the negative perception of death</b>: Gura discusses how our perception of death is affected by our fear and self-centric views. These understandings are often grounded in assumptions rather than objective truths. Our irrational fear of death distorts our perspective, causing us to label it negatively without understanding what it truly is.
</li><li><b>Biased Self-centered view leads to distorted perception of mortality</b>: Our fear of death and our perception of its negativity is often tied up in our desire to survive and the preservation of our self-identity. Gura suggests that perceiving the world from this selfish viewpoint can prevent us from seeing the world as it is. We warp the world to fit our desires and instincts to survive, failing to see our understanding of self and survival as biased.
</li><li><b>Examining the relationship between life's beginning and end</b>: With a self-biased perspective, we view our lives as having a definite beginning and a definite end. Gura proposes that this perspective can trap us into fearing the inevitable end, not recognizing that this consideration of life and death is simply a result of our dualistic thinking. 
</li><li><b>Perceptions of death are shaped by the mind</b>: Gura argues that our understanding and fear of death are not predetermined or objective truths. Instead, they are constructs of our mind shaped by our dualistic thinking and biased self-perspective.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Validity of Death</b>: Leo Gura challenges the common notion that death is inherent and inevitable. He suggests that death might be a construct of the mind rather than a physical event. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Identity</b>: Gura argues that identity is not a scientific fact but a relativistic notion, something we construct ourselves. We identify ourselves with various characteristics which are not inherent facts but mental constructs. If we cease to identify with these labels and beliefs, Gura suggests we would not have been born. 
</li><li><b>Maintaining Life</b>: According to Gura, maintaining life and staying alive is not a one-time event, but something we do constantly by reaffirming these mental constructs of identity. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Death</b>: Gura argues that to understand death, we need to understand how life and birth works since you can't have death without birth. He also proposes the idea that our birth was not a biological process but a construction of the mind. 
</li><li><b>Loss of Identity as Death</b>: He defines death as the end of our identification with whatever we identify with, for example wealth or success. Entirely letting go of the core identity of being human would represent a true death of the identity. 
</li><li><b>True Self</b>: After letting go all layers of our identity, what remains is our 'true self', which Gura describes as formless and infinite consciousness that encompasses everything, whether something arises or not.
</li><li><b>Physical Death vs. Psychological Death</b>: Gura debates the notion of physical death versus that of psychological death. He suggests that physical death isn't necessary for consciousness to comprehend death because we were never the body in the first place. The body, Gura insists, is an identity we construct for ourselves, which we can deconstruct to experience death without physically dying.
</li><li><b>Contradicting Materialist Paradigm</b>: All of these concepts counter the prevailing materialist paradigm that assumes a physical external reality and hinges consciousness upon physical factors. Under this construct, death is a physical process from which there's no escape. But Gura questions this paradigm, suggesting it may not be true.
</li><li><b>Concept of psychological death before physical death</b>: Leo Gura discusses the idea of dying before the physical body dies or experiencing a psychological death. He shares that, through consciousness and explorations, he has experienced this psychological death many times, blurring the line between life and death. This, he describes, has made faced death less daunting, as he has understood that death does not involve going anywhere. Instead, it is about being everywhere, and nowhere specific. 
</li><li><b>Materialist assumptions about death</b>: According to Gura, the concept of death has been demonized by society. People are conditioned to perceive it as a terrible event to be avoided at all costs. However, he challenges this interpretation, stating our fear of death is based on materialistic assumptions that have never been questioned thoroughly. He suggests that if one realizes that death is unreal and solely a social construct, their attitude towards life, work, and relationships might change significantly.
</li><li><b>Connection between death and fear</b>: Gura talks about how fear is closely linked to our perception of death. The things humans fear the most are often unexplored, and death sits at the zenith of this fear. Therefore, the truth about existential concepts like love, infinity, God, and consciousness has been veiled in fear and tagged as death, further deepening the fear. 
</li><li><b>Duality of life and death</b>: Gura draws a clear distinction between life and death, associating death with truth, love, infinity, God, consciousness, selflessness. Whereas life is linked with selfishness, falsehood, delusion, attachment, construction, fantasies, illusions, and survival.
</li><li><b>Transformation into absolute selflessness</b>: Gura describes in great detail how the process of death leads to dissolution into absolute, infinite love. He likens it to a liter of water being let loose in outer space, with it transforming into an amorphous blob or a perfect sphere due to the absence of a container. This formlessness, he argues, represents the water in its truest, most essential state. Similarly, death is a transition into formlessness where one merges with the entire universe, losing all personal identity. 
</li><li><b>Paradox of death as the highest form of love</b>: Gura suggests a different perspective on death, describing it as the ultimate form of love. Instead of viewing it as a bleak, empty void or a fanciful afterlife, he presents death as a merger with the universe, a transition into being unlimited and formless. This dissolution of self, he explains, is the epitome of infinite love. He further notes that realizing death is unreal can greatly enhance one's life experiences and understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Transition from Form to Formlessness</b>: Leo Gura discusses death as a transition from a specific identity or form to a state of formless infinity. He emphasizes that individuals can live from this position without physically experiencing death by shedding all attachment to a defined identity and universally relating to all existence.
</li><li><b>Importance of Detachment</b>: Gura underscores the teachings of various religious figures and mystics that identify attachment as the opposition to spiritual growth. He describes how material attachments like wealth and success can block realization of a person's fundamental formless identity.
</li><li><b>Fear of Deaths Beauty</b>: Despite describing death as a state of absolute love and beauty, Gura acknowledges the widespread fear individuals have for it due to their attachment to their current forms. He asserts that structured societies, communities, and lifestyles are all tactics to avoid confronting the profound and existential reality of infinite love.
</li><li><b>Death is Unification</b>: In his explanation, life and death are parts of a continuous cycle of division and unification, where birth signifies division and death symbolizes the unification. While these may seem contradictory, Gura describes them as two sides of the same coin, both happening within one's universal, formless identity. 
</li><li><b>Living in Denial of Infinite Love</b>: Gura suggests that much of human existence involves active denial of infinite love, as developing consciousness into this state would cause a person to cease existing as a distinct entity. As such, those still alive are seen to be afraid of embracing this state of infinite love.
</li><li><b>Merging With the Collective Consciousness</b>: Talking about loss, Gura asserts that when individuals die, their consciousness merges with the collective consciousness present in everyone. However, people tend to separate themselves from this collective consciousness to create a distinct identity.
</li><li><b>Identity and Death are Relative</b>: He posits death as a relative concept, whereby one's personal identity dies while, from an absolute point of view, nothing truly dies, underscoring the notion of reincarnating at an infinite level.
</li><li><b>Immortality and Identity</b>: The idea of immortality is not a far-fetched concept but can be realized through a change in self-perception. It involves shifting identity from viewing oneself as a finite being (e.g., a single tree in a forest) to identifying as the infinite totality (e.g., the entire forest), and eventually the transcendent universe. Our mortality remains as long as we identify with any finite, limited entity. To attain true immortality, identification with infinite, formless concepts, beyond scientific understandings of the physical cosmos, is crucial.
</li><li><b>Transcending Duality</b>: Our fear of death and attachment to survival hold us back from realizing the inherent infinite love and goodness in life. Identifying with dualities narrows our perception, marking us as mortal. Hence, we need to comprehend and identify with the entire movement of reality or consciousness, transcending all dualities to realize immortality.
</li><li><b>Infinite Love and Fear</b>: Leo posits that life's setbacks, losses, and sufferings are finite and relative in the face of the absolute love and goodness. However, from our finite perspectives, we often misinterpret these setbacks as undermining to life's goodness. This misinterpretation is due to our attachment to survival and inability to comprehend infinite love. Rejecting infinite love leads to self-deception, with negative consequences such as depression, skepticism, and doubt. 
</li><li><b>Relinquishing Self-Deception</b>: Aligning oneself with life's process of self-transcendence and understanding results in peace and joy, while staying attached to self-deceptions leads to suffering. Despite our resistance and fears, we are destined to eventually melt into infinite love. This realization is considered God's mercy for all creation.
</li><li><b>Materiality vs Consciousness</b>: Physical suicide is not recommended; instead, Leo encourages viewers to transcend their struggles at a mental or existential level, embrace the beauty of the material world, and recognize oneself as both formless and formed. Our physical forms (humans, trees, stars) are mortal, but consciousness (truth and love) is immortal. 
</li><li><b>Death and God's Paradox</b>: Leo contends that concepts of killing and death do not apply to God, the absolute reality. However, when God is seen in a polarized form, these concepts can be understood as the unification of dualities. Changing one's identity from human to God is described as an empowering truth, leading to detachment from material existence and favorably enhancing life quality.
</li><li><b>Questioning physical suicide</b>: Leo discourages physically ending one's life out of depression or suffering; he sees it as a selfish act. Instead, he encourages overcoming struggles and suffering on a mental or existential level, and to become an example to others.
</li><li><b>Appreciating physical existence</b>: He emphasizes the beauty of existence and the remarkable nature of the physical world, urging individuals to appreciate and enjoy both their physical form and their spiritual journey. He states that our physical form and our formless essence are not mutually exclusive but part of a harmonious existence.
</li><li><b>Human mortality versus absolute immortality</b>: Leo maintains that humans, being formed entities, are not immortal; however, consciousness, truth, and love, which he defines as absolutes, are immortal. He presents the concept of "absolute" as something that is unchanging and cannot be created or destroyed, therefore immortal.
</li><li><b>Living in oneness</b>: He illustrates the concept of oneness and emphasizes its indivisible nature, stating that in a state of total oneness, even the idea of death becomes irrelevant. He asserts that in this state, the idea of killing something or going elsewhere cannot even arise; any change or movement would mean duality, which contradicts the concept of total oneness.
</li><li><b>Assuming the identity of God</b>: He suggests that by shifting our identity from being human to identifying as Godor adopting the concept of total onenesswe can achieve a form of "immortality." This change is described as the ultimate power of truth. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing potential attachments</b>: Despite awakening, he acknowledges that there might still exist attachments to life and mortality, emphasizing how hard it is to completely detach from all aspects of material existence even if one has experienced awakening. He advises, however, that reducing attachments can substantially improve ones life. 
</li><li><b>Enjoying both forms of existence</b>: Instead of wishing to leave physical existence immediately, Leo posits one can enjoy the pleasures and experiences life offers until death theoretically comes naturally, stating that you can enjoy the dual aspects of realityphysical life and spiritual immortality.
