hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I'm going to cover exactly how to
be more confident alright so this is a personal issue
for me because I've had a lot of confidence problems
that I've worked out over the last five years that
I'm still working on some but I think I have
some good insights for you about how to develop your
confidence and to understand really where you're coming from if
you're not feeling confident why it is that you're not
as confident as you see other people being and how
to flip that around so let's crack into it I'm
actually going to give you a recipe that you can
follow in the next 15 minutes to get yourself back
on track and being the confident type of person that
you want to be so confidence let's understand why you're
not confident and let's actually back up one step and
start with the idea that if you're not confident right
now if you're feeling meek if you're feeling very introverted
if you're feeling that you're not assertive if you're not
decisive with people and in social situations whether it's an
intimate relationship or at work or with your friends all
of that can be flipped around all that can be
changed you're going to have to do some deep personal
work some personal development in order to get yourself to
the place that you want to be at but you
can certainly do it I've done it in my own
life where I started out from is that I was
overweight for most of my childhood and up through college
and so that really crippled my self-image as far as
how attractive I felt I was as far as how
confident I could be in social situation both when in
a relationship with the opposite sex but even in work
type situations or even when I was interacting with let's
say grocery store clerk just the level of assertiveness that
I had there was not the level of assertiveness that
I wanted and so I realized that I had to
get this handled and so I started following some of
these principles I'm going to share with you and really
made a lot of progress so I really want to
encourage you to not tell yourself that you're just an
introvert that you're a shy type of person maybe you
have been up to this point but you can change
all that all that is changeable so let's talk about
why you're not confident the bottom line the reason that
you're not confident is because you have some limiting beliefs
that somehow got instilled in you whether you instilled them
in yourself or whether the environment that you were growing
up in as a kid or even as an early
adult instilled them into you somehow they got into your
system so limiting beliefs beliefs about for example caring what
other people think of you trying to get approval from
other people worrying that you're going to somehow make a
fool of yourself or somehow you're going to get rejected
or somehow you're going to get embarrassed or somehow you're
going to get disapproval in some way from the people
that you're talking with or that somehow what you have
to say is not as valuable as what other people
have to say or that somehow maybe you view yourself
as a naturally shy and kind of in your shell
type of person well all of those can be real
stumbling blocks towards developing your confidence and how do they
get into your system well they get into your system
because as you're growing up you have different conditions that
you're put into and a lot of times we literally
have one or two traumatic events in our past that
have suppressed our natural extraversion and I forget exactly who
the author was but I remember reading in one book
and I loved the brilliance of this is that the
author said that we are all born extroverted and those
that are introverts are simply introverts because something happened to
them to obscure and block their natural extraversion and I
find that to be true for me I had various
incidents in my past that have caused me to be
introverted you I'm sure have your own set of incidents
so maybe it was the way that your parents treated
you or maybe is the way that your siblings treated
you or maybe the way that things happened at school
maybe a friend rejected you maybe someone broke up with
you something traumatic like that that had caused you to
just retreat and go back into your shell and now
what happens is that that is ingrained somewhere deep in
your subconscious and you don't want to come out you
don't want to express yourself you feel like if you
are going to be your natural self and you're going
to be assertive with people that somehow it's going to
come back to hurt you so you feel insecure around
people whether in relationships intimately or at work or anywhere
else so that's the bottom line of it so if
you want to be more confident ultimately you have to
dig into these limiting beliefs that's the fundamental solution what
you got to do is you got to start identifying
and this is we're now getting into the recipe of
how to build your confidence all right so this is
the first step is I want you to start identifying
areas in your life specifically where you lack confidence so
don't just say I'm not a confident person identify where
you're not confident so maybe you're not confident when you're
on a date maybe you're not confident when you're a
bar and Club maybe you're not confident talking to the
opposite sex maybe you're not confident at work when you
just stand up for your beliefs maybe you're not confident
when you're interacting with a manager or a boss maybe
you're not confident when you're in a large group of
people maybe you're not even confident when you're in the
grocery store purchasing your groceries and just talking to the
cashier where are you lacking confidence maybe all the above
but probably I'm guessing some worse more specific right one
or two of those are specifically causing you the biggest
trouble so I want you to sit down and write
down what are all the specific areas in your life
where you're encountering this and when you get that specific
you're going to start to see some patterns emerge and
you're going to start identified a problem more specifically because
just general lack of confidence is very abstract and generic
so first you're going to hold that down and I
want you to really identify specifically the actions that are
happening so even when you're not confident let's say on
a date what is it exactly that's causing you insecurities
there think about that what actions is it the beginning
of the date when you first meet and you feel
kind of awkward and you don't know that person too
well so it's kind of awkward like should we hug
should we kiss should be a handshake like that or
is it you're uncomfortable talking about yourself and you feel
like you can't hold a conversation naturally or maybe you
feel unconfident X depressing some of the stories that you
have to share about your life and you feel like
maybe the person will reject you for them or they'll
think that you're weird or you'll get embarrassed or maybe
you feel you know some other hang-up there so where
exactly are you feeling unconfident on a date in your
work situation where are you feeling unconfident there how exactly
is that being manifest when you're sitting at a meeting
in a group meeting and people are standing up and
voicing their opinions and you're sitting there you're kind of
being quiet and meek make a note of that if
that's you or maybe it's when you see an opportunity
in your job maybe to step up and maybe put
yourself in line for a promotion position and your mind
tells you no no no don't don't do that stay
safe stay in your current place and maybe you're lacking
confidence in that way right or maybe you're lacking confidence
in voicing your thoughts and you can't get those out
or you're finding that you're having to hold back your
thoughts so make a list all these different ways that
you are not being confident then what I want you
to do is I want you to analyze each one
of those situations that you're facing and say what is
an alternative set of actions that you could be taking
so what would a confident person be doing so let's
say in that on that date situation what would the
most confident person who's extremely confident with the opposite sex
what would he or she do how would he or
she think and jot down some specific points how would
he talk about his stories how would she be thinking
about the situation how would he or she be carrying
himself what would the body language be like what would
the thought process be same thing with the situation at
work or anywhere else make a list of alternative actions
that you could be taking that would feel confident to
you if you took them so that is going to
be kind of your game plan once you identify the
situations and you identify the alternative actions you kind of
know what you need to do basically what you need
to do is you need to start changing your behaviors
and you need to start now living in and practicing
those alternative actions and I'm going to give you though
a couple of techniques that are going to go along
with this process to make a little bit easier so
you're going to want to baby step this is not
something that you going to really solve in a week
it's not even going to be something you solve in
a month just tell yourself that this is something worthwhile
to work on even if you don't fix it in
a month just slowly chip away at it and within
a year or two you'll find yourself really raising your
confidence level just by chipping away at it every day
every other day every week right and you are naturally
going to be able to do this because you're always
interacting with people and so you have these little opportunities
every day or every couple times a week to boost
up your confidence level by taking a new set of
actions rather than retreating into your shell like you have
been in the past so you're going to do that
you have to break out of your comfort zone a
little bit and a little at times it's going to
feel a little bit scary it's going to feel a
little bit threatening to you because you want to be
safe and you want to retreat back into your shell
but you got a set tell yourself is that in
the long run it's gonna be worthwhile to push it
and so you can kind of find that comfort zone
for you where can you push yourself a little bit
more a little bit more where it's not too scary
because if you make it super super scary then that's
just going to put you back into your shell even
more so just challenge yourself in small ways and I'm
gonna talk about that a little bit more in a
second then I'm going to give you a couple of
techniques here to help you along with this process so
besides finding opportunities where you can now take these alternative
actions and step out of your comfort zone the other
thing I want you to do is I'm going to
give you two affirmations that you're going to tell yourself
every morning for five minutes and I have another video
where I talk about how to do proper affirmation so
go ahead and check that out you can find it
on actualised org and also on YouTube but here I'm
just going to say number one affirmation is I love
being confident so you're going to say that to yourself
I love being confident I love being confident I love
being confident and you can do that for five minutes
straight every morning for at least two months without missing
a single day you're going to do that for five
minutes you get a timer and you time yourself five
minutes of that affirmation and then the second affirmation and
this one is I am independent of the good or
bad opinion of others I independent of the good or
bad opinion of others I am independent of the good
or bad opinion of others so this one this one
is also one you're going to spend five minutes on
every morning so total ten minutes use a stopwatch to
time yourself and do this each of them for two
months straight you're going to start to notice that it's
going to make a big big difference in how you
feel about yourself is going to start to work on
your subconscious image self-image of yourself now the reason I
mention this one that you are independent of the good
or bad opinion of others is that I find that
people that lack confidence the reason I like confidence is
because the bottom line of it is that you're afraid
that somehow you're going to cause disapproval in somebody else
and the bottom line there is that you just care
too much about what other people think of you the
fact is that it's not important what other people think
of you and now I can tell you that and
you might even agree with me logically but your subconscious
mind is still going to want that approval it's going
to crave approval and it's going to really be painful
to you when someone disapproves of you when someone disagrees
with you when someone says that what you're doing is
wrong when someone has a different opinion than you and
so what you got to do is you got to
start to somehow numb that down somehow get rid of
that belief and the way to do that I found
is really nice with that affirmation all right so those
two affirmations and then the last technique I'm going to
give you is a visualization technique you're going to spend
five minutes every morning for the next two months doing
this visualization you're going to picture yourself in that specific
situation that you made a list of you're going to
pick one situation the worst one for you where you
feel the least confident and then you're going to take
the alternative action that a confident person would take and
you can imagine yourself doing that in the moment right
now so the way you do a visualization I also
have other videos on that that you'll want to check
out is basically that you close your eyes and for
five minutes using a stopwatch you time yourself is you
picture yourself and you feel what it would be like
and you imagine in as much detail as possible what
would it be like for you to handle that situation
where you feel confident to handle it confidently so basically
you're pretending that you are a supernaturally confident person and
you're going to play that movie out in your mind
and you're going to just totally pretend and you're going
to totally forget about the fact that you're not confident
right now and you're just going to pretend that you
are and you're going to do that for two whole
months five minutes every day without missing a day Wow
if you do those things I guarantee you that your
confidence level will skyrocket it will totally change you're not
going to believe how effective these very simple techniques can
be so the final note that I'm going to end
on is that besides doing the affirmations and the visualizations
of course you're going to be doing those but then
those are really going to be priming you for the
real action that you'll be taking in your life which
is pushing your comfort zone in real-life situations so the
affirmations the visualizations will then get you more they'll basically
prime you to then when you're in that real when
you're really in the line of fire and you're at
that you're on that date or you're in that presentation
room at your at your work and you need to
be assertive and confident you're gonna you're going to actually
step up and take that action that a confident person
would take and you're going to have to force yourself
a little bit to do that and kind of push
through the fear push through any anxiety that you have
and as you do that consistently the more you do
it the more you do it then you are going
to become naturally confident person and you're going to grow
into it and it's not going to feel fake at
first it might feel a little bit force a little
bit fake but it's going to become very natural to
you as you just keep doing that the next and
last point that I'm going to end on is that
I want you to socialize more take opportunities to be
more social I find that people that don't have confidence
a lot of times is simply because they are doing
stuff where they're in solitary confinement they're sitting at home
or they're sitting at work in their cubicle they're not
out talking with people and they're actually actually actively denying
opportunities to socialize so maybe your friends one night on
a Friday night are going out to a party and
they invite you but you dismiss them in sand on
all stay home and read or maybe you know maybe
your girlfriend or boyfriend want to take you out and
introduce you to their social circle and you're like no
no no let's stay in and just watch a movie
or maybe at work the your coworkers are deciding to
do to host you know an after work party or
they're deciding to host uh like a weekly lunch that
you guys just get gathered together on and just uh
and just chat and socialize and you know they invite
you and you say no you know that's not for
me I'll just go have my own lunch I make
my own lunch I don't really want to go out
I don't want to pay for dinner or I don't
want to pay for lunch or whatever I want to
challenge you to stop that you need to socialize more
you need more opportunities to step out of your shell
out of your comfort zone and so take on those
opportunities first of all don't deny any opportunities that are
coming your way but even better go out there and
create some new opportunities for yourself what does that look
like well maybe every Friday night decide that you're going
to go out with some friends to a local bar
club maybe decide that you are going to join sort
of meetup group where you're going to talk to people
that are into whatever thing that you're into veteran to
your hobby you can go to meetup.com and find groups
there or maybe you are the one that's going to
initiate and create a lunch group at work so that
instead of waiting for other people to create it you're
going to be the leader and you're going to say
hey guys why don't we meet for lunch every Wednesday
at at noon and we're going to go to this
to this restaurant or to this bar this pub and
we're just going to just going to socialize we're going
to talk work non-work doesn't matter and try to get
some friends or try to get some colleagues together to
have that kind of social event and be the center
of that and set up set up step up and
try to be a bit of a leader so all
of this is I'm painting kind of in broad strokes
the the long term path that you want to take
you're going to want to start a baby step it
start small strong with the affirmation start with the visualizations
creating this list that we talked about and then go
out there and actually live it and you're going to
find that your life changes all right this is Leo
