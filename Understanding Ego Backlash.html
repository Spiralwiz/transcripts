In This episode we're gonna be talking about the ego
backlash Actually today I had a very different topic planned
but I Woke up and I was feeling so miserable
I had a cold all week and I still have
the sniffles and I also hurt my spine this week
twisted it somehow so it was hard for me to
sit and to meditate all week but I was kind
of like suffering through the pain and and then and
then towards the end of the week now I'm getting
this ego backlash from a lot of meditation and self-inquiry
Which is kind of fucking with my mind and so
I thought well This would be the perfect time to
talk about ego backlash since I'm going through it right
now so here we are So let's talk about this
and this is a very practical Matter Because if you're
going deep down on the self-actualization journey if you're going
into spirituality you will experience many, ego backlashes in your
life and so you want to be prepared for them
I Want you to start to think of the human
mind as a harmonic oscillator in Physics a harmonic oscillator
is like a simple spring where you pull back the
spring and you let it go and it kind of
goes bump up up up boom back and forth or
like a rubber band That's called a harmonic oscillator So
that's what your mind is See the mind is a
very complex system Filled with all sorts of symbols and
meanings that you create about your life and this is
really what the ego is We're talking about the ego
mind here This, is like your entire life we're talking
about the heart the engine that drives your entire life
that holds your entire life together This network of meanings
and symbols which is your mind in it or contained
all the behaviors and patterns and survival habits that you've
accumulated from birth basically through all of your childhood and
all of your teenage years and all of that has
been sort of hardwired and baked into this giant complex
vast nonlinear network Which is responsible for maintaining its own
survival in existence? because if this network didn't have a
survival driver mechanism and it didn't behave like a harmonic
oscillator, what would happen is we do just dissolve you
would, die literally you would die So you picked up
and built a lot of habits in your childhood? which
I would call something like survival habits These were habits
that were necessary for you to survive whatever survival demands
there were when you were born and basically throughout the
rest of your life so like whatever family you were
born into maybe you had some alcoholic father or mother
or Maybe you didn't get enough love in your in
your household or maybe you had some sort of bullying
older sibling who bullied you all the time or maybe
Your family didn't have a lot of money so your
parents were always fighting over how to pay the mortgage
next month and then that created a lot of stress
in your life Or maybe your mother or your father
Was very harsh and critical of you and didn't love
you for who you were but wanted you to be
somebody else Wanted you to turn out just like them
and you weren't like that or maybe you were bullied
at school or maybe you got picked on and laughed
at by By kids, or by your siblings or something
and so whatever that is you Know there's a million
different variations on that but whatever that is all of
that was presented to your mind and to your body
into your being as a survival challenge it's like you
had to you have to find coping strategies to deal
with that you needed to find coping strategies to get
your most basic biological needs met Food shelter safety but
then you Also needed to develop coping strategies once you
entered school and you started to socialize you need to
develop coping strategies for how to be loved and liked
and not ostracized from your community and So that people
respected you and then as you grew up older and
you got into your early 20s now you need to
how to make a living and survive in the world
that way and so now there's a whole set of
additional layer of survival habits that you had to construct
in order to be able to pay your bills and
to be a responsible adult and all this sorts of
stuff right and so this Is very deeply wired into
what your ego is your? Ego is not just the
sense of you but it's also all of those habits
and it's all this giant interconnected vast network of stuff
and it's very complicated and what happens is like any
complex system if you studied Systems Theory See, my episode
intro to systems thinking for that as You should know
by now any complex system has inertia to it it
also has a homeostatic drive to it, which means it
tries to maintain its current state because for a system
to be whatever it is however it is doesn't matter
how it is For it to maintain that structure over
a period of time whether it's days or months or
years or a human lifetime It has to maintain a
self-similarity because if that system changes too much or it
allows forces from the outside chaotic Forces to come in
there to rearrange the system whether it's for the worse
or for the better it doesn't matter to the system
it's always perceived as a as a mortal threat because
it literally is because like let's say you have a
castle built out of Legos right the Lego blocks and
There's a certain form that this castle takes well you
could say that's like a complex system In its metaphor
well if we rearrange the Lego blocks into some other
form, which is significantly different from the castle See if
the castle Was self-aware and it had a you know
if it was a living being and it could actually
be complex enough in order to to have a metabolism
and to be able to to look at itself and
perceive itself then What it would say is that wait
a minute too many of my blocks are being changed
and rearranged into this new structure and now this new
structure is not what I was and therefore that literally
is the death of the castle in This case see
and that's exactly what is happening inside your mind with
you in your life when you're trying to create some
kind of significant change or transformation in your life and
that Is what we're talking about with Self-actualization and with
all spiritual work is we're looking to get a significant
change in our life Which is something that's actually quite
rare very few people undertake a conscious deliberate effort to
Significantly change their life in a very fundamental way Most
people when they try to make a change in their
life they're just doing window dressing they're changing the very
surface of their life they're not going very deep trying
to change like fundamental existential Aspects of their being They,
change little things like they change maybe how they dress
or they change one of their friends out of a
dozen friends or maybe they change a relationship And and
and even that can be difficult even that can produce
ego backlash so what is ego backlash ego backlash if
We're thinking of the mind as this harmonic Oscillator it's
the oscillation of the string Or of this spring rather
it's the oscillation of the spring so what that means
is that you should expect that any time you make
a significant change to this complex dynamic Nonlinear living system
that you are you should expect a counter force that
will pull you back towards homeostasis towards the status quo
of whatever you were So if you were fat your
whole life and now you're trying to get skinny you
should expect a counterforce To come in and pull you
back towards being fat because being fat is a sort
of a survival Coping mechanism believe it or not that
your mind created and it's it's getting you some kind
of payoff So, maybe it's because you Were bullied at
school so much that you've developed such low self-esteem That
that's why you feel like you need to eat and
you're always? Overeating and you're eating all these desserts and
and all this sort of stuff Because you're not getting
them maybe the kind of love that you wanted to
get That's just like one example of course that's not
the the reason that all people are fat but that's
just one simplistic example and so The ego backlash is
just whenever you're trying to make progress in your life
and make a significant change the more significant of a
change you're making the more fundamental the change is Not
just window dressing stuff but if it goes like to
the existential level then you should expect a very significant
force to kind of pull you back out of it
That's ego backlash and it doesn't feel good and it
can feel very disappointing it can feel depressing Because you
feel like you've taken a giant step forward in your
life Trying to change something maybe you're trying to change
your career you're trying to change your diet you're trying
to change And become a better meditator or You're trying
to become a nicer person you're trying to work on
some emotional problem you have maybe you have some anger
problem and so you're trying to work on that so
that you don't Hurt, the people you love in your
life but then you make progress and Then as soon
as you feel like okay now I finally made it
have made the change and now it really seems like
it's it's stuck and then of course you backslide and
you take two steps back And Then you start to
wonder like will I ever change Is self-help even a
thing can even work Or is it just all pipe
dreams is spirituality really a thing or is it just
wishful thinking can I really make significant changes in my
life and the answer of course is that you certainly
can but it's gonna take a lot more work and
suffering, than you probably realized See most people don't appreciate
what change means change literally means the death of you
now there can be various degrees of this death from
a total degree 2 minor degrees, which is mostly what
people encounter you know like for example when you're trying
to change your diet some part of you really is
going to die if your diet is really gonna change
and so that part of you will be struggling to
make sure that you don't change your diet because that
part of you doesn't want to die it's scared And
Of course it's not just gonna come out and outright
tell You what's going on all of these are various
kind of like subsurface subconscious Forces and a lot of
times all you experience is you just experience like the
the blunt emotional impact of the ego backlash the ego
backlash usually doesn't announce itself to you like oh here
I am After your meditation retreat you know you've done
all this meditation work and now here I come the
ego backlash It doesn't work that way usually it just
feels like some sort of very primal force emotional force
is Driving you back to your old unhealthy dysfunctional ways
Like you might get a craving for some cheesecake or
You might get a craving for some poor nerf or
some sex or you might get this real like sadness
in you that makes you want to go back to
your ex And make up with them even though you
know that they're abusive to you Or you know after
after? Weeks or months of meditating hardcore doing all this
self inquiry and and you know making lots of spiritual
progress Then all of a sudden you crash back down
into your ego and you you start to judge people
and you start to criticize people and you start to
demonize people which was something that you would think you'd
be over by now and now like it comes back
maybe now some anger comes back at you kind of
like that and you're like it sweeps you it sweeps
you like like a giant ocean wave just kind of
carries you out into the ocean away from shore That
you've been swimming to it's kind of like that and
that can be very frustrating and It can take you
by surprise Because a lot of times in this work
We like to trick ourselves the ego likes to trick
itself into thinking that it's more developed in advance than
it really is That it's further along than it really
is Especially when it starts to see a little bit
of progress it tends to over Estimate its own progress
and it's like okay now we're going you know now
we're moving towards something we're moving towards enlightenment and now
you Think okay now the worst is yet behind me?
And usually, when you think like that the worst is
yet a head of you? so you want to be
prepared so the value of talking about this topic is
just to to set the proper expectations and I do
have an episode called setting proper expectations Go check that
one out because that one's also very important it dovetails
with what I'm talking about here so What you need
to understand is that when we're talking about creating a
significant change in our life we are talking about chilling
aspects of ourselves and we are talking about Reconfiguring this
vast complex Nonlinear system that is your mind that is
holding your entire life together and that's a tricky proposition
because Mmm you know oftentimes when you're making a significant
change it's not just a straight-up improvement it's not always
just that you take this giant tangle of complicated Survival
habits that you've had your whole life and that you
just like slap on some positive healthy stuff on top
of it and everything gets better a lot of times
what you have to do is you have to kind
of like regress first and Certain, parts of your life
have to like you have to like break it apart
you know it may be like you take your career
and you look at your career and you you and
you you think about how My career is so inauthentic
like what I'm doing at Work maybe I'm even doing
something that violates my greatest values maybe I'm I'm Violating
integrity maybe I'm even doing something illegal with my work
and then you have to like look at that you
have to see that oh for me to move to
the next level like in my spiritual growth To be
more authentic with people in my life with my children
Or with my wife and all of that I would
first have to resolve this deeper in authenticity that's there
in my career But my career of course is tied
to my ability to support My family right because if
I lose my career how am I gonna support them
maybe then my wife will leave me and my children
will then hate me for getting divorced with my wife
and you know my whole life will fall apart and
So, that's why you never really look deeply at your
career You never are able to to make any significant
change in your career because of course every part of
your life is Connected with every other part and it's
kind of like um like a house of cards that's
holding itself up and you know if you start to
question one little corner and you sort of pull on
the cards over here the whole thing is gonna collapse
and so your mind is scared of that it knows
that and then especially when we're talking about doing The
deepest spiritual work if we're talking about self inquiry if
we're talking about Hardcore meditation if we're talking about doing
solo meditation retreats the kind that I've demonstrated on my
blog If we're talking about deep psychedelic trips where you're
questioning your entire life you know this is like where
you're questioning the very foundation of your house of cards
and This, is where it does get scary because your
whole life could start to fall apart depending on how
dysfunctional your life is and all of us have various
kinds of dysfunctions in our lives but of course it
comes in degrees some of it some of us have
a lot more of it than others do So if
your life is extremely dysfunctional Your ego is not even
gonna let you analyze The very foundation of your house
of cards because it's way too. Threatening it's way too
painful it's gonna cause way too much suffering to do
that so your ego is gonna keep all your awareness
only at the surface level of your house of cards
and even then you're gonna struggle you're gonna struggle even
just to make changes at the surface but you know
for you to get Significant improvement in the quality of
your life that is directly proportional to how deep you
can go and how much you can work on the
foundation and how much you can tolerate working on the
foundation and working on the foundation Necessarily comes with suffering
Because suffering is what you're Sort of Always trying to
avoid in your life that's like what the egos whole
game is that's what you do in your whole life
is you only do basically two things one is you
avoid suffering and two is that you pursue pleasure That's
your whole life in a nutshell that's your whole life
from the moment you were born up to today in
Every facet of your life from your career to your
eating habits to your exercise habits or lack thereof to
your relationships and to your education and everything else all
right you're avoiding suffering and you're pursuing pleasure And that
constitutes was survival is survival you're always Trying to survive
and What spirituality is is is trying to transcend your
survival drives and to look at reality in a more
fundamental way see reality The way that it looks? when
you're not preoccupied with survival and Survival is not just
physical survival it also includes your social survival So even
though you might think like well Leo I'm not I'm
not surviving every day you know I've got a pretty
decent House and I've got a car and I've got
my food needs met and all that so I'm not
surviving. Oh Yes, you are you're you're busy struggling to
survive in the social domain try to be liked try
to become famous trying to get approval from people Trying
to manage your relationships with your family and your friends
and your girlfriend and your boyfriend and husband and wife
and all of this and children and you're trying to
maintain that whole house of cards See So look very
closely at your life to see that that's what you're
doing most of the time 99% of the time you're
just preoccupied with survival and so of course Because the
ego is built Upon, the avoidance of suffering and the
ego creates all sort of very clever structures in order
to avoid suffering and to maximize pleasure and because your
whole life has been kind of built upon that and
Built these structures like one is built upon another upon
another upon others for like an ancient city you know
like an ancient old city like modern Rome is gonna
be built on on many layers of Ancient ruins you
know there's probably like 10 or 20 layers of ancient
Rome underneath modern Rome that it was built upon well
that's sort of how your your mind and your psyche
is constructed in your ego and So of course to
get the most significant change we have to go very
deep to the lowest levels to the like the to
the origin all of those existential Problems that you've been
avoiding your whole life well we have to deal with
us And of course the whole point of avoiding them
the reason you were avoiding them in the first place
and you created all these clever defense mechanisms and Survival
strategies to cope with those is because you didn't want
to look at them you didn't really want to deal
with the core issues and so Because of this you
should expect that if you do start to you know
excavate down below do some psychic archeology on yourself then
what you're gonna discover is that there's a There's a
lot of skeletons in your closet down there which are
of course Responsible for why you feel so incomplete so
broken so dissatisfied so unfulfilled with life and so fundamentally
inauthentic Which is why you worry so much about getting
approval from other people you, worry so much about them
liking you in the social domain Because you have spent
your whole life avoiding the deep existential issues and now
anytime you try to tackle those deep existential issues Suffering
will come up Because you've been sweeping that stuff under
the rug and The ego backlash a lot of times
comes from a sort of recognition of your own inauthenticity
Here you were thinking you were the self developed person
and you were working hard on yourself and you accomplished
all this stuff in your Life but then The rude
awakening Comes that it's like oh all of that was
just a facade I was lying to the outside world
and I was lying to myself and there are these
deeper truths that I Didn't want to look at and
now I'm looking at and now of course it's it's
like it's Agitating to me and of course now you
have these emotions that come up fear anger envy jealousy
Sadness is a very common one you might feel a
kind of a sense of loss like you're losing something
in your life and that's right you're losing a part
of your ego and if we're talking about going you
know to you self-inquiry towards ultimate enlightenment then you're gonna
be losing yourself not just a fragment of your ego
but the entire thing and how do you cope with
that and that's what I've been sort of coping with
this week is I was doing some pretty deep self
inquiry and You know it's dawning on me more and
more that there's no self there and That you know
my entire personality and ego is just a house of
cards and so the more you look at that it's
one thing to just kind of know that intellectually it's
even another thing to to see glimpses of it of
course you know I've had many very profound non-dual experiences
and various mystical states and highs But then it's sort
of another thing to actually start to like let those
insights permeate your psyche and start to affect your everyday
world and Now it starts to get real you know
now you really feel it because now You know what
does this mean for my career what does this mean
for my business so what does this mean for my
money situation What does this mean for my relationships will
I ever you know even be in a relationship again
what does it mean for my friendships what does it
mean for like my family do I even speak to
my family anymore like you know your mind starts to
accost you with all these Fears and doubts and concerns
and some of those are legitimate Your life may need
to fall apart before you're able to reconstruct it into
something healthy and That's what most people don't appreciate most
people if they try to do is they try to
always build more and more and more on top of
their life they They take this sort of additive approach
but they don't realize that you know stuff Does have
to die off if we're talking about significant change you
can't just keep adding more and more To your ego
or I mean you can but that's just not gonna
solve your problems Because there's there's the foundational problems that
are not going to be fixed just through the additive
approach So in my own life when do I get
the biggest ego backlashes oftentimes is after a a deep
breakthrough on psychedelics and And the way that manifests is
that often times then I want to Sort of avoid
any kind of spiritual work after that. I might want
to avoid meditation I might want to avoid self inquiry
I might want to avoid psychedelics for a long time
because Mmm well the ego mind knows that if he
keeps going in this direction That's going to be the
end of the ego mind and The rate at which
you grow or the way the rate at which you
deconstruct yourself is very important because sometimes when you try
to do it too quickly The ego backlash becomes so
strong that actually it becomes counterproductive You can kind of
freak yourself out of changing or growing and then you
can kind of like shrink from the challenge and then
you can kind of just sort of avoid it for
years and so that's important to to be mindful of
is that you want to be able to select a
sort of a pace of growth or Deconstruction which Which
is kind of stretch you? You're still gonna suffer it's
gonna stretch you it's gonna be difficult but not so
much that it scares you completely off the path which
can sometimes happen so And it's difficult to tell you
you know how to strike that balance you know where
do you draw that line Between doing too much meditation
too much self inquiry too Much psychedelics to changing too
many habits in your life at once and then you
End up just completely backsliding and then maybe spending the
next year playing video games and eating hot pockets in
your mother's basement sort of thing right so you got
to find what that what that line is for you
and you want to stay just under that line so
that you don't you don't trip yourself into into kind
of like regressing in a way where you're just like
Completely disillusioned with self development completely disillusioned with spiritual work
And So, that's why Self-love is is important that's why
self reflection isn't because you've got to kind of self
reflect and kind of be very honest with yourself and
kind of Have an honest assessment of where you're at
right now in your life and how much change can
you really handle And The mind is so tricky because
sometimes the mind will use that against you and they'll
say Oh, well I can't handle this I can't handle
it another meditation retreat. I can't handle more psychedelics when
you really can it's just that your mind will of
course use this to to get you not to change
and so it becomes the sort of psychological Cat-and-mouse game
with your own mind about you know how much change
can you really tolerate Without a complete regression and the
only way you're gonna figure that out is just through
trial and error and being very mindful of the dynamics
that are going in your mind be very mindful of
how sneaky the ego is and how it plays tricks
on you And just honestly going through these backsliding episodes
where you know you make a big change you backslide
and Then you try it again you backslide again you
try to get you back so that you know sometimes
you got to do that three or four times kind
of learn where where your own Tipping points are Also
in my own life besides psychedelic trips I experienced this
after solo retreats or the posture retreats you know you
spend 10 days meditating non-stop and then you come back
from that and usually what happens is that very quickly
the ego gets sucked back in to Watching television for
me playing video games which usually I don't do but
that oftentimes after a retreat I'll want to play some
video games Eating someone healthy food sometimes I don't you
get that too much anymore But that happens after retreats
after after self loss of self inquiry I also get
some of these tendencies and Very interestingly sometimes I listen
to binaural beats which are these like meditation Different sound
frequencies that play in each year and If you listen
to a lot of binaural beats What can happen is
that they can cause emotional upheaval stuff can come up
in your psyche stuff from From your past old memories
all sorts of garbage can kind of just come up
to the surface of your consciousness and then you have
to process that and from that can come ego backlash
But I mean by no means is this an exhaustive
list. I mean people will experience ego backlash from so
many different things from enlightenment experiences From various glimpses of
non-duality if you're just trying to install new habits like
maybe you're trying to change your work habits Like to
develop a strong work ethic maybe you're trying to wake
up early in the morning that can cause an ego
backlash if you spend your whole life not doing that
If you're trying to change your diet that's a very
common one if you're doing a nofap challenge very common
to get ego by backlashes there so What do you
do to minimize? ego backlash and how do you deal
with it well firstly you just expect it You want
to understand your mind as this harmonic oscillator and you
want to appreciate The homeostatic forces which are keeping you
alive so it's not that your mind is evil or
bad in in kind of pulling you back your mind
is this very safety and survival oriented and it has
to be to keep you alive and you know sometimes
you can really appreciate the power of homeostasis and the
value of it like for example when you have a
terrible psychedelic trip a really bad one like a really
gnarly one that scares the shit out of you But
then you're thankful the next day because your mind Brings
you back brings you back to normal Within a week
you're back to normal you forget about the trip it's
out of your mind and you're just back to normal
and you're Thankful for that because you don't want to
be stuck in that horror full State of madness that
you were in when you're on one of these very
deep psychedelic bad trips So you can appreciate that see
there homeostasis is working in your favor it's making sure
you don't go crazy because if it was that easy
to shift your mind you could easily like take a
psychedelic shift your mind into total madness and Then and
then stay that way for the rest your life now
that would be a problem wouldn't it So the homeostasis
is there to protect you Now of course just like
an overprotective mother or father The effect on the child
can be very damaging even though the intention is good
and that is sort of what happens is that All
these survival mechanisms that, we built when we were a
child and early adults? They turn out to be not
as necessary as we thought they were especially after you
know we've kind of outgrown Those various risks and dangers
that we faced now We don't face them anymore but
those habits that we create in order to solve those
issues are still there And they're still running our lives
So very importantly just expect that ego backlash will happen
any significant change generally comes with suffering It's gonna come
with fear. It's gonna come with various emotions that come
up so When this stuff does happen if you're making
a big change in your life start to label it
explicitly call it out as an ego backlash, so when
it's happening to you can just say to yourself oh,
oh Yeah, that's the ego a backlash that leo is
talking about oh yeah there it is That helps you
to get some distance from it so you're not totally
sucked in and absorbed to it the next step is
to observe it as mindfully as possible and this is
where it helps for you to have a meditation habit
and To do these various kinds of retreats that. I'm
talking about or to do psychedelics all of these develop
more mindfulness within you so if you have some mindfulness
skills that you've hopefully built up already then you want
to apply those in your moment of sadness depression fear
and General contraction so generally what happens is the ego
contracts so as the ego contracts the more mindfulness you
have the more easily you can observe the contraction without
getting sucked into the contraction and acting from the contraction
and very importantly at this point if you're mindful enough
you want to remind yourself not to make any kind
of drastic major life decisions in this state of contraction
Because you could easily make some kind of foolish rash
decision like I'm leaving my family or I'm I'm divorcing
my spouse Or I'm quitting my job, or you could
even get to the point we say I'm killing myself
Be very careful about that because this can be dangerous
You want to make sure That you don't make any
kind of major life decisions when you're feeling negative when
you're feeling crippled by fear anger sadness or anything like
this When you're feeling very disempowered when you're feeling like
a victim and all of this will happen to you
All right that's that's what makes the ego backlash so
difficult is that it's got so much emotional charge to
it that it just kind of like sucks you and
sweeps you away and you're not able to like think
clearly All of your lofty high ideals all of the
the reasons that you were pursuing enlightenment and spirituality and
the reason you're pursuing self-actualization the good person you're trying
to become all the love and the beauty of life
all of that gets stripped away from you in this
moment of ego backlash you don't have it You're feeling
very negative at that moment it's gonna feel to you
like there's no hope your life is gonna be terrible
in that spirituality will never work for you and you'll
never get enlightened and you'll never be able to To
change your diet and you'll never be able to find
a good job and you'll never be able to to
get a good girlfriend or a good boyfriend you know
you're gonna feel very negative and You want to make
sure to remind yourself not to make any major life
decisions at that point And just mindfully observe the suffering
I have an episode called How to deal with strong
negative emotions That's a very important episode for when you're
in this the the dot sort of the depth of
the ego backlash so that you can just kind of
suffer it mindfully and let that suffering actually purify you
and grow you and so there's sort of a silver
lining to these ego back lashes in a sense it's
terrible because you're like at the worst that you would
feel in your life during these moments and It also
feels like you're not making any progress But at the
same time if you're able to suffer it Mindfully that
suffering will purify you and in that you will actually
make your greatest progress So this is another one of
those very counterintuitive things these things that kind of go
full circle it's precisely, when you're backsliding that you have
the opportunity to Learn the most about yourself and to
grow the most but it's also precisely because of that
that it's the most difficult for you to remain mindful
during that moment and To maintain all of your good
habits and that's another way to deal with ego backlash
is As much as you can try to maintain your
positive habits even if you don't feel like it So
If you're in the midst of an ego backlash you
probably won't want to meditate that day you'll want to
skip it you probably won't want to observe your diet
that day you'll want to go splurge on some cheesecake
and you probably Won't want to be nice to your
children or to your friends or to your family members
huh, push yourself just to be nice anyways Like today
I really didn't want to shoot this video like I
was really debating about whether I should shoot or not
I felt like procrastinating it And I just kind of
went through the motions and then you know by the
time that I turned on the camera It's really not
much different than any other day The next thing to
remember, when dealing with an ego backlash, is to not
get discouraged by it Frame it in a positive way
Frame it as though this is growth this is part
of the growth process What's really important is to stop
thinking of growth as a straight constantly upwards moving line
on a graph that's not what your spiritual growth or
your self-actualization growth will look like it will look with
like you know jagged sawtooth kind of pattern with lots
of ups and downs and sometimes big spikes downward and
Usually it's when you get to your biggest spike downward
that then you get your biggest spike upward as well
So the way that I try to reframe it in
my mind, whenever I'm having this emotional upheaval or I'm
feeling Like I'm regressing is just that This is the
path this is the growth. I'm growing right now as
I'm doing this as I'm suffering through this this is
the growth That's a really important reframe And also how
you deal with it is that you stop expecting quick
fixes and easy one-time solutions Almost never in your life
will there be just one thing that will just come
in there and resolve all your stuff for you It
just doesn't work that way So Make sure you get
your expectations right Get them right now because right now
you're probably not an ego Backlash state so that when
you do get into an ego backlash state in a
month or in a year or in five years you'll
remember this You'll remember these points and you'll be able
to console yourself While you're in the midst of it?
it's also very powerful to apply self love in these
ego backlash states and what that means is that you
Don't fall into the temptation of guilting yourself and judging
yourself and condemning yourself That's very common That's our natural
inclinations to say all but I thought I was better
I thought I was stronger this shouldn't be happening to
me Why am I so weak why am I so
pathetic why can't I get my shit together Why do
I just keep splurging on this food why do I
have to go and jerk off to this porn why
do I have to watch this television or I you
start to guilt yourself for that and that just doubles
your misery and When you're doing that that's precisely when
you're not learning you're not suffering mindfully there So rather
than that try to love yourself more during this moment
try to be easy on yourself So we've talked about
various examples of course we're just touching the tip of
the iceberg of all the different examples that exist that
are possible for ego backlashes to occur that will cause
them So the other thing you should be aware of
though is that there's something called the collective ego backlash
as well Individually we have egos collectively complex systems Also,
behave as though they have egos and survival drives for
example I have an episode called collective ego which talks
about a lot of these collective dynamics that. Many people
aren't aware of So the ego backlash will also occur
there it can occur within corporations within governments within political
parties and If you're stood of history then you you've
seen this you've seen this play out in ancient history
but, also in modern history so for example Reconstruction after
the Civil. War in the American South what was that
but a collective ego backlash against the abolition of slavery?
So things like the Jim Crow laws That's ego backlash
at the collective level and Then if you're student of
German history and the world wars then you know that
World. War two was? really sort of an ego backlash
of the German people against the way they were treated
in The end of World War one with the sort
of a very harsh treaty that was imposed upon them
after losing World War one the weight of that Punishment
really just sort of created a festering wound Which ultimately
allowed Hitler to come to power and create World War
two so We can think of that as a collective
ego backlash You Can also think of the crackdown on
psychedelics that happened in the late 60s and early 70s
after the hippy revolution in America What was that but
a collective ego backlash? Psychedelics were outlawed all these laws
were passed by the Nixon administration and others the war
on drugs was declared and it's really still going on
today and these beautiful substances were demonized and All scientific
research on them, was basically banned for heard for decades
and we're still to a certain extent going through that
Although now psychedelics are going through sort of a second
Renaissance Gamergate what is that but a collective you go
backlash against various stage green spiral dynamics forces that are
coming to the floor and reshaping society like Feminism and
Multiculturalism and all of this so gamergate was a reaction
against that a Lot of times you notice that if
you're familiar with the spa dynamics stages that one stage
will react strongly against Another stage above it trying to
dominate it or try to demonize it So for example
if feminists from stage green try to demonize stage orange
Masculinity too much stage orange masculinity will come back and
you know try to defend itself through an ego backlash
and What about the the Tea Party and the alt-right
movement that was born over the last ten years here
in America really after the election of Obama That was
a very interesting collective ego backlash sort of a stage
blue/orange ego backlash against against green And that's still going
on today and really the election of Trump was really
just a collective ego backlash Against Obama you can think
of it that way that's one way to analyze it
that's not the only factor but It is a factor
a very interesting factor it's very interesting for example that
Trump's rise to popularity Within politics really started with the
whole birtherism thing which was really a direct attack on
Obama there interesting how that worked So you see? Complex
systems which of course include government's corporations political parties social
movements of various kinds they behave just like all complex
systems do like these for the harmonic oscillators and so
for a corporation to be able to sustain itself or
for a political party to sustain itself as it is
it has to resist death And the way that it
does that is by Defending itself at all costs even
When it's dysfunctional even with it's pathological Even, when it
hurts itself it still does it and in fact you
know the Republican Party in America right now is self-destructing
the last two years have we've been witnessing the self-destruction
of the of the of the Republican Party but the
People in the party of many of them some of
them see it but many of them don't see it
because they are part of the system and so of
course the system doesn't see that is Sabotaging itself and
that's exactly what's happening with you individually in your life?
You have the intention to you know clean up your
diet and to eat healthy but then you sabotage yourself
Along the way and you're not conscious enough to really
see how you're damaging yourself because you have kind of
different arts in your mind they're kind of fragmented and
fight against each other you have like the the higher
self the lower self and Stuff in between and all
this needs to get Reconciled and it's this reconciliation process
which really is like a war a war is raging
in your mind in the same way that you know
you to have a War in Europe in order to
ultimately pacify Europe to unify Europe required many many wars
Europe is quite unified right now but that's only because
there have been like Hundreds of wars in European history
over the last couple thousand years that have ultimately led
to this unification and even now you know it's not
totally unified there's parts of the European Union, which are
breaking off all the time and There's rise of nationalist
movements against the European Union right now so it's it's
very interesting to observe these dynamics happening out in the
world socially with corporations and governments and political parties but
then should also Notice that the same stuff is happening
inside of you The same kind of dynamic then you
see this kind of parallel between the collective level and
the individual level and it's it's very fascinating but of
course all of this will just be theory When you're
in the heat of the moment yourself when you're actually
suffering through it all of this theory is gonna fly
out the window none of its going to really matter
to you so When you're really in it that's where
you want to build the mindfulness skills to be able
to suffer through it mindfully and Just try to do
the best you can try to love yourself try to
be gentle on yourself and then always remember that just
because you've failed to make a change Doesn't really mean
anything because you can come back next week next month
next year and attempt to make the change again Only
this time really you'll be smarter Because every time you
fail every time you backslide if you're mindful if you
backslide mindfully then you will notice the various little sneaky
maneuvers that your ego uses Against you to keep yourself
in homeostasis? You'll you'll start to notice various like mental
tricks and self deception tactics all those deception mechanisms that
I talked about in my Three-part series about self-deception you'll
start to notice more and more of those You'll start
to notice all the smoke screens that your mind throws
up all the ways that it projects out on to
the outside world how it resists taking responsibility and as
you watch all of that you sort of notice just
how Sneaky this beast called ego is it's pure sneakiness
it's pure devilry pure trickery that's all it is And
this is how the devil does his work is Through
trickery through sleight of hand see my episode about what
is the devil See, so we're bringing in a lot
of stuff, together here and Now you start to really
understand Why life is so? Challenging? It's because of all
the trickery that's involved all the tricks that you play
on yourself And Why life is a maze see my
episode about life is a maze It's amazed because you're
lost in the maze of your own mind You're not
sure how to distinguish your genuine Motivations from the trickery
that the devil in you throws up. Which is the
ego and so you're trying to sort all this out
and that's why you have 80 years to live ously
you can Soar, through all this stuff, you need a
lot of attempts So don't get discouraged by this Also
It's important to distinguish between states and stages of development
a State is like a peak experience that you have
and a lot of times what people do especially when
we're not Eve and we just get into self development
is That we have a peak state whether it's on
a psychedelic or just on a meditation retreat Or just
in our life you know we're feeling great or on
top of the world And then we just assume that
Well that state it'll just lock in that's how my
life will be from now on and it's never that
way It's much easier to attain a high state than
it is to attain a high stage of development this
is a distinction that I got from ken wilber the
distinction between states and stages a Stage of development takes
years of work to build You have to work on
it consistently So even though as a Newbie meditator you
could have a peak meditative state that goes very high
and might even reach the depths of a Zen master
But you're not going to be at the Zen masters
stage of development when it comes to meditation because for
that you would need to meditate for years and decades
to be able to reach a sort of a sort
of a baseline level of solid meditation abilities All right
like any newbie can just get a little bit lucky
here and there can have a lucky break and things
go right in their life But it really takes a
dedication to this path to be able to to build
sort of a solid stage of Meditation ability or business
skill or relationship Skills, or anything like that so Make
that distinction and don't just get tricked and seduced by
the high states Because usually after a high state what
happens of course you drop back down If you noticed
after your Greatest emotional highs in life you usually end
up feeling pretty low and Vice-versa after your lowest emotional
lows in life actually the next day the next week
you can end up feeling pretty good So that's also
one way that I consoled myself, when I'm in a
bad mood or I'm feeling negative or something like that
is that I just remind myself that usually after my
worst States of feeling I will experience some of my
best ones and I will rise to a sort of
a new level a new stage will be reached if
I can just Suffer through this mindfully and of course
I never am able to suffer through a situation fully
mindfully So don't be a perfectionist about it here because
again if your perfectionistic about being mindful all the time
of all your suffering then of course you're always gonna
fall short of that and that's just going to make
you more miserable and more depressed So keep all these
points in mind if you ever do experience an ego
backlash in the future a very strong one Remind yourself
that this episode is here you can always go to
YouTube type in ego. Backlash this episode will pop up
listen to it again and Hopefully that helps you to
to grab yourself center yourself and suffer through the moment
mindfully But even better would be if you just kind
of like remember this lesson deep in your mind Such
that no matter where you are if you don't have
internet access even if you don't have YouTube even if
it if this video gets taken down or whatever You
will remember for the rest of your life how to
cope through these challenging moments Alright that's it I'm done
here. Please click the like button for me and come
check out actualize. That'll work, that's my website there you
will find The book list my life purpose course my
blog and the forum where you can also get Emotional
support for this journey The last thing I'll say is
that it's amazing You know you can watch a lot
of these videos from me or from other people you
can read a lot of books about how to do
personal development and spirituality but when you actually start doing
it the work will feel very different than how you
thought it would go or how you thought it would
feel just from watching all the videos and gathering up
all the concepts none of the videos and none of
the concepts can really get you a sense of what
this work entails Just how deep it goes just how
broad it is just how multifaceted it is and also
how much more difficult and complex it is then even
my relatively complex videos and theories Pointed out to be
That's why you need to start doing the actual work
and You might discover that The best way to do
the work at some point is not even to watch
me anymore not even to listen to my videos Because
all dad just becomes more theory sometimes you just go
deeply into the work and let the work kind of
guide you itself In the end all of the answers
are inside of you you don't really need me you
don't need elaborate theories and books and all of this
this is mostly just kind of like for entertainment I
enjoy, philosophy I enjoy talking about these ideas I enjoy
breaking stuff down and analyzing things and making it complex
like I just Enjoy, that I don't know what else
I would really do in life if I wasn't doing
that it's just kind of interesting to me But also
it's not necessarily that beneficial you don't need all this
detailed stuff, you don't need to take copious notes on
all of these complicated theories and concepts really that can
be a distraction so be careful Ground yourself in the
work that's absolutely important Ground yourself in the work and
let your work Reveal to you what is true as
You actually do the work you will discover that various
things that I've said various ways that I've conceptualized stuff
various Models that I've shared with you aren't quite right
That's right Because the work itself is its own thing
And it's very messy it's very Individualized it's very different
for different people so even though some of these models
and concepts might be true for me and work for
me They might not work for you because you've got
your own Different problems and coping strategies that you've invented
while you were growing up that need to be dealt
with And the only way you're gonna discover those is
really Going inside yourself So If you like the theory
and all that all this analysis that's great just don't
get lost in it don't turn it into an ideology
Don't turn it into an addiction that's very easy very
easy I mean hell I'm addicted to talking about this
stuff for sure I have addicted to reading various kinds
of Self-help books, I mean I probably at this point
don't even need to read another self-help book in my
entire life I Have enough theory that I could spend
40 years trying to actualize it all and that will
be what I'm doing more and more in the future
is I'm gonna be Relying less on theory and more
on just like going really deeply into the work And
that can be scary because a lot of people What
they do is they they use the theory and the
philosophy and all this all the concepts and models to
actually Not do the work Because of course the ego
is very sneaky and the ego will use any trick
up its sleeve to maintain homeostasis and so if it
can just lose itself at a bunch of fancy theory
and cool Philosophy then that's what it'll do it'll do
that for 10 years and not accomplish anything So watch
out for that trap but if you still want more
of it then more Theory will be coming in the
future You
