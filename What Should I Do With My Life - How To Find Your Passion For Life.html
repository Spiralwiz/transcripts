hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I am going to talk about what
I should do with my life and by I I
mean of course you what should you do with your
life now this is a very deep topic also a
very important topic as I'm sure you're aware of if
you're searching for this and you found this video so
here we're just gonna scratch the surface but it's still
gonna give you a lot of good ideas about what
to do with your life so chances are that right
now if you're stumbling around life and you're feeling a
little bit aimless maybe you're feeling like you don't have
motivation maybe you're feeling like there's something more out there
that you could be accomplishing in life but you're not
well I'm glad that you found this video because I
found it actualized org to really help people and to
help myself figure out what it is that I want
to do with my life and because this was a
challenge for me and I spent many years I spent
around five years going through and trying to figure out
what it was and in many ways I'm still having
my doubts and I'm still having issues and there are
many challenges along the way of this process and the
first thing I want to tell you that it is
a process so regardless of where you are right now
in your path whether you're just beginning and you feel
like you're lost and you feel like you're already behind
or maybe you all have already worked on your on
on your purpose in life and you feel like you
already know what you should be doing but you're still
struggling and you feel like maybe there's another purpose maybe
there's a way that you could grow it and expand
it out then this video is for you and actually
I that'll work is really for you because this is
something that I love to research so what should you
be doing with your life well generally speaking and here's
kind of the foundation of it all is you want
to have a purpose to your life and purpose is
not something that is god-given or is even man-made purpose
is very personal purpose is whatever you want it to
be so what is it that is valuable to you
what would it be something that would be worthwhile for
you to actually put your your sweat and your tears
and your blood into now this is an interesting question
because if you're feeling unmotivated then you're probably going think
about this and say well I just can't think of
anything there's nothing I feel like that's very important in
life things feel kind of meaningless you know what is
the meaning of it all there's no real meaning so
what am I supposed to be doing why would I
be doing choice a versus choice B if they all
paths lead to the same Road I mean to the
same if all roads lead to the same destination point
in the end you might have some of these kind
of doubts but basically what you need to do is
you need to think more you need to tap into
your imagination what I really challenge you to do is
spend some time doing a visualization exercise and just trying
to come up with a vision for yourself think about
think about it like this if right now you're sitting
on the couch and you're not really motivated to to
really work hard or to go out there and push
yourself break out of your comfort zone do something adventurous
do something crazy if you're not willing to do something
like that ask yourself what would it take to get
you off your ass what would it take to get
you totally committed to some endeavor in life what would
that have to be what would it take to get
you excited again the way that you've been in the
past because I know that there are times in the
past when you have that excited maybe they aren't consistent
maybe you haven't felt that in a long time but
there were times in your history in your life that
you were excited think about what it would take to
get you excited about something like that I actually think
that the reason that most people are not engaged and
are not on board with this kind of vision that
I'm talking about and have not gone through and done
this exercise is because of really one key point and
that is can you guess what it is it's fear
it's the fear of not knowing how it will come
up come about so here's the problem is that if
I tell you right now come up with some ambitious
vision come up with a dream literally a dream for
your life what would your dream life look like where
would you live who would be in your life who
would be your who would be part of your social
circle what kind of things would you be creating how
much money would you have what kind of health what
kind of body would you have what kind of things
would you own what kind of beliefs would you have
if I if I challenged you to come up with
this dream and I say just let it all loose
forget about all your fears forget about all the limitations
that you think are there and just write it down
lay it out I could probably get you to do
this exercise but as you're going to be doing it
if you're like me and I've done this exercise many
times and I've always come across this challenge which is
why I'm talking about it is because it's like a
brick wall there it's like this invisible limitation on that
exercise and what that is is your mind telling you
well this is all well and good but this is
just on paper this is just a dream I want
it in my real life and I just know that
this is not possible for me this thing that I
wrote down on paper sure it's a nice exercise but
that's all it is and I just I just don't
believe that this is possible for me there's no way
that I can have five million dollars in my bank
account there's no way that I could have that amazing
relationships or marriage that I want there's no way that
I could have this kind of business that I want
there's no way that I could be traveling the world
there's no way that I could be at the top
of my career there's just no way there's no way
that's possible given the things that I've experienced and one
of the things you might be saying is well Leo
you have experienced different things than I have and the
things that I've experienced are not allowing me to get
there it's just not possible for me maybe you're living
in some country where that's not possible maybe it's because
of the way you were raised and maybe it's because
of some psychological trauma that you've had in the past
that this is not possible for you maybe you have
some sort of limitations about what you think you're capable
of doing maybe you think that you're not smart enough
maybe you think that you were not rich enough maybe
you think that you're not well-connected enough you don't know
the right people maybe you just feel so bogged down
by all the obligations you already have that you're just
saying to yourself well how am I ever gonna get
this accomplished when I've got all these other things that
I'm doing and that is the barrier and it's really
hard to argue with all these all these reasons right
because some of these reasons seem very legitimate they see
very valid it might be the case that you're living
in a country where you don't have a lot of
opportunity right now it might be the case that you're
overwhelmed with bills and credit card debt and it's hard
for you just to pay your rent let alone worry
about how to advance yourself in other areas right or
maybe you're you're so sick and you've got problems with
your health that's preventing you from going out there and
working hard and accomplishing your dreams and you're just thinking
well if I've got one of these challenges then this
thing that I'm writing out on paper is just not
going to happen and here's the thing is that you
have to think bigger than that you have to have
some sort of faith some sort of trust that it's
possible because what you're doing when you're doing this is
you're you're limiting yourself you're - you're too immersed in
the past that you've gone through and the current present
situation that you're in to see the potential and that
it's just a fact that potential is there for you
just like it was a fact that where you are
today is not somewhere someplace that you could have envisioned
maybe five years ago maybe ten years ago maybe if
you're ambitious maybe even a year ago you couldn't have
envisioned being in the kind of sweet position that you're
in right now but of course you're looking ahead and
you're looking for something a little bit better right and
so that just tends to be how the mind works
is that our psychology doesn't easily allow us to really
buy in to those dreams and that's why a lot
of people get stuck and that's what a lot of
people are unmotivated and don't really have a life purpose
is because first of all they don't even bother to
look into this matter in the first place so it
just passes by them but even if they do look
into it and they do this initial exercise what happens
that they limit themselves they hold themselves back on this
exercise and so they have a dream but they don't
even vocalize it they don't even verbalize they don't even
articulate it because you just feel like it just feels
to you I can vividly remember this when I was
doing this exercise it just feels like there's no way
in hell that this can happen so why am I
even doing it I shouldn't even speak it it's like
you have that dream you have a dream which you're
willing to share with people this is kind of like
your lay up dream and then you have that one
really really big dream really big vision for yourself that
is so big that it's so scary it's so mind-boggling
that you're not even willing to admit it to yourself
you're not even willing to write it down on paper
it's that outrageous it's that far out there it seems
like it's impossible so you don't even want to think
about it it's kind of scary how their mind works
that way and what you got to do if you're
feeling unmotivated if you're feeling like you don't know what
the purpose of life is and what you should be
doing with your life is I really challenge you to
sit down and have faith and just bust through that
you got to bust through it bust through that limitation
bust through that invisible glass wall that's there bust through
it and just have some trust that you try this
exercise you'll get some value out of it you're gonna
see something and it's not gonna happen all in one
sitting and it's not gonna happen or one day in
one week what you got to do is you gotta
start somewhere though and if you're not feeling motivated and
if you feel like you don't have a life purpose
this is the best place to start so sit down
turn everything off disconnect yourself from everything phones computers televisions
internet everything and then ask yourself this question what is
the most compelling vision for my future self that I
could see and if it helps you then put it
far into the future say maybe this is something you're
gonna be five years from now ten years from now
just so your mind can kind of understand that okay
there's some room to figure this out I don't need
to know it all today this is not something that's
gonna get accomplished in a month it's not something that's
even gonna get accomplished in the year this is a
really big long-term vision and ask yourself what is going
to be so compelling what is something so important that
you could be doing something you could be creating some
sort of impact you could be having on the world
that would get you moving that would get you motivated
it's really as simple as that and then start writing
down and you should write a lot write as much
as you can so if it's material things that you
want to start there if it's things that you want
to feel in your body go with that if it's
people that you want to be hanging out with and
interacting with maybe celebrities or people in your industry that
you look up to put put that you know just
craft a vision of your life and since we're talking
about life purpose here of course you can work on
those personal goals like getting into shape and maybe the
kind of relationship you want to have but I really
challenge you to take a look at the kind of
impact that you want to have in your life right
what is it that you want to be creating and
doing what is the contribution that you want to be
having that is what's going to ultimately get to that
the crux of that problem of you know what should
I be doing with my life it's going to be
that because there's enough room in your life to have
your life purpose in your career in place and we're
really talking about career here and then also all the
little things - like your health and your hobbies that
you like and the friends like to hang out with
in the relationships but what I want to have you
focus on is that that that one purpose that everything
is going towards and that is the contribution that you're
having what you're creating right what kind of thing could
you add to the world that would make it better
in your eyes not in somebody else's eyes I don't
mean like going out and doing some charity work I
don't mean something cliche like that I mean what could
you produce seeing yourself as a creator seeing yourself as
an artist what could you create that would actually improve
the world for the better and you think that this
would be an awesome thing to create so this might
be you know you it would be cool to create
a movie to direct a certain type of movie that
you want to create or maybe you want to write
a novel or maybe you want to go out there
and you want to build a business that is a
and a green eco-friendly business or maybe you really notice
that there's some problem that people are having for example
with their education you want to go and you want
to educate people in a better way maybe there's some
system or some some industry that you're involved in right
now where you just see things are not performing optimally
and you could just go in there and optimize that
and work that out and if you did then that
would have a profound effect on the industry but whatever
it is make sure it's big because here's the thing
we're always holding ourselves back and telling us ourselves that
we can't think that big and we always say well
that's not realistic sure I could cope with something big
and it would be inspiring but it would never be
practical so I would just give up and I'd be
disappointed I would fail so what's the point of doing
that well you're selling yourself too short is the bottom
line and you don't even realize it and this is
hard it's very mentally tricky it's a big tricky mental
game that you're playing with yourself because you literally cannot
see your own potential and you cannot see five or
ten years out into the future and what you got
to do is you got to just have faith that
if you create a big vision that stuff will start
clicking and that when you get motivated that motivation that's
gonna happen that's the important thing start there start figuring
out what the vision is that's gonna motivate you and
then let the other stuff fall into place let the
process let's look how to of it kind of solve
itself that will solve itself in the work that you
do so I'm not saying that you're just gonna go
out there and dream this thing and then not do
any working better you're gonna go take massive action but
to do that you need to have the motivation and
the problem right now with you is that you don't
have enough motivation to go out there and do it
that's because you don't have anything big in your in
your life once you have something big then that's something
that you can work with that's something you can mold
you can shape even if you can't accomplish all of
it you've made maybe you can accomplish a part of
it or maybe it'll give you some idea as to
how to spin that off into something else that's more
practical that you can accomplish so trust that they're gonna
be avenues that are gonna open for you but you
have to have you have to take the blocks out
you have to get the energy flowing you gotta get
something moving you gotta get some sort of action happening
so as I wrap up here don't let this exercise
sit in your mind go right now unplug yourself do
this exercise come up with some sort of big dream
big vision for yourself and that is how you're gonna
find out what you should be doing with your life
