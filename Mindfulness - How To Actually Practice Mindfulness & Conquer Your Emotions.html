hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about mindfulness all right welcome
back let us crack into the topic of mindfulness this
is a really important topic and I think that you
should start to really think about this and develop mindfulness
because it can have some powerful effects on your life
so let's crack into what happ - is and I'm
going to give you some practical ways to start developing
mindfulness without just theorizing about I'm going to tell you
actually how you can start developing it so this is
going to be really cool really fast really practical before
we get into that though let's talk about why mindfulness
is important why you want to care about mindfulness is
basically because it's going to make you happy it's going
to make you calm and peaceful and it's going to
get you high performance in your career or whatever else
that you're out there doing in your life that is
why I love mindfulness and it can lead to some
really profound realizations down the road if you keep really
practicing it and doing it but really it's about start
stopping suffering it's about how do you stop suffering I
think all of us have this question all of us
are looking for something more in our lives where we're
you know we're doing we're doing this we're doing that
we're doing relationships we're doing our work and then we're
wondering well there's like what how can i how can
I get rid of some of this pain that I'm
having and really what you're having there is you're having
suffering you're suffering in some way in different parts of
your life and you're always looking for ways to eliminate
that suffering and so mindfulness is very powerful for that
let's talk about what mindfulness is now mindfulness quite simply
is being in the moment and having an observation of
yourself so in your mind it's as though you step
out of yourself step out of your body step out
of your mind and you're just observing yourself without any
sort of judgment without any sort of criticism without any
sort of additional thought all you're doing is observing yourself
so it's like an extra layer that you're adding like
an extra cognitive layer that you're adding into your everyday
activities where you're just observing yourself and you're look at
yourself as though you were observing a chimp in a
zoo so you know how like a social scientist or
an anthropologist or whoever studies chimps will go into a
zoo and sit there and just sit near the chimp
cage and just kind of watch the chimps do their
thing and if that scientist is trying to be objective
that scientist is trying to just sit there and not
add any of his own ideas to what the chimps
are doing he's just sitting there just like recording notes
just on what the chimps are doing okay that chimp
just ran across ran across from one side of the
cage to the next okay you just like writes that
down then he sees another chimp go and hit this
chimp in the head with his fist okay so he
just like writes that down he doesn't judge it he
just writes it down and he's just observing it so
it's basically like he's sitting there with a camera just
like recording what the chimps are doing that's what mindfulness
is and because we are self conscious human beings we
have the ability to look at ourselves and to introspect
that is how you can be more mindful is that
you can start to observe yourself notice what is happening
throughout your day and you might say well I already
know what's what's going on I mean I'm conscious like
I know I know what I did yesterday I know
what I'm doing today I know what I just did
before I sat down to to do this video so
you might be saying aren't I doing that already and
the answer is no you're not doing it already this
is something when you actually start doing it you'll start
to realize how much you were missing out on one
thing that is kind of a shocking revelation if you
haven't really studied this stuff you haven't really done any
consciousness work through meditation or contemplation then you're actually going
to be shocked by how little consciousness you exhibit throughout
your day you're going to be shocked at how how
much of a stimulus response animal you are and all
you're doing is you're behaving like a chimp you're walking
through life and you're doing your chimp things and you're
behaving like a chimp not even knowing that somebody is
watching you you're just doing right you're just doing stuff
you're not aware of what you're doing you're not really
really conscious this is such a deep point I probably
have to shoot a whole new video just on that
one point because uh Peter who's been ski in his
book towards a psychology of don't know what is the
book the oh the psychology of man's possible evolution that's
right so there he really talks about the fact that
we are not conscious of what we do in our
day most of us are not and the way that
you start to develop consciousness by starting to be more
mindful starting to just notice what you're doing okay what
does this mean because I kind of beat this horse
to death what does it mean to be noticing what
you're doing first of all let's start off by having
you be aware of the mundane little tasks that you're
doing throughout your day the next time you sit down
to have some lunch or some dinner basically any kind
of food I just want you to be aware that
you're sitting down to have some food do it try
it try that as a little test are you going
to be able to do it it's going to be
harder than you think it is just sit down and
remember and try to be conscious of the fact that
your own okay I'm I'm sitting down to eat some
food don't think about it too much it's just kind
of like an observation also the next time that you
walk out of your front door of your house or
your apartment where you walk back in I want you
to be aware of the fact that you are doing
that just be aware that's it this is what it
takes to start building a mindfulness we're going to notice
if you start doing this is that it's actually really
difficult and that you're forgetting all the time and that
you're actually not aware of what it is the hell
that you're doing a little exercise for you right now
you can pause the video and do this what I
want you to do is to actually stop pause the
video and then think of yourself think of your name
say your name so I'll pretend like I'm doing it
right now I would turn it off and I would
I would get my my stopwatch or some sort of
clock and I would try to look at that clock
and while I'm doing that I'm thinking of myself they
give myself Leo I'm thinking of Leo Leo leo I
am leo try to just think about that don't say
anything try to just think about that or 60 seconds
just 60 seconds and notice what happens we're you going
to notice is that you can't even do it for
60 seconds some thought is going to come up and
it's going to distract you and your conscience is going
to wander you're also going to notice that at that
point when you're actually thinking about yourself you're observing yourself
and your conscious you're really self-conscious and notice how different
that is from the moment that you were before you
did the exercise and the whole day that went on
today or the whole day that went on yesterday notice
how you just kind of ran through your whole day
until up to this point where I actually forced you
to focus your consciousness by doing this exercise so that
will start to get you to realize that you are
not as conscious as you think that really you are
asleep you are not conscious at all so what you
got to start to do is then start to bring
awareness to things throughout your day the other thing that
I want you to really start to bring awareness to
is I want to start to bring awareness to the
most difficult thing to bring awareness to and you know
what that is negative emotions the next time this is
the best way to build mindfulness the next time that
you have an emotional episode where you get angry at
someone you get frustrated you want to yell at them
you get sad you get depressed you start to worry
you get anxious you start to get pessimistic or down
on yourself you start to feel very lonely and sad
you start to feel overwhelmed very stressed anything negative anything
emotional especially where you tend to then do stupid things
as a result that is where you're the least conscious
which you've got to do as an exercise is next
time that that's happening to you notice it remember to
notice it and notice that it be aware and here's
how it's going to look let's say some guy just
cut me off I'm on my way to work I've
got an important project and this guy just cut me
off and almost bumped into me on the road and
now I'm furious I'm like irritated I'm not yelling at
him but I'm just kind of like on it like
it ruins my mood and I'm thinking like goddammit that
[ __ ] guy right you're just like you're thinking
that normally you would think all that and then you
would go into a tailspin and just thought like a
cyclone of thought this and that and it just goes
all over the place instead what you do if you're
trying to be mindful is you say okay you run
that additional layer of like mental processing and you say
okay let let this thought process run itself out this
anger let it run itself out but you're watching it
you're an observer you're like a third party observer you're
that scientist watching the chip so pretend that you're the
chimp and you're just watching yourself and just watch yourself
be angry about that guy watch your thoughts so I
might have thoughts like goddammit how could that guy do
that I'm always so I'm always so polite on the
road I observe proper etiquette I always turn my signals
on this kind just cut me off like that that
was so dangerous of them you know what if I
had my kids in the car and we actually had
a crash and the car flipped over like it's raining
now so it's even double dangerous and then I wouldn't
have been able to make this meeting so this whole
thought process is going through watch it don't stop it
let it run through don't judge it don't tell yourself
this is bad don't tell yourself that it's bad to
be angry just let it run through but watch it
wow that is so powerful if you can do that
and you can start doing this consistently this is the
key to developing emotional mastery it's the key to developing
real real self consciousness self-awareness and control over your life
the more you start to do this the more control
you're going to develop the more self-aware you're going to
become and the less things will start to bother you
your suffering will diminish what's going to happen is that
when you take that third-person perspective and you're mindful of
everything that's going on your life then you're no longer
identifying with the pain and suffering of everything you're no
longer reacting you're not a stimulus response animal you can
actually have something come into your life that is quote-unquote
painful or bad but because you can detach yourself from
it it's not really going to affect you and then
just I hopefully hopefully you can imagine the level of
performance that can get you in life it takes a
little bit of vision to see this but imagine the
performance you could have in your life if something bad
happened to you and you did not have to react
to it or suffer from it can you imagine what
that can do for you I mean can you imagine
if you're running your business and you lose your biggest
clients but instead of getting butthurt about it and yelling
at your employees and causing this big ruckus and maybe
getting depressed about the whole outlook of your business instead
of that you were completely column and you were just
able to take the proper action to go on with
your business can you imagine the level of difference that
could have and then those things stack up that's one
event because after that crazy business problem what do you
do you go home and then you've got a problem
at home with your relationship and then what do you
do after that you might go and you might go
drinking to the bar and you've got a problem there
and then on the weekend you've got some other problem
and so the stuff it like stacks up your life
is full of problems think about what you could do
if those problems were dissolved and you can dissolve them
with enough mindfulness I want you to start applying the
stuff start really applying yourself this is so powerful and
it's going to be tricky at first because you're going
to be going to forget you're going to forget to
be mindful of the fact they're eating a meal you're
going to forget to be mindful the fact that you're
walking out the door and you're certainly going to forget
to be mindful of the fact that you're pissed off
at somebody or that you're sad or that you're depressed
or that you're you're afraid you're gonna just forget these
things and so you're going to identify with it and
that's when your life goes downhill because you suffer and
your actions then reflect your suffering and actions reflecting suffering
lead to very very very poor results not to mention
that you're just not you're not calm you're not happy
because you're suffering all the time why do you want
that okay so that is it the last point I'm
going to make is if you really want to develop
more and more mindfulness the most practical thing you can
do besides the little exercises that I gave you here
is to start meditation I ate for 20 minutes every
day I recommend you commit for the rest of your
life to doing that find the time fix your schedule
so you can do that I've got other videos that
talk about meditation give you specific techniques and tips for
how to get an a meditation practice in place all
