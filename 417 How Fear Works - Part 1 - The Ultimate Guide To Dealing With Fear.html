            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/meiMUbYEQ4U' target='_blank'>How Fear Works - Part 1 - The Ultimate Guide To Dealing With Fear</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Fear as a universal problem of consciousness</b>: Fear is not just a psychological problem but a deep existential issue with vast implications. It is not just a human problem, but a significant issue in understanding consciousness that is not properly recognized by psychologists, scientists, and philosophers.
</li><li><b>Lack of understanding and teaching about fear</b>: Our society largely overlooks the importance of understanding fear. It fails to teach about fear or how to deal with it in schools and universities partly because of the difficulty in quantifying and measuring it, indicative of our society's materialistic nature.
</li><li><b>Fear dominating our lives</b>: Fear is not just an occasional nuisance; it constantly controls our lives. We often live in a state of fear, unaware of its pervasive influence on our actions, thoughts, and decisions. Fear is more than just an emotional issue; it plays a crucial role in our survival.
</li><li><b>Fear as a control mechanism</b>: Fear acts as a self-control mechanism that helps maintain our identity and survival. It is deeply tied to our survival, from helping to avoid immediate physical threats to preserving our cultural and social identities.
</li><li><b>Fear and survival beyond the physical realm</b>: Human survival is not just about physical survival; it largely revolves around social and cultural survival. We experience fear when our identities are threatened - identities formed by our beliefs, social roles, cultural norms, and values.
</li><li><b>Limitations of scientific understanding of fear</b>: Current understanding of fear remains limited due to the inherent challenges that fear - a subjective, personal, and experiential phenomenon - presents to our largely materialistic, quantifiable scientific practices.
</li><li><b>The key to understanding fear</b>: To truly understand fear, it's essential to be conscious of it and recognize it in our personal experiences. Moving past understanding fear as an abstract notion to truly experiencing and acknowledging it on a personal level is key.
</li><li><b>Fear in Personal and Social Dimensions</b>: Fear impacts not only personal but also larger social contexts, such as government, business, and finances. It not only keeps individuals alive but also maintains their unique identities. Personal identity widely varies from person to person, influenced by factors such as culture, religion, and profession. People with different identities have different fears and survival mechanisms related to those identities.
</li><li><b>Fear in Maintaining Identity</b>: An individual's fear is aimed at protecting their identity. For instance, a person identifying as a Christian will fear things that could threaten their Christian identity, similarly for a scientist, an atheist, or any other identity. This fear can end up distorting their perception of reality and preventing them from acknowledging truth, showing how deeply fear is tied to identity. 
</li><li><b>Fear as a Definer of Identity</b>: The concept of identity is significantly influenced by one's fears. A person's fears define what they identify as, and conversely, what one identifies as determines what they fear. For example, someone identifying as a parent may fear threats to their children, triggering their protective instincts; someone identifying as successful may fear failure or loss of status.
</li><li><b>Legitimacy of Fears</b>: All fears, relating to any identity, are legitimate and deeply rooted. The fears a person has typically revolve around their self-image and identity, and dealing with those fears will be a constant struggle in their life. This struggle goes to a very deep existential level, making fear a problem of survival and life and death.
</li><li><b>Interweaving of Fear and Identity</b>: Fear cannot be removed via straightforward techniques, as it intricately intertwined with one's identity. Therefore, without a change at the identity level, fear cannot be permanently resolved. A skeptic's scepticism, for example, is motivated by their fear of being wrong, showing that even rational and scientific identities are not immune to fear. 
</li><li><b>Self-fulfilling Nature of Fear</b>: Fear often produces the very outcome one is fearing. For example, a skeptic's fear of being deluded can make them dogmatic and close-minded. Similarly, the fear of fluid gender identities threatens those who strongly identify as either male or female, showing that fear can lead to self-deception and a distorted perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Existential conflicts with identity and fear in society</b>: Leo Gura explores the existential fear and controversy around identity, using the example of societal resistance to transgender and LGBTQ+ identities. Traditional individuals often deny fluidity within their firmly held identity categories and view any threat to them with fear. To defend their threatened identities, they may attack or deny the perceived threat, causing problems for themselves and others. This same fear also plays out in other standard identities like being human or being a physical being.
</li><li><b>Identity formation and attachment</b>: Leo explains how personal identities are formed over time, starting from birth, through various experiences and interactions. This identity formation ties directly to one's sense of self and fear of losing it. These fears range from the fear of physical harm to the fear of losing aspects of personal identity. Fear functions as a survival mechanism to protect one's sense of self.
</li><li><b>Death and loss of self</b>: The epitome of all fear, according to Leo, is the fear of death, which ultimately is a fear of a total loss of self. This is depicted not only in the fear of physical death but more so in the fear of psychological death - the death of self-image. He provides an example where certain individuals, even in extremist scenarios, may choose physical death over losing their identity.
</li><li><b>Understanding of attachment to individual identities</b>: Leo uses an analogy of the Sun to explain the varying levels of attachment to different identities. Less integral parts of our identities (like attachment to a car or business) can be compared to the outer layers of the Sun, while the denser and closer-to-self identities (like gender and humanity) are represented by the dense core. Different attachments come with different sets of fears and the ability (or inability) to detach from them significantly contribute to our fears.
</li><li><b>The role of fear in defending identity</b>: Fear plays a crucial part in protecting identities and maintaining attachments. By failing to question or challenge their identities, individuals end up being strongly attached to them, resulting in fear when these identities are threatened or challenged. Such attachments and fears can stem from aspects as fundamental as being human or as specific as religious or career identities.
</li><li><b>Fear Across Different Identities and Life Conditions</b>: Leo Gura stresses that elements of fear are relative, based on the lens of our identity and personal narratives. He discusses how factors including parenthood, financial status, religious beliefs and even scientific convictions can project elements of fear that aren't inherently present in the situations or objects we encounter.
</li><li><b>Fear is Never Inherent</b>: Leo emphasizes that fear is never an objective fact. It's never found in the world as an inherent attribute. Instead, it is constructed by our minds and projected outwards through the lens of our own identities.
</li><li><b>Fear Is Imaginary and Lacks Substance</b>: Fear is a projection of the mind and does not exist independently. It does not originate from external circumstances, but from our interpretation and perception of these circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Fear is Falsehood</b>: Fear is an illusion created by our minds. It is important to realize that there is no objective danger, only subjective danger relative to our identity. In order to overcome fear, one needs to question its reality and not accept it as unquestionable fact.
</li><li><b>Society Exploits Fear</b>: Society uses fear as a controlling mechanism by exploiting our fear of survival. These fears are capitalized on through advertising, political campaigning, and social norms. However, the pursuit of truth can help us transcend fear.
</li><li><b>Understanding Fear Through Mindfulness</b>: An introspective exercise is proposedÂ—observing and analyzing one's own daily micro fears, and contemplating one's greatest fears and what one is most resistant to experiencing. This process aids in understanding the roots of one's fears and how they connect to one's sense of self. 
</li><li><b>Fear Varies From Person to Person</b>: Different individuals perceive fears differently. What one may view as terrifying, another may perceive as harmless. This further underscores that fear is constructed by the mind, not anything inherent in the object or situation causing fear. 
</li><li><b>Fear and Society</b>: Society, while largely built on survival and infused with fear, rarely addresses the understanding and transcendence of fear on an existential level. Fear is employed as a powerful tool to induce control, demonstrated in politics, marketing, and societal norms. 
</li><li><b>Elements of Fear</b>: Fear, while seeming real and applicable to danger, is in fact an illusion. Fear is not inherent in our world, in any object or situation, but lies solely in the interpretation and reactions of the perceiver.
</li><li><b>Materialistic Paradigm and Fear</b>: Society teaches a materialistic perspective where we are biological beings in an independent and objective physical world. Under this view, human fears and dangers appear legitimate and rational. For example, the fear of death, running out of money, or dangers like wild animals. However, danger and fear are relative based on personal and cultural identities.
</li><li><b>Fear and Identity</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that danger is dependent on personal identities and cultural orientation. For instance, a radical Muslim might fear the eradication of Islam more than death, while a scientist might fear the propagation of religious teachings in science. In this way, our fears reflect our identities.
</li><li><b>The Construction of Fear</b>: Fear is based on a misperception of reality. It arises from a series of misinterpretations that our mind constructs concerning ourselves and our surroundings. The denial of the subjective nature of our experiences makes fear seems real, objective, and tangible.
</li><li><b>Requires Personal Mindfulness Work to Understand Fear</b>: The fear we experience cannot be understood in simple abstract terms. It demands direct engagement with personal fears through the practice of mindfulness to feel how fear manifests in our body. Such a practice would help decipher the source of fear and the reasons for its existence. However, developing the ability to feel and understand fear takes consistent mindfulness practice over time.
</li><li><b>Fear's Function as a Survival Mechanism</b>: Fear is an unconscious and rapid reaction designed for survival. It helps us respond to immediate dangers quickly without taking time to analyze the situation explicitly. This makes understanding and examining fear difficult as it primarily arises in dangerous or challenging situations. 
</li><li><b>Creating Mindful Response to Fear</b>: In order to understand and overcome fear, it is crucial to create a gap between the fear and our reactions. Instead of immediate responses, practicing mindful observations to experience fear consciously becomes essential. Pausing in moments of fear, feeling its presence, and questioning its origins and purpose could help in understanding fear and managing it.
</li><li><b>Understanding Fear in Dangerous Situations</b>: This section delves into how people can deal with fear when faced with urgent, life-altering situations like the threat of eviction. Leo asks listeners to challenge their immediate reaction to fear and create a gap for mindfulness and conscious decision-making instead. He suggests this approach isn't just for the significant dangers but can be trained through daily, more minor fears.
</li><li><b>Concept of Resistance in Fear</b>: According to Leo, the essence of fear lies in our resistance to future experiences. Fear surfaces when we try to prevent an anticipated future reality that is not in line with our identity and wishes. For instance, a devoted Christian might fear the hypothetical prospect of being forced into converting to Islam due to a conflict with their existing religious identity.
</li><li><b>Solution to Overcoming Fear - Surrendering to Experiences</b>: To overcome fear, Leo suggests we embrace the very experiences we are resisting. For example, if the fear is due to the possibility of eviction and subsequent homelessness, the counterintuitive solution would be to mentally accept this possibility rather than running away from it.
</li><li><b>Why Fear Management Isn't Taught in School</b>: Leo discusses why society, including educational institutions, do not teach effective fear management. He expresses that mastering fear management from a young age could make individuals invincible, making them difficult to control. Hence, society, driven by motives of control and power, does not encourage the conscious understanding and management of fear.
</li><li><b>Invincibility Through Acceptance of Fear</b>: The section concludes with the key takeaway that the ultimate solution to fear is accepting and mentally preparing to undergo the experiences that we fear the most. By successfully doing so, an individual can become invincible. However, this requires significant practice and mind training against our biologically programmed fear responses.
</li><li><b>Fear Arising from Attachment to Material Possessions</b>: Leo Gura asserts that fear often arises due to having built our lives and happiness on conditional material possessions, which are externally reliant and therefore unstable. Such fears would be intensified especially when one loses these material possessions as their level of spiritual development or consciousness is often underdeveloped.
</li><li><b>Practising Consciousness and Spiritual Development</b>: Gura explains that by focusing on developing your consciousness, which is the only aspect of life that can never be taken away from you, you can lead a life of true happiness thatÂ’s independent from conditional, material possessions. However, this requires time and work to develop mindfulness skills, shed materialistic drives and cravings, and gain spiritual awakening experiences.
</li><li><b>Concept of Surrendering to Fears</b>: Gura discusses the concept of surrendering to fears, regardless of their nature, as a means of overcoming them. By accepting and acknowledging these fears, we can prevent them from controlling us. He gives an example of a person fearing their homosexual urges due to societal judgement and expectations, and explains that acknowledging and surrendering to such fears provides immediate relief, although repetitive practice and potential identity changes may be required for long-term solutions. 
</li><li><b>Surrendering Does Not Mean Acting Upon Fears</b>: Gura emphasizes that surrendering to fears doesn't mean acting upon them. This process involves recognising the fear, letting go of the resistance to it and accepting it without judgement. 
</li><li><b>True Strength in Acceptance and Surrender</b>: Gura highlights that true strength lies in the ability to experience anything, even fear, without resistance. It entails a deep development of consciousness and spirituality over potential physical limitations or societal expectations. He advises that one way to achieve this is by rejecting materialistic identifiers and aligning oneself with truth.
</li><li><b>Exercise to Address Fears</b>: Gura recommends an exercise to overcome your deepest fears. He advises to prepare a concise list of your biggest personal fears and contemplate them, as a way to begin addressing and overcoming these fears.
</li><li><b>The trick with fear and stereotypical fears</b>: Leo Gura lists out common examples of fears such as fear of spiders, snakes, bears, sharks, public speaking, or being poisoned. However, he acknowledges that these are stereotypical and superficial, and they don't have a significant impact on your daily life.
</li><li><b>Examples of fears that influence daily life activities</b>: Fears that have a more profound effect on one's life are like fear of not being good enough, fear of failure in careers, fear of finances going downhill or business collapsing, fear of relationship ending or being alone, fear of aging, and fear of health problems. 
</li><li><b>Fear attached to identity</b>: Fear of disappointing loved ones, fear of losing identity, and fear of making the wrong decisions, are other common fears. He explains these fears are deeply connected to one's identity and are significantly impactful on one's life. 
</li><li><b>Micro fears</b>: Leo Gura introduces the concept of micro fears like running out of toilet paper, saying the wrong thing, pleasing a client, checking our phone, grocery stores running out of our desired items, etc. These are daily fears that we experience multiple times, which are not severe but have a significant impact on our lives due to their frequency. 
</li><li><b>Fear influences thoughts and actions</b>: Fear not only affects our actions but also shapes our thoughts and can lead to physical tension and health issues. Some physical symptoms of fear can be sweaty palms, heart attacks, sexual problems, mental illnesses, obesity, and various pain disorders. 
</li><li><b>Avoidance of fear</b>: Many people react to fear by avoiding or denying it, which only leads to victim mentality and decreased self-esteem. Only confronting fear introduces true growth. 
</li><li><b>Fear as a natural response</b>: Fear is a natural response to immediate physical danger, but in today's complex society, fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, fearing your partner cheating may lead to distrust, causing them to lose attraction to you. 
</li><li><b>Understanding fear for personal growth</b>: Leo ends the section by giving a homework assignment to observe your micro fears for seven days, analyze their connection to identity, and contemplate your biggest fears and what you are unwilling to experience.
</li><li><b>Fear and Its Manifestation</b>: Throughout our daily lives, Leo Gura mentions we experience dozens of 'micro fears', small anxieties or worries that may seem insignificant but actually have a significant impact on our behavior, thoughts, and habits. Examples include fear of running out of toilet paper, fear of being caught lying, fear of offending someone, fear of being late for work, fear of saying the wrong thing, fear of not pleasing a client, and fear of checking your phone among others. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Micro Fears</b>: Despite appearing trivial, these micro fears dictate our lives on a minute-to-minute basis. Gura points out that these fears are so numerous and subtle that it is hard to stop them. However, once we start noticing them, we recognize how they dominate our day-to-day life.
</li><li><b>Fear and Physical Health</b>: Gura explains that fear can have physical manifestations: our bodies store decades worth of fear which can lead to psychological and physiological problems such as panic attacks, anxiety, heart disorders, sexual problems, addictions, mental illnesses, obesity, insomnia, certain types of cancer, and more. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of Recognizing and Addressing Fear</b>: Gura suggests that recognizing these fears and observing how they shape our behaviors and thoughts is the first step in addressing them. By doing so, we can begin to understand how fear affects our thinking and behavior. He emphasizes that fear is more than a mental concept; it is physical tension stored in our bodies that affects our overall health.
</li><li><b>Fear influencing societal decisions</b>: Fear affects not just individuals, but collective groups such as societies, corporations, and governments. Decisions made out of fear can often lead to detrimental outcomes such as racism, closed-mindedness, bad science, and irrational laws.
</li><li><b>Fear and love as inverse concepts</b>: Leo posits life as a love simulator or a means for learning not to fear. Fears are presented for us to learn how to love and eventually transcend them, contributing to personal growth.
</li><li><b>Avoiding fear</b>: People often deal with fear by avoiding or denying it. These reactions might seem like solutions, but they only escape the current fear and fail to equip the person to deal with similar situations in the future, leading to stagnation and victim mentality.
</li><li><b>Confronting fear</b>: Confronting fears leads to personal growth and brings immediate relief, even if physical problems haven't been solved. The realization of the constructed illusion of fear is what truly helps in overcoming it.
</li><li><b>Pathological behavior as result of fear</b>: The avoidance of fear can lead to pathological behaviors such as addictions, lies, criminal schemes, abusive behavior, and harmful ideologies.
</li><li><b>Manipulation skills and fear</b>: Manipulating certain outcomes to avoid fears undeniably helps short-term, but it is not a root solution to the fear. Even the best manipulators cannot escape from inevitable things such as experiencing true love, accepting the truth, and confronting death.
</li><li><b>Counterproductive nature of fear</b>: Fear-based reactions can have a detrimental and counterintuitive effect. Fear as a long-term survival strategy creates a negative cycle and prevents resolution of problems. This cycle impedes personal growth and maintains status quo, which hinders significant life changes.
</li><li><b>Human Evolution and Fear</b>: Leo Gura explains that while fear was an effective survival response for our ancestors facing immediate, physical threats like bears, human evolution has led to much more complicated societal systems where fear often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</li><li><b>Fear as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</b>: When individuals continuously fear certain outcomes, they tend to attract the consequences they are afraid of. For example, fear of a partner cheating can lead to behaviors that ultimately result in lost attraction, and fear of business failure can lead to anxiety and lack of focus, both causing the feared outcome to manifest. 
</li><li><b>Bias and Fear</b>: Fear can foster biases, such as fear of foreigners or different races. These biases can be self-perpetuating, as individuals tend to look for news that confirms their biases, leading to misperceptions and potential conflicts. 
</li><li><b>Negative Effects of Fear</b>: Fear creates a cyclical pattern where individuals temporarily resolve the fear, and then fall back into it. Fear is a deterrent to creativity, happiness and thriving in life as it maintains the status quo and prevents growth and significant changes. 
</li><li><b>Fear and Change</b>: Challenging the status quoÂ—like Martin Luther King advocating for racial equalityÂ—requires vision, love, and higher principles, rather than fear. 
</li><li><b>Homework Assignment for Viewers</b>: Leo Gura assigns viewers to observe and list out their 'micro fears' every day over seven days and at the end of each day, contemplate on how these fears relate to their identities, how they are projecting these fears, and what they are unwilling to experience. This exercise is intended to help viewers take radical responsibility for their emotions and fears. 
</li><li><b>Expectations for Next Video</b>: The next part of the video series is set to address frequently asked questions, provide tools for overcoming fear, and explain the most important quality needed for success in life.
