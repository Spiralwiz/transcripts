[Music] how to detox or chelate heavy metals i've been
foreshadowing this episode for a long time and finally here
we are this is going to be a very practical
episode really i should have put this episode behind a
paywall because of how much research has gone into the
content here and how life transforming it can be for
you but precisely because i have a soft spot for
helping people i decided to put out put it out
there for free this is five years of my research
and trial and error figuring this stuff out figuring out
my own health problems and how it's related to heavy
metal toxicity and other factors and just trying a lot
of different stuff and then figuring out and perfecting these
some of these techniques now of course it wasn't just
me i was also using other experts and i've done
a lot of research by studying the work of other
people who i'll be crediting later on in this episode
but anyways let's get started so i've personally done over
30 rounds of heavy metal chelation using supplements like dmsa
and alpha lipoic acid otherwise known as ala i'll be
referring to it and there are other supplements that i'll
be talking about here so i'm going to be giving
you an entire protocol a step-by-step protocol that i've perfected
for how to do this chelation and how to do
it safely uh but before we get into that and
i'll also be showing you the supplements that i use
i'll be telling you which brands i use and i'll
be even doing some demos about how i organize all
my pills and the schedule that i take them on
so this is very technical stuff here um so if
you're looking for how to do heavy metal chelation you've
come to the perfect spot this will explain everything for
you all right so but before we get into that
uh why detox heavy metals at all what's the point
uh well the reason i got into it is because
i've been dealing with various kinds of health problems for
the last i would say 15 years of my life
uh they really began even before i started actualize.org um
sometimes people think that oh well leo started doing psychedelics
and that's why he's having these health problems like no
i've had thyroid problems and autoimmune problems long predating any
use of psychedelics so it's not about psychedelics um basically
i have a hypothyroid condition hashimoto's it's called um and
a slew of other related autoimmune conditions that have left
me with fatigue problems i had serious sleeping problems where
i was tired all the time i would sleep for
eight or ten hours and i was still tired at
the end of that i started experiencing cognitive performance problems
which was the biggest and scariest problem that i experienced
because my work you know my life's work is is
wrapped up with actualize that org and doing spirituality and
talking about self-development right and contemplating a lot the work
that i do here involves a lot of contemplation you
know philosophy and all this sorts of stuff and um
what i noticed is that my cognitive performance gradually decreased
and decreased more and more and more after i came
out of high school and university um and it was
it wasn't too bad when i started actualize at work
but maybe four or five years into doing actualize at
org my performance my cognitive performance decreased to such a
bad level that i was not even able to sit
and contemplate for two hours straight on some topic it
got to the point where i was worried that i
wouldn't even be able to continue doing my work so
i was basically forced with with that situation to look
for various kinds of solutions and i've troubleshooted many different
solutions and so this heavy metal detox was just one
of the things that i stumbled upon i did other
things as well that i'll talk about maybe at some
other point but this is one factor now as a
caveat i'm not telling you that heavy metal chelation will
solve all your problems i'm just saying it's one potential
factor and for me really i mean to be honest
it saved my life i had saved my career because
after i did x number of rounds of this chelation
a couple of things happened for me um my sleep
problem disappeared so i i had real difficulty waking up
early like for example if i had to wake up
on only six hours of sleep i would have these
like bad headaches and i would just feel terrible and
i wasn't able to function now i can function like
on four hours of sleep not that i would normally
do that but you know in an emergency situation if
i need to only get four hours of sleep and
then for some reason get up and do something i
can do that whereas before that was impossible for me
to do before the chelation so that was a huge
shift that happened i got more energy less fatigue i
experienced less dark circles under the eyes i've had that
problem not to say that all this is fixed for
me but i've seen improvements i've seen a huge lift
in my brain fog and my mental clarity i feel
like my cognitive performance is back to where it was
when i began actualize that org maybe it's not as
good as it was when i was like in high
school or university uh but that just might be you
know age related as well because of course as you
age your cognitive performance will slow down and i also
haven't finished all of my heavy metal chelation yet it
takes a while to to do it even though i've
done over 30 rounds of it um another problem that
i had that i almost forgot about now because it's
it's been completely resolved is i started getting uh this
nerve um this kind of tingling nerve sensation in my
hand it was only i forget if it was the
right hand or the left hand one of the hands
um it almost felt like there was some sort of
nerve damage going from about this point in the wrist
through um to the pinky and it was like on
this side and i also had it on my foot
so analogously on the same side where my ankle is
down to my foot also on the pinky and i
went to various doctors telling them about like why is
this happening it just sort of came out out of
the blue i started getting this kind of like very
it wasn't it wasn't painful just like this very irritating
annoying constant chronic um uh like i don't know like
like a tingling sensation and it got very uncomfortable to
the point where it was difficult to sit and meditate
because this was very distracting and annoying and then the
more you focus on it the worse it gets and
so i had this i went to various doctors told
them about it and they were clueless they didn't know
what to do about it they basically gave me no
solutions but after i did about 10 or 15 rounds
of this chelation that problem completely resolved itself and went
away and i've never experienced any recurrence of it for
about five years now uh and uh to the point
where i even almost forgot to tell you about it
um so um so yeah this can be very powerful
stuff i mean i don't know where i would be
honestly i i might even like even be dead uh
because of how bad also what happened was that when
i was having this severe brain fog it also came
with a depression uh and so i got i got
a good insight into what like a chemical sort of
induced depression is like because you know you can't do
your work and then your brain is functioning poorly you
can't focus very well and then just depression comes with
that it gives you bad mood it makes you irritable
and so i went through a year or two of
that as well and then that has lifted two for
me so that's my personal story now you know there's
a lot of variability i'm not saying you're gonna have
the same results as me i'm not saying you have
the same problems as me you have to judge for
yourself what kind of you know situation you're dealing with
but as a general list because i've researched this very
well and there's a lot of people there's a sort
of a underground heavy metal detox community on facebook and
elsewhere people are doing this stuff and they're fixing many
of their health problems that that traditional doctors and western
medicine does not know how to diagnose or how to
properly treat and so uh who should consider heavy metal
detox people who have chronic fatigue problems sleep problems insomnia
problems uh problems if you're sleeping for eight or ten
hours then you're still tired and you're not able to
function you don't feel refreshed people like that people with
autoimmune conditions if you have brain fog if you have
add autism headaches hair falling out fibromyalgia cold hands and
feet gut problems depression anxiety low sex drive anger irritability
skin problems dark circles under eyes even people with cancer
and other such conditions now again be careful here because
i'm not telling you that heavy metal detox is the
cure to all of these problems many of these problems
have multiple factors and multiple potential causes and so if
you have one of these problems i empathize because they
can be very stubborn and what you have to do
is you have to troubleshoot and you have to eliminate
all the possible causes and try various sorts of solutions
until you find something that hopefully works of course there's
no guarantee that anything will fix your problem but uh
it doesn't feel very good to be a victim about
it you might as well try stuff and see what
works and you might get lucky and so um you
know i'm not i'm not promising you that that this
this process will cure your cancer um but maybe it'll
help so again i'm not a doctor this is not
strictly speaking medical advice you have to consult your own
doctors and think critically for yourself about what of the
things that i'm saying is going to apply to your
particular health condition and your situation factoring in your genetic
history and your diet and all the other factors right
so don't approach this lightly this is your health this
is important stuff on the other hand precisely because it
is your health and it is so important and it
is the foundation of all personal development work and all
spiritual work if you don't get this stuff handled then
you're not going to be able to follow along with
my other content which is why i want to release
this episode is because a lot of you guys are
just stuck suffering from depression or add or some you
know brain fog or sleep disorder or whatever or fatigue
and then you're not able to really go and self-actualize
because the foundation of self-actualization is just basic fundamental good
health so where does heavy metal toxicity come from there's
actually so many sources you'll be shocked once you start
to study the sources at how common it can be
and then it's no wonder that you're potentially toxic so
the problem with heavy metal toxicity is that heavy metals
which is really what we're talking about here is lead
mercury and arsenic these are the top heavy metals although
there's of course potentially other ones as well that you
can test for um i'll be showing you how to
test for them in a minute here um but these
are the big three mercury lead and arsenic and our
environment over the last hundred years has been crazy polluted
from heavy industry and mining and other you know manufacturing
and electronics and results you know bad recycling practices and
oil and gas industry all these sorts of you know
plastic manufacturing um gold mining like there's a lot of
these industries which have polluted because we have very bad
regulations uh have have polluted the rivers the oceans the
lakes the fish the animals the uh the farms because
you know where do they get the water for all
the for all the vegetables and fruits that are grown
they get the cheapest water from the cheapest sources which
is contaminated by industrial pollution and then you eat that
stuff and it gets absorbed into the soil it gets
absorbed into the plants and it stays in the ecosystem
for hundreds of years so it's serious stuff so here
are the biggest sources of heavy metal toxicity first of
all dentistry if you have metal amalgam fillings those silver
fillings which are par mercury and part other metal you
need to get those removed as soon as possible and
that's a whole process i'm not going to go into
explaining how to do that but you need to get
that removed because that mercury the vapors from that mercury
is leaching into your gums and into your mouth and
your lungs and it's slowly toxifying you and that's the
thing with heavy metal toxicity is that it happens very
slowly it's not necessarily that i'm telling you that some
incident happened in your life where you got a giant
dose of mercury no it's just that you know as
you're getting past your 20s into your 30s 40s and
50s and so forth you know every little bit of
food you eat every drink of water you take that
is contaminated with a little trace amount of mercury or
lead or arsenic it all adds up think about it
if you're not detoxing it which most people aren't over
10 20 30 years that's gonna all add up and
the worst thing about it is that it's it feels
like you're slowly being boiled alive like you know that
proverbial frog being slowly boiled alive because it's so subtle
it happens you know over years so gradually that you
don't even notice its effects on you you just slightly
become a little bit more depressed every year a little
bit more depressed a little bit more irritable a little
bit more fuzzy in your thinking your cognition declines your
memory worsens you get a little bit more anxious your
sex drive and performance decreases you have start to have
a little bit of skin problems you get a little
bit of more dark dark circles under your eyes you
start getting acne you start getting gut problems and all
this slowly adds up and it's so subtle and then
you go to a doctor and you ask them you
know what's wrong with me and they can't give you
a straight answer and there's no obvious cure or solution
there's no pill you can take if your if your
brain and your organs are filled with heavy metals there's
no pill you can take that will solve that for
you because it's not a problem of adding something new
to your body it's not a matter of eating more
green vegetables i mean that's good but that's not going
to remove the heavy metals from your brain you got
to remove what's causing the problem in this case see
and because our culture doesn't talk about this stuff you
don't see this advertised on on tv you know heavy
metal toxicity nobody talks about it really so you don't
even know that this could potentially be the root source
of many of your health problems so dentistry food seafood
organ meats the water that you drink the pipes that
your water runs through there's a lot of lead piping
still for example in the u.s there's an initiative right
now in the byte administration to actually remove a lot
of old lead pipes there's especially a lot of lead
piping on the eastern half of the united states on
the west there's less lead piping but you know you
gotta check to make sure your water is not coming
from lead pipes paint used to contain lead in it
fluorescent lights if you've ever broken a fluorescent tube light
and you breathe in those fumes it contains mercury it's
very very toxic makeup can contain lead and other heavy
metals spices are a hidden source of heavy metals we'll
talk about those later in the episode tea potentially many
supplements are contaminated with heavy metals protein powders are a
huge offender if you're taking whey protein powders or even
if you're taking vegetable protein powders those vegan warrior protein
protein powders those are filled with toxic heavy metals did
you know that even the organic stuff you might say
oh leo but i only eat the organic whey protein
and only the organic all-natural vegetable proteins those organic ones
they contain even more toxic metals than the inorganic ones
they've done tests on this you can find websites with
detailed breakdowns of the heavy metals in your favorite brands
of protein powder traffic pollution if you're living near a
highway you're breathing in heavy metal fumes every single day
heavy industry if you live near any kind of industry
if you work near heavy industry plants if there are
coal-fired plants in your city or where you work that
produces a lot of heavy metal pollution waste water of
various kinds mining operations and the the water runoff from
those so there's a lot of potential sources of heavy
metal toxicity but uh the biggest ones you should be
worried about is dentistry food seafood and the water that
you drink these are huge and then any kind of
supplements or protein powders you consume i mean that's part
of what i would call food um anything you take
on a chronic daily basis you want to make sure
that it's very clean and just because it says organic
on the box or on the bottle that does not
guarantee that it doesn't have heavy metal contamination in it
because that's not really checked for when they talk about
organic versus inorganic okay so now you might say but
leo isn't this heavy metal chelation sort of like some
sort of new age thing actually not at all there
is very good hard chemistry and science that has been
done on the effects of mercury-led arsenic and other heavy
metals on um human neurology psychology mental development and performance
criminality levels and so forth this is all very well
documented proven science which is why there are strict regulations
in most countries especially in europe and elsewhere most developed
countries have very strict regulations on mercury-led and and so
forth but even with those strict regulations it's usually not
enough because lead and mercury are neurotoxins this is very
very well known i will be citing various studies throughout
this episode i will be reading some quotes to you
here in a minute about some of the effects of
these neurotoxins on human brain development and so forth and
i think that the full effects the full health effects
of these toxins these neurotoxins is not even fully understood
yet we're only just beginning to do the science and
to understand how bad these chemicals are and if you
go and look at the description box below this video
on youtube you're going to find a list of various
links to serious well-documented research studies on the effects of
lead and mercury on children and on adults and also
you're going to find i'm going to list studies about
the the various supplements that i'll be talking about to
detox heavy metals which have also been proven to work
and are very effective for doing that so there's very
solid science behind this all right so speaking of which
let's talk about a little bit of some of the
quotations here about some of the effects of these neurotoxins
on human development for example the epa says quote children
exposed to methyl mercury while they are in the womb
can have impacts to their cognitive thinking memory attention language
fine motor skills and visual spatial skills end quote uh
another quotation here from the uh ncbi from a study
called aggregate level lead exposure gun violence homicide and rape
i'm going to be quoting extensively from this study this
is a study that tried to correlate lead levels in
one's blood with criminality basically and they found a pretty
solid correlation between these two so this study says quote
lead absorption early in development has been prospectively associated with
reductions in total brain volume into reductions in gray matter
these differences by extension are thought to impair impulse regulation
and to reduce general intelligence for exposed individuals across the
remainder of the life course end quote and further in
this study it says quote increased lead exposure was associated
with lower lower overall intelligence in adulthood as well as
lower scores on measures of perceptual reasoning and working memory
several lines of evidence have found that diminished functioning in
the prefrontal cortex is associated with impulsivity as well as
antisocial and violent behavior end quote and lastly it says
quote aggregate blood lead levels were statistically significant predictors of
violent crime at the census tract level end quote so
there was actually a spike in crime in the united
states in the 1970s i believe and 80s if you
look at the crime statistics there was a very significant
spike and then it quickly dropped off and it's been
dropping off ever since in the 90s and 2000s and
so forth and what they've basically found through various studies
and research is that the reason that happened is because
we passed regulation for unleaded gasoline before that regulation was
passed gasoline was leaded gasoline which means it had lead
in it which means when it was burned and exhausted
that lead was breathed into your lungs and it literally
led to more murders and homicides and other kinds of
violent crime so this just shows you how serious this
stuff is now for this to have a very significant
impact on criminality you need you need probably a significant
exposure to it but but i think that lead mercury
and some of these other chemicals they have more subtle
effects and i think that they could be responsible for
a lot of the autoimmune disorders and other sorts of
subtle disorders that when you go to a doctor and
tell him about it he says oh well maybe you're
just imagining that or we don't really know what causes
it it's like oh well you just have to live
with it there's nothing we can do about it you
know what i'm talking about if you had one of
these disorders and you've gone to various doctors and they
just kind of like shrug their shoulders and they don't
know what to do about it well that's because there's
hidden factors that have not yet been researched very well
by current science which we will discover in the next
50 or 100 years all this stuff will be figured
out but right now we still don't really understand the
full effects so basically here's a list of some of
the symptoms and conditions and disorders that could be caused
by heavy metal toxicity emotional changes such as mood swings
irritability nervousness excessive shyness social anxiety insomnia neuromuscular changes such
as weakness muscle atrophy and twitching and various odd nerve
sensations and dysfunctions which i started having headaches migraines disturbances
in sensations changes in nerve responses poor performance on tests
of mental function lower iq and lower intelligence learning disorders
memory loss brain fog add autism higher rates of criminality
violence and anger anxiety problems problems socializing depression bad mood
fatigue reduced motivation energy problems dark circles under eyes thyroid
disorders skin rashes and disorders autoimmune disorders now again i'm
not saying that all of this is caused by heavy
metals heavy metals are just a factor there could be
other factors and for everybody it's going to be a
bit different so you have to do research and try
stuff out and see what is true for you and
your specific situation now some people are more sensitive than
others to heavy metals you might wonder like well leo
i have these disorders but i'm drinking the same water
and eating basically the same food that my friend eats
or that my brother or my mother eats so how
could i be toxic but then they're not toxic and
yet they're all healthy and they might even eat junk
food and yet they're still healthy how can that be
and why am i sick in this case well because
you have different genetics and genetics determine how well you
detox heavy metals naturally the body has certain natural mechanisms
for detoxing certain amounts of heavy metals for example in
the research that i've looked at depending on your genetics
and various kinds of detox pathways and methylation pathways that
exist within the human body potentially for some people if
they consume some let's say fish you consume a pound
of salmon that will have heavy metals in it some
people will detox 80 of that mercury just naturally due
to their good genetics for other people they're they're only
going to be able to detox 20 of that so
compare maybe your mother or your brother is eating the
same salmon you're eating every day but they're detoxing 80
percent of it every time and because of your genetics
which is a little bit different than theirs you're only
detoxing 20 of it do you think that makes a
difference when you multiply that by 20 years by hundreds
and hundreds of meals of this salmon that you're eating
yeah it makes a big difference it's going to add
up in a different way and also how your body
deals with and stores these heavy metals could also vary
due to genetics these heavy metals are not just floating
around in your bloodstream they then get absorbed into various
organs fat tissues and then especially problematically is the brain
because your brain is mostly fatty tissue it's a lot
of fat in your brain and then the heavy metals
get stuck in there and heavy metals basically have the
effect on the brain of what i would call anti-psychedelics
if psychedelics raise your consciousness if psychedelics increase the neuronal
interconnections and your cognitive performance which they do heavy metals
have exactly the opposite effect they are like a an
obstacle to the proper functioning of the neurons in your
brain and your ability to think and to reason and
to remember things and to visualize things and to use
your prefrontal cortex to think about things to be logical
about things and this is why it can lead to
stuff like increased criminality so you can do some research
into the genetics it's a bit complicated and technical i
won't go into it here but you can research the
mthfr gene and various methylation pathways you can even do
a genetic test on yourself doing something like 23andme which
i've done and then you can actually find the specific
mutations you have of this mthfr gene you can find
specific snippets and you can see based on your genetics
you can actually take a look at how susceptible are
you to uh heavy metal toxicity and so i've actually
looked at my own mutations and what i found is
that i have a few of those mutations which make
me more susceptible than let's say the average person and
so that would explain for example why i have these
problems more than maybe other members in my family or
maybe the general population so that is possible for you
to do now let's talk about how to actually test
for heavy metals it is important to test yourself because
you don't want to just be sort of assuming that
you're toxic in heavy metals maybe you're not in which
case don't waste your time and money doing chelation so
there's various tests that are possible you can do blood
tests you can do hair tests you can do urine
tests what i've personally found is that blood tests and
hair tests are unreliable and that the the best test
is called a provoked urine test what is this provoked
urine test basically it's a at home test kit that
you order online there's various brands available i'll be showing
you here a demo of the brand and test kit
that i use but basically it's a small test kit
that they mail to your house you can use it
in the convenience of your house uh over over a
period of three hours basically what you do is you
consume a fairly large quantity of a supplement called dmsa
which is what detox is the heavy metals you consume
uh a certain amount of that that provokes your body
to release heavy metals like lead and mercury and then
you drink a lot of water for the next three
hours you collect all your urine into a bottle and
then you mail some of that in this test kit
you collect some of it and then you mail it
back to the lab they test it and they give
you a report and uh i'll be showing you some
results from my own report here in a second and
um and so you do this test kit and this
gives you an idea of how much heavy metal you're
excreting by consuming dmsa so this shows you whether anything
bad is coming out of you and so this is
a pretty reliable test because if you didn't have heavy
metals in your body then nothing would be getting excreted
by the dmsa but probably something will be this test
costs about 110 in the u.s i don't know about
other countries so here i'm going to show you a
demo of what the test kit looks like check that
out so here we have the urine collection test kit
this is an at-home test that you can order online
and they will mail it to you they will mail
you the urine collection container that's what this is we'll
set this aside for now and then the kit here
itself and i'll just quickly show you how this works
there's a cup that you use to pee in there's
the actual sample that you're going to send back to
the lab here i'll show you how to use that
in a second and then there's some paperwork you have
to fill out and then there's a fedex prepaid envelope
and a stamp that you were going to package all
this into and then you're going to drop it off
at your local fedex location so let's show you how
this works so basically the way it's going to work
is you're going to wake up in the morning you're
going to pee the first time you're just going to
do a normal p and then you're going to take
your bolus dose of dmsa so for this you're going
to need to separately purchase some dmsa that's what this
is and then you have to calculate the proper dosage
for you whatever that is i give you the calculation
later on in the video but for me it's about
18 of these 100 milligram pills so in total it's
a thousand eight hundred but of course this is for
my body weight you're going to adjust that for your
body weight so you calculate x number of these pills
you take them all at once you set a timer
for six hours on your alarm you set a timer
for six hours and that's how long you're gonna be
collecting your urine so you're gonna make sure you're gonna
drink a lot of water in the next six hours
and every time you have to pee you're gonna pee
in this cup don't forget and then you're gonna pour
the contents of this cup into this container every time
you pee you're gonna keep pouring it in here and
you store this in the refrigerator and you keep pouring
in and pouring in for six hours and then once
you got six hours of urine collected then you're going
to have a lot of urine here you're going to
shake this whole thing up to mix it all together
and you're going to pour from here into your sample
vial you're going to pour in there once this is
full then you're going to close it up and this
is what you're sending back to the lab so you're
going to put it into the box here you're going
to put the paperwork in here into the box and
then you're going to put the box into this fedex
envelope with this shipping label and you're going to mail
all this off via fedex and then the lab will
send you the test results in about one to two
weeks via email or wherever you ordered your test kit
from maybe some online portal or from your doctor and
that's it so when you purchase this test kit it's
not going to come with dmsa dmsa is what you
need to provoke the heavy metal chelation so this you
have to purchase separately and you have to figure out
a proper dose for yourself in order to do this
test um i'll be talking about where to purchase it
and how that works and what the dos dosages are
in a minute here so basically once you have the
dmsa you take it you collect your urine for three
hours or so you collect it and then you send
it to the lab so what i recommend is that
before you begin doing your detox protocols if you decide
to do it is that you do two urine tests
the first test is going to be an unprovoked urine
test which means you're just going to get sort of
a baseline a control you're going to use one test
kit without dmsa and just see how much heavy metals
you're excreting naturally through your urine then you do a
second test right away at the same time you do
a second test where you take the dmsa and then
you you collect your urine and this test shows you
the difference between how much you're excreting without dmsa versus
with dmsa this shows you what the dmsa is doing
now what's the proper dose of dmsa it should be
about 30 milligrams per kilogram of body weight so for
example usually if i'm doing a urine test i will
do about 18 pills 18 pills and each pill is
100 milligrams and then my body weight i don't know
it in kilograms but in pounds it's about 170 pounds
um so that just gives you sort of an idea
and then you have to do the calculation and adjust
it for yourself now you'd have to be careful with
these provoked urine tests because if you're very very toxic
and for example you have metal fillings or you're actively
exposed to heavy metal toxins at your workplace or wherever
and then you take a a large dose of dmsa
the problem is not that the dmsa is toxic or
is going to cause you problems the problem is that
the dmsa is a very safe molecule but it's going
to cause your body to release all of the heavy
metals that you've been storing up for years and this
can have some dangers to it so you do have
to be careful when you're doing these provoke tests on
the other hand this is really the only reliable way
i i feel like to test yourself so there's a
bit of a kind of a a risk reward trade-off
there and you have to decide for yourself you know
whether you want to take that risk because otherwise how
are you going to know if you're toxic or not
so here i'm going to show you an image of
my actual test results that i got these are test
results this is the first provoked test that i did
about five years ago and you can take a look
here and so basically what what this test showed me
is that i had an elevated mercury level you can
see here it's in the yellow sort of the out
of reference range yellow column and then i also had
a fairly high amount of lead as well it's it's
within reference range but uh basically the conclusion i came
to here is that things like lead and mercury and
arsenic they should all be at zero there really is
no safe amount and uh part of the problem is
that if you look at government websites they will give
you sort of like safe levels of fda and epa
approved safe levels of how much mercury is okay to
have in fish how much mercury is okay to have
in water and lead and so forth and basically i
call [ __ ] on all these uh first of
all because the fda and the epa they're um they're
filled with a lot of group think and basically their
their responsibility is to avoid like the most severe cases
of toxicity they're not looking out for very subtle cognitive
performance problems that can come about from you know consuming
heavy metals for years and for decades and honestly they're
also lobby very heavily by these industries which are big
polluters they're lobbied by oil and gas industries they're oil
lobbied by pharmaceutical industries they're lobbied by farming industries and
so forth and you know if the epa and the
fda were truly concerned about you know optimizing your cognitive
performance and your level of consciousness and so forth then
they would have much much stricter levels and on top
of that not only are the levels not strict enough
furthermore they're not enforced nearly enough so a lot of
products out there in the market that you are consuming
supplement bottles and protein powders and vegetables you're eating and
meat you're eating and whatever else water you're drinking they
actually have way higher levels beyond what the fda and
the epa recommends but you don't even know about it
because who's really checking this stuff the government is not
checking this stuff very rigorously so um a disservice is
happening there so you have to be careful you can't
really rely on their safe numbers those numbers are not
necessarily safe and maybe they're safe enough not to cause
an acute toxicity okay but what we're talking about here
is health problems chronic health problems that add up over
years and decades which are not an acute toxicity they're
a mild grade low-grade toxicity which still can destroy your
life now with this urine test the problem with the
urine test is that it doesn't really show you how
much lead or mercury or arsenic you have stored in
your organs all it shows you is how much you're
excreting within three hours of taking this dmsa your body
is only going to excrete so much at a time
and so this test we don't really have any tests
that will show you how much heavy metal is stored
in your brain or in your other organs and so
really what you have to do is you have to
do rounds of chelation i'm going to be talking about
how to do around here in a minute rounds of
chelation you do 10 20 rounds then you retake the
test and you see are you still excreting as much
as you were before if you still are that basically
tells you that you have a lot stored up and
then you do 10 or 20 more rounds of chelation
then you take another test and you see are you
still excreting as much or maybe now you're excreting half
as much that shows you that okay so maybe you've
decreased but not entirely eliminated all of the load in
your organs so you keep doing that and doing that
and doing that until eventually your tests come back very
very low and in this way you can you can
know that you're detoxing properly and also of course you
can just anecdotally feel what's happening with you you might
see improvements and symptoms you might see improvements in your
sleep in your cognitive performance in your ability to focus
in your memory in your you know dark circles under
the eyes and other things like that so basically what
you have to realize is that there are no safe
levels of these heavy metals in your body any amount
decreases your performance so the question is how much decrease
in performance are you willing to tolerate and if you
have a kind of a job that like that i
have where my cognitive performance to me is like everything
my entire life hinges on my cognitive performance basically uh
i can make millions of dollars if i have good
cognitive performance or i can lose that potential money if
i'm unable to perform cognitively so for me it's very
worthwhile to optimize my cognitive performance as well as i
can now i don't know what it's like for you
maybe you have sort of a mindless job where it
doesn't matter to you but then again you know it's
not just cognitive performance it's other health stuff it just
could be how how good you feel in your own
body you might have even forgotten how good it you
can feel what good mood you can be in so
another thing you have to realize is that these heavy
metals literally put you into a chronic state of bad
mood you could just be anxious depressed fearful in a
sort of low consciousness days uh you know sleep walking
through life like a zombie not sure what's wrong with
you and you could be blaming yourself for like well
maybe i'm not being spiritual enough maybe i'm being lazy
maybe i'm doing something wrong maybe i need to read
more books and it's like but maybe it's not that
maybe it's simply because your neurochemistry is screwed up maybe
it's just that and then when you fix that problem
you realize that all of a sudden your depression lifts
you're you're happy for no reason whatsoever like you were
when you were a kid remember how that was when
you were just happy for no reason uh yeah that's
possible and you might experience that if you do some
of this chelation again i'm not guaranteeing it's going to
happen i'm just saying these are possibilities and these are
some of the benefits that you should be considering so
uh now how to do the detox basically you're going
to be doing rounds of dmsa alpha lipoic acid ala
and or potentially dmps dmsa versus dnps these are two
analogous molecules uh we'll be talking about the the pros
and cons of each here in a minute they they
both detox slightly different kinds of metals but you can
use them interchangeably in different ways and basically you're going
to be using a protocol developed by a doctor named
dr andy cutler so i'm borrowing heavily from his protocol
and then i'm adjusting a little bit to suit my
own experiences so you can go purchase dr andy cutler's
book which talks about his protocol and it's a very
good book if you're going to be doing chelation i
recommend you purchase it and read it in addition to
all the information that i'm giving you here so detoxing
heavy metals is safe when you're using the right protocol
but otherwise it can be dangerous so it is important
that you understand the caveats and warnings and the things
not to do when using these supplements to do the
detox most importantly you have to understand that you can't
do this chelation if you have mercury in your body
most likely from metal teeth fillings or if you are
actively exposed to heavy metals because what's going to happen
is that if you have metal fillings and then you
start doing this chelation it's going to start leeching the
mercury from your fillings into your body so it's going
to make your problem worse you're not going to be
removing all the mercury from your teeth by pissing it
out through your urine that's going to take 100 years
that you're just going to be leeching from your teeth
into your organs and into your brain and in this
way you could really damage and harm yourself so you
have to make sure that you first remove all your
metal fillings if you got them and then you can
start doing chelation and you should wait some number of
weeks or months after removing your fillings or after a
recent heavy metal exposure and then only then begin chelation
just to be safe so here's the actual protocol of
how to do this basically a single round of chelation
is going to last about three to four days this
means for three to four days you have to be
taking these supplements on a very regular schedule and here
are the the schedules for each substance so dmps you
have to take it every four hours for three to
four days that means you have to set a timer
and on the dot every four hours you have to
be taking a new dose i'll be giving you dosage
recommendations here in a few minutes as far as alpha
lipoic acid ala this you have to take every three
hours and then with dmps you have to take this
every eight hours so for example if you're going to
combine dmps and alpha lipoic acid and take them together
which is my preferred protocol i take them at once
you're going to be taking it on the shortest on
the shortest schedule so in this case every three hours
so basically my round looks like this for four days
straight every three hours i am taking a certain dose
of dmp of dmsa and ala let's say i might
be taking 200 milligrams of dmsa and then 100 milligrams
of ala every every three hours and this includes in
the middle of the night when you're supposed to be
sleeping so literally i'll set a timer and every three
hours that means i'm gonna be waking up probably two
times a night it's a bit of a pain in
the ass but you have to do it very rigorously
and the reason you have to do it this way
is because these supplements and chemicals have a half-life so
what happens is you take you take the substance like
the msa it has a half-life about four hours that
means in four hours much of it is excreted from
your body and the the key here is that once
you activate and you start to leech the heavy metals
from your organs now it's it goes into your bloodstream
now it has the potential to go through your liver
and your kidneys and to get pissed out and excrete
from your body but once it goes into your bloodstream
from your organs you know if four hours passes and
you don't take a second dose then what's gonna happen
is that this chemical it acts like a sponge like
this dmsa it's like a sponge basically which if it
if it comes into contact with any heavy metal in
your bloodstream it's gonna it's gonna lock on to it
and then those molecules together that combination of molecule is
gonna get excreted in your urine but if you don't
have sufficient dmsa on a regular basis what's gonna happen
is that the mercury is gonna collect in your blood
and then through the blood it's going to circulate and
deposit itself into various kinds of organs so if you're
not taking it on a regular basis every three or
four hours essentially what's going to happen is that you're
going to start redistributing the heavy metals in your body
from one place to another place and you can actually
cause yourself more damage by doing that so it's very
important to observe these half-life time frames and the minimum
length of around should be three days although you could
go longer i usually go about four days and the
way you want to do it ideally is you want
to take three to four days of of these pills
and then you want to take another three or four
days off to let your body recover because this can
be stressful on your body there can be various kinds
of side effects as is happening give your body time
to rest if you want give yourself a whole week
to rest and then begin a second round so what
constitutes a single round is is that three to four
day period of taking the pills plus four to seven
days of rest and recovery that is one round and
then you can keep doing more and more rounds uh
and how many rounds should you do in total well
that depends on how toxic you are um if you're
pretty toxic this whole process will take you several years
to complete i recommend doing at least 10 20 rounds
personally i want to get to like 50 or 60
rounds because i'm really serious about optimizing my health and
so i still have yet to to complete that i
may be halfway done and i've been doing this for
about five years of course on and off i haven't
been doing it five to five years straight i've taken
many breaks in between so in order for this process
to work in order for you to do it very
consistently that's the key is you must pre-sort all your
pills and doses you can't be fumbling around with bottles
in the middle of the night it's not going to
work so we have to pre-sort everything i'm going to
show you a demo of how i do that in
a second i use these sort of pill containers i
use four containers for for the four days that i'm
doing this everything is pre-sorted and then it becomes very
easy to just set a timer and then to take
you know from each pill box the amount of pills
that i need very easily at the right time you
must also use timers so i use digital timers with
alarms that i set around the house to make sure
that i don't forget to take these doses it's important
you don't skip any doses throughout this three to four
day period and uh yes even during the night you
must take them which is a little bit of a
pain in the ass in addition to taking the main
supplements of dmsa and alpha lipoic acid i also add
additional support supplements which i'll be showing you in the
demo here in a minute so i take vitamin c
that's buffered 500 milligrams and i sprinkle those out throughout
the day i take vitamin e 250 milligrams and i
also sprinkle those out throughout the day i take zinc
picolinate 50 milligrams sprinkled throughout the day and magnesium citrate
210 milligrams also interspersed through my pillbox throughout the day
now here's stuff that you should not take when you're
doing this chelation you should not take chlorella spirulina or
cilantro these are sometimes considered effective chelation for heavy metals
in sort of a natural you know in the natural
way and um this is problematic we don't really have
a good idea of how chlorella or spirulina or cilantro
work maybe they do detox stuff but maybe they don't
really if you're going to be doing the dmsa and
ala combination you don't need to add this other stuff
to it it could screw it up other things you
shouldn't take other supplements is knack nac glutathione and iv
treatments sometimes you can get iv infusions of glutathione this
actually can redistribute heavy metals in your body in a
in a weird way which can backfire on you it's
also important that you don't take alpha lipoic acid as
a daily supplement some people take it as a daily
supplement some people have it in their multivitamin this is
bad because ala redistributes heavy metals and you don't want
to be taking it only once per day if you're
taking alpha lipoic acid you've got to be taking it
on that three hour half-life and you're going to be
taking it for three or four days straight as part
of a chelation protocol otherwise don't take it because it's
going to be redistributing heavy metals in unknown ways in
your body and the other thing not to take is
um there's a sort of analogous supplement to dmsa called
edta which has a sort of a worse profile of
chelation than dmsa and dmps so avoid edta now as
far as dosages how much should you take of this
stuff well when it comes to dmsa i purchase it
in 100 milligram pills that's very convenient for me and
the dosage is 30 milligrams per kilogram per day and
then you divide it into those three or four hour
segments so for example i will take 2 200 milligrams
per day for my body weight and then i take
2200 milligrams and divided by eight because there are eight
chunks of three hours and 24 hours so uh that
means 200 milligrams every three hours 200 milligrams every three
hours for eight times is 24 hours and that adds
up to 2 200 milligrams per day which is ideal
for my body weight now you're gonna have to adjust
that number for your body weight and also if you're
extremely toxic you might lower that dose because the higher
your dose is and the more toxic you are the
more side effects you're gonna experience from the from the
detox so for me personally that dose is very reasonable
and i handle it relatively well now with alpha lipoic
acid what's the dosage for that here it's a little
trickier the dosage will range anywhere from 25 milligrams to
250 milligrams per three hour period so every three hours
you would basically take let's say if you want to
start very low you start at 25 milligrams now alpha
lipoic acid is unique in that it it crosses the
blood-brain barrier so the reason you're using alpha lipoic acid
specifically is because dmsa and dnps is not actually going
to leech the heavy metals from your brain which is
the most important really um in my personal opinion is
to detox your brain not just your body but your
brain specifically and really the only way you're going to
do that is with alpha lipoic acid because it crosses
the blood-brain barrier uh the problem though is that alpha
lipoic acid can cause some fairly severe detox symptoms as
it's leaching out and chelating the heavy metals depending on
how toxic you are so with alpha lipoic acid you
want to start very low and feel how well you
can handle it and if you can handle it then
on the next round you can increase your dose and
then increase some more and increase and just keep increasing
it until you get to something like 250 milligrams that
would be probably the maximum you should take every three
hours uh it'll probably take you 10 20 rounds or
more of chelation to get to the point where you
can actually tolerate 250 milligrams of alpha lipoic acid so
to be safe i'd say start at 25 milligrams and
then maybe bump it up to 50 bump it up
to 75 bump it up to 100 see how you
do at 100 maybe try 150 maybe try 200 and
just keep ramping it up and and see how you
feel you got to go by how you feel and
then as far as if you want to use dmps
instead of dmsa you can do that i would purchase
250 uh i mean sorry 25 milligram pills and with
dmps the dosage is going to be about 200 to
500 milligrams per day that's the maximum you'd want to
take and then you divide that up um with dmps
you're taking it um every eight hours so you only
need to divide it into basically um three doses so
the idea here is that you want to start low
and you want to gradually ramp up you have to
be careful not to just blast yourself with a bunch
of dmsa and lala all at once because this can
cause some pretty severe redistribution of heavy metals and and
various kinds of side effects so be patient with this
process don't try to you know reach the finish line
too soon because you might end up back it'll backfire
on you you have to go by how you feel
um it's recommended that you basically do four rounds at
a certain dosage and then if you're still feeling good
everything's okay the side effects aren't too bad then you
can increase on the next four rounds and then do
four more rounds on the higher dose and then see
how you feel if you still feel okay then increase
for four more rounds and then keep doing that and
just kind of ramping up be careful more is not
necessarily better what you want here is a slow steady
even keeled approach rather than a sort of a yo-yo
effect where you're taking large doses you're experiencing horrible symptoms
and then you have to stop you have to recover
for a long time then you try it again and
this sort of up and down yoyo thing is is
not very wise all right so now i'm going to
show you a couple of demos of how my supplements
look and also how i organize them okay now i'm
going to show you the most crucial part of this
protocol which is all the supplements that i use and
specifically how i arrange them into pill boxes for this
entire three to four day duration that you're going to
be taking and chelating all right so let's start off
by introducing our chelating agents and chemicals so we have
the dmsa this is 100 milligrams here and these pills
they just look like ordinary white pills like this this
particular brand is from living supplements i like this brand
but you can use whatever brand of dmsa you can
find out there that you like same brand living supplements
this is dmps 25 milligrams they also just look like
white pills nothing special about them and then this is
the life alpha lipoic acid uh ala otherwise known as
ala 150 milligrams now you can get this in different
dosages 150 milligrams is pretty high if you're just starting
this protocol you probably want to start something lower like
50 milligrams and then work your way up but for
me these work fine and they're also kind of like
a yellowish white pill so we've got that and then
these vitamins and supplements here these are just supporting supplements
so basically these are gonna do the work of pulling
the heavy metals out into your bloodstream and through your
kidneys and your liver and out of your body and
then as that's happening your body is detoxing and it
needs some support vitamins and nutrients which are those like
vitamin c we have vitamin c 500 milligrams here we
have zinc picolinate 50 milligrams we have vitamin e uh
268 milligrams and this is magnesium citrate uh about 210
milligrams per pill on this one and so these are
just to support your detox pathways and to lower any
kind of detox symptoms you might be feeling any negative
side effects from the chelation and now here's how i
organize everything and it's crucial that you do this because
if you don't every three hours remembering to open all
of these and to take them in the right combination
it's going to be way too much work and you're
going to forget and it's just not going to it's
not going to fly so what you do is you
buy four of these sort of week-long pill boxes you
can find at your local pharmacy or on amazon or
order it online i think i bought these at like
walgreens or cvs and then i put a label on
each one so see here it says this is number
one this one says number two and so on and
then so what i do is i fill them all
up at once like this i won't do all of
them because it'll take too much time i'll just do
one day's worth so you can see but normally i
would fill all four of them up at once so
what i would start with is let's say i'm this
is my sort of standard protocols i'm going to use
dmsa and i tell you how to calculate your proper
dose basically your dose is going to be roughly 100
milligrams to 200 milligrams every three hours with the dmsa
so for me i do 200 milligrams so i'll put
two pills so each of these containers basically counts as
three hours and you're gonna have eight of them per
day so like this so normally i would keep going
but just for the sake of brevity here i'm only
showing you one day's worth so that's one day eight
times three um then i would take my apple alpha
lipoic acid and i would do one of these per
three hour period so like this and of course you're
going to adjust these dosages to whatever you know is
suitable for you now the dmps i'm not going to
take because usually i'll either take dmps or dmsa but
not both of them at the same time so that's
for some other you know another another time um so
we got that and then i will take the vitamin
c and i will add one per three hour period
so quite a bit of vitamin c this just helps
with the detox uh symptoms and kind of gives you
the antioxidants and nutri nutrients that you need while you're
detoxing and then as far as vitamin e and the
other ones go with this what i do is i
put it into every fourth one so one two three
four because i don't want it you don't want to
take too much of some of these vitamins you can
overtake some of these vitamins so you want to be
careful and then the zinc i will also do just
once every four and then the same for the magnesium
these pills are pretty big so like that and that's
basically it now i would i would fill all four
of them up and so this is going to be
equivalent to about three and a half days worth which
is about what you're shooting for with this protocol and
so all of this constitutes one single round of chelation
and you're going to be doing 10 20 30 50
of these rounds you know depending on how how toxic
you think you are and depending on your urine test
results what those show and depending on how you feel
if you feel good after doing five or ten rounds
you know keep doing more also what you should know
is that you're not necessarily always going to feel better
after a round it might be the case that you
do five rounds and you actually start feeling worse and
it's important that you actually continue to do more chelation
because what that means is you're feeling worse because you're
detoxing and you have a lot to detox and you're
in the middle of a detox cycle and so just
because you do five rounds and you feel bad that
doesn't mean it's not working or that something is going
wrong it just means you got to keep going and
finish it you know go to 10 rounds go to
20 rounds and then you're going to start to feel
much better that's usually how it works so there tends
to be a dip in this whole chelation process you
might feel better after the first few rounds of chelation
then maybe between round 10 if 10 and 15 and
20 you feel worse there's a dip and then after
you complete you know 20 rounds then you maybe start
feeling better again so it's important that you keep going
even though you might not feel good after each round
and then after some rounds you might feel really good
so it tends to vary don't expect it to always
be positive some rounds can feel great some rounds can
feel bad and so that's just the nature of the
beast so that's how that works and then um the
final part of this which is crucial is you need
a high quality digital timer which is what i use
here so i'll put three hours on here i'll set
it for three hours and i'll leave this here and
when the three hours is up it's going to ring
and then that that tells me i got to come
here and take the next dose and so i'll be
doing that every three hours for the next three to
four days as i'm finishing this whole round including in
the middle of the night so you need something that
will wake you up in the middle of the night
so that you can do this there you go uh
on the one hand it can seem a little bit
complicated on the other hand it's actually pretty easy once
you get the hang of it and it's actually really
effortless one once you have this timer it's very effortless
to take it on a schedule and you can be
working you can be you know doing whatever chores you
got to do around the house and really it it
doesn't it shouldn't affect your life too much unless you
start to experience some severe detox symptoms which means that
your doses are too high that means you've got to
lower your dose of dmps or dmsa or alpha lipoic
acid lower your doses to the point where the side
effects you can maybe feel some of the negative side
effects but they're not debilitating and they don't prevent you
from living your life and doing what you got to
do throughout the day okay so you've seen the demos
you kind of know what it looks like you have
a good idea of how to organize your pills it's
very important that you have a organized system because if
you don't you're not going to be taking them consistently
and the whole thing is going to is gonna implode
on you you're not gonna be able to basically follow
through on the protocol so make sure you invest in
the pill boxes and you organize everything very well you
have the timers and all that stuff all right now
you might be wondering well leo is dmsa ala and
dmps safe or might these molecules harm me how do
i know they're safe well actually there's good science on
all these molecules i'm going to link some of the
studies down below you can search for studies yourself all
these chemicals and molecules are very safe they're not going
to harm your body in fact they're safe enough for
children to take and they've been used on children effectively
however we have to be careful with is that the
heavy metals that are being leached and absorbed by these
molecules and moved around in your body those are not
safe so it is important that you take this detox
protocol seriously and you don't just play around with it's
not a game ordinarily you'd want to do this under
the supervision of your doctor the problem is that a
lot of doctors are very clueless about these protocols and
so they simply won't be able to help you and
if you have a you know a stubborn health problem
is better to take it into your own hands than
not do anything at all about it i have not
been able to find doctors i've gone to many doctors
i've i've found some even alternative doctors and some expensive
doctors and most of them have no idea about how
this protocol works i've only found like one doctor and
i only found him after years of figuring that this
stuff out for myself so most likely your doctor is
not going to know about these protocols and even if
he does know about a little bit of it um
he's not going to be able to actually show you
the safest protocol which is what we're talking about here
this takes a lot of of research that they don't
simply teach to traditional doctors uh so how many rounds
of detox are required well really it's not possible to
say because your toxicity you know can vary you can
be very low toxicity or very high toxicity anywhere in
between it might take 10 to 20 rounds and you
might need 50 plus rounds if you have serious health
problems if you have a combination of all these various
problems maybe 50 rounds or more that's what i intend
to be doing personally but you know start with 10
rounds and just see how you feel and how it
goes and if it's going well for you keep keep
doing it if your test results are coming back better
your urine test results keep doing it if your symptoms
are improving keep doing it now what about the side
effects of detox how will you feel during the detox
process while you're taking these supplements well i can explain
to you some of my own uh experiences generally i've
felt very few side effects however sometimes when i've taken
a lot of alpha lipoic acid i have felt some
negative side effects which hindered my performance for those three
to four days that i was taking it so you
can feel fatigue you can feel depression you can feel
sleepiness you can feel brain fog you can feel a
bad mood or a temper or sort of anger arising
within you you can also have maybe sleeping problems or
bad sleep or even like nightmares i've had a little
bit of that on detox in fact right now as
i'm sitting here i'm in the middle of my protocol
and so right now i have dmsa and ala coursing
through my system but right now i'm like i've found
my dosage you know a a nice moderate dosage where
i can still function i can still think uh right
now i don't feel fatigued i don't feel depressed i
feel pretty good although last night when i was sleeping
i did have some like weird dreams and nightmares that
i probably associate with taking this stuff but overall i
feel pretty good i've had other weeks where i would
do a protocol or a round of chelation and i
would feel miserable and so that generally depends on your
dosage range and also how much you've already detoxed right
if you're very toxic and you're just starting off with
a large dose you will feel more of these symptoms
the symptoms can get so bad that they will actually
inhibit your ability to work and to relate to other
people in which case that tells you that your dose
is too high and you just have to lower your
dose next time that's all that tells you the the
side effects should be bearable if they're not bearable then
lower your dose your dose is too high and then
after you do 10 to 20 rounds of this chelation
redo that urine test and see where you're at and
then keep doing it like that slow and steady every
10 20 rounds re-test yourself to see your progress and
then save all your test results on your computer so
that you can track yourself over the months and years
all right now let's compare the pros and cons of
these various chelation chemicals so dmsa what's it good for
each one of these chemicals has certain heavy metals that
it has a higher affinity for so for example dmsa
is especially good for detoxing lead so if you do
a urine test and you you see you have a
lot of lead in there then you want to focus
on using dmsa it'll be very effective for that it's
less effective against mercury although still it will detox mercury
it will also detox cadmium antimony and arsenic now dmps
is more effective against mercury lead it's less effective at
but it'll also do lead it'll do arsenic it'll do
nickel and also antimony so if you have a lot
of mercury maybe consider dmps instead of dmsa or if
you have more lead then consider dmsa instead of dnps
and then with alpha lipoic acid uh it's most effective
against mercury and then also arsenic and cadmium and it
doesn't do lead but additionally what you have to understand
about alpha lipoic acid is that it it's the only
chemical here that's going to cross the blood-brain barrier and
actually detox heavy metals from your brain so that's what
that's what makes it so good it'll it'll it'll suck
the mercury out of your brain it'll suck the arsenic
and the cadmium and um personally i think that's that's
one of the most valuable things so what i've done
is i've combined dmsa with alpha lipoic acid that's my
personal combo although i also have purchased dmps that i
in the future i plan to test out dmps as
well so i'm going to test out a combo of
dmps and alpha lipoic acid and try those in tandem
and just see how that compares i haven't tried it
yet but i will in the months to come so
you know you find your combo if you want try
both you can also just start with dmsa or dmps
without alpha lipoic acid you don't have to include alpha
lipoic acid in fact that is what andy cutler recommends
he recommends that you only add alpha lipoic acid after
maybe six or 12 months of chelation with simply dmsa
or dmps the idea being that first you want to
detox your other organs and then once you've sufficiently detoxed
the other organs then you can add in the alpha
lipoic acid which is going to work to cross the
blood-brain barrier and detox your brain you sort of want
to leave that one for last because it's like the
most sensitive and that might give you the most problems
if you haven't detoxed other areas of your body yet
so i recommend you buy dr andy cutler's books and
read them to get a deeper understanding of how chelation
works and also the books are great because he outlines
the various dangers and the the things you should not
be doing in this process because there could be certain
things you're doing in the wrong way which are going
to actually harm you chelation is serious business at the
same time it's not very difficult and if you follow
the protocol here it's uh it should be very safe
these protocols have been used on children and adults not
just by some new age quacks but by by medical
researchers and doctors these chemicals like the msa dmps these
have been very well researched specifically for the purposes of
chelating heavy metals usually they're only used when you have
very acute exposure like in heavy industry if somebody gets
exposed you know to a lung full of very toxic
chemicals then they will give them dmsa and dnps to
chelate that stuff out and so these are very well
known chemical chemicals and molecules and they're reasonably safe now
it's very important that you understand that you should not
expect your traditional doctor to support you in this detox
process in fact what i found is that doctors traditional
doctors will gaslight you if you go to a traditional
doctor like your you know general practitioner physician or family
doctor and you tell him that you're going to be
doing this process he's probably going to discourage you from
doing it he's going to tell you oh you don't
need to worry about that that's only for people who
are like involved in heavy industry he's going to ask
you like well were you exposed to a lot of
mercury or lead and you're going to say well not
that i can think of and he could say well
then you don't really need to do it he doesn't
know what he's talking about you have to understand that
the traditional medical industry is very conservative they're extremely conservative
because otherwise they can get sued so the only things
they generally recommend are the things that are like proven
beyond you know a shadow of a doubt uh methods
and protocols that are 50 years old or 100 years
old that's the kind of stuff they recommend they don't
recommend more cutting edge stuff um they're not really looking
at the fringes of science they're also not interested in
optimizing your cognitive performance they're not interested in optimizing your
health they're basically just interested in helping you with like
the most severe conditions that you have and a lot
of these doctors they're just not interested in in the
cutting edge newest protocols and medicines that have you know
been found in the last 10 or 20 years um
they're they're just not really serious about health period a
lot of them are very corrupt a lot of them
will only do things and treatments that are covered by
insurance and your insurance is not going to cover this
um most likely and so um i'm not telling you
to ignore the advice of your doctor obviously take into
account what your doctor tells you but at the same
time don't be stupid and gullible and think that your
doctor is some you know all-knowing health expert he's not
i've had so many doctors that just gave me completely
wrong advice complete horseshit um i could have found better
advice at just looking at articles on the internet honestly
or on a on a [ __ ] forum on
a health forum i could find better advice than i
got from these doctors to whom i paid hundreds of
dollars just for a single appointment um so in general
i'm very disappointed by the quality of of the doctors
here in the united states i don't know how it
is elsewhere i assume it's not that much better in
europe and so really if you're serious about optimizing your
health you're gonna have to take it into your own
hands the doctors we have they're good at treating conditions
that are very well known and very well understood but
they're terrible at treating conditions like thyroid conditions autoimmune conditions
and other subtle conditions that have to do with like
brain fog and chronic fatigue and dark circles under your
eyes and skin conditions they're just they're clueless about treating
these these conditions uh because these conditions have many possible
factors and honestly these doctors are not getting paid enough
money and they don't have enough time to sit down
with you and carefully diagnose for hours you know diagnose
every single problem and possible cause and troubleshoot each one
this takes hours and hours and hours to do they're
not going to do that with you in a 15-minute
appointment so um i recommend you do your own research
uh i am not a doctor and this is not
medical advice uh at the same time you should also
understand that this advice could be better than anything you
hear from your traditional family doctor i find most family
doctors are idiots uh but with that said if you
uh decide to use this protocol and you harm yourself
don't hold me liable i'm not responsible for how you
misuse this protocol you have to do your own research
you have to be very careful about it and only
if you take full responsibility for what you're doing should
you attempt this protocol now you might say but leo
isn't there some natural way to detox heavy metals like
cilantro chlorella spirulina activated charcoal zeolite juicing you know people
talk about celery juice or green smoothies or fasting or
taking saunas what about these natural methods it sounds like
the method you're recommending is a very kind of artificial
chemical method and i want to do some sort of
new aging natural method it sounds like it's going to
be healthier well be careful with that it might not
be healthier because what these various natural methods might do
is first of all they just might not work at
all there's not very good science on any of these
chemicals or any of these natural methods of effectively chelating
lead mercury arsenic and so forth um you know there's
various kind of whisperings and things in various kinds of
like new age health communities alternative medicine communities that some
of these things are effective but there's there's no hard
science with the stuff that i've talked about there's very
good hard science on that um so you just might
be wasting a lot of money in time and not
getting any benefit with these natural methods and um and
also even worse than that is that this cilantro this
chlorella the spirulina activated charcoal what it might be doing
is it might be actually just moving heavy metals around
in your body but not fully effectively chelating them what's
unique about dmsa dmps and alpha lipoic acid is is
that these are very special chemicals which have like this
special double bond that bond very tightly to lead mercury
arsenic and so forth to fully uh excrete them from
the body whereas some of this other stuff like spirulina
chlorella cilantro and whatever else it might partially attach it
might partially move these heavy metals around in your body
but not fully excrete them which can actually make things
worse so be careful in general i consider these natural
methods to be weak sauce and i would not rely
on them i would much rather rely on dmsa and
ala because they're they're proven to work they're proven to
be safe so why why mess with the formula that
has been proven to work and the other problem is
that some of these natural methods they're not going to
cross the blood-brain barrier your cilantro your activated charcoal your
zeolite your celery juice it may not crust across the
blood-brain barrier and it may not detox your brain in
the same way that alpha-lipoic acid will now you might
be wondering where is the proof that dmsa works at
all for example well i'm going to post some links
down below you can go to pubmed or go to
google and search for studies search specifically for something like
you know dmsa mercury and lead detox or chelation search
for these kinds of phrases or if you want to
search for dmps you can search that as well you'll
find various kinds of articles on government websites that are
well researched and sourced which explains to you the effectiveness
of these chemicals and also their safety you could find
studies on children that they've done this with now is
chelation worth doing you might wonder because it seems like
it's a lot of work costs some money and so
forth so should you really be doing it well if
you're very healthy then no it's probably not worth doing
but if you have various kinds of vague and otherwise
untreatable health problems then it's definitely worth looking into if
you have metal fillings or you've been exposed to heavy
metals it's definitely worth doing once you get those middle
fillings out if you have stuff like chronic fatigue brain
fog cognitive performance problems problems focusing add memory problems sleep
problems depression anxiety then i think it's definitely worth trying
out and just feeling it for yourself ultimately the proof
is in the pudding ultimately the proof is not in
the urine tests or in any kind of research studies
the proof is in how it makes you feel if
you do 10 rounds and you feel better about yourself
and your conditions improve then that's the ultimate test that's
the ultimate proof which means that you have to become
your own test subject you have to become your own
guinea pig now will heavy metal talk detox solve all
your health problems no because there exists many other factors
for example there are other toxins that are not covered
by this detox particle there are pesticides there are plastics
there are things called pfes is there are phthalates there
are pcbs there are dioxins all of these are present
in your food and the things you consume in your
water and in your makeup and other things in your
soap in your shampoo in your uh you know contact
lens solution in your shaving cream uh so there are
a lot of toxins in the environment a lot of
toxins in our food that go way beyond just heavy
metals and this protocol i'm talking about here is not
going to rid you of all those toxins some of
those toxins might not have any way to be detoxed
on the other hand maybe there are ways we just
haven't found them yet or i don't know about them
yet i'm always interested in finding new protocols so this
is just one factor another factor of course is that
um your health problems might stem from things like just
poor diet or the fact that you're eating foods that
you have sensitivities and allergies to that you're not even
aware of yet so you're eating the wrong foods you've
got to change your diet that alone can improve many
of your health problems maybe a lack of exercise is
the cause of some of your health problems genetics is
a very huge component to your health problems now the
thing is that it's not that genetics necessarily cause most
health problems is that genetics make you susceptible and then
that opens the door for food sensitivities and other toxins
in your environment coming in there and combining with your
sensitive genetics to create these various kinds of autoimmune disorders
and other kinds of conditions right so it can be
very disempowering to think like oh well you know i
have a thyroid problem because of my genetics it's all
of my bad genetics or i have sleep problems because
of my genetics or i have autism or add because
of my genetics that's not usually the case you should
assume that your genetics are actually pretty good the problem
though is that your genetics can make you susceptible and
sensitive to various kinds of triggers in your environment these
triggers can be food you know genetically modified plants uh
various kinds of pesticides plastics toxins phthalates dioxins heavy metals
pollution god knows what else is out there um and
then it's that combination that causes a lot of these
sort of subtle vague difficult to diagnose health problems of
course also your health problems could be caused by lifestyle
problems it's the way you're living your life maybe you're
a workaholic maybe you're over stressed maybe you're stuck in
a depressing job for a decade and this can all
create health problems and maybe there's even a spiritual component
to your health problems maybe it's the way you're using
your mind maybe it's the kind of weird thought patterns
that you have and you got to retrain some of
that maybe you're constantly overthinking or you're you're anxious and
you're scared or you have depressive thoughts so maybe it
it so you see it's very complicated because there's multiple
layers here there's like the the raw physical chemical layer
you got to get that right which is why we're
talking about heavy metals once you get that right then
there's the next layer of like your diet you got
to get that right which kind of foods are right
for you you know some people can have sensitivities to
to very common types of foods like gluten or wheat
or certain kinds of vegetables certain kinds of meat eggs
shellfish dairy nuts you know whatever uh just because you
don't have an acute allergy where you take a you
know you eat some eggs or you eat some dairy
and you have a you know full-blown you know reaction
to it that doesn't mean your body isn't having sort
of a more subtle autoimmune response to these foods that
you're generally not aware of but that are causing long-term
problems especially if you consume these foods chronically all the
time every day like a lot of people do um
so there's the diet level once you get that sorted
out then there's like the lifestyle level you got to
get your lifestyle sorted out and then there's maybe the
highest level which is sort of like the spiritual level
you got to get that sorted out so a problem
with your health can exist on multiple levels and part
of the challenge here is diagnosing which level it exists
at and one of the mistakes is trying to um
attribute a problem to the wrong layer like you might
think that well i'm depressed because i have a spiritual
problem but is that really true or maybe you're depressed
because you have a chemical problem because the water you're
drinking is filled with lead because there's lead pipes where
you live you see and so you might be trying
to solve that problem by like meditating a lot but
no amount of meditation is going to fix that for
you because the problem exists at a lower deeper level
than you thought it it did on the other hand
i mean it can work in the reverse way too
you might think that the problem is heavy metal toxicity
and it's chemical but really it's not chemical maybe the
problem is just that you're you're sensitive to certain kinds
of foods that you shouldn't be eating that you should
eliminate from your diet but you just keep eating them
because your culture tells you it's okay and because you
know they serve you pizza at work so you just
eat pizza all the time and uh but maybe you're
you know you're sensitive to gluten in the pizza or
to the cheese dairy or whatever else so all this
takes a lot of experimentation to figure it out for
you and it's different for different people so you can't
just read a book and i can't just tell you
what the solution is because every solution is going to
be custom tailored to each person and so this takes
many hours of research and experimentation to figure this out
now let me give you some preventative measures if you're
going to be detoxing yourself and taking heavy metals seriously
you got to take some preventative measures to prevent yourself
from getting re-toxified once you finish detoxing and really once
you finish detoxing remember there's always trace amounts of mercury
and lead and so forth in all the foods you
eat and all the water you drink even if it's
healthy and you know as clean as possible there's still
going to be trace amounts and over 10 20 years
it's going to add up again so you want to
be doing these rounds of detox you know every couple
of years you want to be detoxing a little bit
to to keep yourself clean because it all adds up
you're breathing in pollution from the street outside from the
cars that you know from the gas station when you're
pumping fuel you know those gas fumes are entering into
your lungs and who knows what's in those gas fumes
or the exhaust from the giant 18 wheelers that are
driving around on the streets let's go all going into
your lungs imagine 10 20 years of sniffing those fumes
inhaling those fumes what that does to you so here
are some preventative measures never again drink tap water only
the purest reverse osmosis water this is huge if you're
drinking your city's tap water trusting that it's free of
the mercury lead and arsenic and so forth you're you're
a [ __ ] fool stop eating seafood and organ
meat seafood contains a lot of mercury and organ meat
god knows what's in that organ meat if you're eating
liver and things like this even if you're eating organic
liver from grass-fed cows or whatever you have no idea
the kind of water that these cows receive even if
it's organic cows grass-fed cows they still probably get you
know toxic [ __ ] cheap ass water they're not
drinking pure spring water they're drinking some sort of industrial
sludge that you know saves pennies on the gallon for
the companies for the farmers and you know they don't
care about your health so and then you're eating that
organ meat you're eating that liver that that liver collects
and stores all the toxins in the in the cow's
body and you know and so forth with other organ
meats be very careful with supplements spices protein powders teas
and really any kind of powders especially protein powders i've
read some very scary research where they actually took some
of the most popular brands of protein powders not just
whey powders but also vegan powders vegetable powders all organic
and what they found is that the organic powders have
even more heavy metals than the inorganic ones so just
because it says all natural vegan organic does not mean
it doesn't have heavy metals in it don't be a
fool this is just marketing talk there's also been a
recent research on spices certain spices are very contaminated with
heavy metals i'll be actually posting on my blog over
the next week on my blog i'll be posting an
article about the worst most toxic spices be careful about
that that's a hidden source of heavy metal exposure supplements
a lot of supplements have also been found to be
contaminated with heavy metals so don't take supplements that you
don't really need only take the most essential supplements and
be very careful about the brands try to find the
most trusted brands in general be suspicious of any kind
of powders that you're consuming on a daily basis those
powders when you when you powder down a food and
you concentrate it like you do with a protein powder
right with the protein powder you're basically taking like uh
five gallons of milk and you're condensing it all down
to like a little cup of whey protein powder think
about that concentration process how it distills and concentrates all
the heavy metals because those are not getting evaporated and
the same thing if you're talking about vegetables you know
you take 10 pounds of of kale and spinach and
other stuff and then you you grind it all down
into a cup of powder think of all the pesticides
they all get concentrated in that little cup and then
you consume that every single day in your smoothie you're
basically poisoning yourself every day thinking that you're being healthy
when you actually aren't also be very careful with store-bought
bone broths bone broths are sort of like a hip
trendy health trend i guess you could say these days
they're supposed to be very healthy and so forth these
bone broths because they also concentrate you know you're taking
a bunch of meat boiling it all down some vegetables
boiling it all down to a single cup and then
all the heavy metals are getting concentrated in there and
then you're drinking that on a daily basis thinking it's
healthy for you when you're just poisoning yourself baby food
has been notoriously found to be filled with heavy metals
and this is especially egregious and bad because for babies
with developing brains this is much much worse than for
adults and and by the way if you have children
you should be taking this episode extra seriously if you
care about the health and cognitive performance of your children
a lot of children i think develop add autism and
other sorts of you know learning disabilities and disorders because
a lot of the the food the baby food and
other sort of packaged food that is given to kids
this is the most atrocious low quality literally poisonous food
that you could imagine so be be very careful about
this and even with your pets if you have a
dog or a cat that you love and you're feeding
it the cheapest kinds of cat and dog food which
is definitely contaminated with the worst kinds of heavy metals
it's going to add up and kill your [ __
] cat or your dog especially because they're so they're
so small compared to humans that that affects them even
more than it does humans so be extra careful there
if you want to know what the worst spices are
the most contaminated spices that it's been recently found is
oregano and thyme stop using those they are filled with
heavy metals even the organic versions of those spices remember
that organic and all natural does not mean it's free
of heavy metals it also does not mean it's free
of pesticides organic food is filled with organic pesticides and
organic pesticide is not good for you in many cases
people people overlook this because they get just brainwashed with
this sort of marketing and branding a lot of so-called
organic and natural products a lot of the vegan products
a lot of the products that look like they're you
know very healthy products that you buy at the health
food store when you do testing on it it's found
that that product contains even more heavy metals than just
your normal supermarket product so there's no guarantee that just
because you're eating something organic or very expensive or all
natural or from a health food store that is not
contaminated it's not horrible for you be careful also with
makeup makeup can notoriously have lead and mercury and other
heavy metals in it that can get absorbed through your
skin if you're using a lot of makeup for you
ladies um be careful with the toxic fumes solvents chemicals
and paints like maybe you're using glue around your house
some sort of like epoxy that has fume toxic fumes
coming out of it maybe you're doing some work around
your house using chemicals cleaners bleaches uh various kinds of
paints you know especially doing a lot of like housing
work construction work be careful uh breathing in those fumes
when you're considering your living situation don't rent apartments and
don't buy a house near any major highways there's research
that basically says that if you live within a mile
of a major highway that this increases your risk of
cancer and other kinds of health problems just simply from
the pollution that comes from that highway so try to
live at least a mile away from any major highway
be careful with ammunition and gun ranges if you are
someone who likes to go shooting at a shooting range
and you're using lead ammunition every time you fire that
lead ammunition that lead gets vaporized small particles of that
bullet gets vaporized and then you're breathing that in and
everybody around you standing there firing they're also breathing it
in and causing a giant smog invisible smog cloud of
vaporized lead pretty disgusting so what do you do well
either stop going to the gun range or at the
very least you can find gun ranges actually there's a
gun range in vegas here which is completely lead free
they force you to use lead-free ammunition and i recommend
you purchase lead-free ammunition it costs more money but you
can find ammunition that's coded in copper or i'm i'm
not that familiar with the different kinds there are but
there are lead-free ammos that you can purchase so definitely
go with that and make sure that you remove all
fluorescent lighting from your house or from your place of
work because the fluorescent lighting if it breaks it's filled
with toxic fumes and heavy metals and it's a it's
a giant pain in the ass to clean that up
it's very toxic uh nowadays it's very easy and cheap
to to purchase led lights they last for a decade
they're super energy efficient there's no need to be purchasing
fluorescent lights at all in fact i think they should
be banned because they're so toxic and recycling them is
a big pain in the ass you can't just throw
fluorescent lighting into you know a garbage can so let's
talk about the cost of chelation you might be wondering
leo what's all this going to cost me well i
can give you a very precise estimate so dr andy
cutler's book costs 50 you can purchase it on amazon
the urine test like i said costs 110 a piece
you'll probably be doing half a dozen of those so
that's like six or seven hundred dollars in urine tests
a bottle of dmsa costs about thirty five dollars a
dollar a bottle of dmps costs about seventy dollars but
you need less of it remember than dmsa um just
volume and weight-wise a bottle of alpha-lipoic acid is very
cheap about 15 the other miscellaneous supplements and vitamins that
i recommend are going to be about 50 so here's
how this works one round of dmsa at 200 milligrams
per round um you know i mean a dose every
every three hours this is gonna cost you about um
it's gonna be about 35 dollars plus 10. so about
45 so basically to do a single three to four
day round of dmsa in total that's going to cost
you about forty five dollars ten rounds of that will
cost you four hundred fifty dollars twenty rounds nine hundred
dollars and thirty rounds one thousand three hundred and fifty
dollars so you're looking at about a let's say a
thousand dollar investment here to do maybe 15 rounds 15
to 20 rounds will cost you about a thousand dollars
including the urine tests and supplements and dmsa and all
that about a thousand dollars and within those 15 rounds
you should get a sense of whether this is helping
you and whether you want to continue doing it now
is it worth that i would say given the improvements
that i've experienced personally is it's totally worth that it
would be worth ten thousand dollars it would be worth
maybe even a hundred thousand dollars given the improvements that
i've personally experienced but you know that's just me one
anecdote um i have no way of telling uh well
it'll be worth it for you but i mean even
if you can improve your cognitive performance by 10 let's
say and or if you can improve your sleeping maybe
cut an hour off your sleep uh every day or
if you can you know stop your hair loss or
you know get rid of some of your acne problems
or maybe increase your memory by 20 percent any of
these basically would easily be worth thousands of dollars if
you can get any of these benefits um and also
not to mention of course uh i think you know
we have we have an epidemic of cancer happening around
the world and scientists still don't really have a good
handle on what causes these various cancers i think a
factors i'm not saying the only factor but i think
a factor is is these various toxins and heavy metals
honestly when they build up over 10 20 30 40
years could that result in cancer of course of course
it could um obviously it could um it's not a
you know one-to-one correlation but it's a factor and so
i think i think that honestly plenty of people just
die prematurely needlessly prematurely or get horrible cancers that then
they have to go spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
in chemotherapy to treat you know see experts and doctors
and go through whole ordeals just to cure that cancer
when you know if they just did some of this
chelation when they were younger they could have eliminated that
you know that horrible ordeal so you can treat this
as a sort of a long-term investment into your health
now if you're a parent you might be wondering leo
you know my kid has autism will heavy metal detox
cure my child's autism the answer is it's complicated and
that maybe it can help but there are no guarantees
uh with that said it's worth a try you don't
really lose very much you can do chelation on children
just follow the protocol and it'll work on children as
well as adults of course you have to adjust dosages
to their weight and all that but i actually have
a doctor i have a really good doctor who has
made his whole career treating children with autism using chelation
using dmsa ala and the andy cutler protocol and he's
had hundreds of successful clients so personally i don't have
a lot of experience in this because i don't have
children i've never treated a child with autism or whatever
and i'm not saying that autism is only caused by
heavy metal toxicity i think there's many factors that contribute
to autism including genetic factors of course it's not it's
not purely environment it's also genetically related as well but
you know it's really the combination of environment plus your
genetics which leads to many of these disorders and so
just based on the anecdotal evidence that i've heard from
my doctor and the success he's had with many of
his clients is that he says that you know 10
20 rounds can um can cure a lot of these
kids or can reduce their symptoms significantly to the point
where they're able to you know to be normal again
same thing with stuff like add we have epidemics of
add and autism right now and if you think about
you know where is this coming from uh one theory
is that well we're just diagnosing kids more we're better
at diagnosing autism that's why there's more of it we're
better at diagnosing add that's why there's more of it
i think there's some truth to that but i don't
think that explains all of it i think that a
lot of it has to do with the with the
toxins that that is present from the you know basically
from the last 100 years of heavy manufacturing and pollution
that has been mostly unregulated all around the world um
and also the horrible practices that are happening within the
food industry food food is filled with toxins the food
you get at fast food places a lot of children's
food junk food snack food candy you know pizza potato
chips burgers the kind of food they serve at school
to children all this stuff i mean it's it's basically
poison we're poisoning our children and we're acting as though
nothing is wrong and then we're acting surprised like why
is there all this autism and add and learning disorders
and problems focusing and then you know kids being juvenile
delinquents and being aggressive and becoming school shooters and being
depressed and being suicidal a lot of it is simply
the horrible food practices that we have and the toxins
in the water in the food in the environment pollution
all of it it all adds up it's you know
small things they add up especially over 10 20 years
it adds up and it even begins in the womb
most mothers are completely clueless about these things and they
consume horrible food filled with toxins which of course starts
to affect and ruin the development of the child's brain
while the child is still inside the mother and so
many children start off life already at a disadvantage right
from the very beginning and they're never ever going to
overcome that no matter how much they meditate or do
self-help or some of these other things or how many
doctors they go to on the other hand your body
is also very resilient so don't feel like you're a
victim and that if you had some sort of you
know a bad childhood or you know bad food that
you ate for a long time you know i horrible
food for the first 20 years of my life i
used to be overweight i i ate the worst food
my family didn't care about health and nutrition at all
and and really i'm paying consequences for that now as
an adult i think um and one of the things
that that's made me much more you know um careful
about what i eat these days precisely because i felt
some of the horrible consequences of it but don't don't
don't get stuck thinking that you know you're a hopeless
cause be positive stay positive try some of these protocols
and keep troubleshooting it is possible for your body to
recover from the damage that's been done over the years
your body can be incredibly uh resilient and it has
the capacity to heal itself the biggest thing is just
you know reform your lifestyle so that you stop consuming
these toxins and these poisons that's the number one thing
is even before you start chelating and detoxing just stop
poisoning yourself to begin with so just to reiterate heavy
metal detox is safe for children but again that responsibility
is on you it's only safe if you do it
properly if you do it improperly it's not safe i'm
going to post a study specifically about children this study
is from pubmed it's called safety and efficacy of oral
dmsa therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders that's the
full title of the study i'll post a link down
below if you're interested in that now you might be
wondering leah where do i purchase dmsa and dmps i
looked on amazon and it's not sold there how come
well because even though you don't technically need a prescription
for dmsa or dmps in the u.s i believe the
fda has sort of cracked down on selling this supplement
and so you can still purchase it without a prescription
but you have to purchase it from overseas so i've
purchased dmsa and the mps from canada i've purchased it
from south africa you can order it from the uk
and maybe from europe so you can find various kinds
of websites that are available or you can go to
a doctor and get a prescription for it and get
it at your local pharmacy i'm not sure what the
regulations are in europe i assume that it's probably is
more easily available in europe than it is in america
actually there's a website that i like to use to
get my dmsa it's called livingsupplements.com they ship from south
africa it takes a while to arrive it takes about
a month to get your shipment in the u.s but
they have very high quality dmsa and dmps that i've
used and that i can vouch for and i have
no affiliate relationship with them i get no sponsorship i
get no money from any supplement company when i talk
about these various websites or brands if i'm showing you
a brand of a certain supplement that i use that's
only because that's the specific supplement that i use it's
not because anybody is paying me to to show you
these supplements where do you buy alpha lipoic acid this
is available in any supplement store you can buy it
on amazon very cheaply and easily or wherever you get
your supplements that one is easy in conclusion heavy metal
detox is not a magic cure for all disorders we
should be clear about that it's just one tool in
your toolbox it's one thing to troubleshoot and to try
and to see if it works and if it doesn't
work for you keep on troubleshooting and trying other solutions
with the hope that you can get to the bottom
of your health problem heavy metal detox is not particularly
difficult but it does require some research you have to
know what you're doing if you understand this process you
have to understand the dangers and it does require a
serious long-term commitment this is not something you do for
a week or for a month this is something you're
going to be doing for the next couple of years
it's not going to take you that much time once
you know how to do it it's actually very easy
to do but setting it all up and figuring it
all out that does take some time and then you
have to be consistent about you have to do it
on a weekly or bi-weekly basis and you have to
do that consistently for months and months and months to
get to you know 20 rounds 30 rounds 50 rounds
of chelation and that's where you should really start to
feel the full potential of this protocol so that means
you have to have a long-term vision of why you're
doing this you have to treat this as an investment
in yourself it's going to be a financial investment it's
going to be a time investment it's going to be
investment of your emotional labor and so forth um you
know a lot of times i just sort of forgot
to do it like for the last few months i
should have been doing chelation but i just sort of
forgot because i was busy with life and you know
i didn't want to wake up every every in the
middle of the night you know taking my pills all
the time so you do have to kind of force
yourself into it but you know lately i kind of
re-remembered i'm like oh yeah i forgot i should be
doing my chelation because it's going to improve my health
long term and my performance long term and also the
reason i stopped is because some of the rounds i
did recently they gave me some negative side effects and
i'm like i don't know if i want to experience
those side effects for the next week or two and
you know so if you're experiencing negative side effects remember
that that's actually a sign that it's working you're detoxing
something so especially if you're experiencing negative side effects you
have to you have to persist and continue if you're
having serious negative side effects lower your dose and then
tell yourself okay that means that this is actually a
good sign it's not bad it's good this means that
i can i have toxicity if i do 30 rounds
of this protocol i can slowly rid myself of all
this in a safe manner and then that should give
me increased health and increased performance one warning that i
want to give you is that it is possible for
you to destroy your life if you take very large
quantities of ala or dmsa and you're also very toxic
there's actually one case that of a guy i found
who was doing this chelation this example was posted on
my forum um the guy actually shot a video where
for some reason he was doing this chelation process and
he ingested he was like trying to i don't know
he was like making his own supplement pills i think
with alpha lipoic acid and he got like this very
concentrated giant bag of this alpha light book acid powder
and he was like somehow mixing it up in a
blender or something like that i forget exactly the details
of it and he got like a giant uh something
happened with the blender like it slipped it broke and
this giant like cloud of alpha light bulk acid just
like blasted him in the face and he absorbed it
in his lungs and so he just got like a
super massive dose of alpha lipoic acid accidentally and he
also happened to be very toxic with heavy metals and
so what this did is it sort of like just
dumped a bunch of um heavy metal like redistributed in
his body in some sort of weird way to the
point where all of his symptoms became very much worse
and he entered such a deep state of like depression
and mental fog and insomnia and so forth that he
was like unable to sleep unable to function eventually he
he killed himself but before he killed himself he recorded
a video explaining the dangers and of what happened to
him exactly and why he killed himself so um he
put it out there just to warn you guys that
you know be careful about how you're doing this now
with that said you know that was some sort of
very rare situation you're not going to encounter this if
you're just taking pills of alpha lipoic acid he took
like a super super super mega dose that you would
never take under any normal circumstances but you do have
to be careful um now you might say but but
leo i went to my doctor and my doctor told
me i don't need any of this heavy metal detox
stuff yeah a traditional doctor will probably tell you that
i've had a lot of doctors tell me that i've
actually literally taken my test results i've taken my test
results and i've shown it to doctors and they just
look at it and then they just hand wave it
and say oh well that you know that elevated mercury
yeah it's still within it's it's within a reasonable range
it's not a big deal don't worry about it that's
what doctor have told me and then when i did
the chelation my symptoms improved my my weird nerve tingling
improved my my my sleep problems improved my cognitive performance
improved and then you know good luck going and convincing
a doctor that the chelation did that the doctor's not
going to believe you a lot of these doctors just
[ __ ] stupid right they're they're deeply uh they're
deeply stuck in a sort of a conservative medical um
capitalism like echo chamber a lot of these doctors are
very corrupt because they're dealing with insurance companies all the
time and the only things that they research or care
about are the things that insurance is willing to pay
for because most patients are not going to pay out
of pocket a thousand dollars to do you know 20
rounds of heavy metal chelation so just keep that in
mind on the other hand this is not medical advice
either right so i'm not your doctor figure out for
yourself what's right for you again to reiterate i did
not have any sponsorships or financial relationships to companies selling
supplements or heavy metal detox protocols or to dr andy
cutler so i really just wanted to put out this
video because i know that many of you guys who
are trying to do self-actualization work actually will not be
able to achieve it because the base layer the chemical
layer of your entire life your brain your body your
health there are serious problems there and until you fix
those you're not going to really be able to do
the kind of work that i'm talking about with the
rest of my content actualizer content assumes that you have
the foundation of your life the chemistry of your brain
sorted out and if you don't it's not going to
work for you and you're going to be very frustrated
because you'll be like wondering why is some of the
stuff leo not talking about why doesn't it work for
him why does meditation not work for me why does
psychedelics not work for me and so forth and that's
because there are deeper problems that you got to fix
at that very base layer which usually i don't talk
about because i mostly i talk about spirituality and psychology
i don't talk about like chemistry and physics that much
unless i'm talking about maybe psychedelics speaking of psychedelics actually
by the way my trips and my insights and my
consciousness has all skyrocketed uh again this is anecdotal has
all skyrocketed and become much clearer and more powerful and
more stable after this chelation now i don't know if
there's a direct one-to-one correlation uh i suspect that that
it helped me but i can't prove it because the
reality is that i've done probably close to 200 trips
at this point on over 20 different chemicals in psychedelics
um and but what i've noticed is that after the
chelation basically after my brain fog sort of lifted um
my trips just become deeper and more clear and more
lucid um to like scary frightening degrees um and so
if i trip these days like god damn the clarity
and the consciousness in those trips is is just incredible
it's it's indescribable how powerful it is how clear it
is how pristine it is how lucid it is how
conscious it is it's it's incredible uh and so i
think it helped me in that regard as well and
so uh what i want to end on here is
just to underscore that health and mental performance is the
foundation for all self-actualization work and for all spiritual work
if you don't have this sorted out you're not going
to succeed with spirituality and actually and this is what
a lot of gurus and sort of traditional spiritual teachers
don't tell you is that it's impossible to awaken without
a clean brain i think a lot of people are
very toxic because of the kind of junk food that
they've been eating for the last 20 years of their
life and the kind of dirty water and pollution that
they've been consuming breathing in and drinking and so forth
that then they go to like some sort of eckhart
tolle seminar or they go to a vipassana retreat or
maybe they even try to take a psychedelic thinking that
oh well i should be able to get enlightened or
awaken or realize god or some of these other you
know cool things that these spiritual teachers talk about or
that i talk about because i should be able to
experience infinite love and all this sorts of beautiful stuff
right and then you sit there and you try and
you try and you try and you try for for
months and for years and it doesn't work and one
of the reasons it doesn't work and and and you
don't feel happy you feel depressed you feel miserable you
feel anxious and then and then that only worsens the
situation because you're trying so hard at the spiritual work
self-actualization but it's not working you feel unmotivated you feel
lazy you feel depressed you feel anxious your hair is
falling out and you're getting skin rashes and other things
are happening to you um you're stuck in negative thinking
and you're wondering like well why isn't the spirituality stuff
working well maybe it's not working simply because you don't
have the health and the chemical layer figured out your
brain is not clean your brain is toxic when your
brain is toxic you can't even sit in focus for
five minutes and a lot of spiritual teachers won't tell
you this they act as those like oh well just
meditate harder and self-inquire a little bit harder and you'll
figure it out you're just kind of being lazy or
something no maybe you're not just being lazy maybe there's
actually a problem with your brain maybe there's a problem
with your body maybe there's a problem with your hormonal
system maybe there's a problem with these anti-psychedelics remember heavy
metals are like anti-psychedelics they are retarding the massive interconnectedness
that is necessary within your mind and brain in order
to have the highest realizations about the nature of self
other and reality and love and god and so consider
that as a very important factor and finally if you're
interested in the studies that i've been talking about go
to youtube check the description box below and you will
find links to all of that all right good luck
take 100 responsibility for whether you're going to apply this
protocol and i wish you the best of health and
then once you get your health sorted out then come
on back to me and we'll talk about how to
figure out your um self-actualization work and your inner work
your consciousness work and ultimately get you to realize god
and love and all that beautiful stuff you
