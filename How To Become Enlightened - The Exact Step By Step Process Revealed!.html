hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to become enlightened
the exact step-by-step process this is a very advanced video
which is something I have to say right off the
bat if this is your first time hearing about enlightenment
then this video is not for you go watch my
introductory videos first there's a bunch of them that you
should watch this is an advanced video which will guide
you from going from the point of learning about what
enlightenment is and kind of getting curious about it to
actually getting down to the nuts and bolts of what
do you do to become enlightened like practically speaking and
I'm going to try to cut out as much [
__ ] and mysticism as I can from this process
because there's tends to be a lot of it when
you start reading and studying and researching this stuff so
what are we really talking about here with enlightenment let's
refresh our memory well there's an interesting and very peculiar
fact about your awareness and this fact is that you
are not an entity sitting inside your body that is
not who you really are but it sure really seems
like you are an entity that's sitting inside your body
that's how you perceive the world it's been that way
for you since the moment you can remember living life
and your entire life is centered around this idea that
you're an entity at the center of life who's experiencing
it well this turns out to be false it's just
factually false and what your true nature is your true
existential absolute nature is something that's very fascinating and in
fact cannot be communicated through language but we can try
and many people have said many things on this topic
but basically the consensus is that you are everything within
the field of awareness you are the field of awareness
itself and this entire field of awareness is couched in
nothingness and so absolutely you are that nothing this is
like an existential metaphysical nothing now immediately we have some
traps here that we're already starting to get caught in
and this is the trap of taking anything that I
say here as a philosophy taking enlightenment as a philosophy
it is not that this is not philosophy we are
not interested about what you believe or what other people
believe or what I believe or what some scriptures told
you or what some expert told you or what science
told you or what your religion told you none of
that not interested in it here what we're after here
is going underneath the beliefs which is something that you've
never really done in your life before and yet your
mind tells you that you have so you see immediately
we have a very big problem because in just starting
this process already there's many false assumptions within you so
we have to navigate around this there are many traps
here that we have to avoid and I'll be pointing
them out as we go the objective here in this
episode is to get you a process that will allow
you to attain enlightenment fast as fast as humanly possible
when you start studying and researching enlightenment one of the
things that becomes apparent to you is that many people
have been on this journey towards enlightenment for decades 20
40 years and they haven't become enlightened so when you
read about this and you hear about this immediately you
start to say to yourself well I don't want to
be like that so what do I have to do
to make it happen now in a year or two
let's say rather than in 20 years or in 40
years well the last 12 months of my life I've
really spent studying different schools of thinking on enlightenment different
techniques and processes that are available I haven't studied them
all but I've looked at a good number of them
and there's a lot of consensus between them and what
I've done is I try to find the methods that
work the fastest and so the method I'm going to
give you here is going to be a very very
direct method extremely direct and it's very rare that you
hear such direct method so if you want to do
it fast and I'm talking about doing it within 3
to 24 months you can do that if you're really
dedicated and you work hard and you follow the guidelines
that I give you you can do it in 3
to 24 months which might sound like oh man that's
that's still a lot of work yes it's a ton
of work enlightenment is a ton of work but it's
a lot less work than 20 years or 40 years
also in case you're wondering question comes up about meditation
people wonder well is meditation used to attain enlightenment shouldn't
I just be meditating is that going to be sufficient
and the answer is in a nutshell no that's not
sufficient meditation is great for calming the monkey chatter in
the mind it's also possible to use meditation to attain
enlightenment but that process usually takes 20 to 40 years
of everyday meditating for half an hour to an hour
right so it's a process and it works but it's
a very very long-term process which most of you don't
have the patience for I recommend that you do keep
meditating as you do what I call enlightenment work the
process that I show you here but it's not sufficient
it's not direct enough meditation is just the starting point
really to attain enlightenment you need a very very focused
inquiry into your own consciousness and that's what we're going
to describe here I spent the last 12 months working
with enlightened guide and studying lots of other enlightened people
who have come up with different processes and I've been
kind of putting and piecing all of them together to
find the thing that is the quickest and has the
least [ __ ] to it the process is simple
which I'm going to show it's a very very simple
process the difficulty is in the many many traps and
ego deceptions that are going to be happening as you
try to apply this process so I'm going to explain
this process right now and then I'm going to spend
some time talking about the different traps and making some
key distinctions that you're going to need to apply this
process successfully because don't get confused by the simplicity of
it all right there's so much depth here this is
the deepest topic that I've ever discovered in my entire
life is is enlightenment it's the deepest and most challenging
topic that there is I think for the human mind
to grapple with so here's the process and actually there's
some bad news the bad news is that actually there
cannot be a process for becoming enlightened the mind wants
to look for a process but actually enlightenment itself is
not a process it's a state of being it's not
a state just so you understand it's not an emotional
state that's not what I mean when I say a
state of being I mean reality right we're living in
reality there is a reality here are you aware of
it right now so whatever you call reality that entire
thing is you you are it you are reality you're
not a piece of it you're not an observer of
it you're not someone who's inside of it you are
the whole of it so to become enlightened what you
need to do is you need to become reality itself
right now in the present moment as soon as that
happens enlightenment happens but there cannot be a process to
get there because it's already happening every second of your
life you might say that you're being it the problem
is that you're not aware of it so what we
need to do is we need to raise your awareness
to this to a sufficiently high level where you simply
become what you already are but don't know that you
are and how does this actually happen well a very
tricky thing here and this is something that took me
a long time many months to to accept is that
enlightenment happens basically by spontaneous luck you cannot control it
really why not because what is enlightenment enlightenment is the
truth of no self meaning that there is no such
thing as the entity that you personally think and believe
that you are right now listening to me this thing
I'm pointing out right here it's not a real entity
that's a fiction so that being the case and you
wanting to become enlightened can you see the problem here
of you trying to become enlightened there's no one to
become enlightened that is enlightenment is realizing that there's no
one to become enlightened sometimes in the Eastern traditions they
call this passing through the gateless gate very paradoxical the
most paradoxical perhaps thing that you'll discover in life is
this thing here but nevertheless even though there's not really
a process for being you because you already are you
you already are reality she's not aware it so there's
no real process for it you just have to do
it now right this second you have to become it
but how do we actually get you there practically well
there's a little bit of a process here it is
first thing you do is you sit down sit down
in a very quiet place with no distractions get a
timer set the timer for 30 to 60 minutes that's
what I recommend to start with sit upright in a
meditative like posture you don't need to be overly formal
about it but if your back is up right that's
helpful so you don't fall asleep when you're doing this
you want to be as mentally clear and alert as
humanly possible so ideally don't do this before not before
but after a meal for example or right before bed
because you're gonna be sleepy or tired your mind's not
going to be able to focus we need your mind
to focus like it's never focused before in its life
so here's what you do you're sitting right you're all
prepared your timer is rolling now what you do is
you can close your eyes if you'd like or you
can keep them open if you like both methods work
and then what you do is you go inside so
to speak inside your awareness and you look and you
try to get an accurate real-time present sense of what
you believe you really are so one thing you notice
if you start meditating is that there's like a sense
inside of you of you like when I say hey
you over there you I'm pointing at you you are
registering that and you're saying in your mind something like
oh he's talking to me oh that's right meaning me
I that's what you is pointing to okay so that's
we're talking about that sense now what you need to
do is you need to get up real time in
the present moment sense of that because that sense is
shifting around this moving maybe it's an idea in your
mind maybe it's an image maybe it's a sound maybe
it's a label maybe it's the word eye maybe it's
the word me maybe it's you or whatever maybe it's
your name so you get an accurate sense of that
right now in the present moment and this is very
different than just a belief about you or something that
you've been told like oh well you know my uh
my science teacher in sixth grade told me that I'm
the brain and that my consciousness is coming out of
neurons firing in the brain no that's a story that
someone told you forget about that you need to focus
on what's going on right now in the present moment
because reality is happening right now in the present moment
reality is not back in sixth grade science class that
happened 20 years ago forget about that right now who
do you think you are who do you feel you
are the most honestly like honestly who do you feel
you are because you have a very firm sense of
yourself because if I tell you that you aren't real
what happens in your awareness is that immediately you jump
to the fact that no wait a minute Leo I'm
right here so we need to capture that you need
to kind of like latch onto it with your awareness
all right so you get that and then you start
looking around in your awareness what's going on in there
and you try to distill your sense of self to
the most accurate thing you can pinpoint and you try
to be specific about it because here's the problem is
when I start talking about you and pointing to you
and you close your eyes you go in there and
you try to find where is me where's me where
am I is that me is this me who's me
when you start doing that you start to notice that
a lot of the things that you think you are
you actually aren't so the first thing you'll say is
like well I'm the body but then you go in
there and you look and you're like well wait a
minute am I really do I really believe I'm the
body I mean it seems like I believe on the
body but then when I go and look a little
deeper it's like well but you know like the sensations
in my feet I don't really believe that that's me
I mean there's certain stations in the feed and I
believe the feet belong to me okay but it's like
I'm the one who's perceiving the feet I'm the one
that they belong to I'm not actually the feet I'm
the owner of the feet interesting okay I didn't maybe
realize that before okay so then I look deeper and
deeper and deeper and eventually as you keep doing this
and you'll do this over the course of weeks and
months and perhaps years depending on how astute you are
with your awareness you'll start to see that actually what
you really believe that you are is not a body
or a brain or any other kind of stuff like
that but what you most believe you are is a
perceiver you believe that you are like this point behind
the eyes between the ears back there somewhere on which
all of these sensations here are converging that's what you
really believe but it's not enough that you just hear
me and take me at my word you've to actually
go inside yourself and actually find that but if you
do the work you'll start to see that what I'm
saying is true for you once you get that sense
of oh I'm that spot back there somewhere try to
pinpoint it can see this is where people start to
get very vague and they start to wave their hands
and say oh Willy oh yeah I mean I'm I'm
somewhere back there or you know whatever maybe I'm this
may be I'm not no you have to be very
accurate what actually are you in your present experience as
it's happening right now what are you and you ask
yourself a couple of key questions first question is who
is aware so you're doing this process and then you
ask you have who's aware I'm aware who's aware that
I'm aware who's aware of the eye who's aware of
these words who's aware of these images who's aware really
good question second question is who is perceiving so you'll
notice if you close your eyes and you sit there
that you believe that you're perceiving stuff sound sensations feelings
in the body and so forth well when you're doing
that ask yourself who is perceiving is there actually an
entity in my experience who is perceiving experience and you
sit and you wonder and you look for an answer
and the third question you can ask yourself is Who
am I this is a classic question the problem with
this question is that you know for the first six
months of this work or so this question didn't make
any sense to me I didn't know what the question
was really asking so it takes work for you to
even get to the point where you understand what the
question is really asking so you might want to start
with the other two questions but eventually you get to
the question of Who am I and again you close
your eyes or maybe keep them open and you just
look who am I really like really Who am I
and that's the whole process basically and what you're doing
is you're looking for an answer except you're not looking
for a logical answer so the answer to these questions
is not going to be something like oh well I'm
a spot behind the eyes somewhere or I'm the body
you're looking for an experience of your true existential being
what are you metaphysically as an entity right now you
most likely believe that metaphysically what you are is you're
composed of atoms and that you're a body and that
you're a brain and that's what you are maybe you
also believe that you're a spirit or soul of some
kind doesn't matter which both of those things are stories
and just beliefs and both of those are false -
so those are not what your true nature actually is
but it's very difficult for your mind to even open
to the possibility that that could be false so what's
going to happen is that you're looking for the answer
you're trying to become the thing that you actually are
you're trying to become aware of it and becoming aware
of it is not the same thing as thinking or
philosophizing about it that's not what you're supposed to be
doing here if you're philosophizing you've lost it you're off
track what's going to happen is that the voice will
come up for you I call it the voice the
voice is that internal dialogue in your mind that you
identify yourself with so one of the other beliefs you
have is that you are the voice all the thoughts
you think and have you think that those thoughts are
you what's going to happen when you ask yourself Who
am I or who's perceiving or who's aware immediately the
voice will kick in and it'll supply a ready-made logical
answer and it'll say something like well I mean leo
don't be stupid Here I am I'm the body it's
stupid to even think otherwise or a million other variations
on that theme here's the problem is that the voice
is not actually you you're falsely identified with it so
what we need you to do is to actually become
aware of that fact so when the voice kicks in
what I want you to do is I want you
to go meta on the voice so the voice will
kick in they'll say something léa léa on me or
something like hey this is it this is here this
is me right here what are you stupid Here I
am the most obvious thing ever I'm me right here
when you get that answer I want you to recognize
that that's an answer of the voice and you need
to ask yourself who is perceiving that answer and what
this does is this takes you up one level this
is called going meta so the voice says I'm the
body you say who's aware of the body the voice
says I am the body and I'm self-aware and you
ask yourself again who's aware of that answer and the
voiceless runnable I of course I am and you'll say
well who's aware of that whose proceeding that and you're
going to play this game what it is actually is
that it's the voice talking to itself it's AB it's
absurd what you're doing really because there's not a you
and a voice you are the voice but that's all
false that's all the illusion but you need to get
a direct experience of this right so you're going to
be sitting down on a daily basis and you're gonna
be practicing this what I'm telling you ask yourself these
questions and you're going to be carefully looking and you're
not going to be thinking or philosophizing but you're going
to be very carefully observing just objectively observing what's going
on in there and what you need to do as
you're doing this you need to keep a very open
mind the problem here is that you need to open
your mind to the fact that you actually don't know
who you are and this is very hard to do
because you believe so firmly that you do know who
you are your entire life is predicated on the fact
that you know exactly who you are but actually the
fact is that you have no idea who you really
are and it's not going to be possible for you
to even practice this work towards moving towards enlightenment until
you open your mind to the possibility that you don't
know and this is very hard to do you have
to do it right now in directives you know experience
it's not enough for you just to agree with me
and say yeah Leo uh maybe I don't know not
enough you have to actually not know and there's different
techniques we can use to open up your mind so
one that I really like is this one notice right
now in your direct awareness your conscious right stuff is
happening around you they're sensations you're seeing me you're hearing
me and other things around you you're feeling sensations in
your body right notice that everything that you're perceiving is
arriving at nowhere right now notice this everything that is
being perceived by quote-unquote you think is you you think
you is the point to which this stuff is arriving
to like you think that these sights and sounds are
converging on a point which is you but can you
notice right now that there actually is no point to
which these things arrive at right now do it in
your awareness kind of freaky huh where are these perceptions
coming from and where are they going to who are
they going to you might say well they're going to
the body or the thing inside the body like the
soul but notice that whatever you perceive as the perceptions
going to that that's just another perception can you see
this so whatever you answer as the thing that all
these perceptions are converging towards that's another perception that's not
the perceiver can you see that can you see that
in your awareness there is no perception of the perceiver
if you believe that what you are is a perceiver
which is what you believe then what do you really
know about yourself because everything you perceive is not the
perceiver and is not actually you so then who are
you what are you are you saying that your a
perception no you probably don't want to say that you
probably want insist that you're the perceiver but all you
have are options do you see this do you see
that there is no perception of a perceiver any perception
of a perceiver is a perception not the perceiver good
if you need time pause and actually do do this
in real time for yourself right now it doesn't help
to believe me it doesn't help to agree with me
in fact it hurts you're not going to become enlightened
that way so this process this little technique here is
designed to create genuine wonder within you like oh maybe
there's something awry here like I've been walking around and
living and breathing and thinking that I got this [
__ ] handled but maybe there's like a glitch in
the matrix and I just saw it and now my
mind is open just a little crack is open in
the mind now you can actually run the process and
now you have a chance of actually progressing in this
work see how tricky this is if you just sit
there with a closed mind and you ask yourself these
questions you could sit for 50 years and you'll get
nowhere so you got to open your mind and as
you do that your mind opens and then you look
inside and try to be aware of okay Who am
I who's perceiving and you look for evidence of the
perceiver you need to find that evidence in your direct
experience what do the raw facts of the situation show
right now forget about what people have told you doesn't
matter forget everything about everything that I told you forget
about that too you have to ground this in your
direct experience and as you're doing all this a very
important point is that you have to intend to become
your true self there needs to be an intention here
to actually make a quantum leap because right now you
think you're a perceiver which is actually not what you
are you are being itself you are reality being itself
but it doesn't help for you to to know that
or to believe it that doesn't help in fact it
hurts so the reason I tell you this is that
I want you to understand that you need to make
a quantum leap between where you are now and where
you're going to be to become enlightened so this is
the leap from thinking that you're a perceiver of reality
to becoming all of reality itself can you see the
quantum leap there this is like two whole [ __
] worlds apart so to do this basically have to
sit there you have it you have to have it
up like a steel determination to make the quantum leap
happen like you have to like you have to want
really [ __ ] bad like you have to really
want with every fiber of your being to make that
jump if you lose that intent you're not doing the
process and you'll get nowhere and it's very easy to
lose intent because what'll happen is that your mind will
wander so in this process basically you're focusing in on
the most real sense of you and then you're really
opening up and you're wandering and you're asking yourself this
question let's say you know who's perceiving or who's aware
and you're kind of intending to make that quantum leap
and what will happen is that your mind will wander
off your sense of you and they'll start thinking about
lunch it'll start thinking about how stupid this whole thing
is you'll start thinking about your car and your email
and tomorrow night and your girlfriend and your boyfriend all
this stuff your mind will wander around and the hardest
part of this entire process I found for me is
refocusing your mind always back to the subject and the
subject is always you so what is your most real
sense of you you have to refocus on that over
and over and over again every second of your sitting
if you're sitting there for 30 to 60 minutes you
have to keep refocusing and you have to notice when
you've won it off and then bring yourself back this
is the hardest thing you're going to fail thousands of
times at this you're going to get lost in stories
and ideas and fantasies and you're gonna fall asleep and
this and this and that and every time you do
that you're getting nowhere you need to have a direct
experience of who you really think you are and then
you need to ask questions of that to become aware
of who you really are and every time your mind
supplies a ready-made logical answer you need to remind yourself
that this is the voice and that the voice is
simply sounds and images and that sounds and images are
not actually you you don't believe that now anyways you
believe that you're the perceiver of sounds and images so
again who are you if you're not a sound or
an image that's the process there's a lot of subtlety
and nuance in this process and there's a lot of
places you can go wrong which I've already underlined for
you a little bit but it's going to be worth
it for you to go back to this part of
the video and rewatch it dozens of times as you're
practicing this on a daily basis because there's a lot
that I said that you're going to miss on first
or second or even third hearings you're going to need
to build up awareness before you really understand what I'm
talking about here okay so how do you practice this
you go and you do this on a daily basis
I recommend doing 30 or 60 minutes of this every
single day like clockwork like a meditation habit except this
is much more focused than meditation I like to call
this process looking which actually brings me to two very
important distinctions that you need to make in your awareness
if you're going to use this process successfully and the
first distinction is the distinction between thinking versus looking the
thing that you're very familiar with is thinking you're real
good at that in fact you're so good at it
that you think that thinking is all that there is
well there's also perceptions for you so you think that
what the world consists in is perceptions and then thoughts
and you think that your way of interacting with the
world is basically by thinking about it and seeing it
and perceiving it but there's also another thing which is
awareness and the distinction between thinking versus looking is the
distinction between thinking and applying awareness pure awareness to a
situation which is observation and when I say looking I'm
not saying with your eyes although you could look with
your eyes but I'm saying like with your awareness with
your consciousness have you ever wondered what thoughts actually are
I mean you think them non-stop thousands of them in
a day maybe ten or more thousand a day but
have you ever stopped and wondered like wait a minute
what the [ __ ] is a thought existentially what
is it I mean is it made of matter out
of energy is it a spiritual thing what is a
thought don't be so quick to think you know it's
a very tricky question you could spend months practicing looking
to find what the answer is and you'll still fail
thoughts are very tricky things here's what you got to
know about thoughts a thought is a sensation so to
speak and it also contains content or what I call
a story how do we best explain this I like
using the movie analogy imagine that you're watching a movie
you're in the theater you're watching a movie and let's
say you see Tom Cruise getting punched in the face
okay so you're watching that now what are you actually
watching are you actually watching Tom Cruise get punched in
the face or are you watching light projected onto a
flat white surface like a wall what is a movie
actually is a movie actually Tom Cruise getting punched in
the face we would say no maybe that happened and
that was filmed but that's not what I'm watching what
I'm watching is light flickering on a wall okay so
if that's true also notice that when you're sitting there
and watching the movie you're completely engrossed in the movie
so much so that you have no idea at all
no consciousness in the moment that this is light flickering
on a screen in fact when Tom Cruise gets punched
in the face what do you do you kinda like
you flinch or you reactor like you gasp or you
laugh or whatever the intended you no emotion is that
the movie wanted you to feel but basically you're totally
absorbed in what I call the content or the story
of the movie and you're not aware of what the
movie actually is and so what happens is that you
literally get sucked in and lost in the fiction very
curious a thought is analogous to this a thought has
both a reality to it and then also it has
the content or the story that sucks you in and
the whole problem with life is that everyone is walking
around in living life completely sucked in to their fictitious
thought stories rather than seeing what's actually going on existentially
inside their mind so I want to demonstrate this for
you right now and I want you to make this
distinction in your direct experience right now so go ahead
and close your eyes and now with your eyes closed
just relax and what I'd like you to do is
keep them closed until I tell you to open them
so they're closed now I'd like you to think of
one million dollars in your bank account you got that
a thought of 1 million dollars in your bank account
now you've got a picture of it or a word
or mental label something like that that's a thought so
keep that thought in your mind keep it alive now
here's question is that reality is there actually a million
dollars in your bank account and of course the answer
is no that's a thought which says there's a million
dollars but there's not really so it's a fiction ok
good so that's you know obvious keep your eyes still
closed keep thinking of that million dollars now the question
that's even more interesting is does the experience of 1
million dollars in your bank account does that have a
reality to it of its own like what is that
it's not actually a million dollars in your bank account
but it is something right you are aware of something
a thought does have substance it has a certain feel
to it a certain sensation certain color a certain sound
or whatever right that's the actual reality of the thought
that's kind of what the thought existentially is so draw
the distinction right now between what a thought actually is
and what is pretending to be with its content you
see how that works this is a very critical distinction
if you're going to try to become enlightened this is
the whole problem of why you're not in line already
do you realize how significant this is this one distinction
this is huge because if you don't make this distinction
very clearly with every one of your thoughts then you're
always lost in fantasies you're always caught it up in
the movie in the drama of the movie you don't
see that the movies just light on a screen what
if who you believe you are this perceiver that we
think you are what if that was a thought and
not reality now what does that mean remember we made
a distinction here so when we say that yes there's
a certain feeling to the thought of you but what
you believe you are is not that feeling what you
believe you are is you believe you're the story that
that feeling portrays so to speak which is a fiction
could that be possible could you as an entity actually
be a fiction interesting very significant very significant distinction so
keep that one in mind because we're going to go
on to the second one second distinction is also extremely
important and this is that reality is only what is
happening right now in the present moment this is a
very powerful distinction what I'm saying here is that if
you don't see it hear it smell it taste it
think it right now like right [ __ ] now
not a minute ago or not what you think is
going to happen tomorrow but like right [ __ ]
now then it's not real it's what it's a story
it's a movie that you've been sucked into that's what
it actually is now this is a bold claim that
I'm making and perhaps you're going to want proof of
this which I'll address here in a second but um
do you realize how significant this is what I'm stating
I mean literally that right now if you're looking at
me and you're watching this and you're listening if your
parents are not in front of you then they are
literally not real if right now you cannot hear feel
smell taste your parents they're not real I'm also saying
that your car unless you're sitting in it or you're
looking at it is not real it does not exist
in consciousness which means it is not a part of
reality it also means that yesterday all the stuff that
happened you yesterday that feels so real that that's not
real either that's a movie that you believe is real
but you're not seeing it for what it really is
which is just some light projected on a screen and
very curiously your brain isn't real can you see your
brain right now can you hear it can you feel
it can you taste it can you smell it what
do you actually have of your brain you have a
movie of it you have a thought of it but
that's it in fact notice that you've never in your
entire life unless you've had open brain surgery with a
mirror looking at your brain you've never seen your brain
so as far as you're concerned the brain is a
fiction these are just some of the ramifications of what
I'm saying so you sort of see how significant this
statement is that only what's happening right now and what
is happening in your senses is real now what's going
to happen is that your voice is going to object
to this the voice it'll come in there and say
well leo hold on hold on a second hold on
a second but you know it's the scientist tells us
this and and science tells us that and then we
got other ideas here and regarde religious ideas here and
I mean what about you are you saying like when
I'm looking out looking at the Sun the Sun doesn't
exist when I turn my head away the things behind
me don't exist anymore what are you saying exactly the
voice will say all this stuff again what's actually happening
there when the voice is talking remember we've already made
this distinction what is real about the voice and what
is the fiction what is the content so notice that
when you start getting sucked into those different what's happening
that you actually you're getting sucked into the content of
thought again so what happens that basically thoughts come up
and then you start to open your mind to some
new possibility and what happens immediately a new thought comes
up and covers that opening and just pummels you as
more content and you just keep getting pummeled with more
and more content as though imagine you're sitting at the
movie and you've been at the movies your entire life
so you can't distinguish between reality and movie so you've
been watching movies chained to your to your chair or
your entire life you grew up that way and then
when someone tells you that wait a minute you're just
watching a movie it's just light on a screen it's
not real and then you start to say oh well
maybe that's possible and your mind opens up a little
bit right and then what happens immediately you get pummeled
with more content right it's not like your mind just
opens now you can see the illusion no the movie
keeps playing and you see some you know scary monster
jump up and run [ __ ] it's a scary
monster it's so real and you forget about the fact
that your mind was just starting to open in your
mind closes back up and that's exactly what's happening all
the time in this enlightenment work is your mind opens
up and then it gets just bombarded with content and
you forget that the content is not real to fiction
so it's an extremely self-propagating illusion here and you need
to have enough awareness to start to see what's going
on so you need to be able to go meta
so when these objections of your voice pop up as
another pointed towards me you know questioning my theory or
whatever you want to call my philosophy then you need
to see what that is you need to apply the
things you learned here otherwise you're going to fall back
asleep and no one can help you with that by
yourself I can't help you with that no I'm not
going to go in here and say that this is
the absolute truth that reality is only what you hear
right now I'm just saying that that's a that's a
principle general guideline that I want you to follow in
this work because if you don't follow this principle you're
going to waste literally hundreds if not thousands of your
hours precious hours running in circles in your mind getting
absolutely nowhere this is how people can take four years
to become enlightened is because they've been running in circles
getting pummeled with content buying into the content not going
meta not seeing what the content actually is in reality
getting sucked in and tricked by their voice that's how
it happens so I really encourage you to take this
distinction of realities only what's happening right now in my
senses and run with it you use that principle until
it breaks it'll break your mind it'll break your sense
of self you can use this one principle to get
to full enlightenment if you just sit there and you
you actually start to sort out what's real from what's
not real by applying this principle you can get to
full enlightenment but that will take a very special dedication
on your part to do that not easy so those
are two distinctions now what I want to do is
I want to wrap up with some tips I want
to give you some tips for avoiding some of the
most common traps that people fall into in this work
and the reason that I know these is probably because
I've fallen into most of them myself many many times
all right so here we go do not take any
idea or framework or belief as the truth and when
I'm talking about truth in this context of enlightenment I
mean like the truth with a capital T I mean
like existential metaphysical truth now science tells us that such
truth is not possible to come by this work is
telling you that it is is it really be open
to the possibility because if you're not open then you
are not doing the process any idea or framework or
belief at all is not absolute truth why not because
it's that movie it's not the reality light shining on
the screen also don't take any instruction as the truth
including my instruction so when I'm here telling you stuff
this is just to make you aware that you're in
the matrix that's all it is it's like me handing
you a little secret note that says hey buddy you're
in the [ __ ] matrix wake the [ __
] up that little note is still in the [
__ ] matrix the note is not you getting outside
the matrix don't make that mistake very deadly mistake everything
I tell you here is not the truth with capital
T it's only value to you is if it helps
you to discover that truth for yourself that truth can
only be discovered by you by no one else also
forget about all scientific explanations they will not help you
here they will hurt you it will slow you down
forget about the Big Bang Theory forget about string theory
forget about quarks and atoms and molecules and chemistry and
evolutionary theory and all this stuff that you've learned forget
about all that doesn't matter I don't care what quantum
mechanics says irrelevant you have no understanding quantum mechanics anyways
also forget about all religious explanations if you're the religious
or spiritual sort drop all that [ __ ] forget
about God forget about the soul forget about spirits forget
about heaven and hell forget about energy forget about love
forget about all that nonsense those are more ideas more
beliefs which are slowing you down also very importantly if
you're like a more advanced student of this work and
you kind of know what enlightenment is and you're like
oh well enlightenment is nothingness and it's everything and I'm
this and I'm that now I've studied so much of
this in lime and stuff I know you're talking about
Leo no you don't unless you're enlightened you really don't
know what you're talking about so forget about nothingness you
think you know what nothingness is you have no [
__ ] idea what it is if you did you
would be in line we wouldn't be having this conversation
by the way I apply all this to myself you
understand this so I'm not here like preaching this at
you as oh like haha I'm better than you no
these are all traps that I fall into every single
day that I struggle with right so I get caught
by all these traps don't think I'm like above you
somewhere I'm not I especially get caught with the trap
of nothingness because I spent so much time learning and
studying enlightenment that now I think I know everything about
enlightenment and I know that actually I don't know anything
about Lineman how's that for some paradox so whatever idea
you have of nothing that you're trying to get yourself
towards stop that that's not nothing else that's slowing you
down that's illusion you need to see that as more
stories more movies the biggest trap here is that people
try to conceptualize enlightenment they try to conceptualize themselves this
is not possible every and any belief or idea that
you have is not the truth with capital T will
not work you cannot think your way into enlightenment nor
can you think your way out of enlightenment but that's
the only way you know how to do enlightenment work
that's the only thing you really recognize as as real
that's the only way you solve problems is trying to
think your way out of them or thinking your way
into something else can't do that here here's an analogy
that I like you're basically like a dog trying to
learn calculus a dog to not learn calculus why not
because it doesn't have the conceptual high conceptual abilities to
conceptualize the different ideas that are necessary to do calculus
it doesn't have that abstract thinking faculty so try as
it might if the dog just keeps doing its dog
stuff like wagging its tail and chasing around and eating
food and scratching its nuts if it keeps doing all
that will it ever learn calculus no it won't analogously
you're like that dog scratching its nuts that's what you're
doing when you're thinking about stuff that's the only thing
you know you can do you don't even know that
there's anything else outside of that you don't even have
a [ __ ] clue that there's some calculus out
there that could be learned so then how do you
advance past this well you have to not think your
way out you can't get yourself to calculus by scratching
more of your nuts that's not going to work you
have to raise awareness you raise awareness mmm by looking
and observing not by thinking that's why we made that
critical distinction between looking and thinking you got to really
hold yourself to that otherwise you're just going to be
scratching your nuts remember that this work takes massive persistence
so when you sit down you're doing this process you're
going to very likely get disheartened many many times and
quit many many times that quit and come back and
this and that is give me a lot of drama
and problems and emotions will come up and you'll have
existential crises and you'll get depressed and angry and pissed
off and jealous and you'll say that a Leo is
stupid and [ __ ] all this enlightenment [ __
] and you'll come up with every scenario in the
book this work takes massive persistence like on a scale
that you have not thought you are capable of as
a human being what's required here of your mind is
extraordinary right you need to sit down and look at
who you really are thousands of times and you will
fail thousands of times guaranteed and you need to be
able to fail thousands of time and still persevere and
every time refine your approach and do it better and
better and better and better and even if you're doing
all perfectly you're still going to fail many many times
and in the end what will happen is that you
will get rewarded with your persistence and if you're doing
everything right then what will happen is at some point
and you can't predict win or why or how what
will happen is there will be a spontaneous awakening this
is enlightenment the spontaneous awakening happens it happens by fluke
luck you break through really you did not use any
process to get there although if you use this process
that I told you your results will be you know
the probability of your results will be greatly increased so
you have this spontaneous awakening and then what happens that
you become actually what you are you're not thinking about
who you are you're not philosophizing you're not theorizing or
believing some theory or whatever you actually are it absolutely
you're not even a perceiver of it because actually there
are no perceivers there just is reality as it exists
there's only being so what happens is that you become
being and this being is not limited or located in
any particular coordinate in space so it's not like you're
sitting behind the brain somewhere actually what happens that the
you that you think is behind the brain there it
expands to everywhere it has no location it can be
anywhere also have you noticed by the way that uh
slots have no location check it out in your awareness
one one time when you sit down thoughts are not
located anywhere so yeah so what will happen is that
you will just become reality and that will be the
alignment and you'll have some good times and will happen
is then you'll fall back asleep and then you'll go
pursue some more enlightenment then you fall back asleep and
then you'll pursue some more enlivens and you'll fall back
asleep but uh you know even if you can crack
that first nut that'll be very very eye-opening for you
it will be life-changing for you it'll be something that
you never imagined it was possible it'll be something that
you literally cannot conceive with your imagination and it'll be
extremely powerful in the ramifications it has on your life
but also at the same time subtle subtle and when
you look back on it you'll um you'll be very
grateful that you did this work because once you break
out of the matrix you never want to go back
in and you're always very grateful for all the work
you did even though as hell all the work you
did to break out it'll be very very worth it
but it's hard for you to conceive right now what
I'm talking about so that's it you will get lost
a lot on this journey so what I recommend is
that you stick around for more of the videos that
I'm going to have coming really this video if you
think this video is long I could keep talking for
another 3 or 4 hours just to help you to
make some more distinctions just right here just with this
little piece of it right here and help you to
understand how to do it right but I want you
to go get some practical experience go apply this right
now in your life do it consistently try to get
consistent habit of it going and then stick around for
future videos because I'm going to be breaking down other
facets of this work different traps are going to be
falling into there's a lot to talk about so a
lot of good stuff coming that I'm really excited about
very advanced topics right even more advanced than this remember
that this is not philosophy this is not philosophy so
stop [ __ ] around stop your objection stop your
excuses you know if you want you can do all
that but that's going to cost you thousands of hours
of time so if you want to play devil's advocate
and you know funny remarks and all this and ha
ha ha um yeah I could go do that but
you're not making any progress if you want to make
real quick progress here and this is something even do
is stop raising all the objections in your mind stop
clinging to all the different beliefs that you have because
every belief you cling to that's not the truth so
in practice what this work really becomes it becomes a
work a process of dismissing a bunch of your beliefs
first before you can actually sit down and do real
enlightenment work I mean I probably spent six if not
ten months just clearing out the [ __ ] in
my mind before I could really get some just five
minutes here or 10 minutes here of like really laser
focused looking awareness of what I could be and I
still haven't cracked it yet right but I've made a
lot of progress what you're going to notice in this
work is that you know when you first start it's
gonna seem like it's so vague and what the [
__ ] is Leo talking about like this is so
stupid it makes no sense what am i doing but
something in you knows that there's nugget of truth here
so you pursue it um and then what happens you
start to have these aha moments where you realize that
oh [ __ ] I've been I've been going down
this trap for a week and I've been going down
that trap for three months and it's like oh [
__ ] um and then you put yourself back on
track and sometimes they'll get disgusted and you'll get depressed
and whatever you'll quit then you'll come back a couple
months later you'll lose a couple months that way but
um you know better than never coming back and so
what happens though also is that you have all these
objections about well but reality should be this way and
you know religion told me that and what about God
and what about the soul you know but science says
this and the Big Bang Theory said that that's that's
dozens of hours right there for each one of those
running around licking your nuts in your mind that's what
you're doing so I encourage you to cut that [
__ ] out if you can and if you can't
then [ __ ] go work through it work through
it it'll take a thousands of hours work through it
it'll be worth it even then even then even if
you're the slowest worst person at this it'll be worth
it very worth it as hard as this is the
value of it is greater to you than the difficulty
and lastly just remember that everything that you have been
told here is not the truth all right I'm done

I continue forward with actualize that org we're going to
be covering more and more very nuanced very deep very
advanced topics so in order for you even to start
to understand those you need to start to do some
