hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to be a
man part to the advanced version I've addressed this topic
in the past of how to be a man several
years ago I released an episode that was quite popular
and there what I basically told you was how to
embody your masculinity talked about how masculinity works how it
contrasts with femininity and then what practical steps you can
take to go up your masculinity and that might involve
going having sex with girls getting into relationships and other
things like that that can be some useful advice and
it still applies to many guys but I want to
give you a deeper more advanced understanding of what it
means to really be a man especially if you've already
experimented with the advice I gave you in the previous
episode and the insight that I'm going to give you
here is going to be very simple but it's also
going to be very counterintuitive here's the whole insight it
could be said in like one sentence very very simple
the key insight is if you want to be more
of a man be more of a woman if you
want to be more of a man be more of
a woman what leo what what does that mean how
is that going to make me more of a man
no Leah what I want is I want to be
alpha teach me how to be alpha so that I
can get all the girls and I could be super
macho and I could be super confident and stoic and
nothing can touch me I want to be untouchable that
untouchable Arnold Schwarzenegger character make me like that but you
see that's your problem right there that's actually why you're
struggling to be an authentic man is because that stereotype
is a caricature of what it means to be a
man that is not it means to be a man
and for many men that's completely inauthentic and actually counter-intuitively
what it does when you try to do that when
you have this desire to be alpha it actually makes
you beta you see very counterintuitive when you're trying so
hard to be alpha and to be macho and that's
your ideal image of who you're supposed to be but
that's not actually real for you then you become very
ungrounded and what I want to show you is I
want to show you that it's actually possible to be
feminine but to still really be a man and to
be highly attractive to women and in fact this is
a very powerful technique that you can use to embody
your full masculinity the full spectrum of masculinity masculinity is
not about becoming hyper macho alpha guy who goes to
the gym and bench presses 300 pounds that's for kids
that's a juvenile notion of what it means to be
a man but first what we have to do is
we have to challenge this alpha stereotype what is the
Alpha stereotype well in our culture in Western culture I'm
not really sure how it is in Eastern cultures but
in the West here in America and probably in Europe
what you've got is this idea this Hollywood idea of
like being the big muscular guy the tall and handsome
guy the guy with the deep voice and the big
dick and the big balls and you're filled with testosterone
and you're like this bro or this dude and you're
very extroverted and gregarious and you've got charisma flowing out
of every orifice of your body and you've got the
cool sports car and you're always kind of nonchalant and
you're icy and stoic you're unemotional nothing fazes you you're
always confident and decisive you never hesitate you're very popular
with everybody your friends your co-workers they all love you
and you're well-dressed you're like the perfect package you're charming
girls swoon over you and you're like the playboy who
bangs a bunch of girls because they're constantly throwing themselves
at you this is probably like the image that a
lot of men these days have of being a man
so when I say how to be a man you
might be thinking oh yeah Leo tell me the techniques
to become that guy that you just explained that sounds
awesome I want to be like that guy and in
your mind you have all these iconic images of like
the James Bond character who tends to be this way
or the Arnold Schwarzenegger character or the Vin Diesel character
the Brad Pitt character maybe the George Clooney character something
like that and you think back to high school and
you think back to college and you remember though athlete
jocks who got all the girls and who were at
the top of the high school or college hierarchy and
you want to be like that but what you never
do is you never really question whether that's authentic to
you and what this whole thing is this image of
becoming this hyper macho guy what you need to realize
is you need to realize that this is a silly
cultural norm and that really you've been brainwashed since being
a kid with this kind of thinking and so one
of the hardest things I think for modern guys to
do is to let go of that to actually have
the courage to let go of that and develop an
authentic identity in other words to be your self be
yourself to the max and being yourself holds the danger
that your authentic self is not going to be in
line with this constructed ideal that you have of what
it is like to be a macho guy most guys
are not macho guys most guys are not the Arnold
Schwartz or the James Bond sz's or the Brad Pitt's
or the Vin Diesel's and that's okay the inner work
that you need to do is to actually accept that
can you accept that or are you going to accept
that but then secretly in the back of your mind
everything like yeah well yeah Leo you're probably right I
know I'm not a macho guy but damn you know
I mean I really want to be the macho guy
I feel inferior well that's not what I'm telling you
to do what I'm telling to do is to let
go of that I deal so much that you make
whatever you are into having that kind of high value
that right now you place on the macho guy so
that when you're around a macho guy you don't feel
inferior but actually you feel superior not an egotistical son
superior but just superior in the sense that you know
that you're you and you know that that's the best
you can be is to be you whatever you are
is what you should be and it's what you love
to be you see that's the deeper thing that's going
on here that's what it really means to be a
man being a man doesn't mean being hyper macho or
being nonchalant and stoic actually what it means is it
means being fully yourself and not selling out to anybody
else's opinions and in this case what you're doing is
you're dishonouring that because you're selling yourself out to this
ideal that Hollywood has presented to you and all you
need to do is to let go of that but
see that's easier said than done because is really ingrained
in you how do you do it well first you
start questioning the cultural norms and then you apply this
technique that I'm going to give you which means here's
the how to the - is that you own and
you accentuate your feminine qualities exactly the thing that you're
running away from now you turn and you face it
and you embrace it and you actually embody it more
fully here's the logic behind this is that it actually
takes courage a lot of courage to be authentic to
successfully be authentic and to successfully embody the feminine qualities
actually takes more growth from you than to act hyper
macho because acting hyper macho that's fake and admitting and
accepting the feminine qualities in you that's actually what's real
that's what's true but see a lot of guys who
are focused on becoming stronger guys they forget about the
feminine qualities and they tend to wanna forget that they
even exist and they swing their pendulum all the way
to the masculine side and they say hi I'm gonna
I'm gonna like go to the gym a lot and
I'm gonna take muscle supplements and I'm gonna I'm gonna
do all the stuff that the Arnold Schwarzenegger guys do
but that's actually done out of a sense of fear
and inauthenticity you see now I mean there's nothing wrong
with that if you're naturally pulled to be a normal
torturing your character go yeah go do that if that's
authentic to you but that's not most guys and chances
are that if you are that way then you wouldn't
be coming to me for advice on how to be
a stronger man and you know what funny enough even
if you are the Arnold's forcing your character you might
actually also be denying your feminine qualities see maybe you'd
be denying it from birth because of the way you
were told you know you're told like men shouldn't cry
and men shouldn't have strong emotions and men be too
nice and they shouldn't be too romantic in this kind
of stuff so here's the technique that I want to
give you and this is actually a great technique if
you are whatever kind of man even if you're the
macho guy I recommend you try this technique what you're
going to find is you're going to actually become more
fully human the reason this advice that I'm going to
give you here is more advanced than the stuff I
said before is because really I'm teaching you how to
transcend the masculine and the feminine and to become holistic
each man in each woman has the masculine and the
feminine in them and really your goal is not to
cling to one or to the other pole but to
embody both poles that's what's going to make you feel
the best so the technique is accentuate your feminine qualities
that means be more emotional both the positive emotions and
the negative emotions where your emotions more on your sleeve
be nice be caring and be compassionate in other words
all the things that for example pick up culture tells
you not to do be cute be playful be like
a little kid again cry be nerdy be romantic and
of course you get bonus points for doing all these
things in front of women because usually the guy is
like thinking well if I'm going on a date with
a woman or if I'm at a bar or a
club I'm trying to impress some woman to get attracted
to me then I have to act a little bit
more alpha than usual here what I'm telling you is
actually no resist that urge and go the complete opposite
direction and actually act more like a woman more like
a child more like a crybaby try being romantic and
chivalrous and just see what happens just as an experiment
and notice that's going to be emotionally difficult for you
because you're kind of not wanting to do that because
actually you feel like your masculinity is being threatened by
these things but notice that if you feel that crying
or being romantic or being compassionate and caring towards someone
or just being nice to someone to somebody if that
erodes your masculinity notice that your masculinity is not very
strong a true test of your masculinity would be to
cry in front of a hot woman and to not
be fazed by it huh interesting how that works yes
so be these things be romantic be nerdy do feminine
activities go do something that women do that men don't
usually do that isn't considered much like go do some
yoga something like that or some Pilates you know and
just see how that makes you feel does that make
you feel like you're a woman all of a sudden
does that make you feel insecure well that's a direct
test of how authentically masculine you are it shows you
that your masculinity is actually a facade that you've constructed
and that it's not really grounded in something deeper yeah
be artistic be creative be soft have the courage to
be soft try being loyal try speaking with passion and
emotion rather than indifference try saying whatever you want to
say even what you're going to say is going to
sound weak or pathetic or unattractive have sex the way
you want to have sex make love the way you
want to make love allow yourself to fall in love
a lot of guys they're trying to be so macho
that they actually don't have sex the way they want
to have sex because they think it's going to be
too soft or something like that yeah they don't let
themselves fall in love because they feel like well that's
for girls that's not for guys see so you have
to go in there you have to really really carefully
take a look at how much of your identity has
been constructed artificially and what's really authentic there and that
takes some some trial and error experimentation to really see
where things lie so that's your technique so what I
want you to do over the next few weeks or
the over the next months you know however long you
want to work on increasing your masculinity and becoming more
of a man uh whenever you're around girls or whenever
you're around your guy friends isn't like that you're going
to behave in a more feminine manner and you're going
to do it in a way where you're not ashamed
and you're going to keep doing that until you become
more and more comfortable with that and I actually recommend
that you sort of swing your pendulum to the feminine
end act a little bit hyper feminine act more feminine
that you're then you're even comfortable with just because it's
like an experiment and we want to see where the
middle ground is to find the middle ground you got
to kind of explore both extremes chances are you've already
explored the mat the macho extreme and actually you've probably
been disappointed with the results right that's why you're here
so try doing that and just see what happens what
you'll find is that the more you actually accept the
feminine qualities in you the more girls love you because
what girls are attracted to is they're attracted to authenticity
authentic expressions of self and emotion regardless of whether it's
macho or not that's why sometimes if you're puzzled like
how can that hot girl that I know like I
know this hot girl and she's attracted to this guy
this guy looks just like a stupid douchebag he doesn't
look like some macho a weightlifter guy and she's in
love with him how can that be well it's probably
because this guy is authentically himself even though your standards
are like well I have to be macho to attract
the girls but what that guy understands or maybe he
doesn't understand it but either way what that guy is
doing to keep that girl attracted is that he's just
being himself and that might mean that he's like a
crybaby or that he's insecure whether he's not very confident
and that might shock you because you think like well
but girls we all know girls are attracted to confidence
and all this kind of stuff and this guy doesn't
exhibit those qualities I know him I'm a good friend
of his but see whatever qualities he does exhibit he
exhibits them authentically without shame without embarrassment and that actually
wins the girl over now you got to be careful
here not to use this as like some meta strategy
where you say like okay so let me go cry
in front of a girl to attract the girl that
would be a mistake the thing I want you to
do is just define what's authentic to you whatever that
happens to be hey and also remember that not every
girl is supposed to like you so just because you
act a little more feminine and then you see some
girls rejecting you that doesn't mean anything girls reject guys
of all stripes and colors so really what you'll discover
if you interact a lot of girls is that the
only thing that really repels girls is neediness neediness this
kind of clean energy that you have for her um
and that it's not about really like your personality or
anything there's no ideal personality for you to have to
attract girls different girls are attracted to different personalities so
of course there's going to have to be a personality
match between you and the girl and some girls you
will not have a personality match with but more or
less universally girls everywhere are repelled by neediness from guys
now you might say but Leo what if I'm at
the point in my life where I am authentically needy
what should I do should I hide my neediness and
pretend like I'm not needy or should I actually be
needy what do I do that's interesting overall the way
this problem is solved is by understanding that your neediness
actually comes from a deep inauthenticity in you but it
might take you a while to get to the root
of what that inauthenticity is what I'm going to claim
is that if you were fully authentically you and you
completely deconstructed this false identity that you created for yourself
you would not be needy the neediness would be fixed
but that's uh you know that takes work to do
that might take you a year or two or more
to figure that out and in the meantime if you're
interacting with girls you want some sort of like short-term
solution so what do you do well I can recommend
two things one try owning your neediness and being needy
with the girl now that comes with the risk of
her leaving you or losing attraction for you on the
other hand if you try to hide your neediness usually
what happens is something even worse because you try to
hide your neediness and then you're you're really acting like
a scared little boy and she can really feel that
off you it's high it's hard to to hide true
neediness so what I found in my own life is
that when I try to really hide my neediness it
still comes out and it often looks even uglier than
it would have looked had it not been there had
I expressed it fully authentically so that's something that you
know carries risk with it try it out I also
do think that sometimes it's helpful to just say you
know just stop B let me stop being needy for
the next week and just kind of try to the
fake it till you make it that can also sometimes
be useful but overall what you're working towards is more
authenticity and as you're experimenting with this technique of embodying
and accentuating your feminine qualities your neediness might increase because
you're trying to be more authentic and I actually want
you to experience what that looks like one of the
best cures for neediness with women is to actually get
into a relationship with a great woman be authentically needy
with her repel her with your neediness and be just
conscious of how that whole process worked and then go
through the heartbreak that comes with her leaving you from
being so needy and then you're like holy I lost
an amazing girl because I was this pathetic pathetic needy
um guy and I don't like being that way that's
not authentic to me I'm just kind of giving my
power away for I don't know what reasons to this
girl and that actually moves you up to the next
level that actually helps you to outgrow your neediness see
so your overall goal here is to subvert the macho
stereotype get that out of your mind the goal here
is not to be macho the true definition of being
a man is doing whatever the you want even if
it's girly or weird that's what it really means to
be man not because you're trying to be alpha but
simply because it's you you're just being you and that's
the on that's the bottom line and you're not changing
who you are for anybody not for your girl not
for your friends not for money not for anything that
gives you that kind of groundedness that you attribute to
an Arnold Schwarzenegger Vin Diesel character but that has nothing
to do with having big muscles or fast car or
any of this other kind of stuff right you need
to a distinction between the outer signs of macho alpha
behavior and the real internal psychological core and to not
think that just because you can ape Arnold Schwarzenegger that
that makes you now a man know if you're aping
Arnold Schwarzenegger actually that makes you a betta a weak
little betta and I want you to take the attitude
that a real man brings the man into anything that
he does and the best way to illustrate this is
I love I love the following example I was listening
to Abraham Maslow giving a seminar this was a recording
because he's dead now but I was listening to one
of his seminars and he gave this beautiful example he
was talking about masculinity and femininity he gave this beautiful
example he says that I remember a a while back
hearing about the the Prime Minister of Italy this was
like 60 or 70 years ago the Prime Minister of
Italy and he was seen as this kind of like
manly man and then one day the press got caught
you know caught him at home wearing an apron like
he comes out of his house and he's wearing an
apron and the press they take some pictures of him
and he's wearing this apron with these like flowery patterns
or something on them and he looks very girly because
he was cooking and cooking was apparently something that he
liked to do but you know 70 years ago cooking
was seen as like woman's work and so the press
they asked him about this and like whoa why are
you doing this this this woman's stuff we thought you
were a man and he just told them he said
whatever I do is man's stuff see that's the kind
of attitude you want to take a real man brings
the man in to whatever he's doing the activity doesn't
define the man the man defines the activity so if
you want to cook if you want to so if
you want to go to yoga or pilates go do
it do it and bring the man into it than
being a little boy who is like oh I'm afraid
to I'm afraid to go to Pilates class I'm afraid
to put on an apron because of what I think
that will mean about my masculine image that I'm trying
to project out into the world you see can you
see that a guy who can put on an apron
and not wince and not even think twice about it
how that's the guy that women actually want they want
that guy they don't want that guy who is like
oh well sorry honey I can't go with you to
Pilates because I think that that will make me less
of a man that's actually what she doesn't want you
see so it's a little counterintuitive but I hope you
can take this inside to heart go try it out
try it out with your girlfriend with your wife or
just girls you know in school or in class or
coworkers or whatever and just see how it works what
you're going to discover is that with a little bit
of trial and error actually the women in your life
will start to appreciate you for being more expressive of
yourself and actually not just the women but also the
men because to be attractive to men or women sexually
or non sexually to have lots of friends is simply
to be yourself to wear yourself on on your sleeve
wear your heart on your sleeve and let the chips
fall where they may and those people that will like
you will like you and those people that will hate
you will hate you and those that will be indifferent
to you will be indifferent to you and you're cool
with however the chips fall all right I'm done here
