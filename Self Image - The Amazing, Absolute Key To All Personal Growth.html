hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about the self-image hey okay
welcome back let's crack into this one the self-image this
is going to be a quick breeze through what self-image
is because self-image is such a powerful idea it's such
a transformative idea first of all I love this topic
because of the potential it has to completely transform the
quality of your life I'm talking about ridiculous levels of
transformation possible by understanding and utilizing this concept so we're
going to break into it but there's so much here
I can't cover it all in just 15 or 20
minutes so let's pack in as much as we can
get you a really solid intro to self-image hopefully convince
you of the importance of further study on this topic
and taking some of these actions to heart all right
so self-image what is it well a lot of these
ideas that I bring to you are really coming from
Maxwell Malta's classic self-help book psycho cybernetics if you haven't
checked that out and you want to be a serious
student of self-help I really recommend it of all the
books I've read I think this is one of the
most powerful important practical tools that you can use to
transform your life is psycho cybernetics it is ridiculously powerful
here are some of the key points so maxwell maltz
he was actually a doctor he was a plastic surgeon
back in the 50s I believe 1950s and what he
discovered is he started looking into psychology but the reason
that he started looking into psychology and people's self images
was because he started to do plastic surgery I mean
he was doing plastic surgery and then he noticed a
couple of interesting things the first thing he noticed is
that he would make changes on people people that had
crippling emotional problems because of how they looked for example
they would have some deformity on their face which they
thought which they thought would make them ugly and unacceptable
or they thought that they had too big of a
nose or their lips were too small or they had
wrinkles or something like that and Maxwell Maltz would go
in there and he cut them up fix them up
and make them pretty and when he did that what
he noticed much to his shock was that even though
he could take an ugly person and change the change
that person's face totally around and make them beautiful and
pretty that that person two things would happen need two
types of patients one patient his life would be radically
transformed his self-confidence would be boosted his self-image would be
awesome huge feel great he'd have a lot of self
esteem and he'd go out and he'd really change his
life he have a light transformation that would last for
the rest of his life that happened with some of
the patients with some of the other patients who also
went through that same procedure what would happen is that
they would still think that they're ugly even though objectively
they were now beautiful and in fact some of the
patients were so upset with Maltz that they accused him
of not having made any changes to their face at
all they would accuse him basically of being a charlatan
of being a quack and of course he made changes
but that person here's where we're getting to self-image had
such a strong self-image of who they were before the
operation that that self-image still remained even after the operation
and even though the external the physical features changed it's
the self-image that really determines how you feel about your
life and even what you believe is true so this
is a extremely powerful concept let's really define self-image what
is self image self image is a subconscious framework for
how you see life and yourself and what you believe
and what you think is true and this applies to
reality and it applies to yourself so every belief that
you have is part of this self yourself image what
you think of yourself of course is the self image
but also what you think is possible that's also part
of your self image for example do you think it's
possible for you to be earning a million dollars a
year do you really believe that if you do then
that's part of your self-image if you don't if that
if that sounds ridiculous to you sounds like a like
a fairy tale like wishful thinking that's not part of
your self-image and so that that pathway of reality basically
is blocked off to you what's happening here is that
in your mind your mind is creating a map a
mental model of reality and how the world works and
this model this is the really tricky part about it
is that it's mostly subconscious you're not aware of it
you're not aware of all the assumptions that you make
about how your world works how society works how life
works and how you work who you are you have
all sorts of assumptions that get in there mostly unconsciously
by being programmed and conditioned as you're growing up by
your parents by all the friends you interact with through
school basically every single person you come into contact with
and not just people but also circumstances that happened to
you and just even you know simple things like experiences
that you have when you put your hand in your
hot stove and you learn your lesson from that real
quick right but that gets seared into your subconscious and
that's part of your self-image and your model of reality
is is that you don't put your hand near hot
objects because that has hurt you in the past that's
burned you literally so this is what you've got is
you've got this self image and this self image is
like a large I like to think of it of
a ball of yarn think of it like you have
a ball of your own that's this big and there's
like literally hundreds of strands of yarn in there and
it all tangled up and bunched up together and that's
built then built up over the last all the years
of your life up to this point is all the
experience have come in and taught you different lessons give
you different beliefs and assumptions and it's all congealed into
this tight ball of yarn and it's pretty big mess
in there and all this is sitting below the surface
so you don't even see it you maybe see a
little corner a little piece of the yarn here a
little piece they are there and what's powerful and important
about all this is that this is determining your actions
I have other videos on this to talk about the
how does subconscious mind but the key takeaway from those
videos and I'm just going to throw out you here
real fast is simply that ninety-five percent I would say
of your behaviors and actions are subconscious so the results
in your life are largely subconscious you're not consciously the
results you're getting and your body is like a thermostat
and your mind is like a thermostat and it tends
to keep you in a state of homeostasis in equilibrium
so that is why it's hard to make change that's
why you're stuck where you are right now that's why
you're stuck earning as much money as you do you're
stuck at the weight level that you're stuck at you're
stuck at your happiness kind of setpoint you're stuck in
in your relationships kind of where you've always been and
so you're kind of tend to be stuck there and
if you want to create big change then you've got
to start looking below the surface into this big ball
of yarn you start to have start to unravel that
stuff and looking at the self-image so what's powerful about
the self-image is that anything that you really believe to
be true is something that you're going to then align
your behaviors and your actions with so your behaviors and
really whole personality and what you think of yourself and
what you think of the world and how you then
go and act the things you then do in your
life this is very practical the things you do in
your life are all shaped by what you believe is
true and the crazy thing here is that it doesn't
matter if you believe it to be true and it's
false you'll still operate based on that belief because by
definition a belief is believed to be true by you
and so it feels as though it's true and there
are many things in your self-image that are complete horseshit
false fabrications complete illusions and that is keeping you stuck
where you are so if you want to prop yourself
out of that and you want to get going and
you want to create some some big change in your
life whether with your career your relationships or your fitness
or anything else or just how you even think about
yourself then you have to start to dig in to
self-image and do some of this work so when you
actually start to change your self-image and this is possible
it's possible to change yourself image then you start to
create lasting changes that are sustainable that are not like
a yo-yo effect that actually lasts and that's how you
can create massive weight loss that's how you can create
massive success with the opposite sex that's how you can
create massive success with your finances in your business that's
how you can create massive success personally in your own
psychology just how you feel how you think becoming more
positive rather than negative dropping anxiety dropping depression dropping alcoholism
all of this stuff happens by working on your self-image
whether you do it consciously or not you're still working
on your self-image this is why it's so powerful let
me give you a couple of examples now of what
self-image is on a more practical level these are thoughts
about you so there's thoughts about reality let's talk about
thoughts about yourself what do you see yourself as being
because who you see yourself as is what your life
is going to reflect it's a really powerful idea your
thoughts reflect your life and your life also reflects your
thoughts so there is a interaction then there's a it's
a two-way street it's not a one-way street right now
you probably think that well what I think about myself
is just what's real it's the experiences that I've had
and if I believe that I am for example a
poor speller I'm not good at spelling well that's because
I've got all this evidence to back that up I've
always failed spelling tests I always make a lot of
typos people keep telling me I'm a bad speller I
didn't do good at school so I must be a
bad speller right maybe you are maybe or not but
the fact that it's in your in your subconscious now
it's in it's in your in that big ball of
yarn it's part of your self-image now your life is
going to start to reflect that and it's going to
start to create self-fulfilling prophecy effect which can be extremely
dangerous and it can propagate the fact that you are
a poor speller so maybe you were a poor speller
in the in the past does that mean you can't
change that going forward but if you believe that you
are a poor speller that's part of your self-image you
really believe it what chances do you think you have
of becoming a good speller very little right very very
little it's really dangerous is when you believe it so
much that even what I'm telling you right now just
goes over your head and you start coming up with
with reasons why I'm telling you is not true but
let me assure you that this model of the self-image
is very very true and there are shocking things about
yourself that you believe right now with 100% faith uncertainty
which are completely bogus and are completely destroying the quality
of your life and your potential to grow so let's
cover a few more of those we covered I am
a poor speller what if you believe deep down inside
that you're bad at math you know you always hated
math didn't like math you were bad at math to
school you're bad at numbers whenever someone asks you to
do some accounting work some Excel spreadsheet work you always
make mistakes and errors so now you believe you're bad
at math that could be part of your self-image how
about I'm a failure you imagine what that would do
to your life if you really believe that you fail
you're a failure what if you believed that you are
shy what if you believed I am shy I'm just
a shy person I'm an introvert what if you believe
I'm clumsy I'm always clumsy I always say the wrong
things do the wrong things trip into over stuff bump
into things or just a clumsy person what if you
think of yourself as an alcoholic I am an alcoholic
I have a drinking problem I always have always will
that's just who I am to my genes right its
genetic that's a good one isn't it oh I'm shy
because that's genetic my parents were shy I'm a poor
speller you know my parents were bad spellers I'm I'm
not smarter than my burbled the verbal part of my
brain is just not as sharp as other people about
that at math for the same reason or I'm clumsy
I'm just naturally clumsy watch out for that genetic and
that naturally those can be killers all right how about
uh money so many negative self-image problems with money how
about believing this money is hard to make what do
you believe about money you believe money is hard to
make or is it's easy to make do you think
that has an effect on how much money you have
in your bank account well it does very much so
look into what you think about money about what if
you believed that life is unfair and life is hard
and difficult life is unfair and difficult and hard that's
kind of an ugly one what if you believed I'm
ugly you believe that you are ugly and that others
see you as being ugly how do you think that
would play out in your life so these are some
just common examples that I might throw at you you
can think of more there can be a list of
literally hundreds maybe thousands of them these are just common
limiting assumptions and beliefs part of the self-image that we
can have that that is perpetuating the low quality life
that we have and I've got these you've got them
the trick is that we don't even know that we've
got them a lot of these they sound very silly
and simplistic like something for example like I'm a failure
you might say well I would never say that I'm
a failure that's just stupid you recognize that logically but
actually deep down inside you actually believe that you're a
failure because a lot of the things that are in
your self-image are completely illogical stupid foolish until you articulate
them the problem is that you don't even know what
they are you haven't dug into that into that ball
of yarn to find out or something like I'm ugly
you might never have even articulated to yourself that you
are ugly but maybe deep down inside you actually believe
it and that's why you have a lot of the
relationship problems that you have because you need the other
person to come and give you compliments and to praise
you all the time and to to lavish you with
love and whenever he or she is not doing that
you feel rejected you feel anger you feel bitter and
then that relationship falls apart because you create a lot
of stress and drama because you want more love and
you want more affection from the other person and that
drive the other person away from you but you need
it ultimately because deep down without even realizing it you
believe that you are ugly and you need other people
to to basically counteract that belief and you want them
to be showering you with compliments all the time kind
of deep kind of powerful right but that is how
it works it's crazy how the mind can work so
let's move on and let's talk about wrapping up here
and talking about you know what what kind of can
you do about this and where where does is all
this leading to so ultimately what I want you to
take away from this video because I can't cover all
the steps of how to actually start to affect your
self image right now but I want you to take
away this idea that this is something that's real this
is something that's extremely important this is something that your
mind should be focused on and thinking about and that
this is where change happens you know the old saying
where they tell you if you're going to be lifting
some heavy object you want to lift it with your
legs and not your back because if you lift it
with your back you're going to strain your back and
you're not gonna be as strong as if you lift
it with your from your legs and so you have
to kind of train yourself to lift from your legs
when you're moving something heavy maybe you've run across this
when you remove in your house and moving heavy boxes
or that washing machine or that TV well that can
apply here with doing personal development work and where it
applies is this right now if you're trying to get
some sort of change in your life what you're probably
doing is you're using your willpower to say okay enough
is enough I'm going to go on a diet and
then you try to do that diet or enough is
enough I'm going to go try to earn some more
money by starting a business and you start that new
business or at least you try and what happens you've
probably noticed this is that you quickly fall off because
your willpower breaks it breaks it's like you're back it's
like using your back to lift something there are times
when you can do that and it's fine to do
it and I think building willpower is great but the
key if you want lasting massive change in your life
transformation then what you got to start doing and you've
got to start doing work in your subconscious because your
subconscious is the power center of your results the subconscious
is where 95% of your action is stemming from so
that's what you got to work on and that is
working on your self-image it's working on your beliefs it's
doing more of this deeper introspection work and one of
the ways that you can work on that is through
coaching coaching is really it for getting you these insights
bring stuff up from your subconscious getting you to realize
things that you haven't really realized before and the last
one I'm going to end on is the fact that
yes you can change subconscious it's actually not that difficult
but it does take persistence it takes about 21 days
as maximum waltz talks about in psycho cybernetics he says
it takes about 21 days to really create elastic change
in your in your self-image so that is why for
example if you're keeping on diets or if you're doing
a habit you're taking up some sort of new habit
it's going to take you at least 21 days maybe
a month or two to really lock that in it's
because it's supposed to permeate into the subconscious and that
is a form of working on your self-image all right
