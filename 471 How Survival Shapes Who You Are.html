            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mPIVZtxYHJc' target='_blank'>How Survival Shapes Who You Are</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of Survival Shaping Identity</b>: Leo Gura discusses how environmental demands for survival, especially those in our youth, shape our identity. This includes our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Over time, the layers built in our psyche from these experiences can be forgotten, contributing to problems in our present life. 
</li><li><b>Survival Variance Around the Globe</b>: Survival varies enormously from country to country and within regions of the same country due to cultural differences. Our individual survival strategies are largely influenced by our cultural, familial, schooling, and work environments more than the physical environments in which we live.
</li><li><b>Addressing Survival Wounds and Scars</b>: Wounds and scars from early environmental survival challenges influence our behaviors, desires, fears, insecurities, and biases. These early survival situations, often dealt with dysfunctionally, become ingrained in our psyche and directly impact our successes and failures in life. 
</li><li><b>Circumventing Limitations and Blind Spots</b>: Our individual survival situations create large blind spots in our psyche, limiting our growth, success, and ability to transcend to higher personal or spiritual developmental levels. Essential to personal growth or spiritual development is identifying and addressing these limitations and blind spots, which may be roots of our unresolved issues and dysfunctions.
</li><li><b>Role of Early Survival Challenges</b>: Early survival challenges shape our psyche, making it difficult to remember their significant influence on our present selves. The first 20 years of our lives play a crucial role in shaping our minds, making it increasingly difficult to change as we age. 
</li><li><b>Flexible Nature of Human Survival</b>: Human survival has drastically changed throughout history. Our survival challenges and strategies today are considerably different from those faced by our ancestors. Our survival model is more often than not cultural, contrasting the physical survival model of our ancestors. 
</li><li><b>Role of Psychic Archeology</b>: Digging into our past and exploring the layers of our psyche built during the first 20 years of our lives can reveal many influences on our identity today. This "psychic archeology" allows us to confront and address dysfunctions in our lives that we may have forgotten about. 
</li><li><b>Effects of Survival Elements on Identity</b>: Elements of survival, such as reactions, dreams, thoughts, habits, are not consciously chosen by us. These elements form our identity and though they may seem important, they are beings shaped by random experiences. These elements are then rationalized by our minds to justify and avoid questioning our identity.
</li><li><b>Understanding Survival Shaping Who We Are</b>: It's crucial to understand how much our survival demands from our environment shaped us and thus direct our lives. We often forget how much we were shaped by the environments in which we were raised and forget that our mind's shape determines everything that unfolds in our lives. To make meaningful changes in your life, it's critical to examine and alter your core identity. 
</li><li><b>Variable Survival Strategies</b>: The survival strategies adopted by individuals vary significantly based on the cultural, familial, schooling, and work environment they were exposed to. These strategies often come with blind spots and limitations that restrict our understanding of others and hinder our personal growth.
</li><li><b>Importance of Early Life Experiences</b>: Leo highlights the significant influence of the first 20 years of a person's life on shaping their psyche. Just as impressions in drying concrete remain, the early experiences people have in life significantly impact how their minds develop. Changing this becomes increasingly difficult as we age. 
</li><li><b>Adaptation to Survival Scenarios</b>: Leo instructs viewers to consider various drastic changes to their upbringing and living conditions, and consider how it would impact their identity and worldview. He lists numerous scenarios (such as having a drug-dealing parent, being bullied in school, growing up in a war zone, or in vastly different cultural environments) for viewers to reflect on and realize that their identities would drastically differ in those circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Judgment of Survival Strategies</b>: Leo warns against being judgmental about the survival strategies of others since every individual's survival strategy is deeply influenced by their personal experiences. He notes that survival under specific circumstances might require fundamentally different perspectives on reality. 
</li><li><b>Adjusting Survival Strategies Based on Environment</b>: According to Leo, individuals who grow up in harsh environments (for example, war zones, or restrictive societies) must significantly adapt their worldviews and behaviors for survival. Their survival hinges on seeing reality in ways that might be very different from individuals living under safer conditions.
</li><li><b>Childhood Understanding & Survival</b>: Leo notes that children often lack an understanding of reality and therefore have to depend heavily on their childhood experiences to form their beliefs, values, and survival strategies. He points out that many children face difficult circumstances, and without proper guidance from their adults, they have to navigate survival on their own with limited understanding. 
</li><li><b>Compassion and Understanding for Different Survivals</b>: Leo asks viewers to practice compassion and understanding for different people's survival situations. He emphasizes the importance of refraining from judgment, given that people adopt survival strategies based on their unique experiences, and challenges they faced might have required very different responses than our own.
</li><li><b>Reflections on Hitler's survival challenges</b>: Leo Gura discusses how understanding Hitler's early life survival challenges can change one's perspective of him and World War II. He urges viewers to apply this logic to themselves. 
</li><li><b>Exercise to unravel personal survival challenges</b>: Leo starts an exercise asking viewers to recall early memories and write down their survival challenges. He recounts his struggle with simple tasks such as avoiding getting dirty while eating and maintaining body temperature.
</li><li><b>Family's financial situation and its impact</b>: The fluctuating financial situation in his family had a significant influence on Leo's attitude towards money and life. 
</li><li><b>Development of sexuality and worldviews</b>: Leo also talks about how early experiences and struggles surrounding sexuality, adapting to physical growth, and dangerous situations shaped his views on multiple aspects of life. 
</li><li><b>Effect of learning new skills or languages</b>: The challenges faced while learning language, time, mathematics and other life skills left a significant impact on Leo's life.
</li><li><b>Impact of Social interactions and school experiences</b>: School experiences, especially social interactions with peers, tackling bullying, academic achievements and fitting in, had a crucial role in shaping Leo's psyche. 
</li><li><b>Family dynamics and their influence</b>: Leo highlights how family dynamics, seeking approval, experiencing divorce, forging identity, and navigating the societal norms contributed to forming his perspective. 
</li><li><b>How interests shaped identity</b>: Leo concludes by reflecting on how exploring various interests and hobbies during his early years played a significant role in the formation of his identity.
</li><li><b>Impact of Early Survival Experiences on Different Aspects of Life</b>: Early survival shapes many aspects of our lives, from our beliefs, convictions, principles, pet theories, judgments, likes, dislikes, fears, and insecurities to our political and economic philosophies, sexual identity, social behaviors, career decisions, and life philosophies. How we react to strangers, the facial expressions we make, the muscle tensions in our bodies, the darkest thoughts we have, the dreams and goals we have for our lives, and how we handle money are all influenced by our early survival situations. Even seemingly trivial things, such as the type of food we eat, the books we read, the media we consume, and the work we do, are shaped by early survival.
</li><li><b>Survival Beyond Physical Survival</b>: Survival struggles don't just help us survive physically but also create and nurture our psyche or ego mind. The psyche is a system of meanings and interpretations that develop throughout the first 20 years of life in response to survival situations. Fear and insecurity only stem from survival struggles.
</li><li><b>How Survival Affects our Morality and Attitudes</b>: Our morality, firmly held opinions, and worldview are always in response to something such that it helps us survive. Dislikes, aversions, convictions, and judgments help us survive the specific situations we were in. We create an object of meanings, interpretations, and attitudes that accrete into an ego mind, which needs to survive even more than our physical bodies.
</li><li><b>Understanding Early Survival through an Exercise</b>: Reflecting on our early survival situation reveals fundamental views we hold. An exercise of fill-in-the-blank sentences with subjects such as 'Life is...', 'Men/Women are...', 'Happiness is...', etc., helps to comprehend how our views have been shaped by our survival situations. Spending time contemplating these sentences can reveal much about our psyche.
</li><li><b>How we Cope and Adapt Forms our Identity</b>: How we cope and adapt to challenges is who we are today. Early survival experiences shape our likes, dislikes, beliefs, convictions, principles, judgments, and worldview. These experiences influence our political and economic philosophy, our sexual identity, social behaviors, career, fears, insecurities, and life philosophy. Our reactions to social situations, the facial expressions we make, even our muscle tension, darkest thoughts, and dreams are all shaped by these challenges.
</li><li><b>Effect of Survival on Aspects like Money Handling</b>: Early survival experiences also affect our attitudes and reactions to different aspects of life; for example, how we handle money. Whether we are stingy or wasteful is shaped by our early survival challenges. We might adopt the money behaviors of our parents or rebel against them based on those early experiences.
</li><li><b>Attitudes Towards Money and Dressing Style</b>: Our attitudes towards money and our style of dress are heavily influenced by our upbringing and survival situations. Religiously held views and characteristics for survival are often not consciously chosen but are an accumulation of random events and experiences while trying to survive.
</li><li><b>Identity Change for Better Outcomes</b>: For better life outcomes, it is crucial to change our core identities. This process might be difficult and uncomfortable as it requires changing parts of ourselves that we are heavily attached to. The more we can change about ourselves, the more positive results can be achieved, assuming the changes we make are beneficial and improve our effectiveness, happiness, etc. 
</li><li><b>Survival Shaping our Choices</b>: Survival experiences shape our choices, often creating arbitrary contingencies that significantly impact our beliefs, behaviors, and identities. For instance, being forced to go to church when you were young could lead to either a love or dislike for religion in adulthood.
</li><li><b>Survival-based Approval Seeking Behaviors</b>: Survival situations often lead to approval-seeking behaviors based on the type of approval received during childhood. For example, if one received approval for good grades or being beautiful when they were young, they may continue seeking approval in their adulthood through pleasing authority figures or maintaining their appearance respectively.
</li><li><b>Self-Judgement Interferes with Observing Survival Strategies</b>: Judging oneself while trying to understand survival strategies interferes with the ability to observe and understand these strategies fully. It is essential to neutrally observe these survival mechanisms without attaching any judgement or bias. 
</li><li><b>Influence of Survival on Personal Identity</b>: Our personal identity is significantly influenced by the survival strategies we adapt over time. These strategies are typically developed during our formative years in response to the survival challenges we faced. They shape our inner psyche, our preferences, and the way we portray ourselves to the world. It's important to discern and reflect upon these survival patterns to gain a deeper understanding of our identity. 
</li><li><b>Identity Shift for Improvement</b>: To improve the quality of life, individuals must undergo a core shift in their identity. This shift can seem counterintuitive and uncomfortable, as it often feels like a part of the self is dying. However, embracing and consciously executing this transformation can lead to profound personal growth and improved life conditions. 
</li><li><b>Personal Development and Acceptance</b>: Personal development requires understanding and accepting the various facets of our identity shaped by our unique survival situations. This understanding can help in making positive changes and freeing oneself from illusionary limitations, thus enabling a more enriching life experience.
</li><li><b>First girlfriend trauma shapes perspectives</b>: Childhood traumas like being cheated on by a first girlfriend can shape long-lasting beliefs and attitudes. Though seemingly simplistic, such experiences can profoundly shape one's identity, worldview, and attitude towards the opposite gender.
</li><li><b>Lack of parental love shapes identity</b>: Abundance or lack of love from parents, especially during childhood, can significantly shape a person's identity. It causes the formation of coping mechanisms, fears, and insecurities that persist even into adulthood. 
</li><li><b>Lack of love affects career and life direction</b>: Lack of parental love combined with specific expectations can direct one's career and life choices, often leading to dissatisfaction. The attachment to parental approval can lead an individual to make choices that do not align with their personal desires and potentials, causing long-term frustration and spurring different survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Race, class, religion, and peer group influence bias formation</b>: Aspects such as racial and socioeconomic background, household religion, circle of friends, and the level of parental criticism faced can shape identities and lead to the establishment of biases in an individual's psyche.
</li><li><b>Perceived inadequacies derive from childhood survival challenges</b>: The defense mechanisms and strategies for survival during childhood can significantly influence an individual's perception of their inadequacies in adulthood. While some instances of inadequacies rely on physical realities (like height), many are illusory perceptions that form from early disruptive events, misinterpretations, and misperceptions. 
</li><li><b>Inadequacies can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies</b>: Illusory inadequacies can snowball over time, becoming self-fulfilling prophecies that continue to fuel a person's biases and defense mechanisms. These prophetic inadequacies serve as defense mechanisms, shaping one's identity, worldview, and coping apparatus. 
</li><li><b>Early survival situations shape personal biases and coping mechanisms</b>: Personal inadequacies and biases often arise out of the survival tactics that we adopt in response to challenging situationsparticularly during our early years. These coping mechanisms are not consciously chosen and we seldom consider their long-term consequences. For example, someone might turn to substance abuse as a method of coping with difficult circumstances, and this behavior then becomes their default survival technique, distorting their perception of reality. 
</li><li><b>Defense mechanisms distort perception</b>: Defense mechanisms can significantly alter our interpretation of reality. For instance, someone raised in a religious community might ignore or reject scientific evidence or perspectives that threaten their religious worldview. This denial is a defense mechanism that helps them maintain their identity and place within their community, but it also distorts their perception of reality and can inhibit their ability to acknowledge and accept differing viewpoints.
</li><li><b>Personal experiences greatly impact one's outlook and coping mechanisms</b>: Leo Gura shares his own experience of moving from the USSR to the U.S. at a young age. The culture shock and struggle to fit socially led him to adapt certain survival strategies which still affect him today. These strategies have resulted in self-doubt and insecurity, particularly in social situations. Despite having done significant work to overcome these insecurities, he acknowledges their continuing impact on his behavior, underscoring the long-lasting effect that early survival situations can have on our psyche and behavior. 
</li><li><b>Survival strategies can distort reality across various life aspects</b>: The use of survival strategies isn't confined to any particular aspect of life like religion or culture. Defense mechanisms and biases developed to maintain certain worldviews can also affect perceptions around science, rationality, business, money, and relationships. Survival strategies can lead to avoidance of certain information, denial of facts, and the rationalization of beliefs that may be detrimental or limiting. 
</li><li><b>Survival mechanisms can lead to denial and distortion of truth</b>: Survival mechanisms often involve concealing or denying parts of reality that are painful, threatening, or inconvenient. This can lead to a distorted perception of reality, where only aspects that align with an individual's survival strategies are acknowledged, while everything else is dismissed, rationalized, or denied. This not only distorts one's perception of reality and truth, but also forms a self-deceptive loop that perpetuates these biases and compensation mechanisms.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's social withdrawal and introspection</b>: Gura discusses how his early social survival experiences shaped him into an introverted, solitary, and introspective individual and how it influences his lifestyle today. He recognizes there are both pros and cons to this, such as increased independence and avoidance of groupthink but also loneliness and limited social interactions. Despite inevitable trade-offs, Gura appreciates the unique perspective it has lent him.
</li><li><b>The impact of financial instability in childhood</b>: Leo opens up about the influences of his family's financial instability and dysfunctions on his mindset. His family's fluctuating financial conditions led him to develop a deeply conservative approach towards money as a survival tactic. Although this helped him bootstrap his earlier businesses, he later recognized he had swung the pendulum too far and began to loosen his reins, even allowing some room for wasteful expenditure to balance out his excessively frugal lifestyle.
</li><li><b>Impact of financial insecurity on education and career</b>: Gura discusses how financial instability during his adolescence made him focus intensely on his education and career. He viewed academic excellence as a practical path towards securing financial stability, leading him to sacrifice his social and dating life. While mostly beneficial, this pragmatic and utilitarian approach did come with certain trade-offs. 
</li><li><b>Achieving financial independence</b>: Gura successfully achieved financial independence through his pragmatic approach, which he acknowledges served as the foundation for actualized.org and his teachings. He notes, however, that his habit of constantly thinking about money is dysfunctional at his current state of financial stability and is more of a remnant of survival strategies from his financially insecure past.
</li><li><b>Survival, love & approval</b>: Discussing about his childhood, Leo notes that he largely sought approval and love from academics and teachers. This helped him become more educated but later realized that this dependence on external approval and acknowledgement was unhealthy and that one's sense of love and approval should primarily originate from the self. 
</li><li><b>The impact of positive feedback</b>: Leo mentions that while he appreciates positive feedback, he chooses not to let it influence his own view of himself. Relying heavily on positive opinions for validation leads to an obsessive need for constant reassurance and risks the inflation of ones ego, which ultimately does not foster true happiness.
</li><li><b>Two strongest influences on identity</b>: Leo underlines that the two heaviest influences on one's identity are the deepest sources of suffering and love one experienced in the first 20 years of life. They shape the coping mechanisms, beliefs and perceptions about self-worth and adequacy we carry into adulthood.
</li><li><b>Unhealthy coping mechanisms</b>: People often rationalize dysfunctional coping mechanisms by justifying that it delivers less suffering than if they were to drop the mechanism. However, Leo encourages viewers to replace unhealthy coping mechanisms with healthier ones, thereby 'upgrading their armor'.
</li><li><b>On finding love</b>: Leo warns against associating love with external validation/approval and shows the importance of self-reliance and self-love. He encourages viewers to replace partial and contingent ways of receiving love with more expansive and holistic sources, primarily from oneself.
</li><li><b>Self-love and the role of survival patterns</b>: Leo Gura stresses the necessity of self-love as an effective survival strategy. Many people rely on others for love, which can perpetuate a dysfunctional survival strategy and lead to attachment to someone who may not be right for them. This implies that survival strategies should focus on personal development and self-love, which can take years to develop. 
</li><li><b>Identification with survival strategies and their implications</b>: Viewing one's survival strategies as their identity can set them up for failure since survival is a temporary solution that may become unsustainable over time. The realization of one's mortality can be deeply painful but necessary for self-growth. It is essential to distinguish between one's worldview (shaped mainly by survival scenarios) and ultimate reality or truth.
</li><li><b>The arbitrariness and contingency of worldviews</b>: Implicitly, it is suggested that one's worldview can change dramatically with varying survival circumstances, implying that it is less an immutable truth and more a byproduct of specific survival scenarios. Realizing this can lead to disidentification from one's worldview, which often gets rationalized as the one true or best concept of reality due to the psyche's justifications.
</li><li><b>Survival vs. truth, goodness, and love</b>: Survival is not synonymous with truth, goodness, or love; in fact, it can prevent individuals from accessing these qualities. What we perceive as survival strategies are merely coping mechanisms to experience a sliver of truth, goodness, or love. To achieve more of these qualities, we must broaden our understanding and decrease our reliance on survival-based thinking.
</li><li><b>Rationalizations in Peoples' Realities</b>: Notably, people tend to rationalize their survival strategies as essential, valid, and good, with powerful figures in media, business, science, or politics often falling prey to such rationalizations, even to the extent of self-deception. These people often genuinely believe in the ideologies they promote, often leading to situations where their survival strategies further perpetuate untruths or illusions.
</li><li><b>Implications of survival strategies for truth</b>: As per Leo, even scientific truth, often seen as objective, is merely a survival strategy. This implies that a lot of what we perceive as truth - economic, social, or political - is closer to delusions constructed to ensure survival. The limitations of one's survival strategies become glaringly apparent when compared to the larger reality.
</li><li><b>Breaking away from self-deception and survival strategies</b>: Understanding that many of our deep-seated behaviors and ideologies are survival strategies is the first step to unraveling the inherent self-deception. It would, however, take a significant amount of work and time to break away from these survival patterns due to attachment, unconscious tendencies, and denial. 
</li><li><b>Understanding goodness and truth</b>: Highlighting a nuanced perspective, Leo posits that everything is good, which allows our ego to rationalize any action or ideology as good. However, the ego does this by only focusing on a small aspect of an entire situation, ignoring anything that doesn't fit into its limited understanding. Implicitly, the inference is that absolute good is the entirety of reality or existence, but ego-based survival strategies only allow for a narrowed, smaller version of this goodness.
</li><li><b>The problem of contradicting worldviews and versions of reality</b>: Different individuals, influenced by their survival situations, carve out different versions of reality or goodness for themselves. These versions often contradict each other as they represent only a small part of the complete reality, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.
</li><li><b>Early survival challenges and fears</b>: The experiences and trials faced during our early stages of life shape our deepest fears and insecurities. These situations directly affect the values we develop and the strategies we employ to receive love and acceptance. 
</li><li><b>Coping mechanisms and defense strategies</b>: Our reactions today are often the result of past survival strategies and defense mechanisms that were once beneficial. Understanding how these historical patterns serve us and limit us now can pave the way for personal growth and development.
</li><li><b>Compassion towards early survival situations</b>: Consideration and understanding should be shown towards your past self's challenging survival situations, as well as those of others. Our early circumstances were usually out of our control, lacking in knowledge and guided by survival instincts. 
</li><li><b>Education and wisdom</b>: The absence of mentors, teachings, and opportunities for personal growth in our early stages contribute significantly to our survival strategies. If we have access to higher teachings and wisdom, we are able to make better choices in life.
</li><li><b>Understanding different worldviews</b>: Different worldviews come from diverse survival environments. Therefore, classifying people as evil or monstrous based on their actions should warrant reflection on their likely challenging survival situations. 
</li><li><b>Cycle of ignorance and knowledge</b>: Dysfunctional behaviors and misguidance often result from ignorance, perpetuating a cycle of harmful survival strategies. A significant part of breaking this cycle involves gaining essential knowledge and consciousness. 
</li><li><b>The importance of action</b>: While understanding the right course of action is an important step, it must be coupled with action. It's not enough to know what needs to be done; it requires the will and effort to put this knowledge into practice.
</li><li><b>Spiritual development and survival strategies</b>: Our spiritual journey involves transcending our ingrained survival script and purifying and healing the scars left by our struggles. At the same time, it's equally important to develop nuanced and healthier survival strategies as we continue to face new survival challenges in every generation. 
</li><li><b>Understanding oneself</b>: Ultimately, we need to understand that the majority of our actions and behaviors are driven by inherent survival scripts. Personal growth entails recognizing and transcending these scripts while also acknowledging the need for practical survival strategies.
</li><li><b>Current Generational Survival Mechanisms</b>: Leo Gura explains that every generation, Gen X, Millennials, and Zoomers, will develop its own survival mechanisms and blind spots. The process is a continuous cycle contributing to growth, consciousness, love, and an understanding of the various limitations and biases that prevent these developments.
</li><li><b>Difference Between Reactive and Conscious Survival</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the difference between surviving reactively and surviving consciously. He observes that most people survive reactively, from a position of weakness not proactively, and encourages viewers to shift to conscious survival. According to him, conscious survival avoids opportunistic and reactive survival that tends to lead to evil and deceptive behaviors.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Live for a Higher Purpose</b>: Gura advises viewers to live life for a higher purpose, rather than just performing actions that lead to short-term pleasure. He refers to this as a long-term investment that will reap dividends for the rest of their life. 
</li><li><b>Need for In-depth Understanding of Survival</b>: Gura repeatedly underscores the critical importance of understanding survival in depth. He advises viewers to watch his previous series on understanding survival and to make consistent self-improvement efforts.
</li><li><b>Recommendation to Utilize Resources on Actualized.org</b>: Gura encourages viewers to utilize the resources available on his website, Actualized.org, such as book reviews, a blog, a forum, and a life purpose course. He also appreciates those supporting him on Patreon and announces the launch of a new YouTube channel, Actualized Clips.
</li><li><b>Importance of Mastering Survival Before Exploring Spiritual Topics</b>: Leo Gura advises viewers, especially younger individuals, to prioritize mastering survival before delving into more abstract spiritual and philosophical topics. He emphasizes that a good handle on survival will provide a solid foundation for spiritual exploration. 
</li><li><b>Warning Against Endless Pursuit of Survival</b>: Gura cautions against getting lost in the endless pursuit of survival. He counsels that just enough survival should be learned to survive but not to the point of overdoing it, which may backfire.
