hey Leo here or Ashlyn org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about what is the devil understanding
the mechanics of evil [Music] you I need to issue
a warning right off the bat which is that this
episode may offend and disturb you I've gotten death threats
in the past for speaking about some of the material
that needs to be covered here today on this topic
and that's for good reason because here we are stabbing
the ego right in the heart this is not what
most people want most people's lives are in fact designed
around never understanding what is meant to be understood here
so be careful but also get excited because if something
is that deeply offensive and disturbing it also probably means
that there's a lot of growth to be had there
if you become conscious of it what I want to
help you do in this episode is to reconcile evil
once and for all in your life so that you
understand what it is and why it is at the
biggest picture possible in the most holistic way very few
people in life have done this so what we're gonna
be doing in this episode is answering some age-old philosophical
and theological questions but in a practical way that have
to do with morality and ethics and evil so questions
like why is the devil we're gonna answer that what
is evil we're gonna answer that why does evil exist
and how is it created what's the mechanics of it
we're gonna answer that we're gonna answer the question of
if there is a benevolent God how could a benevolent
God allow for evil to exist if God is all
good and all-powerful then there's this paradox of evil that
we have to contend with how do we explain that
and we're gonna answer the question of how do you
stop evil once and for all so those are our
questions now this issue of reconciling evil it's important for
two reasons one it's important for your peace of mind
and your happiness because if there's a lot of evil
around you in the world and it's happening to you
and around you and you don't understand what it is
or you misunderstand what it is then you're always gonna
be perturbed how can you be happy how can you
be at peace in a world while all this stuff
is happening when you don't understand it and secondly and
perhaps even more importantly is that if you misunderstand evil
you will unwittingly create evil and that actually is the
primary reason why there is so much evil in the
world is simply because people have the wrong understanding of
what it is they're by actually creating it so let's
get started let's just get right into the heart of
the issue which is what is the devil do you
want to know do you really want to know are
you sure you want to know it's you you are
the devil it's as simple as that if you take
away one thing from this episode well let it be
this the devil is not some guy with horns and
a pitchfork and a pointy tail and red skin that
is a metaphor that is a metaphor from Christian mythology
let's say but I don't even know if they talk
about the appearance of the devil in in the Bible
I don't think so that's just something that our culture
has sort of come up with but that's a caricature
that's a cartoon version of what the devil is that's
a metaphor for what for you for the self for
the ego evil is basically just selfishness which is the
same thing as ignorance which is the same thing as
unconsciousness now of course the devil works in sneaky and
deceptive ways the devil uses illusion and sleight of hand
so to this end of course the devil must deny
that he is the devil because if the devil ever
realized that he was the devil he would have to
stop being the devil so fundamentally the mechanic of being
a devil is that you behave like a devil while
saying that you are good that's what the devil does
actually that part of the Christian devil mythology is quite
right in Christian mythology they always talk about the devil
as being this sort of trickster character who promises you
one thing and then gives you something else well that's
exactly right the devil works through deception and not just
deceiving you in the sense that there's some external agent
like a guy with the pitchfork who deceives you that's
not what we are talking about here I'm saying that
you are the devil you deceived yourself and by that
very deception you come into existence as a self and
from that dynamic comes all the evil in the world
that you know and love that we commonly recognize from
history from all the history books torture rape murder war
terrorism genocide racism slavery pedophilia whatever you name it every
abuse imaginable what is that but selfishness that's what it
is here's the thing about the self and about you
is that you have to understand how you came into
existence to really understand this topic and the problem is
that most people think they came into existence by being
born that is not how you came into existence most
people think that they are a physical object like a
human being is a physical object human being is not
a physical object a human being is a concept you
are a concept to understand this this again just regular
old non duality so if you've heard me talk about
this before then we're just gonna rehash it here but
for those of you who are new and you know
some people have heard it they still don't get it
here's what non duality means is that you just have
one substance out of which everything is made in this
substance there is no distinction between a subject and an
object a self and another these things don't exist yet
it's all one then what happens is that let's say
we want a self how do you get a self
are you just born No when you're born you don't
have a self you're alive but no self yet the
self comes into existence when when a distinction is drawn
between self and other in other words there are no
objects in reality scientifically objectively speaking there's not a single
object it's all one there are no boundaries but you
can draw boundaries if you want to and then you
can believe in those boundaries so what would happen if
we drew a boundary imagine a white piece of paper
we have a sharpie big fat black sharpie and we
just draw a circle so as we're drawing a circle
we're creating a boundary and then what we do is
we tell ourselves up to everything inside the boundary is
me is the self that's my identity and everything outside
the boundary that's the environment that's the other that's reality
that's God that's science that's the universe we have all
these different names for what the other is it includes
of course human beings but it also includes physical objects
the external world all that sort stuff inside the inside
the circle is me the self now of course as
soon as I do that there's a problem my entire
existence is based on the creation of this boundary and
the maintaining of this boundary see if someone comes along
with an eraser tries to erase this line I will
literally disappear that's what it means for you to be
a concept I'm saying that you will disappear if the
boundary of you and other is erased and you can
erase it which is precisely why you fight so much
to stay yourself which is precisely why you defend yourself
you defend yourself image you not only defend yourself physically
you defend yourself conceptually as well you defend all your
ideas your beliefs various ideological systems that you have your
notions of reality you defend various rights and values and
ideals that you hold and of course you defend yourself
physically and you just defend yourself from all sorts of
forms of abuse from theft for rape for murder from
from getting screwed over in a business deal from getting
screwed over in a relationship for not getting the short
end of the stick for getting the kind of food
you want or I see it just goes on and
on your entire life is about this to be alive
is to be a thing which tries to survive as
a self you could imagine it as though we take
a water balloon and we fill it with water and
now we have this water balloon that is you that's
the self now of course the problem is that yes
you do have a shape it's flexible but generally you
have a certain kind of shape which makes it seem
as though you're distinct from your environment but of course
you're also very vulnerable to your environment as a self
because this water balloon can be very easily punctured a
pencil some scissors a knife some sharp coffee table corner
could puncture this fragile membrane of the water balloon so
does the water balloon have to do if it wants
to survive as a water balloon cuz you see reality
is a chaotic thing chaotic system there's a lot of
variability there's a lot of chaos you can get burned
you can get stabbed you can get frozen I mean
you can get shot out into outer space all sorts
of bad stuff could happen to you if if if
you are dead set on staying yourself if you don't
care about staying yourself then it's not a problem but
if you care about maintaining this fixed configuration of matter
and energy or whatever it is this water balloon if
you want it to stay unpunctuality do and that's exactly
what the self is about and that's exactly how the
devil is created see the devil creates evil simply because
it exists as a self and he needs to act
to preserve itself and the easiest way to do that
is to be extremely extremely extremely selfish because when you're
extremely selfish what you'll do is you will take every
single obstacle or threat to your existence in the environment
and you will label it as being evil or bad
and that's true from your point of view because if
all you care about is self survival and your own
persistence and your own reproduction and your own thriving and
your own pleasure and happiness if you care about those
things above everything else then you don't care what the
truth of the matter is you don't care about non-duality
what you care about is just maintaining your configuration and
the best way to do that is to demonize those
things which are really threatening to you so evil is
the label or the concept that you invented in order
to marginalize those things which are threatening to your existence
so that you could justify to yourself eliminating those things
without any self-reflection or any guilt see and this notion
of evil you have is completely relative it's relative to
you it's relative to your survival consider that if you
had no self you literally would not see evil and
that it literally would not exist this is a hard
pill for people to swallow it's hard for people to
wrap their minds around this I see this consistently by
reading people's comments about these topics because they have this
feeling that evil is some tangible property out in the
world in the same way that length or weight or
color like the color red is a property of the
world they think that evil is a property of certain
people or if certain situations or certain things that's not
the case at all evil is a concept that was
invented by the self by the devil so that he
could be a devil without admitting to himself that he's
the devil and when you understand that you immediately start
to see why there are so many Devils in the
world the devil is not out there the devil is
in you when you get in touch and you become
conscious of the devil within you and you recognize just
how powerful of a force this is it's a force
of nature which is very difficult to stop you will
then appreciate and understand why other people are acting like
Devils and you will not really blame them or condemn
them for being Devils because you understand that you're also
a devil and that there's really very little difference between
you two this is something that nobody wants to admit
because the whole point of having a self is to
be selfish it's to have a self agenda it's to
be very self biased to have a double-standard have you
noticed that when other people act excessively selfishly you are
very quick to call it evil and others around you
are very quick to condemn that person for being so
selfish but when they themselves or you that yourself are
being selfish that's completely ignored ah that's not important let's
not look at that let's point our finger at the
one who is being a devil the one outside and
that dynamic right there is exactly what the devil does
that is how devilry works it works ass-backwards it's tricky
it's deceptive it's the most counterintuitive thing ever think of
the most evil thing you can imagine maybe slavery maybe
genocide maybe torture and rape maybe war and notice that
these things are not evil in an absolute sense they're
only evil for you now this is where people stumble
is they say well leo for me it's not just
for me like nazis they're not just evil for me
Nazis are evil for everybody terrorists are evil for everybody
no they're not this notion of for you it's a
much broader notion than you're thinking I don't just mean
Nazis are evil for you in the sense that they
can harm you physically and maybe they could even dismantle
your entire country if you let them there's more to
it than that cuz your sense of evil for me
doesn't just include you personally it includes your family your
social circle your country your tribe it includes all your
ideas includes your entire identity it includes all your values
of justice goodness and liberty and beauty and truth and
love includes all that so in that sense Nazis are
evil for you because they go against the things that
you hold as most dear but Nazis are not evil
to themselves and terrorists are not evil to themselves and
there are many people who support terrorists doing what they
do why is that is it because they're also evil
no it's because they have a different agenda that's the
difference it's a difference of agenda not a difference of
any kind of physical properties or characteristics you have to
start to see that everyone in the world is acting
basically the same they're acting in a self biased manner
to accomplish their own agenda that's what 99.999% of people
in the world are up to and that's why we
have so much people in the world it's really just
as simple as that the problem is that you don't
want to admit it you do dozens of evil things
every single day but you're ignorant of them evil is
ignorance and of course you're gonna deny it because the
first thing the devil does when he comes into existence
is that he says that he is good he is
true he has to play that game on himself in
order to feel like he's real like he's solid now
I hear you saying well Leo but your ik waiting
me with Nazis I'm not see and I'm better than
a Nazi why are you trying to put us on
the same playing field precisely because what the devil needs
to do to maintain himself as a devil is to
is to skew the playing field see what the ego
likes to do is it likes to make very fine
distinctions and it says well but I'm not as bad
as a rapist and I'm not as bad as a
terrorist and not as bad as a Nazi and that's
exactly what perpetuates the evil and the blindness within you
which will cause you to create more evil see it's
true that different people have different degrees of ignorance and
unconsciousness and selfishness not everybody is equally selfish and it
manifests in many different ways but the very important point
to understand is that there's no fundamental difference between you
and a Nazi or a terrorist or whoever you hate
there's no difference at all it's just a difference of
circumstance it's a difference of degree and really the difference
is much smaller than you think a Nazi is maybe
1% conscious you are maybe 2% conscious that's the difference
the difference is 1% consciousness that's what most people don't
understand and there's a lot of room for growth there
on that scale huge room for growth see the devil
is really good at ignoring the collateral damage that he
causes people think that evil happens through diabolical planning usually
it doesn't sometimes it does but usually it doesn't usually
it just happens well like this let me give you
an example this example is the Iraq war this is
a very good example if you ask most Americans what's
the most evil thing you can think of one of
the things they might cite as an example is 9/11
and they might say well 9/11 is one of the
most evil acts perpetrated upon the American pub like in
the last 50 years let's say since the Nazis perhaps
since the concentration camps okay and how many people died
in September 11th two and a half thousand people roughly
speaking okay after 9/11 george w bush holds a famous
news conference where he talks about the axis of evil
in the axis of evil who does he call out
Iran Iraq and North Korea then shortly after we invade
Iraq under the pretense of weapons of mass destruction and
although there's no connection whatsoever between Iraq and 9/11 still
the public is in this sort of combative mood and
we want to be tough on terrorists and dictators and
evildoers evildoers that's a very popular quote for george w
evildoers and how does he frame this war he frames
the war as us fighting good evil so we're the
good guys they're the bad guys we are making the
world safer we're fighting for freedom we're fighting for democracy
we're fighting for enlightenment or fighting for American values all
that's good in the world and I say this as
an American I'm American citizen so very interesting right then
we go to war with Iraq and what happens a
lot of people died how many let's pull it up
here's my phone I'm gonna go to google and type
in casualties of the Iraq war and I'm gonna click
on the first thing that comes up which is a
Wikipedia page cattle these are the Iraq war and I'll
quote you a little bit of it here's what it
says various scientific surveys of Iraqi deaths resulting from the
first four years of the Iraq war are estimated up
to 1 million Iraqis died as a result of the
conflict during this time another study published in 2011 estimated
it's approximate that it's approximately half a million Iraqis another
newspaper who has been calculating these valise tallies called the
Iraqi Body Count project found that a hundred and seventy
four thousand Iraqis were killed and of those approximately 120
thousand were civilian non-combatants so Americans were pissed off when
we lost two and a thousand people and yet then
we invade a country who had nothing to do with
that and we kill at least 120,000 civilian non-combatants and
how do we justify it well we ignore it this
figure is virtually never cited in the news or in
mainstream culture never brought up in fact the Defense Department
doesn't even bother keeping accurate count of the casualties that's
not something they're interested in you see we keep very
accurate count of our own casualties and granted is easier
to keep count of your own casualties than those of
the opposite side but still there is a sort of
willful ignorance there for good reason because if you were
fully conscious of what you were doing when you were
waging this war from the highest level then you could
not wage this war see because this is just the
committing of evil that's what it is but it gets
even sneakier than this see now let me take my
own responsibility for this because I'm an American citizen I
pay US taxes I pay over $100,000 in taxes every
single year where does that money go to the federal
government to fund our defense industry to fund these wars
the Iraq war is estimated to have cost at least
a trillion taxpayer dollars and that's a very conservative estimate
some estimates put it at 2 3 or even 4
trillion when you take into account all the ancillary costs
the interest rates and the all the collateral damage that's
been done that needs to be repaired and all the
disabled veterans and that need to be taken care of
for fifty years into the future dealing with post-traumatic stress
dealing with amputations dealing with all this sort of stuff
you see so enormous cost and I funded that because
on American citizen I funded evil if you're an American
citizen you funded evil if you do business with America
through trade you also funded evil you see if your
country was part of the coalition that I made in
Iraq which included the UK Australia and like a couple
dozen other countries they sent in very small numbers of
troops but nevertheless you participated in that evil and see
if your taxpayer in those countries you also fun to
this evil and yet you don't think of it as
such do you how much time in the last ten
years have you thought have you spent thinking about this
very very little of course and that's precisely how evil
gets created you don't understand you're creating it because you're
deeply deeply ignorant and you're in denial about it and
it's not pleasant to talk about these things at the
dinner table or on TV or even in the news
even the news doesn't cover this stuff really it's extremely
biased it's extremely selfish as you would expect because not
only is there an individual ego there's a collective ego
the entire nation of America is an ego structure in
a sense really and it fights to preserve itself it's
selfish it's got a self by sky self agenda of
course it does as as every other nation as does
every other tribe every sports team every corporation every family
every couple it works like this but also the individual
contributes to it and there's an interplay between the individual
and the collective so that was one example here's a
for you that a lot of people are in denial
about smartphones do you own a smartphone if you do
if you own an iPhone for example this is not
an iPhone but if you own an iPhone and I
mean I assume that the same basic manufacturing principles apply
to any phone not just the iPhone but they're manufactured
in China using very cheap labour making these people work
in factories for 60 80 hours a week many of
them are under miserable conditions some of them are work
to death they actually have to install nets under the
windows and in the staircases of these factories because people
will jump out and commit suicide because of the miserable
conditions in which they manufacture these phones it's just a
very tedious process very robotic process mind-numbing life numbing and
yet you go out there and buy a new phone
every year and you love your phone and you just
obliviously text away on your phone not realizing that that
purchase created that evil see and what is that that's
just ignorance that's just selfishness you want your phone even
when I tell you this you're still gonna keep using
your phone it doesn't matter you're gonna continue to use
it because you have a double standard because that's what
the eeo is about and that's how evil is committed
what I'm telling you that fundamentally there's no difference between
the Iraq war between the iPhone between a lot of
other stuff like that between Wall Street and between Nazis
and terrorists there's really very little difference when you look
at the fundamentals of it when you look at the
mechanics of it the content is different but otherwise no
you're just kidding yourself evil has a function the function
of ego of evil is to serve the ego it's
a concept that the ego created so that you can
point to something out there and call it evil and
never have to really self reflect about your relationship to
that thing you never have to adopt the perspective of
that person or of that ideology you have to never
you never have to step in that person's shoes and
to really experience their suffering because when you call something
evil that immediately puts up a barrier it's sort of
a deliberate blindness so that you can go and exterminate
that thing guilt-free have you noticed that nobody that you
consider evil considers themselves to be evil not Hitler not
racists not slave owners not dictators not murderers they don't
think of themselves as evil why is this an accident
no that's this mechanism working perfectly what people don't understand
is that evil is a tool of the self which
is used against the other so yourself uses evil projects
it onto other because you don't want that evil to
come towards you you want to keep it at arm's
distance and of course that that other has the exact
opposite perspective or at least they can which is why
for example Hitler didn't consider himself to be evil Hitler
considered and choose to be evil and he was very
convinced of that now people will say well Leo but
that's because Hitler was so deluded and he was so
evil that he lost all sense of right and wrong
no actually Hitler didn't lose sense of right and wrong
his mechanism was functioning perfectly he was being selfish and
he was using the concept of evil exactly how the
self needs to use it that's why it exists for
that purpose and you're also using that mechanism now to
demonize him and to demonize whoever else you like to
demonize the point of you demonizing them is so that
you can maintain yourself that's the point that's it so
when you see yourself doing it and you try to
stop yourself from doing it and you see how difficult
that is you will immediately understand Hitler and racists and
slave owners and dictators and terrorists and all them the
question is how deeply do you see it within yourself
the core function of the concept of evil is to
provide cover for self biased behavior and to stop self
reflection because the devil only exists by virtue of the
fact that he doesn't self reflect if he fully self
reflected he would stop existing because upon full self reflection
you realize that there is no self and that's a
a rude realization let's talk about some of the characteristics
of the devil we already mentioned the devil works through
trickery and self-deception but this cannot be overemphasized just how
tricky and sneaky this is as soon as the devil
comes into existence the first thing he does is he
flips the script on everything he calls up down he
calls left right he calls right wrong and wrong right
he calls good evil and evil good and most importantly
he calls truth falsehood and falsehood truth why does he
do this because he must because the thing that is
most threatening to the devil is the truth with a
capital T because the truth the capital T is God
and God is everything God is indiscriminate God is without
boundaries God is infinite which leaves no room for Devils
so the devil's in trouble whenever the truth is around
so what the devil must do his game is to
always be moving away from truth but at the same
time claiming that his falsehood and his ignorance is actually
the real truth it's an ingenious strategy for self survival
and that's exactly what you do that's exactly what people
do and nowhere is this more clear than in religion
because you see spirituality true spirituality is the path to
ultimate truth this means the eradication of the devil now
for the devil this is a problem so of course
how does the devil deal with the biggest existential threat
that he has in society which is spirituality he takes
it and subverts it corrupts it and turns it into
a tool for deepening his ignorance and that's exactly what
religion is for billions of people on the planet it's
exactly that it's a corruption of true spirituality and mysticism
to the point where the original mystics and founders of
these religions quote-unquote founders because mystics don't find religions it's
their followers who do they're ignorant followers see they are
demonized the very founders ideas and principles are all demonized
and turned upside down by the devil when the devil
gets ahold of this stuff which is why it's brilliant
you see because you can go and pretend to be
spiritual by being religious and that makes you feel like
you've got the truth now and you can go preach
and you can go convert people and you can go
talk to people about your beliefs and about how much
you believe in God and how much you believe in
goodness and morality and truth and helping people and how
much you believe in Jesus or the Buddha or whoever
else without understanding that in so doing you're actually being
the devil see the devil has possessed you so thoroughly
and it's also possessed all our social institutions so thoroughly
that people are born into this stuffed bait they don't
even know what hit them it's so sneaky and they
will deny it to the very last breath of course
as they must because the devil can never admit that
he's the devil see the devil thinks that he is
separate from God that's fundamentally what that distinction of self
is if there is no boundary between self and other
then that means everything is one everything's non-dual but as
we know from Christian mythology what did Satan or Lucifer
do what's his story he's like the fallen angel he
renounced the love of God and he wanted to be
in power himself see he wasn't happy with God being
all-powerful he wanted to desert his own power he wanted
to rule in his own domain but how can the
devil rule in his own domain when everything is one
domain in some way the devil needs to create his
own domain which is like a bubble within the larger
domain so he does that by doing the separation but
the only way separation had happen is if he forgets
that he actually is God from the very beginning so
he has to separate himself from God and then to
maintain that he has to constantly lie and deceive not
only others but himself another characteristic of this devil is
that he's massively arrogant he has to be because he
has to feel like he knows when in fact he
does not wishes why the devil uses ideology as one
of his favorite tools any kind of ideology is basically
devilry this includes religious ideology political ideology economic theology capitalism
vers communism liberals versus conservatives religious people versus atheists atheists
are also devils agnostics or Devils scientists are devil it
doesn't like it doesn't matter what your ideology is the
content of the ideology is irrelevant the point of an
ideology is to create an identity out of ideas and
concepts and also another characteristic that's closely related to this
is that the devil loves to feel like he possesses
the truth exclusively so when the devil grabs hold of
this truth he really believes it it's because he believes
it so much and it's because he thinks that his
truth is the best truth that he then goes out
preaches converts and kills or threatens anyone who who doesn't
accept his truth see it's brilliant it's just brilliant in
its design how it all works another characteristic of the
devil is that he's outwardly oriented materialistic and very pragmatic
why is that well again because if the devil ever
self reflects he's dead so what he has to do
is he has to spend virtually all of his time
in life orienting outward rather than inward so that means
the devil is preoccupied with sex money parties alcohol drugs
internet TV having a career pursuing success earning lots of
money on Wall Street getting a nice house getting lots
of cars getting girls getting guys and it just goes
on and on and on like this the devil uses
addiction and distraction to keep himself constantly looking away from
the truth that he doesn't actually exist and he thinks
he's gonna win this game but in the end he
always loses this game because hey it only lasts 7080
years maybe 90 years tops then you're dead that water
balloon that you are it's gonna burst because the [
__ ] the truth always overpowers falsehood see so the
devil's gonna lose it's only a question of how long
until he loses and will he recognize what he's doing
and open up some room for redemption to see the
devil if he really wants to the devil can always
turn inwards and realize that he's being a devil and
he can say you know what I'm tired of this
[ __ ] I don't want to rule over my
own domain let me just surrender to God and if
he does that he becomes God the boundary between God
and the devil is paper-thin in fact it's actually non-existent
from God's perspective from the devil's perspective it's it's likely
oh god what is god there's no God from the
devil Strika of course there's no God or the opposite
of course there is a God but what you hold
as the God is not really God it's just ideas
you have it's ideology the beauty of ideology is that
it's a perfect place holder for God if you got
ideology whether it's science atheism agnosticism theism whatever it is
doesn't matter it's not God by definition because it's limited
and so it's the perfect self-deception this reminds me of
a TV show I used to watch on HBO it's
a long time ago most you probably don't remember it
wasn't a very popular show it's called carnival some of
you might remember it that was an interesting show it
only ran for about two seasons before they cancelled it
but it was an interesting two seasons it was set
in the Depression era in the United States and it
followed these carnies or these ha like circus folk who
would travel around the country they were the good guys
and the bad guy was literally the devil this was
a classic story of good versus evil so in this
fictional sort of universe that they had they had various
spiritual powers and what happened is that the Satan came
to life and he reincarnated as a person and so
this person comes and he has this mission Satan has
this mission to take over the world with his devilry
and then the protagonist was supposed to stop him but
what I found really interesting is how they portrayed his
devil so he's incarnated now as a human being and
what job do you think the devil has of course
he's an evangelical preacher the perfect role for Satan and
every day he gets on the radio and he talks
about the beauty of God and morality and about honesty
and about truth and about justice and liberty and goodness
and he's the most devout Christian you can ever imagine
and through this he uses the radio to gather a
larger and larger audience until he amasses millions of people
who follow him and he is leading them all straight
to hell that's what this show is about and the
main protagonist is supposed to stop him what I loved
about this show was that it showed that the writers
had a keen intuitive sense of how the devil works
see he works through these 180-degree reversals you might think
that the devil because he's coming from falsehood that he
wouldn't be so bold as to go out there and
have anything to do with religion but actually exact opposite
the devil is extremely bold he will look you straight
in the face and tell you the exact opposite of
what is true and he'll believe it and if you're
not careful he'll make you believe it see and of
course by he I mean you that's what you are
the devil is not somebody else but you it's you
it's ingenious it's the greatest mind [ __ ] ever
which starts to answer the question of why there's so
much evil in the world because nobody wants to acknowledge
this nobody wants to patiently watch themselves being the devil
the final characteristic of the devil is a lack of
self-reflection which I already talked about but what's interesting is
that the devil does self reflect in some way it's
just that his self reflection is neurotic he has what's
called neurotic self-consciousness so the devil will feel shame the
devil can feel guilty the devil can make himself feel
bad some people they don't think of themselves as good
people they think of themselves as evil people and the
people who think of those as evil people those people
are oftentimes very evil ironically because that's a sort of
neurotic self reflection you see true self reflection would involve
you being conscious of your own self judgment yourself criticism
and your guilt and your shame and not being reactive
to it which most people are not conscious of they
confuse these for honest self reflection but these things are
not anything to do with truth these are just more
tools the devil uses in order to trick himself on
ever deeper layers now of course every double must deny
what I'm saying here they must because if they admitted
this and they really followed the breadcrumb trail it would
lead to their demise which is why a lot of
people hold this topic to be controversial and they will
debate with me they'll say this and they'll say that
and I'll have all these rebuttals but um just a
game that's the devil's game he plays that game that's
just ideology that's what ideology does is it it goes
into arguments and debates and philosophy and ethics and all
this it's a lot simple than that it just requires
enormous self-honesty now the question arises how can a benevolent
God allow for evil if God is as they say
infinite and all-powerful and omniscient and all loving why the
evil well of course this question is asked from the
devil's perspective that's the problem with this question to God
nothing is evil to the devil anything that threatens the
devil that's what's evil so how does a benevolent infinite
God allow for evil very simply God is everything God
is infinite there's nothing that isn't God God has to
be everything it's inevitable there are no boundaries than God
which means that God must of course include every single
boundary possible which of course includes the boundary view the
boundary of me the boundary of your nation the boundary
of your country the boundary of your family all these
boundaries these are all what it means for God to
be God so God is not separate from the devil
if you think that that's only because your devil God
is the devil duality is non duality from the perspective
of non duality non-duality and do allottee are identical literally
identical from the perspective of duality there's only duality that's
the irony of this thing God in creating boundaries within
itself creates also ignorant the infinite consciousness must also include
infinite ignorant so God is playing this game with itself
and that's what you are that's what's conscious of me
right now that's what I am we're one but we
think we're two that's how it works it's hard to
wrap your mind around this else you actually experience it
for yourself now some people might say but Leo isn't
the devil bad no the devil isn't bad to think
the devil is bad is being more of a devil
make sure you're not confusing what I'm saying here as
any kind of imperative for how you should behave I
said nothing about whether you should or shouldn't fight Nazis
whether you should or shouldn't lock up criminals or rapists
and whether you should or shouldn't stop Devils that's not
what we're discussing we're discussing the mechanics the really deep
existential mechanics here how you then behave you're free to
do whatever you want and a lot of people misinterpret
that and they think that well leo what you're talking
about here is moral relativism which means that we don't
stop the Nazis when the tanks come rolling through our
streets and then that's bad for everybody no that's only
bad for you as a self-hating the devil and hating
evil is just more evil people think they can stop
evil by hating it by condemning it by criticizing it
no you can't you just add more to it that's
why we're focused not on actions because actions are external
actions are already deceptions of the devil the devil will
feed you with ideas of like where but Nazis in
tariffs we got to stop them all they're gonna threaten
me yeah they're gonna threaten you that's the whole point
you're so preoccupied with saving yourself that you will commit
all manner of evil to do it which is the
tragedy we have is the tragedy of the Commons everybody
is afraid of everybody else and therefore everybody is perpetrating
evil upon everybody else and that's the only reason evil
exists so I'm not telling you that you need to
be a goody two-shoes I'm not saying that devil is
bad I'm not saying you should stop being a devil
I just want you to become conscious of the fact
that you are a devil without necessarily doing anything about
it just become conscious just by the fact that you
become conscious watch what happens then your behavior will start
to change in very interesting ways okay let's take a
quick intermission here don't go anywhere I'll be back in
a second all right let's talk about how to stop
evil what do you got to do there first you
have to recognize very deeply that seeing evil in others
does not solve evil but in fact creates the evil
which you seek to stop the solution to evil is
to see it within yourself to see that you're the
devil it's very easy to see other people as Devils
the hardest thing is to admit to yourself that you're
the devil notice that trying to rid the world of
evil only creates more evil that's the trap that's the
trap that 99% of people do not understand thereby they
go and create more evil condemning evil is antithetical the
truth because in truth evil doesn't exist it's a concept
it's a projection there are two facets to evil one
is the facet of not doing evil yourself eliminating selfish
actions in other words the other facet that people overlook
is the seeing of evil in the world so if
you want to stop doing evil actions you also have
to stop seeing evil because in order to see evil
you must project evil therefore you create evil this is
where people get stuck they don't think they create evil
by seeing it but of course you do because evil
is a concept but most people don't realize that evil
as a concept the truth is is that there could
be no such thing as evil because everything is non-dual
everything is one everything is infinitely interconnected so who are
you calling evil whatever you call evil is actually you
the question is do you realize it or not see
when you see that everything is you and that there
are no boundaries then it makes no more sense to
call things evil because you'd be calling yourself evil and
what's the point of attaching a label or a concept
to something which is itself the label adds nothing to
it the label only has a practical value if you
somehow separate yourself from the other who you're attaching the
label to then it does some kind of work but
once you see through that then you don't need it
to do that kind of work anymore the tragedy of
evil is that in trying to stop it you create
it this is very difficult for people to understand they
tend to think like well but some stuff léo it
really is even like the Nazis really are evil we
need to stop them and in trying to stop the
Nazis we don't create Nazis well actually you do actually
do it's interesting actually because in World War two when
the Allies were fighting the Nazis and the Americans were
fighting the Nazis there was a whole propaganda ministry in
the u.s. here and they made posters you can go
google and look at some of those posters where they
actually demonize Nazis drew them with like fangs literally like
a demon why did they do that because creating this
idea or this story of evil helps to rally people
around your cause and then it's easier to get them
to go do some kind of action and especially if
the action you want them to do is to kill
other human beings to bomb them to burn them to
torture them to shoot them then you got to demonize
them cuz you know what it turns out it turns
out that human beings don't like killing other human beings
when they see that that human being is just like
them that creates way too much cognitive dissonance now the
objection that comes up here is of course people say
but Leo if we don't stop the Nazis then they're
gonna come here and they're gonna take over and they're
gonna kill us all and thence the world will be
ruled by Nazis is that what you're advocating of course
not what I'm advocating is understanding the mechanics of calling
things evil and seeing evil in the world and co-creating
evil with your mind if you want to stop the
Nazis you can stop the Nazis without calling them evil
you don't need to print posters of demon Nazis in
order to fight Nazis but there is even a deeper
point and this is one that people just do not
want to hear which is that if Nazis roll through
your town and they want to kill you and your
family and destroy your nation then that might happen see
the problem is that people are so focused on self
defense being an ego that they lose sight of the
truth the only tend to care about the truth when
it serves them but see in this case usually what
people will say is well if we have to fudge
things you know fair to print some posters with Nazi
demons on them that's okay that's just part and parcel
of fighting the Nazis sometimes we got to do that
we got to fudge the truth a little bit in
order to survive to thrive to live to reproduce to
maintain our values and my point is not that that's
wrong or right my point is exactly that's what the
ego does it defends itself at all costs regardless of
truth it doesn't care about the truth it cares about
survival and survival is falsehood but the problem is that
you're so attached to survival that you can't see the
value of truth for truths sake because you're asking the
question from a perspective of the ego which only cares
about survival so the ego is always going to ask
well Lea what's the point of truth if it doesn't
help me to survive and to thrive and what that
is is that's exactly what the devil does it works
in that way that's the mechanism of the devil maybe
to access the truth you have to die maybe that's
how reality works but you'll never know if all you
care about is survival and what benefits the truth might
bring you you'll never know because all you care about
is survival you see the 22 here also notice that
the desire to end evil is itself selfish the only
reason you really care about stopping evil is because it
disturbs you and why does it disturb you because it
threatens your ability to be an ego so really the
reason that you are opposed to selfishness in others is
because very ironically it tends to thwart your own selfishness
and what you want to do is you want to
reserve the right to be as selfish as you can
possibly be therefore you need to preempt the selfishness of
others it's because you want to be the biggest devil
that you are afraid of Devils see the problem with
being a devil is that you have competition yeah you
see you're not the only devil if you were the
only devil in town well you could feel great you
just run around doing your devil stuff and no problem
but the problem is of course is that there's always
bigger Devils where does it end it seems like you
can have infinite degrees of devil miss so be careful
about misinterpreting everything I'm saying here as a demand that
you be a good person the demand to be a
good person plays into what the devil is doing the
problem is not good versus evil the problem is the
dichotomy the fact that you even drew a line between
the two that's the problem people think that no Leo
if I just go be good that will take care
of the evil no I won't it won't cuz you're
creating the dichotomy in doing that you're creating that Icona
me you're literally creating it it's only after you see
really deeply see what I'm talking about here that a
solution to evil really presents itself human beings have been
fighting evil for thousands of years have you ever wondered
how come it hasn't been vanquished maybe it's because the
way that human beings intuitively want to fight evil is
by becoming good and they think that's gonna do it
mm-hmm it's not gonna do it because the solution is
deeply counterintuitive it's perhaps the most counterintuitive thing there is
it's turning against yourself the solution to evil if you
really care to stop it is to acknowledge that you
are the devil yourself to deeply see that to see
all the ways in which you do it and this
is not something that you just admit in five minutes
or from watching this episode this will require months and
years of patience self observation seeing how you behave like
a devil in an objective way without guilting yourself so
that's step number one step number two is committing to
truth for truth sake committing to consciousness for consciousnesses sake
and setting that as your highest priority rather than your
own pleasure or your own survival and step number three
is surrendering to the truth even if it means the
death of you and this means dropping all your opinions
all your judgments and all your ideology about life and
especially about good and evil and now you can really
appreciate why nobody does this who on earth would take
this deal up who on earth would pursue truth for
true sake at the cost of the self if your
very existence is at stake your ego is not [
__ ] around your very existence is at stake here
even though the ego is conceptual it doesn't feel conceptual
it feels physical so when you really understand what I'm
saying here you will realize that this what I'm saying
seems very idealistic perhaps to you / cisely because what
you're being asked to do is to surrender everything pragmatic
your entire life to truth without really knowing where that's
gonna lead you and you have a lot to lose
you have your whole life to lose here potentially in
this bargain so of course you don't want to make
this bargain you want to stay being a devil and
I don't blame you 99.99999% of people on earth make
the same choice but once you see this at least
you'll understand why they make the choice and why you
make the choice you see it's not about demonizing people
I'm not here to demonize Devils I am just trying
to expose the mechanics of how this works if you
want you can eliminate all the world's evil simply by
turning inward that's all that's required you don't need to
fight Nazis or terrorist or any of that solve the
problem of evil in yourself how do you solve this
problem of evil is it by restraining yourself from having
sex and stealing money and chasing houses and cars and
this sort of stuff no not at all it's by
erasing the self erase this boundary of the self that
you have drawn and then what will happen is ego
death you will realize the truth of no self that
is enlightenment that is awakening once you awaken then you'll
realize that nothing can be evil because you'll see that
evil is just a projection a story in your mind
and if that happens then of course the devil has
been redeemed and has become God by surrendering yourself to
truth that is the only way the devil can be
purified of himself the devil doesn't have the power to
purify himself because he's not real the devil must turn
to the source the source is God turn to God's
light God's light will purify you and burn the devil
out of you now of course this sounds nicer than
it actually feels in real life because don't forget that
the devil here is you and now imagine that you
are the vampire who is thrown out in the midday
Sun and he's burned by the light the light burns
you it's called zyou it pains you it's emotionally scarring
it's difficult and as a vampire it's not easy to
take to all your vampire friends you know what guys
I am gonna go walk out during the midday Sun
right in the middle of town square and I'm just
gonna sit there and lounge around in the Sun so
you know to vampires that doesn't work because that means
their death but of course what the vampires don't realize
is that if they actually did do that after the
devil in them has been purified what remains is God
and that's a really beautiful thing if you ever get
to experience it now don't make the mistake of thinking
that just because your post egodeath that now your body
can't be armed so by going through this awakening you
will eliminate evil forever in all the world but your
body could still be harmed see people have this silly
notion of what it means to eliminate evil in the
world they think that to eliminate even the world what
has to happen is we have to stop all the
violence stop all the theft stop all the rape but
see that stuff was never evil to eliminate evil in
the world what has to happen to have to eliminate
the concept of evil stop projecting it and also stop
doing it you can easily well not that easily but
you can stop doing a lot of it yourself once
you become conscious enough but also you're gonna stop creating
it by stopping seeing it now of course people say
well Lia that's just semantics you're just playing some word
games because what you're basically saying is that your version
of a limited evil in the world is just for
me to stop thinking that things are evil but in
fact I can still get killed my daughter can still
get raped and my nation can still get attacked by
foreign power and there could be a nuclear war and
you're right all of that stuff can happen but you
know what it can happen anyways you can't prevent any
of that stuff really you can fight it and fight
it and fight it but it still gonna be there
we've been fighting violence with violence for thousands of years
and guess what we still have lots of violence and
we still will for many many centuries to come the
trick is not to stop violence the trick is to
understand what it's about and also to stop being so
defensive to the point where you're not offended if violence
is done to you not that you go seeking out
violence not that you want to become a victim not
that you want to give people license to abuse you
no not at all but you want to dis identify
with all the material stuff in life including your physical
body and your mind and all your ideas and all
your beliefs and once you're detached from that then you're
not gonna care so much about what happens with the
body and with your life because no matter what happens
your body is still always in jeopardy your mind is
always in jeopardy and they will die that's their nature
they're temporary that's a game you can never win but
what you can do is you can realize that you're
not them and by doing this dis identification now you're
set free and you're not worried anymore and literally this
is how the problem of evil is solved it's counterintuitive
because it's fundamentally a conceptual problem but mistaken as a
physical problem now to really bring all of this home
to you I want to help you to do this
imagination exercise this really helps me to to reconcile evil
for myself so what I want you to do is
I want you to imagine that right now you're living
life as this particular being that you are or that
you think you are you have this particular perspective you're
this human being who is born you were given this
name and here you are alive but now I want
you to imagine that from the universe's perspective from God's
perspective there are all these billions upon billions and trillions
of other creatures and other beings alive all over the
universe and even though right now you just feel like
you're one of these perspectives I want you to to
take God's perspective and to see that as God you
will inhabit every single one of those perspectives of all
those creatures and I really want you to imagine this
so imagine for example that a couple hundred years ago
you were alive as a slave and you were beaten
and worked until you died and then you were hung
and that was your fate really imagine that live through
that not as some other not as some other person's
life but as your life you lived through that and
now imagine yourself as a concentration camp victim you and
your family were all rounded up and put into these
concentration camps you were starved you were beaten you were
tortured and ultimately you were led into ovens and you
were burnt and as you were gap being gassed and
burn in these ovens your fingerprints were clawing at the
concrete walls of this gas chamber and that was your
life that was your perspective not as some other but
this is you you're living through that and now imagine
that you had a family you had a nice daughter
that you loved perhaps you were the mother or the
father and that she was raped and you lived through
that and imagine that you were the mother and the
father and also the daughter herself and you were raped
and see how that feels and now imagine that you
are a family living in the Middle East someplace like
Iraq or Afghanistan just a regular farming family let's say
or a merchant family and your entire house was blown
up at a drone strike because hey some mistake and
military intelligence thought that you were harboring some terrorists you
weren't but they thought maybe you were so they decided
that it's better to take you out so they took
out your entire compound entire house an entire family and
yourself was killed so imagine that that's your life you
lived through that now also imagine that you're an ant
crawling along the sidewalk and some little kid is running
to get his ice cream cone during the summer and
as he's running toward his ice cream cone very excited
to get his ice cream cone what does he do
he just steps on you he doesn't see you cuz
you're this little little ant and he's this big kid
he just stands steps on you and squishes you now
imagine being that ant getting squished on and notice what
that feels like imagine that you're a pack mule perhaps
in the ancient Roman times and you're working to to
lug giant stones and stuff for building public works and
as a pack mule they just work you to death
it barely feed you they barely give you water they
leave you out in the cold they don't care about
you and eventually you starve to death from being overworked
and malnourished and imagine what it's like to be that
pack mule that's your whole life or imagine that you're
a big cat on Safari like a lion and some
businessman from Wall Street from the u.s. flies over on
safari in Africa and shoots you and that's the end
of your life imagine you live through that you didn't
even know what hit you you were just laying there
on the rocks basking the Sun and then you get
a bullet through your heart or imagine that you're a
pig in a factory farm where you were born and
raised you didn't even see the light of day you
never even saw the Sun or grass you were just
raised in this kind of metal warehouse and you were
given a little tiny space that you can barely circle
around in and you just live there in your own
feces amongst all your other Pig friends and then you
were butchered for food and that's your whole life that's
your existence that's you imagine that these kind of exercises
are really helpful to see the other side that the
devil doesn't want you to see the part that people
don't realize is that since you are God and since
God is one and since there is nothing else outside
of God that means every single life and every single
perspective that ever was and ever will be is identical
to you in the sense that you will experience all
of them and you actually already have you just don't
have a memory of it see right now the only
reason you can be so complacent about all the evil
in the world is because you're sitting there you're living
in a first world country probably if you're watching me
and you have a very cushy lifestyle now in the
21st century even if you're struggling in life you still
have an extremely cushy lifestyle and still you want and
you [ __ ] and you moan and you complain
but you don't realize that you literally were the slaves
you were the concentration camp victims you were all these
butchered animals not only were you them but you were
also their abusers you were Hitler you were Stalin you
were the terrorists you're all of them because there's no
boundaries that's what non-duality means but when you are conscious
of that really conscious of it not just as a
thought experiment but you're actually conscious of it can you
start to see how that might change your behavior not
in a moralistic sense of like oh you shouldn't eat
meat or you shouldn't do that or you shouldn't harm
people no no no not at level at a much
much deeper level where you realize the oneness of it
all I want you to spend the next week living
your life consciously reminding yourself that everyone you interact with
from your parents to the people at your work to
the ants that you see on the sidewalk that all
of them are you and that you're living as all
those perspectives you just don't have access to it through
your current memory because what it means to be you
is to not have memory of those things see and
notice what difference that makes in your life just observe
what you'll find is that you start to walk through
the world very lightly very carefully because you just naturally
then don't want to inflict unnecessary suffering on other beings
and that's ultimately what spirituality boils down to once you
become conscious of that interconnection of everything then you start
to act like it but you have to be careful
not to put the cart before the horse don't start
to act like it if you don't really feel it
because that leads to actually more devilry when you start
telling yourself how you're supposed to feel and how you're
supposed to act you have to actually do the work
do the consciousness work start with this exercise take it
seriously don't take it as just an exercise don't say
oh well Leo you're just talking about reincarnation that's some
sort of Hindu concept no no I'm not this is
not a concept you literally have experienced what it's like
to be every single human that was ever alive and
that currently alive and that will ever be alive you
just don't have access to it as itself right now
shocking but that's non-duality when you realize that that will
show you the way out the way out of your
devilry it's only after you try to stop being selfish
try to stop being a self and fail at it
over and over and over and over again struggle with
this consciousness work for years falling off track getting back
on track falling off track getting back on track only
then will you really start to appreciate why so much
evil exists in the world because you'll have an appreciation
for how difficult it is to exorcise the demon from
within you and then of course you'll be much more
sympathetic towards the challenges that other people face in exercising
their own demons do you want unconditional love and tranquility
in your life are you sure are you really sure
then surrender all notions of evil forever that's the price
you got to pay with enlightenment comes the corollary that
you will never be able to criticize or condemn anyone
ever again for any action whatsoever including the most heinous
and disgusting actions you can possibly imagine because all these
condemnation criticisms are fundamentally false so if you really want
to be conscious if you want to be as enlightened
as possible then you're gonna have to drop all these
criticisms and that's something people really hate to admit say
Cleo I'll do anything I'll be good but just let
me keep my ability to criticize and demonize others just
let me have that it feels so good I'm so
addicted to it I love it so much it's so
important Leo if I don't have that how am I
gonna stop all the evil stuff in the world that's
how the devil thinks but hopefully now you have enough
of the theoretical foundation to see why this is so
misguided and why it actually is a catch-22 that circles
back around and creates the very thing that it tries
to stop all right that's it I'm done here please
