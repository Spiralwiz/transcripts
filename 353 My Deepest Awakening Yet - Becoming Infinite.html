            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/RNgns7nQ7rs' target='_blank'>My Deepest Awakening Yet - Becoming Infinite</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Experience of Total Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura describes an experience he calls total enlightenment where he 'became everything', with all boundaries disappearing. He describes himself as becoming infinite in infinite directions and in infinite dimensions, marking the end of the materialistic paradigm.
</li><li><b>Nature of Reality</b>: In his enlightened state, Gura understands that reality is merely 'infinity'. He discusses the idea that everyone is at the center of infinity, yet only experiences a small piece of it, being attached to their body and mind. However, Gura claims to have broken free from these confinements, realizing he is the 'entire singularity'.
</li><li><b>Infinity as The State of Being</b>: Gura highlights infinity as the only state of being, existing beyond existence and non-existence, tangible and intangible. He enfolds every possibility, including the feeling of not experiencing everything, within the concept of infinity. He underscores the paradox in infinity as the ultimate unlimited set that includes all possible 'finitudes' or limitations.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Physical Reality</b>: Gura also elaborates on his understanding of the physical world through his enlightenment, stating there is no difference between himself and any physical object, sentient or non-sentient. In his view, all physical things are equivalent and identical to himself, with everything reduced to mere 'being'.
</li><li><b>Achieving Enlightenment</b>: Leo discusses the transformation in his levels of consciousness during this awakening. He emphasizes that this enlightenment is not an emotional or intellectual high, but a staggeringly profound realization that offers a clear and ultimate answer to the existence of everything. He admits that his description of this radically different plane of consciousness might be difficult to grasp from a normal plane of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Switching from a Human to Universal Perspective</b>: Leo describes this transition as experiencing an infinite chain reaction of every possible form that could exist, their substance being undefined and undefinable. Reality, in this sense, is likened to an infinite hologram or hallucination. 
</li><li><b>Hawaii Meditation Retreat & Frustration</b>: Upon returning from a seven-day meditation retreat in Hawaii, Leo felt increased consciousness but also dissatisfaction due to his perceived lack of progress and frustration with self-inquiry. Despite gaining valuable lessons, he did not have any significant awakening moments. 
</li><li><b>Shakti Pot Experiment</b>: Frustrated and seeking to end his spiritual quest, Leo scheduled and paid for an energy transmission session (commonly known as Shakti pot) with an enlightened psychic. Despite looking forward to this experiment, Leo's intuition told him he needed to tread the path alone, forcing him to cancel the session. 
</li><li><b>Conflict of Intuition and Ego</b>: Leo found himself grappling with the accuracy of his intuition, questioning if his decision to cancel the session was influenced by his ego, spiritual arrogance, or pride. 
</li><li><b>Resumption of 5-MeO-DMT use</b>: Following his intuition, Leo decided to use 5-MeO-DMT again, a psychedelic he had not used for around a year and a half since his last major breakthrough. Despite his apprehension, his intuition guided him to try a small dose (10 milligrams) and to administer it rectally, a new method for him. The effects began after five minutes.
</li><li><b>Navigating his Spiritual Path</b>: Leo moves forward committed to his chosen spiritual path, striving to prove the effectiveness of 5-MeO-DMT for complete enlightenment and resolve his deepest question - understanding why reality exists. Despite his apprehensions and frustrations, Leo remains open and receptive to the guidance of his intuition.
</li><li><b>Experience with rectal administration of 5-MeO-DMT</b>: Despite initial fears, Leo describes how his consciousness became infinite within five minutes of administering 5-MeO-DMT rectally. He emphasizes the crystal clarity of the experienced awakening and a deeper understanding of the absolute, which was not separate from him. Over the span of 1.5 hours, the peak of this awakening, he achieved a calm, meditative state, free from distractions.
</li><li><b>The interactions of 5-MeO-DMT and yoga practice</b>: LeoÂ’s active yoga practice to open up his chakras seemed to extend the effects of 5-MeO-DMT, leading to an increase in energy and sensitivity. Permanent rewiring of his mind occurred during the peak of the awakening while additional chakras, especially his third eye and crown, opened up.
</li><li><b>Understanding and realization of relative, absolute and infinity</b>: Following the 5-MeO-DMT trip, Leo retained a clear understanding that the relative and absolute are one, even in a sober state. Using the example of books on a table, he explains the concept of infinity as every object being arranged precisely in a manner as it exists. He expresses that death is a configuration of infinity, and he represents every possible configuration across all times simultaneously. Thus, the concept of life and death loses meaning in Leo's perspective.
</li><li><b>The long-lasting and gentle effect of rectally administering 5-MeO-DMT</b>: Compared to snorting it, the rectal administration method indicates lasting effects that are more stable, smooth, consistent and gentle, enabling a deeper understanding of consciousness within five minutes.
</li><li><b>Changes after the 5-MeO-DMT experience</b>: Leo reports gaining perfect, absolute knowledge of reality, surpassing the understanding achievable by science. He views himself as the ultimate answer and the entirety of reality simultaneously, with each moment, word and interaction being configurations within the infinite dimensions of infinity. The most drastic change is Leo feels no remaining mystery or lingering questions about the nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Infinite Possibility of Thoughts</b>: Leo Gura points out that every thought that can be possible, no matter how reasonable, insane, true, or false, is a part of his existence. Mundane understanding of knowledge transcends into a larger comprehension of only 'being.' 
</li><li><b>Sense of Satisfaction and Cessation of Seeking</b>: Leo expresses a deep sense of satisfaction in the realization of what everything is and why things exist in a certain way. He discusses the end of his 20-year-old quest for understanding existence, marking an end to his phase of seeking and hinting at reduced personal suffering. However, he urged the viewers not to cease seeking until they have reached their destination.
</li><li><b>Enhanced Awareness and Improved Meditation</b>: Leo reveals that his baseline level of awareness is heightened, as he becomes more conscious of everything around him, realizing its infinite and inevitable nature. His meditation practice has improved significantly due to his cessation of seeking, allowing him to just be still and exist as infinity. 
</li><li><b>Awareness of Inevitability and Acceptance</b>: Leo discusses his understanding that every occurrence, good or evil is part of absolute infinity and thus bears an element of inevitability. He stresses on the need to stop resisting or rejecting life, instead accepting everything as it is. Using the analogy of a person futilely criticizing a dog for its natural behavior, he emphasizes the pointlessness of criticizing inevitabilities.
</li><li><b>Insight into Nonrejection of Reality</b>: Leo's realization on the inevitability of every single possibility, has led him to a staggering insight, where he refrains from rejecting reality. Understanding that everything is a part of him, he stopped criticizing or judging people or situations, adjusting his attitude towards people and situations. Emphasizing on the inevitability of everything, from ignorance to mistakes to evil, he concludes on the importance of this insight in affecting one's attitude towards life.
</li><li><b>Stillness and Continued Growth Post-Awakening</b>: Leo admits that even after his awakening, he experiences suffering, gets triggered, and contends with addictions. He underlines that his sexual cravings may have amplified as he feels more energic. He points out that enlightenment can have different levels and degrees according to individuals, and warns not to oversimplify this process. 
</li><li><b>Embodying Awakening</b>: Leo describes his awakening as complete but acknowledges the possibility of experiencing more profound awakenings, comparing them to Peter Ralston's expression of equal depth in all awakenings. He places his current stage of enlightenment at stage 5, a form of 'mastering,' according to Zen's Ten Ox Herding Pictures. He believes there's still room for personal growth and deeper enlightenment experiences. 
</li><li><b>Embracing Five-MeO-DMT Path</b>: Leo advocates for Five-MeO-DMT as an effective tool for attaining absolute consciousness and feels he's proven this path for himself. Despite being dismissed by some enlightened masters as merely a substance, he has shattered the myth of its ineffectiveness for himself. Now, his focus is on embodying the infinite in all aspects of his life. 
</li><li><b>Living in Stillness</b>: Leo desires to spend copious amounts of time immersed in stillness, embodying the infinite in his daily life. He feels the need to accept this and channel it into his actions, emotions, behavior, meditation, and interpersonal relationships, which he believes is the essence of his ongoing work. Despite the appeal of retreating to a peaceful place for solitude, Leo intends to keep running Actualized.org to help guide others to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Leo's Continued Journey Post-Awakening</b>: Leo discusses his plans to still the mind, work on emotional mastery, clear energy blockages, and focus on physical health. He emphasizes the need for removing addictions, promoting healthier living and developing more compassion for others. He sees his communications becoming more loving and compassionate. 
</li><li><b>Five Meo and Its Future Role</b>: Leo plans to continue proving the effectiveness of 5-MeO with small follow-up doses, not aiming for huge breakthroughs, but rather stable experiences that help complete the integration process. He looks forward to exploring more about awakening and the insights psychedelics reveal.
</li><li><b>Unfolding Path and Life Purpose</b>: Leo feels calm and grounded, with a clear path ahead. His life purpose - teaching, writing books, creating videos, researching techniques, experiencing other mystical states - has been strengthened by his awakening. He wishes for his followers to become conscious of the purpose of existence, encouraging them to persist until they're certain of why everything exists.
</li><li><b>Continued Personal Transformation and Growth</b>: Over the next six months, Leo anticipates a significant transformation as he works to embody all he has learned. He expresses openness to new experiences, teaching styles, places and talks about being more spontaneous and adventurous in the future. He hopes his journey and transformations inspire others on a similar path.
