            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/gn1-lBpD_6c' target='_blank'>Jacques Derrida, Deconstruction, Post-Modernism & Nonduality</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Derrida's Work</b>: Leo Gura draws from various sources, including a book ("Derrida for beginners" by Jim Powell) and two papers (David Loy's "The Deconstruction of Buddhism" and "The Modern Intellectual Tradition: From Descartes to Derrida" by Professor Lawrence Cahoone) to discuss philosopher Jacques Derrida's profound impact on academic fields ranging from literature to philosophy, art, architecture, and anthropology. 
</li><li><b>Structuralism to Post-structuralism</b>: Derrida's ideas were born in the aftermath of structuralism, a linguistic philosophy movement led by Ferdinand de Saussure and Claude Levi-Strauss. Saussure and Levi-Strauss posited that all symbols in language are arbitrary, and their meaning is determined by their relationship and association with other symbols. 
</li><li><b>Derridean Deconstruction</b>: Derrida developed the philosophical method of deconstruction to question structuralism, critiquing not just structuralism but all of Western intellectual tradition and revealing how language shapes thinking and knowledge. In Derrida's view, the meaning of a symbol stems from its historical uses and its connection to other symbols in the language.
</li><li><b>Structuralism and Comprehensive Understanding</b>: For comprehensive understanding of a word like 'science,' according to Derrida's philosophy, one must consider all its historical uses and its connection to every other word in the English language. The meaning of such a word is composed of the present and absent symbols, with the absent symbols creating a background for understanding the present ones.
</li><li><b>Language and Decentralization</b>: Derrida postulated that language is decentralized, without a central authority or foundation. Meanings change over time, and humans have the power to shape these meanings. Derrida pointed out that the meaning of a symbol does not only depend on the object it represents but extends to represent another symbol, leading to a possible infinitude of meanings. 
</li><li><b>Language and Reality</b>: All human knowledge falls within the realm of language, and critiquing language, in Derrida's view, has significant implications across various academic fields. Derrida proposed a radical critique of language, suggesting that familiar concepts such as 'science' are not immutable entities but are continually evolving and influenced by their relationship with all other English words. 
</li><li><b>Derrida's Critique of Binary Oppositions</b>: Notably, Derrida's deconstruction opposes the bifurcations in Western intellectual tradition, arguing every binary opposition collapses under scrutiny, as each part of the binary suggests the other. 
</li><li><b>Decentralization of Reality and Language</b>: Gura emphasizes that Derrida's critique extends beyond language to apply to reality itself, considering both as decentralized networks without any central authority, underpinning a radical restructuring of knowledge and reality. 
</li><li><b>Power of Language and Concept in Reality Construction</b>: The mind constructs realities, often simplified and based on dualities, through the power of language and concepts. Derrida's deconstruction method challenges these constructs, advocating for collapsing these binaries. The importance of non-duality, to Derrida, lies in the realization that binary conceptions ultimately collapse because each side implies and seeks to deny or marginalize the other. 
</li><li><b>Challenging Western Intellectual Tradition</b>: Derrida questions hierarchies and power structures, criticizing Western intellectual tradition for confining the free flow of reality by constructing rigid concepts. Derrida encouraged exploring concepts without clinging to them, acknowledging the paradox inherent in philosophical inquiry.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction and Non-duality</b>: Gura explains Derrida's deconstruction links to the practice of realizing non-duality, which requires dismantling oneself to understand truths. He emphasizes the practical application of deconstruction for gaining insights. This principle of interconnectedness permeates philosophical, linguistic, and conceptual discussions, leading to a critique of established beliefs and exploration of alternate perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Language and Non-dual Experience of Reality</b>: Gura suggests that deconstruction extends beyond intellectual understanding to include the non-symbolic, direct experience of reality, aimed at realizing interconnectedness and our illusory perceptions of reality. 
</li><li><b>Groundlessness and Realizing Non-duality</b>: The connected web of language and physical reality, argues Gura, underscores the absence of a central authority or ground, resonating with the post-modernist notion of infinite expansion. The mind, functioning as a construction machine, creates a conceptual matrix and belief system that allows humans to navigate their world and survive. However, these constructions are illusions, and seeking enlightenment is crucial for transcending these constructs and realizing non-duality.
</li><li><b>Understanding the meaning of "science"</b>: The meaning of a word like "science" is derived not only from its connection to certain specific concepts but from its relations to every other word in the English language as well. Meaning is composed of both present and absent symbols, where for example, the presence of the word "science" activates the background knowledge of words like "knowledge", "truth", "proof" etc. but also involves the absence of most of the English language words.
</li><li><b>Language as a decentralized system</b>: Just like Bitcoin, language has no central authority or ground, with the meaning of symbols being relative to all uses of a symbol. Meanings have the potential to change with different users and over time. 
</li><li><b>Connection of words to other words</b>: A symbol's meaning does not point to an object in the outside world alone, but to other symbols as well. This forms an infinite chain where every symbol has an infinite potential of meanings and no meaning for a word or a concept is ever finalized.
</li><li><b>Partial understanding of the actual meaning</b>: Unless one can summon every instance of a word's usage throughout human history, understanding of the meaning is only a tiny fragment of its real definition. There is no one canonical meaning for a word. 
</li><li><b>Testing a single statement in isolation</b>: Borrowing from Klein's epistemology, no statement or proposition is tested in isolation as knowledge is a complex web of interconnected truth statements with varying probabilities. Even basic notions like true or false are colored by an individual's web of beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Interpretation of results</b>: Testing theories requires making assumptions and interpretations based on one's own knowledge and beliefs. The interpretation process isn't devoid of personal biases or beliefs. The fundamental understanding in philosophy is that there is no "interpretation-free" access to knowledge for human beings. 
</li><li><b>Testing the entire web of belief</b>: Testing a single statement actually tests the entire web of belief as our interpretations and beliefs influence the testing process. Even for seemingly straightforward statements like "snow is white", assumptions like whether one is hallucinating or not, come into play.
</li><li><b>Isomorphic Similarity between Klein's Web of Belief and Derrida's Language Theory</b>: Quine proposes that knowledge is interwoven much like Derrida's view of language; both involve interrelated meanings that vary based on context and interpretation. No objective way to interpret a text exists, since meaning is complex and interpretations differ between individuals, including the original author of a text. This suggests the absence of a fixed meaning or interpretation.
</li><li><b>Simplification and Suppression of Meanings</b>: Derrida argues that communication involves constantly narrowing down the infinite potential meanings of words to fit specific contexts, hence suppressing meanings. This process often leads to misunderstandings as people interpret words and concepts differently. This phenomenon also leads Derrida to assert that every statement is a lie, due to its confined and manipulated nature.
</li><li><b>Definition of a Symbol</b>: A symbol refers to something else but is not the item it represents. This applies in two ways: firstly, the meaning of the symbol isn't its beingfor example, the word "cat" is not a cat. Secondly, a symbol's meaning exists in its difference from another symbolthe word "cat" only has meaning through its differences from words like "bat," "mat," and "rat."
</li><li><b>Meaning as a Web of Differences</b>: Derrida coined the term "différance," asserting that all meaning involves differences and that meaning is always deferred. This implies that full comprehension of a concept or word is never achieved; instead, understanding perpetually evolves as one explores further interrelated meanings in other concepts or words.
</li><li><b>Critique of Western Intellectual Traditions</b>: Western thinkers, similar to someone outlining one specific triangle in a network of overlapping triangles, often attribute excessive weight to particular concepts or pieces of knowledge. Derrida argues this approach neglects the inherently dynamic and interrelated nature of knowledge and languageboth function more akin to a decentralized, interconnected network rather than a hierarchical structure.
</li><li><b>Derrida's Criticism of Western Intellectual Tradition</b>: Derrida criticizes Western tradition for its logo-centrism or overemphasis on language, words, and logic. He asserts that Western thought seeks to find a foundation or meta-narrative of truth and reality through language. However, Derrida argues that concepts and language are foundationless and only carry meaning in relation to other concepts.
</li><li><b>Role of Distinctions and Binary Opposites</b>: Derrida highlights that Western tradition creates distinctions and binary opposites (e.g., reality vs. illusion, existence vs. non-existence) to make sense of the world. However, these distinctions are arbitrary and ultimately collapse under scrutiny, as each part of a binary pair only gains meaning from its juxtaposition with its opposite. Moreover, Derrida criticizes Western culture for assigning privilege to one part of a binary opposite.
</li><li><b>The Fallacy of Privileging Rationality Over Emotion</b>: Derrida deconstructs the common dichotomies such as rationality vs emotion, challenging the conventional privileging of rationality over emotion. He suggests that emotions play a crucial role in compelling action and aiding decision-making, posing a fundamental challenge to the belief that 'rational' thought is superior.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction of Hierarchies and Categories</b>: Derrida's method, deconstruction, erases the hierarchies and categories that have been constructed by Western philosophy. By doing this he aims to reveal a more true and groundless state of relations within language and concepts, warning against defining one perspective as superior or 'true'.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Thought</b>: All thought, according to Derrida, is inevitably dualistic and emerges as binary opposites. Pushing these conceptual distinctions to their limits reveals that each distinction is dependent on its counterpart, and each collapse under extensive analysis.
</li><li><b>Relativism and Fluidity of Concepts</b>: The essential lack of foundation in concepts, meanings, or language results in a fluid, relative and complicated set of relations that form the mind and language. Derrida encourages embracing this relative and fluid state, undermining any one dominating perspective.
</li><li><b>Concept of Reality versus Illusion</b>: Derrida challenges the conventional understanding of reality and illusion, highlighting the privileging of reality over illusion in Western tradition. Non-duality suggests that both reality and illusion are interconnected, and that everything, including our lives and problems, are illusions. Rather than dismissing illusions, Derrida encourages us to question and challenge our understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction of Philosophy</b>: Western philosophy is critiqued for its fixation on meaning and finality, seeking to create a meta-narrative or definitive understanding of matters, such as history. Derrida argues against this, suggesting that reality and history are too complex to be encapsulated in oversimplified narratives. He highlights the constructivist bias in philosophy, which constructs a house of cards based on selected data points and creates oversimplified narratives.
</li><li><b>Understanding Deconstruction</b>: Deconstruction involves breaking down conceptual distinctions within a text, philosophy, or model until they collapse and reveal the groundlessness of the whole argument. Each side of a dichotomy contains and implies the other side, leading to an unstable system of distinctions. This method can be applied in various fields including science, philosophy, psychology, and linguistics. The core discovery through deconstruction is that reality is non-dual, and that all dualistic conceptions of reality must ultimately collapse.
</li><li><b>End Result of Deconstruction and Derrida's Thinking</b>: The outcome of Derrida's thought process and method of deconstruction is the dissolution of all justifications, hierarchies, and power structures. It results in the lack of foundations, with reality existing as a playful, free-flowing construct, unbounded by strict definitions or dichotomies. Concepts, in this understanding, do not have a fixed essence and instead represent the pure possibility of transformation. Our understanding of reality is, therefore, perpetually unmoored and de-anchored.
</li><li><b>Derrida's Deconstruction and its Impact on Academia and Culture</b>: According to Derrida, every house of cards or system of beliefs and values is susceptible to deconstruction. This radical philosophy unsettled most academics, leading to a mass dismissal of his ideas, particularly in hard sciences which emphasize practicality and results over abstract speculation on truth. However, in softer disciplines such as literature, cultural studies, and gender studies, Derrida's ideas gained some traction. His philosophy inspired considerations of relativity, challenging the privileged status of certain values or perspectives. This led to an anti-establishment political ideology stemming from post-modernism. However, most people dismissed post-modernism as impractical, creating a niche application of Derrida's philosophy.
</li><li><b>Danger of Ego Seizing on Relativity</b>: While Derrida's idea of non-duality implies absolute freedom, this can become problematic when those without a deep consciousness of non-duality seize on it as an ideology to further their own agendas. Unconscious adoption of this philosophy as an ideology can lead to its abuse, forming dogmatic beliefs on what was supposed to free us from such dogmatic thinking.
</li><li><b>Critique of Derrida's Writing</b>: Derrida's writing style is often criticized for being convoluted, non-committal, obscurantist, and sometimes interpreted as intellectual fraud. Critics suggest that his overly complicated language usage makes it seem like he is using sophisticated expression to convey nothing substantial. Derrida's incessant critique of Western intellectual tradition and his refusal to assert any definitive stances contribute to the perceived obscurity of his ideas.
</li><li><b>True Practice of Deconstruction</b>: Despite the criticisms, Derrida's work encapsulates the inherently endless process of philosophical questioning. Every intellectual structure is, in his view, a house of cards, including his own post-structuralist ideas. To truly understand and apply his philosophy requires an acceptance of the endless nature of intellectual questioning and the relentless challenge to every formed concept or belief. The non-dual nature of reality, as conveyed through Derrida's writings, can only be fully grasped through a continuous commitment to deconstruction and by keeping an open mind capable of floating with complete freedom.
</li><li><b>Critique of Derrida's Language and Writing Style</b>: Mark Goldblatt, a critic of Jacques Derrida, labels him as an "outright intellectual fraud," stating that Derrida's method of affirming and simultaneously denying claims makes him seem as if he's saying nothing substantial. The convoluted and complex nature of his writing stems from the need to simultaneously affirm and deny claims, reflecting the non-dualistic nature that he supports.
</li><li><b>Challenges tied to Language and Philosophy</b>: Derrida acknowledges the complexities tied to critiquing language through language itself  an inherent problem of self-reflection. To avoid being a hypocrite because of his harsh criticism against Western intellectual traditions, Derrida has to consciously deconstruct himself while writing, making sure there is no strong stance or firm thesis left for others to deconstruct.
</li><li><b>Limits of Derrida's Approach to Deconstruction</b>: The critique against Derrida's work is not that it's overly radical but that it falls short in fully addressing the dichotomy between language and reality, epistemology and metaphysics, and the mind and the physical world. Derrida primarily focused on language, philosophy, and academia but failed to transition beyond these areas into authentic non-duality.
</li><li><b>Derrida's Misunderstanding of Non-Duality</b>: Derrida's understanding of non-duality remained primarily conceptual. He discovered the duality within the mind and advocated for a non-dual stance in mental matters but didn't fully transcend his own minda limitation that can be attributed to his belief that humans can only access reality through language and concepts.
</li><li><b>Transcending Language and Concepts</b>: To fully tap into the essence of non-duality and reality, one needs to go beyond intellectual understanding and direct experiences of illusion towards a raw, non-symbolic, and direct experience of being. This entails transcending the mind and accessing reality not just through language and concepts, but through a deeper realm of existence.
</li><li><b>The Deconstruction of Metaphysical Reality</b>: In a quote, David Loya Zen mastermentions that Derrida's approach needed to go beyond deconstruction of language to the deconstruction of the world as we perceive it. He argues that one's perception of physical/material things as self-existing entities reflects a metaphysical standpointthat it's not just language that obscures the nature of things, but the metaphysical objectification of these things. Thus, it's this metaphysics that most needs to be deconstructed.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction beyond intellectualism</b>: According to Leo Gura, the process of deconstruction should extend beyond just intellectual ideas and philosophies to the direct experience of the physical world. This method of deconstruction would entail challenging the belief in physical bodies and real-world metaphysics, and even the idea of a physical body, which could render it a more practical philosophy. Nevertheless, the practicality of this level of deconstruction can lead to feelings of insanity depending on the depth of the process. 
</li><li><b>Deficiencies in Derrida's deconstruction</b>: Gura critiques Derrida's approach to deconstruction, arguing that Derrida fell short of fully recognizing the non-duality and groundlessness of existence because his method primarily targeted philosophies and textbooks rather than immediate experiences. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the nature of reality</b>: The nature of reality, as put by Gura, likening it to Derrida's perspective, is based on differences. This aligns with his belief that the structure and function of language closely resemble the structure and function of physical reality. Through this lens, God can be viewed as the realization that there is no definitive ground, and reality presents as an infinite web expansion, with no one entity in control. 
</li><li><b>The struggle with attachment to concepts</b>: The human mind is a construction machine, forming a matrix of conceptual constructs that aids survival. These constructs, such as morality, values, and personal beliefs, are perceived as tactile and objective. This perception of solidity is upheld because there is no tangible reality with which to compare these illusions. Therefore, while deconstruction is essential, it poses a problem as most people, including philosophers, scientists, religious individuals, and people in positions of power and leadership, resist the process due to their deep attachment to these constructs. 
</li><li><b>A call to practice deconstruction</b>: Leo Gura encourages the actual practice of deconstruction to truly realize the truth. He implies that such practice can lead to a deeper transformation and spiritual growth, where the deconstruction process actually actualizes beyond the intellectual level to affect emotions and physical reality. 
</li><li><b>Actualized.org's objective</b>: Gura presents Actualized.org as a platform aiming to expose individuals to the falsehoods that surround them due to their constructed beliefs. Then, by seeking enlightenment, they can transcend these constructs and find freedom, although the concepts and constructs of Actualized.org itself are not exempt from being considered as just another form of falsehood. 
</li><li><b>On mystical traditions and non-duality</b>: Gura discusses the thin line between constructing a spiritual ego and achieving non-duality, emphasizing that the true essence of mystical traditions, such as Buddhism, is to deconstruct oneself to discover the truth. He calls for the application of deconstruction to realize non-duality and to see past the illusions created by the mind. 
</li><li><b>On grappling with language limitations</b>: Communication of these ideas relies on language and concepts, which creates an inherent paradox due to language's limitations. As such, while embracing deconstruction provides a starting point for deeper transformation and spiritual growth, it also highlights the difficulty of transcending the mind using the mind. 
</li><li><b>Derrida's connection to Kabbalah and non-duality</b>: Gura discusses Derrida's connection to Kabbalah and how the quest for truth can lead to the insight of groundlessness, thereby realizing non-duality through the process of deconstruction.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org's purpose</b>: Actualized.org aims to show individuals that they are surrounded by common misconceptions. It presents sound, credible ideas and concepts to help them understand reality from a new perspective, acting as a solid ground amidst a "sea" of false beliefs.
</li><li><b>Experiencing reality beyond concepts</b>: While actualized.org presents structured concepts, it encourages individuals to transcend beyond these concepts and into direct experiences of reality, a state free from all constraints.
</li><li><b>The paradox of using concepts to explain fallacy of concepts</b>: Each explanation given by Leo Gura, just like Zen masters' teachings, are riddled with paradoxes. This is because attempting to explain the limitation of concepts using language and concepts itself is inherently contradictory.
</li><li><b>Limitations of the Constructive Mind</b>: The human mind tends to cling to conceptual ideas and structures. This, according to Leo Gura, prevents individuals from making the jump into non-duality or the realization of interconnectedness and complexity of existence.
</li><li><b>Role of Actualized.org in Self-Actualization</b>: Although the guidance and concepts provided by actualized.org play a crucial role in helping individuals navigate the complexity of existence, they are not to be considered as the ultimate end goal. The site serves as a stepping stone towards achieving non-duality or the interconnectedness of existence.
</li><li><b>Importance of Practicing Deconstruction</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of practicing the method of deconstruction to realize the truth. Deconstruction, in this context, refers to the process of challenging and breaking down belief systems and concepts to seek out the underlying truth.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of Various Concepts</b>: Gura concludes the lecture by highlighting the interconnectedness of various concepts and ideas. Each topic of Actualized.org and its findings reveal intricate connections and deep insights about the complex nature of existence. This exploration of concepts, although not necessary for enlightenment, is presented as an enriching and worthwhile pursuit for the intellectually or conceptually inclined.
