            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/lbOC_tYRNoE?si=m6SyOPo5rvyPB57K' target='_blank'>The Ultimate Guide To Happiness - How Happiness Works</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to the topic of happiness</b>: Leo Gura introduces the topic of happiness, grounded in psychology and philosophy. His insights are shaped by personal experiences and extensive academic study. Despite having chronic health problems, he has achieved high levels of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Unhappiness from chronic health issues</b>: Leo addresses the impact of health on happiness, sharing that despite his deep understanding of what brings happiness, chronic health issues have been an obstacle to his own happiness. He emphasizes the importance of health to happiness, which is often overlooked until one faces health issues.
</li><li><b>Need for proper living for happiness</b>: Leo asserts that living properly and having the right attitude towards life is crucial for achieving happiness. The quality of life is not determined solely by external circumstances but more importantly, by internal character and attitudes.
</li><li><b>Unconditionality and conditions of happiness</b>: Leo challenges the notion of unconditional happiness. He states that happiness is highly conditional and fragile. Even though spiritual pursuits can lead to less conditioned happiness, he emphasizes that constructing a life that provides the best circumstances for happiness is essential.
</li><li><b>Importance of proper philosophy in understanding happiness</b>: Leo reinforces the role of proper philosophy in understanding happiness. He asserts that understanding what constitutes a good life plays a critical role in achieving true happiness.
</li><li><b>Variety in routes to happiness</b>: Leo emphasizes that there is not a single right way to live. He suggests that there are multiple ways to live that lead to happiness, underlining the individual nature of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Conflation between Success and Happiness</b>: He draws a clear distinction between success and happiness. Leo states that although societal norms often conflate the two, they are not the same. His argument is that often, success is achieved through unethical means which do not align with happiness.
</li><li><b>Living Virtuously Instead of Chasing Pleasure</b>: According to Leo, happiness stems from living virtuously and developing good character rather than from merely chasing pleasure.
</li><li><b>Counterproductive pursuit of happiness</b>: Leo warns against blind pursuit of happiness that doesn't involve self-reflection or an understanding of individual needs. He argues that pursuing unrealistic ideals of happiness can lead to misery. 
</li><li><b>Living according to one's character for happiness</b>: Emphasis is placed on leading a life that aligns with one's character for true happiness. He discourages pursuing external goods excessively, considering them as secondary to cultivating one's character.
</li><li><b>Problems with modern culture and pursuit of happiness</b>: Leo criticizes modern culture and its artificial environment which makes the pursuit of happiness more challenging. Society's emphasis on fame and materialism is seen as an obstacle to achieving happiness. 
</li><li><b>Impact of natural environments and societal structures on happiness</b>: In contrast to modern life, Leo posits that natural environments and simpler societal structures of the past enforced habits that cultivated good character, and hence happiness. The survivalist lifestyle of our ancestors required the development of virtues such as a strong work ethic. He implies that living according to these natural laws can lead to genuine happiness.
</li><li><b>Definition of true happiness as per capitalism and societal norms</b>: According to Leo Gura, societal norms, capitalist incentives, and market forces severely distort people's understanding of true happiness. By emphasizing quick solutions and the purchase of materially gratifying items, society conditions individuals towards a cycle of dissatisfaction where they constantly consume temporary solutions to their unhappiness. This cycle prevents them from realizing that true happiness cannot be bought and is the result of lifestyle changes and character development cultivated over years.
</li><li><b>Critical view on contemporary lifestyle and its impact on happiness</b>: In modern society, individuals can easily fall into unhappiness by adopting artificial lifestyles devoid of virtue. Examples of these lifestyle choices include spending excessive time playing video games, consuming harmful media, indulging in drugs, among other unvirtuous activities. Such lifestyles make individuals neglect developing their character and living virtuously, leading to a cessation in their growth towards obtaining true happiness.
</li><li><b>The importance of a personal inquiry into the nature of happiness</b>: Leo highlights the necessity for every individual to conduct their investigation into the nature of happiness. This involves questioning what makes one, in particular, happy and observing the aspects of life contributing to their happiness or unhappiness. Self-observation leads to the reshaping of one's mind, priorities, desires, and value systems, ultimately resulting in increased happiness.
</li><li><b>The Role of Honesty in Discovering True Happiness</b>: Being honest with oneself about what brings happiness is crucial. Sometimes individuals may fall into the trap of investing a significant amount of time and energy into activities they believe should make them happy, but doesn't. It's important to distinguish between the idea of happiness aka theoretical happiness (rooted in societal norms and expectations or influenced by others) and actual, experientially based happiness.
</li><li><b>Differentiating between happiness plans and actual sources of happiness </b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of developing the ability to differentiate between the idea or theoretical concept of something that should make one happy and the actual experience itself. For example, he thought working at a large game development studio would make him happy, but he discovered he was happier working on indie games. He notes that the process of observation and honesty is key to avoid falling into traps of theoretical happiness.
</li><li><b>Necessity of Customizing the Approach to Happiness</b>: According to Leo, the approach to discover what makes an individual truly happy should be personalized, taking into account one's personality type, genetic temperament, level of development, and maturity. There's no one-size-fits-all path to happiness. Hence, instead of following general advice or observing someone else's path, individuals need to find what resonates with them and aligns with their uniqueness.
</li><li><b>Understanding levels of development and personality for happiness</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of understanding one's level of psychological development and personality type in achieving happiness. He points out that spiritual gurus, who are usually at a more advanced stage of development and maturity, may offer advice that doesn't align with one's current stage of life or personality; hence the importance of determining one's level of development and taking personality tests like Myers Briggs, the big five, and Enneagram.
</li><li><b>Variables that affect the kind of happiness one needs</b>: Leo suggests individuals identify their level of ambition, and whether they are more conservative or liberal, to understand what kind of lifestyle will suit them. He also advises accounting for facets like artistic inclination, risk tolerance, need for socialization, and leadership role preference among others.
</li><li><b>Finding ways to be happy based on individual preferences</b>: Gura emphasizes the significance of knowing oneself deeply and using that knowledge to lead a fulfilling life aligned with ones preferences. From temperament to interest, he encourages self-exploration and observation to recognize what actually contributes to one's personal happiness.
</li><li><b>Role of life experiences and age in understanding happiness</b>: Leo points out that understanding what truly makes one happy becomes clearer over time and with age as individuals amass life experiences. He suggests young individuals actively seek out experiences for self-understanding, while older individuals should focus on reflecting upon their experiences to draw meaningful conclusions.
</li><li><b>Happiness varies based on spiritual maturity and development</b>: He clarifies that not everyone requires spirituality for happiness, as it heavily depends on individual spiritual maturity and development. Less mature and developed individuals may find spirituality burdensome, while more mature and developed individuals may not be happy without it.
</li><li><b>Understanding oneself through experience</b>: Leo stresses that happiness comes from self-understanding and awareness, achieved through exposure to different life experiences and observing personal responses to them. It is important to learn from experiences and reflect on them to gain insights into personal happiness requirements.
</li><li><b>General Points About Happiness</b>: Happiness is about satisfaction and contentment, not short-term pleasure. Chasing raw pleasure provides only temporary spikes in the dopamine system, while contentment is a steady state of happiness driven by the serotonin system. Happiness requires long-term cultivation and dedication to personal development.
</li><li><b>Material Objects and Happiness</b>: Material possessions like money, cars, houses, and luxury items can bring momentary pleasure, but they do not lead to lasting happiness. As one matures and develops spiritually, the importance of material possessions diminishes and the need for spiritual contentment increases.
</li><li><b>Success vs. Happiness</b>: Success and happiness are not the same thing. Massive success does not equate to happiness, and often requires neglecting personal growth and character development. Happiness is about who you are and how you live, not what you possess.
</li><li><b>Difference Between Pleasure and Meaning</b>: Pleasure and meaning are not the same. Most people chase pleasure instead of creating meaning in their lives. A meaningful life generates a steady income of happiness, while pleasure is often inconsistent and unreliable.
</li><li><b>Creating a Meaningful Life</b>: The key to creating a meaningful life lies in living in alignment with one's highest values and evolving priorities over time. This involves identifying and prioritizing personal values. Building a life of happiness requires maturing and evolving one's desires, not merely acting them out. 
</li><li><b>Self-Conflict and Happiness</b>: It is impossible to be happy while continually fighting with oneself. Self-conflict about decisions can lead to unhappiness. Identifying and rectifying internal conflicts is key to achieving a state of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Role of Material Possessions</b>: Material possessions such as money, cars, or houses can provide temporary pleasure, but they do not contribute to lasting happiness. Building real happiness requires long-term investment in personal growth and character development. 
</li><li><b>Spirituality and Personal Development</b>: As individuals mature and develop, the importance of material possessions diminishes while the importance of spirituality increases. Spiritual awareness and contentment become more vital to individuals' sense of happiness than material possessions.
</li><li><b>Happiness and Life Purpose</b>: Identifying personal values and aligning actions with those values plays a major role in establishing a meaningful and happy life. It requires a deep understanding of one's life purpose and top values in order to create a life of satisfaction and happiness.
</li><li><b>Improvement of desires quality</b>: Conscious engagement and observation of lower conscious desires can improve the quality of desires leading to increased happiness. The consequences of lower conscious desires often results in unhappiness, hence their observation drives a shift to higher set of desires. 
</li><li><b>Manipulation as a happiness strategy</b>: Attempts to manipulate reality to attain happiness often leads to failure and misery. A total manipulation of reality is an unrealistic expectation of the ego, hence efforts towards such manipulations are futile. Observing the connection between manipulation and consequent misery is vital. Highly manipulative strategies are counterproductive to the attainment of happiness.
</li><li><b>Unhappiness from short-term goals and temporary enjoyment</b>: Engaging in activities like attending comedy shows or playing video games without a larger purpose leads to temporary happiness and doesn't contribute to long-term growth or meaning. However, these activities can be transformed into opportunities for learning, growth, or skill development, thus building long-term capital in meaning and satisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Factors leading to unhappiness</b>: Unhappiness stems from factors such as the pursuit of short-term pleasure, chasing material objects, fame or approval, naive and reckless behavior, unalignment with personal values and immorality. Miseries are also fueled by scenarios of disrespect, financial struggles, stagnation, procrastination, health problems, and addiction. An inability to control oneself, victim mentality, lack of freedom, and compulsive behavior are additional potential sources of unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Importance of health in happiness</b>: Health is a vital factor in happiness. Chronic health problems can result in frequent unhappiness and even the most amount of spiritual, financial or sexual fulfillment cannot compensate for a lack of good health. Some aspects of health are controllable such as diet and exercise, some are tied to genetical factors. Therefore, individuals with health concerns must find ways to derive happiness despite these obstacles. 
</li><li><b>Observation of individual circumstances</b>: It is crucial to recognize that people's circumstances differ significantly, making it harder for certain individuals to attain happiness. Challenges such as living in war zones, encountering severe poverty, grappling with poor health and feeling powerless can act as severe barriers to happiness.
</li><li><b>Unhappiness and Authoritarian Control</b>: Living under strict and authoritarian control, particularly by a father figure, can lead to substantial unhappiness. It's crucial not to accept such conditions passively and instead take proactive steps to change the situation.
</li><li><b>Hopelessness and Lack of Change</b>: The feeling of hopelessness, especially in unchanging circumstances, is a major source of misery. To foster happiness even in difficult situations, start taking action towards improving your circumstances, the process of which can bring you happiness.
</li><li><b>Toxic Relationships and Absence of Boundaries</b>: Being in toxic or abusive relationships, whether familial or romantic, contributes significantly to unhappiness. It's essential to set boundaries, extract oneself from toxicity, and prioritize authentic self-expression.
</li><li><b>Cult Involvement and Constant Conflict</b>: Involvement in cults or continuous conflict with others hampers happiness due to manipulation and emotional strain. Striving for peace or removal from the situation is necessary.
</li><li><b>Mental Illnesses and Emotional Volatility</b>: Mental disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia make happiness challenging without proper management. High emotional volatility and engagement in drama undermine peace, which is key for happiness.
</li><li><b>Misguided Philosophy and Lack of Emotional Intelligence</b>: Bad forms of philosophy such as nihilism, cynicism, etc., ignorance, and lack of emotional intelligence lead to unhappiness. To foster happiness, it's important to educate oneself, develop emotional intelligence, and steer clear from ideologies and dogmas that hamper personal growth.
</li><li><b>Regrets, Guilt, and Insecurity</b>: Feelings of regrets, guilt, and shame significantly contribute to unhappiness. Similarly, fears, insecurities, and anxiety can impede the pursuit of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Avoidance of Responsibility and Challenges</b>: Taking on more responsibility than one can handle, or alternatively, avoiding responsibility and challenges can lead to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Physical Appearance and Obligations You Don't Believe In</b>: Discontent with physical appearance and fulfilling obligations that don't resonate with personal beliefs can result in unhappiness. Acceptance of one's appearance and refraining from unaligned obligations are necessary for happiness.
</li><li><b>The pros and cons of marriage</b>: Good and well-maintained marriages can lead to happiness, but unhappy marriages, especially those with poor communication and lack of mutual investment, can cause unhappiness. 
</li><li><b>Investment decisions</b>: Engaging in speculative investments, like the latest cryptocurrency trend, which can result in losing all your money, leads to unhappiness.
</li><li><b>The impact of noise</b>: Loud, unpredictable noises, such as regular disturbance through loud neighbors, can lead to chronic misery. It's noted that humans cannot fully acclimate to chronic acoustic chaos, causing ongoing unhappiness.
</li><li><b>The ramifications of promising more than you can deliver</b>: Promising things to people that you can't deliver leads to unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Striving for unrealistic goals</b>: Undertaking efforts that are de-facto impossible or implausible, such as significant societal change within a generation, is a fast track to failure and resultant unhappiness. It's important to make realistic goals and adjustments based on circumstances.
</li><li><b>The risk of contradictory pursuits</b>: Trying to achieve two contradictory goals simultaneously, such as starting a business and seeking spiritual enlightenment, can cause unhappiness due to divided focus and energy.
</li><li><b>The impact of thought patterns</b>: Low spiral development, pettiness, and small-mindedness contribute to unhappiness. Excessive selfishness or sacrifice (selflessness) also results in unhappiness, suggesting a balance should be sought between the two. 
</li><li><b>The pitfalls of escaping suffering and excessive spiritual seeking</b>: Constantly attempting to escape all suffering can intensify unhappiness because of repeated failures. Overemphasizing spiritual seeking or trying to escape the material domain can equally lead to dissatisfaction. 
</li><li><b>General contributors to happiness</b>: Activities aligned with top values, using one's talents and strengths, being productive, developing new skills, self-education, undertaking quality and impactful work, and being independent or your own boss can all lead to happiness. Being excellent at work, not just performing it, is highlighted as a basis for satisfaction. Reflecting uniqueness and individual differences, these elements will vary from person to person.
</li><li><b>Being Your Own Boss</b>: Not everyone is cut out to be their own boss, but for those who thrive in this role, creating such an environment can significantly contribute to happiness.
</li><li><b>Leading and Helping Others</b>: Playing a leadership role and contributing to the improvement of society can be an extremely rewarding and happiness-inducing experience.
</li><li><b>Rest, Relaxation and De-stressing</b>: Regular periods of rest and relaxation are crucial for happiness, as constant stress and overwork can prevent one from achieving lasting happiness.
</li><li><b>Human Intimacy, Companionship, and Socialization</b>: Strong human connections, friendship, and socialization can create serious happiness and deepen the quality of life.
</li><li><b>Identifying Love Languages for Intimate Relationships</b>: Understanding and communicating your top love languages (e.g., physical touch, quality time) can significantly increase the level of happiness in intimate relationships.
</li><li><b>Time Alone for Introverts</b>: Introverts need ample time alone to recharge and prevent misery from constant socialization.
</li><li><b>Turning Challenges into Opportunities</b>: Meeting challenges head-on and reframing them as opportunities for growth and exhibiting personal power can increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Investing in Long term Aspects of Life</b>: Making the most out of each day and investing in long-term ventures increases happiness.
</li><li><b>Building Confidence through Experiences</b>: Gaining confidence by exposing oneself to experiences can overcome insecurities and increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Exploring and Traveling for Life Enrichment</b>: Traveling not as an escape, but for broadening horizons, expanding consciousness and contemplating life, can be rewarding and increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Patient Cultivation of Hobbies</b>: Patiently cultivating a hobby over time can create a residual passive income of satisfaction and increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Good Health and Healthy Lifestyle</b>: Being healthy, eating quality food and taking care of oneself can significantly boost happiness.
</li><li><b>Deep Solitude and Retreats</b>: Engaging in moments of deep solitude and occasional solo retreats can be a deep source of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Passion, Enthusiasm, and Inspiration</b>: Living life passionately, enthusiastically, and continually seeking inspiration can significantly increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Humor and Playfulness</b>: Developing humor and a playful attitude can make life lighter and more enjoyable, and therefore, increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Creating a Comfortable Personal Space</b>: Creating a comfortable and personalized living space is a source of happiness and wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Creating a comfortable living space</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of investing in and developing a comfortable living space, noting that it does not need to be expensive or fancy. He notes that feeling safe, secure, and comfortable in one's environment can contribute significantly to overall happiness. 
</li><li><b>The value of small comfort features</b>: Gura mentions installing convenient features that improve daily routines, such as easy-to-reach lamp switches, demonstrating that small changes can impact overall happiness long-term. 
</li><li><b>Doing philosophy properly</b>: Leo Gura asserts the proper practice of philosophy as a source of happiness. Misapplied, however, it can be a source of deep misery. 
</li><li><b>Self-actualization and growth</b>: Leo Gura indicates that self-actualization and personal growth, despite their challenges, are potential sources of deep happiness and satisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Being aligned with truth</b>: Having honesty and avoiding self-deception are essential to achieving happiness, according to Gura.
</li><li><b>Exploring consciousness</b>: Gura emphasizes that exploring consciousness, consciousness of God, and spirituality can bring profound happiness. 
</li><li><b>Falling in love with oneself</b>: Gura suggests that falling in love with oneself can bring immense joy and happiness.
</li><li><b>Recognizing the beauty of consciousness</b>: Gura cites the recognition of the beauty of consciousness and reality as a significant source of his personal happiness.
</li><li><b>Specific activities that bring happiness</b>: Gura outlines several activities that specifically bring him joy, including being creative, learning and developing new ideas, seeking truth, spending time in nature, being in solitude, complete creative autonomy, and appreciating music. 
</li><li><b>Exploring consciousness through psychedelics</b>: Gura suggests exploring consciousness via psychedelics as an enormous source of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Using music as a source of happiness</b>: Gura enjoys curating personal music playlists and considers listening to his favorite music an important source of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Finding joy in natural elements</b>: Gura derives pleasure from natural elements like rain, suggesting that such simple joys significantly contribute to overall happiness.
</li><li><b>Personal sources of happiness</b>: Gura talks about various activities that bring him happiness such as envisioning his future, having a productive work day, making a positive impact on society, innovating and making new discoveries, studying and contemplating, being playful, engaging in digital art, appreciating good food and female beauty, and consuming pornography as an art form. He also gains satisfaction from categorizing and organizing his life, speaking in front of a camera on meaningful topics, reminiscing on his past experiences and work, resting, and investing in his own house. 
</li><li><b>Personal sources of unhappiness</b>: Gura discusses several challenges that impair his happiness, notably chronic health problems which interfere with his productivity and creativity. Being on a strict schedule, working just for money, doing work he doesnt believe in, having a boss, and his fear of running out of money all contribute to his unhappiness. He dislikes wasting money, doing menial chores, socializing for extended periods, managing others, behaving egotistically, being lazy, engaging in arguments or debates, and arguing online. 
</li><li><b>Consuming pornography as art</b>: Gura mentions his appreciation of pornography when consumed with an artistic perspective, likening it to appreciating fine art. He points out the necessity of finding the high-quality 10% of available content, and regards this search itself as an enjoyable pursuit. 
</li><li><b>Importance of creative work and solitude</b>: Gura highlights the joy and satisfaction he receives from being productive and engaging in his creative work, stating that it requires no effort and puts him in a flow state. Additionally, he emphasizes his preference for solitude, mentioning his happiness is highest when he is alone. 
</li><li><b>Dealing with health challenges</b>: Gura acknowledges his struggles with chronic health issues, noting that despite various attempts to improve his condition, he is restricted by his genetic predisposition. He discusses the impact this has on his productivity and creativity, leading to difficulties in meeting his own standards, which he is not willing to reduce.
</li><li><b>Fear of running out of money</b>: Despite his financial stability, Gura discusses his lingering fear of running out of money due to past traumatic experiences. He emphasizes the impact of such deep-seated fears and past traumas on overall happiness, advocating for healing from these experiences. 
</li><li><b>Organization and systematization for happiness</b>: Gura takes pleasure in organizing his life and creating systems that support his work, infrastructure, and personal space. He suggests this simple activity brings more real and durable happiness than pursuing momentary highs from activities like partying or drug use. 
</li><li><b>Setting a good work-life balance</b>: Gura brings attention to the importance of work and projects that align with personal values and beliefs. He stresses that doing work he considers meaningful and impactful brings him joy, while tasks not related to his personal interests or simply for money tend to make him unhappy.
</li><li><b>Personal preferences for happiness</b>: Leo dislikes arguing, smartphone addiction, chronic loud noise, overeating junk food, and social obligations that prevent him from having alone time. 
</li><li><b>Meditation and Spirituality</b>: Leo finds that meditation and spiritual work didn't align well with his personality and resulted in unhappiness. His creative mind didn't gel well with quieting the mind and he prefers contemplation over meditation. 
</li><li><b>Need for innovative and creative work</b>: Leo finds happiness in being creative and innovative. His active mind is what generates his work and ideas, which he values more than silencing his mind through meditation. 
</li><li><b>Respective approach to life</b>: Spirituality, instead of being an end goal, has become a part of his everyday life. It enabled him to recognize the beauty of consciousness, which is of utmost import to him. 
</li><li><b>A warning about happiness</b>: There is a trap in trying too hard to be happy and escape suffering, which may lead to increased suffering. Not everyone should aim for full spiritual or Buddhist monk lifestyle - it is important to also lead creative, family, or work-oriented life. 
</li><li><b>Mindset towards suffering</b>: Rather than trying to escape suffering completely, one should accept it as part of life and not obsess over it. Focusing on building a meaningful life will result in contentment and satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Doing things for their own sake</b>: The deepest happiness comes from doing things for their own sake, not as a means to an end. The highest grade of happiness can be found in the appreciation of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Ecstasy</b>: Leo Gura explains that the ultimate form of happiness comes from a state of ecstasy - a deep, transcendent, religious and mystical experience gained from an elevated consciousness of God and an immersive feeling of infinite love. However, it is not constant or attainable all the time but has a transformative effect on the psyche when experienced.
</li><li><b>Simple Joys and Real Happiness</b>: Most of life's genuine, long-term happiness comes from appreciation of simple everyday things and experiences. This includes relaxing and reading a book after a long day or admiring the beauty of nature around you.
</li><li><b>Happiness is the Journey</b>: Happiness should not be sought solely from the achievement of big goals, but from enjoying the journey and process of achieving them. For example, if you are building a business, find enjoyment and happiness in the day-to-day activities and not merely in the eventual success of the business.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Consciousness and Existence</b>: Ultimate happiness can be derived from simply appreciating the beauty and divinity of consciousness and existence, even in moments of doing nothing. Such deep appreciation comes from high consciousness and spiritual attunement.
</li><li><b>Creating a Happiness Journal</b>: For personal exploration of what brings you happiness and unhappiness, Leo Gura suggests keeping a happiness journal. This involves logging specific life instances and activities that make you feel happy or unhappy, creating a clear picture of what brings you joy and what holds you back from it. 
</li><li><b>Exploring Your Mind</b>: The teachings are geared towards individual exploration of your mind, not to instill new beliefs. Validations of these teachings should come through direct personal experience, observations, and tests, taking into consideration potential self-deceptions and emotional blockages.
</li><li><b>Resisting Ideologies and Dogmas</b>: The discussions in this lecture are not to be treated as ideologies or dogmas. Everything stated should be grounded in direct personal experience and not standardised validations from external sources. All teachings should be verified personally to determine if they hold true for you.
</li><li><b>Importance of Inner Purification & Maturity</b>: Though ecstasy is rarely experienced, it has a purifying effect on the psyche and gets rid of bad karma. However, the readiness to let go of old ways, habits and values is a sign of inner maturity and can affect how these teachings validate in one's experience.
