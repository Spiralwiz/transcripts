            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/zxMTekwz1HM' target='_blank'>Whatever Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger - True or False</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of "whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger"</b>: The video examines the validity of this adage, questioning whether enduring challenging situations necessarily leads to strength and resilience or can result in emotional crippling. 
</li><li><b>Personal experience of adversity</b>: Leo Gura uses his recent experience with a legal trial in Toronto to illustrate the concept, expressing that such severe emotional triggers made him question if such experiences would make him stronger or possibly weaker. 
</li><li><b>Potential for harmful decisions</b>: He underlines the idea that detrimental life choices, such as mishandled business affairs or failed relationships, can lead to serious consequences and potentially cripple a person emotionally.
</li><li><b>Short-term repercussions of poor decisions</b>: In the immediate aftermath of bad decisions, individuals can end up cornered and experience self-doubt, fear, and retreat, which might deter them from fully living their life.
</li><li><b>Emergence of strength through adversity</b>: Despite the potential for immediate and medium-term suffering, the video points out that people often grow and become stronger after making poor decisions. This growth can result from a variety of stressful situations including drug addiction, financial scams, divorces, and personal loss. 
</li><li><b>Perception of traumatic events</b>: Even though a person might initially wish not to face these hardships, with time they might come to see these moments as essential for their emotional development and resilience. This perspective applies even to extreme situations like kidnapping or losing someone close.
</li><li><b>Role of psychological resilience</b>: Gura ultimately argues in favor of the Nietzschean philosophy, stating that hardships don't just produce temporary pain but also build psychological resilience. Catastrophic failures or losses can redefine a personÂ’s character and provide motivation for future efforts and resilience.
</li><li><b>Tough experiences lead to a stronger mindset</b>: Leo emphasizes that despite facing adversities and going through tough experiences such as failed relationships or business losses, it gives a person a more grounded and stable view of life. He gives an analogy of skin building a callus after recurrent puncturing and wear and tear, illustrating how challenging events in life build psychological resilience.
</li><li><b>Smooth sailing in life may not always lead to resilience</b>: If a person's life is smooth without any hardships or challenges, they may be fortunate but might also lack resilience. Leo suggests that if a previously smooth life suddenly faces adversity, it can easily fall apart due to a lack of mental toughness or resilience developed through overcoming prior difficulties.
</li><li><b>Overcoming adversity gives way to personal growth and resilience</b>: Leo believes that going through trauma and tough situations can result in a robust mindset and a psychologically resilient nature. He asserts that successful individuals often come from challenging backgrounds as they are used to handling adversity and are therefore better equipped to handle the worst life can throw at them. 
</li><li><b>Reflecting on past traumatic events as valuable experiences</b>: Looking back on traumatic events after some time has passed, individuals may find that they are grateful for those experiences as they serve as foundations for future actions and life decisions. He suggests that the Nietzschean adage 'whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger' is largely true, despite possible exceptions for extremely horrific events.
</li><li><b>Persistence despite adversity strengthens mental endurance</b>: Leo insists on the importance of pushing through challenges without giving up. He encourages viewers not to react hastily to traumatic events, but to give it time and reflect back on these adversities as a platform for personal growth and resilience. 
</li><li><b>Use Actualized.org as a resource for mastering psychology</b>: Leo recommends viewers to sign up for his website, Actualized.org to receive new videos, articles, and other contents for self-actualization. He maintains that continuously learning and applying the concepts he shares is crucial for transforming one's life.
