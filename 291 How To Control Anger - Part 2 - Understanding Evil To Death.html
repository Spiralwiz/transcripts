            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/iF1q76Eiio4' target='_blank'>How To Control Anger - Part 2 - Understanding Evil To Death</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Holistic Understanding and Controlling Anger</b>: Leo Gura highlights the relationship between holistic understanding and anger management. He argues that anger generally stems from a lack of holistic comprehension. By understanding situations, the world, others, and even ourselves from a more comprehensive viewpoint, we can diminish anger. 
</li><li><b>Defending Personal Partitions</b>: Gura explains that most people create a mental partition of themselves within realitydefending this partition and maintaining its viewpoint on reality. However, when their perspective is challenged or violated, it often leads to feelings of outrage and anger. This kind of defensiveness, Gura suggests, results from a failure to recognize larger holistic systems at play.
</li><li><b>Holism and Larger Systems</b>: Gura underlines that each individual forms a part of multiple large systems, such as social, cultural, familial, and species systems. Having a holistic understanding of these systems can enable us to see beyond our limited viewpoint or personal partition. This wider comprehension can enable us to accommodate reality as is rather than expecting it to adapt to our individualistic perspectives, thus reducing feelings of anger.
</li><li><b>Respecting Other Perspectives</b>: Gura proposes that remaining stuck in ones own perspective and refusing to consider others can lead to a bitterness affecting overall effectiveness in life. Having the ability to switch viewpoints and adopt a holistic understanding enables individuals to be more effective and peaceful in the world.
</li><li><b>Anger towards Injustice and Unfairness</b>: Gura explains that when people feel violated by instances of perceived injustice or unfairness, it usually results from looking at an issue from their limited viewpoint. To deal with such anger, instead of clinging to our points of view, adopting an open-minded and more holistic perspective can be productive.
</li><li><b>Consequence of Not Adopting a Holistic Perspective</b>: Gura highlights the consequences of not adopting a holistic perspective. Staying within a narrow viewpoint can foster bitterness and a lack of resourcefulness needed to resolve problems. To achieve peace and effectiveness in the world, he suggests cultivating holistic thinking, radical open-mindedness, and a desire for understanding.
</li><li><b>Understanding as a Cure for Anger</b>: Understanding the complexities of a reality or situation helps to decrease feelings of anger. This involves accepting reality as it is, without creating "should" scenarios that insist on one's point of view, and which often deviate from what's actually occurring. Understanding leads to acceptance, which subsequently produces peace. 
</li><li><b>Corruption and Anger</b>: Anger at corruption, for instance, can be diminished by studying its root causes and gaining a holistic understanding of it. This process can involve questioning one's personal contributions to corruption, as well as the mechanisms that enable it. Upon gaining a comprehensive understanding, it becomes challenging to remain angry at corruption. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Lying</b>: To understand the act of lying, one must examine it from the perspective of the liar and seek to comprehend why lying occurs. Recognizing the extent to which one personally lies can be insightful. By understanding the reasons and structure of lying, one can reduce the anger associated with it. 
</li><li><b>Relationship and Family Problems</b>: Anger stemming from family or relationship problems can also be mitigated through holistic understanding. Looking beyond personal perspectives and seeking to understand the general functioning of relationships or workplaces can help curb feelings of injustice or unfairness, thereby reducing anger. 
</li><li><b>Dealing with Severe Injustices</b>: Even with severe injustices like war, religious fanaticism, and rape, holistic understanding can help victims process their anger and move toward healing. Though it's difficult and may take time, victims can ultimately realize that being angry doesn't serve their healing journey. They can transition from anger, through forgiveness, to understanding, which can contribute to their emotional recovery.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Holism</b>: Understanding reality from a holistic perspective helps to nullify anger and promotes acceptance of situations as they are, without insisting on one's own viewpoint. This principle, though challenging to grasp initially, can be vital in managing personal responses to various life situations, ranging from minor annoyances to significant injustices.
</li><li><b>Understanding Perspectives and Rape</b>: Leo Gura stresses on the need to understand why grave deeds like rape happen, from a holistic point of view. He suggests that by understanding the abuser's background or childhood, sympathy may develop, which doesn't make the act correct, but lessens the anger and facilitates acceptance.
</li><li><b>Understanding Ignorance</b>: Leo posits that evil actions come from ignorance, which is a deep, powerful force difficult to correct within oneself. He uses this to explain the rationale for harmful actions people often undertake and the influence ignorance has on them.
</li><li><b>Understanding Daily Annoyances</b>: Leo makes a connection between daily minor annoyances and anger, urging that the principle of holistic understanding can be applied to them, too. He employs a personal anecdote of a squawking bird causing annoyance during his meditation session, revealing his realization that there is no separation between him and the bird, leading to peace and nullifying anger.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Existential Self</b>:
</li><li>Leo talks about erasing the fundamental partition the mind creates between self and other or self and world, citing it as an advanced example. He mentions that this realization leads to overwhelming love and acceptance for everything, which in turn, can convert seemingly perpetual annoyance into love.
</li><li><b>Anger into Motivation</b>: In response to certain objections, Leo addresses that outrage or anger may serve as motivation to solve problems. However, he argues that there are better, purer forms of motivation, often rooted in love, that can be attained through personal development, and have better health implications in the long run. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Vs. Accepting Evil</b>: Leo responds to the objection that understanding evil may lead to its acceptance, resulting in increased chaos. He challenges the idea, stating that accepting evil doesn't mean it runs rampant. He emphasizes that acceptance often leads to peace, and with peace, the intensity of evil tends to diminish.
</li><li><b>Acceptance as a mechanism to confront evil</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that confronting evil is not achieved by fighting it, but by embracing it so deeply it loses its ability to trigger negative emotions, paving the way for peace. This requires relinquishing attachment to a single point of view and accepting that reality is multifaceted, complex, and not aligned only with one's personal perspective. 
</li><li><b>Reality as infinite degrees of freedom</b>: Leo elaborates on the concept of reality being infinitely free and stresses the importance of making peace with it. He acknowledges the challenges that come with doing this, as it demands letting go of personal demands and expectations while underscoring that truth and reality are not always palatable.
</li><li><b>The role of holistic understanding in personal development</b>: Leo advocates for holistic comprehension as a key aspect of personal development. He accepts that implementing this ideal can be challenging but shares personal experiences of overcoming difficulties to underscore its transformative potential. 
</li><li><b>Practicing acceptance through understanding</b>: Leo suggests a practical approach to implementing holistic understanding, specifically when dealing with anger. He encourages viewers to pause, reflect, and ask themselves what they're failing to understand when faced with situations that trigger anger. Leo advises practicing this approach in minor, everyday situations before attempting to apply it to major issues, emphasizing the pursuit of a holistic perspective.
</li><li><b>Further exploration of anger</b>: Leo acknowledges that while he has provided valuable insights into managing and understanding anger, there is still more to be discussed. He promises to offer additional perspectives in future content, urging viewers to continue practicing and incorporating these techniques into their life to achieve holistic understanding and tranquility.
