[Music] i'm feeling inspired today i was actually going to
shoot a different episode a more down to earth practical
episode which is going to get pushed off until next
week because i was in the shower and i was
contemplating the nature of god and love and forgiveness and
just this this profound chain of logic came to me
that inspired me that i want to share with you
so we're going to talk about and explain why god
forgives devilry and evil this is a this is a
topic that perplexes many religious people and and even non-religious
people honestly because the one of the biggest i think
obstacles that even non-religious people have towards the notion of
god is this idea of like if there is a
god how did god design such a terrible world uh
why is there so much evil in the world and
i've talked about this previously and i've talked about what
is devilry in my episode what is devil regal check
that one out it's kind of important to know when
i use that term what i really mean so um
i'm going to be speaking here both figuratively and literally
at the same time it's a little tricky but i
want to take you through the logic here so god
forgives all devilry what does that mean what do i
mean by devilry well if you watched my episode about
what is the devil i use it sort of tongue-in-cheek
don't take it too seriously i'm not telling you that
there is a satan you know with horns and a
pitchfork uh somewhere in hell i i i'm i'm speaking
more of like the human devilry that we see all
around us all of the shenanigans going around in politics
and around the world the wars the violence the theft
the exploitation the abuse the manipulation the enslavement of others
and this sorts of stuff right all the stuff you
don't like when it's happening to you and all the
stuff you love when you're doing it to others when
it serves you see when you're on the receiving end
of it you don't like it but when you're on
the benefiting end of it and especially when you don't
have to think about how you got the benefits in
other words you do the devilry without yourself being conscious
that you're doing devilry then you love it because you
love the fruits of the devilry but you don't like
perceiving yourself as the devil so this is the sort
of game that the ego mind plays is that it
tries to act like the devil while denying that it's
doing so and then of course when you point that
out to it it doubles down on its denial and
it denies that it's in denial that it's doing this
but anyways so uh you might think that like well
god should punish this stuff and this is very counter-intuitive
is that what you discover is that god doesn't punish
anything not even the worst atrocities that you could imagine
god doesn't punish these things god is not even upset
or disturbed by these things it's just it just it
doesn't it doesn't affect god why is that well the
short answer is god is love but there's more dots
we got to connect here for this to make sense
but before we do that let me just lay out
a disclaimer here that what i'm talking about i'm speaking
from direct experience from my own conscious experiences that i've
had very high levels of consciousness super human levels of
consciousness so i'm not here promoting any kind of religious
dogma to you um i'm not trying to get you
to believe this stuff i am going to lay out
the logic for you to help you to make sense
of this in your own mind as you go about
doing your spiritual practices and eventually hopefully becoming conscious of
these things for yourself not because i said so but
because it's what is the case and then i'm just
giving you some analysis here and helping you to connect
some dots in your mind clear up certain confusions all
right so this is not dogma or ideology don't make
it such but anyways the logic is this see god
is everything god is infinite consciousness truly infinite consciousness what
infinite means that has no bounds that means it has
no limits upon it that means it extends in all
directions in all dimensions not just spatially but in every
possible way that you could imagine so if god is
everything absolutely everything then god is those things that you
would call devilry whatever you think devilry is what however
you define it you want to define slavery or genocide
or sexual abuse or the abuse of children or whatever
you want to define as you know the epitome the
pinnacle of devilry and then minor forms of devilry like
lying and cheating and stealing and tax evasion whatever you
know um maybe you think war is is the ultimate
form of devilry genocide something like that so god is
all those things if god is everything see that's the
logic of it the logic of it is oneness that's
the fundamental principle behind the entire universe it's it's oneness
everything is connected to everything else and the only way
anything can exist is if everything exists so see as
a finite human consciousness here in this little dream that
you've been living in it seems to you that well
life is this certain way and it has to be
this way and it can't be some other way because
of all the limits that are placed upon you physically
materially and so forth there are limits upon what your
body can do what your mind can think and what
you can even imagine but this is all finite consciousness
god is infinite consciousness infinite conscious means it's completely unlimited
as to what it can imagine it can literally imagine
anything so literally god can't imagine a physical material devil
if he wanted to i say he really it's an
it or it's you but a god can imagine because
it's infinite consciousness can imagine anything so it can imagine
war genocide abuse exploitation slavery it can imagine physical demons
and devils uh an infinite number of different kinds just
like in your dreams you know when you're sleeping at
night fly proof life lying around um when you're sleeping
at night there's no limit to the kind of horrors
that you can imagine i mean you've had nightmares think
back to the kind of nightmares you've had think of
the diversity of all the crazy nightmares that you've concocted
with your mind well see god is that taken to
infinity so if god wants to god infinite consciousness can
can construct its own physical material hell if it wants
to because it's infinite creative potential infinite creative potential means
that you can imagine atoms molecules cells creatures aliens angels
devils it can dream all sorts of nightmares it can
dream bliss realms of of beautiful sex and food and
whatever other material pleasures you desire money vacations anything the
universe can literally imagine anything because it is pure infinite
imagination it's everything and the only reason anything can exist
is because everything exists within infinite consciousness it's like an
infinite possibility space so now think about this imagine you
are this infinite possibility space and of course now here's
a further little wrinkle to the logic if we're talking
about oneness and everything see if if god is everything
that means what about you and if god is infinite
consciousness what about your consciousness you're conscious right now you're
a thing right now so a thing is part of
everything that means you're god there can't be a god
separate from a you because god is the creator of
everything and the way it creates things is not by
sitting outside of it and then creating it and being
separate from it but by actually incarnating as it so
it's incarnated as you right now listening to me imagining
this whole conversation so this is what god is imagining
right now so you are it but it is also
everything else and there's no limit as to how it
can be it can be any way it wants right
now just happens to choose to be the way that
it is right now if it wasn't doing that then
you couldn't exist as a human you would be something
else you'd be a kangaroo or a devil or an
angel or whatever else it was thinking of or if
it was thinking of nothing you'd be nothing or if
it was thinking of everything you'd be everything you see
this this would present you with an existential crisis you
would think that you're losing your mind you think you're
going crazy you would probably go to a psych ward
and then there the the uh the shrinks would evaluate
you and uh if you were honest with them about
what you were experiencing what you were conscious of that
you were everything uh they would put you on psycho
antipsychotic medication that's what they would do because they don't
understand how radical and serious this is you know we're
not just talking about human psychology here we're talking about
the origin of all of existence all of creation so
the reason god can create anything is because it is
everything so the way it creates is just by imagining
whatever it wants right now that doesn't mean that your
little human ego can imagine whatever it wants that's not
what i'm saying your little human ego is something it's
imagining that's a limit it's placing upon itself right so
you see infinite consciousness constrains itself into something finite which
resembles your human experience and it does feel very finite
it is literally finite because it's imagining itself to be
finite but it doesn't have to always be that way
it could unimagine it the next moment now will it
well the problem again is that if it did you
would lose your mind so it doesn't for your own
sake but also it can and then people do lose
their minds people lose their minds just throughout the course
of life extreme stress people have psychotic episodes schizophrenic episodes
whatever or people take psychedelics and lose their mind people
do spiritual practice and lose their mind through meditation or
yoga or self-inquiry so there's a lot of ways to
lose your mind and it's it can be it can
also go wrong it does it's not always good to
lose your mind you can lose your mind in a
controlled healthy manner and you can lose your mind in
an uncontrolled unhealthy dysfunctional suicidal manner so you gotta be
careful about how you go about losing your mind i
don't recommend the dysfunctional path because that can cause a
lot of damage to yourself and others and we've talked
about that in the past but anyways so the logic
of it here is that the only way you can
have anything is if you have everything so when you
have everything that means you are everything consciousness is everything
god is everything if god is everything literally then how
can god be upset at anything how can god judge
or condemn anything because if god was judging or condemning
anything it would be judging and condemning its own nature
in other words another way to put it is truth
since god is truth since there is nothing outside of
god because it's infinity and it's everything that there could
ever possibly be that is the truth this absolute truth
if it didn't forgive itself and accept all parts of
itself that means it would be in conflict with itself
that means it would be denying aspects of itself that
means truth would not be fully accepting itself as truth
truth would be at war with itself and sure enough
this does happen within the human realm of limited consciousness
but it can't actually happen at the highest levels of
consciousness at infinite consciousness it can't happen at infinite consciousness
consciousness is too conscious to deny or resist any parts
of itself and when this happens the idea that god
would condemn judge hate demonize or not forgive any aspect
of itself is ludicrous it's tantamount to insanity you'd have
to literally be insane to judge your own self because
the infant itself the self that is everything is the
only thing that exists it's the only thing that can
be just by virtue of the fact that it's everything
and you can't have more than everything everything is everything
it also includes nothing so when you've got absolute everything
and you're fully conscious of it as that then how
can you judge it how can you not love it
and here is where love and truth become synonymous and
actually identical because when you're fully conscious of what you
are and what the truth is everything simultaneously what comes
with that is a full acceptance and surrender to what
is and that is simply love unlimited love for your
own self as creation as the act and process of
creation as the creator and the created and also another
element of logic we should bring in here to this
equation is uh is selflessness so god is selfless the
reason god is selfless with a capital s is because
a self with a lower case s like a human
self yourself as a this by by a biographical biological
self you think you are that self see that's a
finite form within consciousness that's a finite thing consciousness is
imagining so if god had a self it couldn't be
everything because by definition a lowercase s self is a
finite thing so see if you think that you're john
or sarah that's your little finite self and then you
think i'm leo this you think this is another separate
finite self that we're separate selves and see for you
to be john or sarah you can't be leo you
have to exclude leo from that and for me to
think of myself as leo i have to exclude john
and sarah from my little self you see so if
you're getting stuck to one finite self that means you
can't recognize yourself as the infinite self because the finite
gets in the way of the infinite you see this
is a very existential sort of trade-off that we have
here between this we have this tug of war between
the finite and the infinite um but god in its
highest form is completely selfless because it needs to have
the infinite freedom to incarnate as any self to be
able to imagine itself as being any self not just
a human self but a kangaroo self a koala self
an alien self an angel self a devil self whatever
it wants it needs the freedom to be able to
imagine itself as absolutely everything and so since god is
selfless that means it can take on the form of
an infinite number of different selves it's all possible cells
in other words it's the superposition of all possible cells
it's the source of all selves it's the empty self
that is dreaming itself as a specific finite self so
now think about why you would not forgive something think
about something that might happen in reality that you would
not forgive you might take a stance and say i
will never forgive some person for doing some x amount
of evil if they reach that level of evil like
i will never forgive hitler i will never forgive stalin
i will never forgive that person who molested me when
i was young i will never forgive my ex-boyfriend for
cheating on me i will never forgive my wife for
leaving me i will never forgive my father for abandoning
me i will never forgive my mother for hitting me
you know fill in the blank what that is for
you and so what i want you to notice is
that the reason you're struggling to forgive that is because
as a finite self you have a survival agenda and
survival biases which are informing your entire mind and perceptual
system so literally the way you look at the world
is informed by what you need to survive in the
world and so those things that you can't forgive notice
the only reason you can't forgive them is because of
how threatening they are to your survival as a finite
self survival as a finite self so actually the reason
that you're not able to forgive is because you're selfish
but you see god doesn't have this problem because god
in its most infinite form when it has no attachments
to being a specific human self what does it care
think about it if you had no attachment to survival
if you didn't need to make money if you didn't
care about how your children felt if you didn't care
about your job if you didn't care about achieving anything
specific in life if you didn't even care about whether
you lived or died if you didn't care about whether
you're experiencing pleasure or pain or if you're suffering or
not imagine if you were so selfless and so unbiased
in your consciousness that you literally did not distinguish between
these things and you didn't care which one of them
was happening to you in that case would there be
anything you wouldn't forgive no you see so when you're
infinitely selfless you automatically forgive everything because you're simply accepting
of everything you're not attached to having experience go one
way you're not attached to your dream being dreamt in
a particular direction that attachment which your little finite self
has so you want your dream to unfold in a
particular way like you believe that in the future you
want to get married and have children and you want
your children to do well you want them to have
good health you want to go to good schools you
want to eat them to eat good food you also
have aspirations for yourself you want a certain career you
want a certain life purpose you want a certain amount
of wealth in your life and certain material luxuries and
comforts and you want to play video games and you
want to be entertained and you want to laugh and
smile and have fun and you don't want pain and
you don't want cancer and you don't want heart disease
and you don't want to be obese and there's all
these things you don't want and then there's all these
things you do want this is what sets up the
whole problem because when you're attached to having things go
certain a certain way and not have not having them
go a different way these biases and attachments now commit
you to hating certain aspects of reality that hatred is
the mechanism you use to avoid those things and to
guide your dream to shape your dream to have it
unfold in a particular direction that would be self-serving and
notice all the stuff you want is completely self-serving why
do you want it because it's serving your agenda and
it's making you feel good that's ultimately why you want
anything even if you want to uh murder people the
reason you want to murder people is because it's going
to make you feel good in some twisted sense that
is what's going on inside the mind of a murderer
otherwise they wouldn't be doing it they take a certain
twisted delight that the suffering they inflict on others actually
makes them happy and that can happen when you're in
a very low state of consciousness you know a being
in a low state of consciousness takes pleasure in the
suffering of others we'll actually take pleasure in torturing an
animal or will take pleasure in his or her political
opponent being defeated and you've experienced that maybe you don't
experience pleasure from torturing animals and you think that's sick
and twisted and you would never go down that dark
road but you still take pleasure you take pleasure when
your enemies do badly you take pleasure when your political
opponents lose in an election you take pleasure when there's
a debate going on between two sides and your sides
scoring points against the other side and the other side
seems to be crumbling and getting debunked or embarrassed you
watch those youtube videos where either liberals or conservatives are
getting dunked upon and shown to be idiots and you
take pleasure in that depending on which side you're on
what attachments and biases you have see if you're a
soldier at war you take pleasure in the enemies that
you're fighting being killed you actually smile when you shoot
an enemy in the in the face and your commanders
smile and congratulate you for doing that see now of
course you have a whole story about how it's important
that you do this for the safety of the nation
the motherland and for defending children i mean in your
mind you justify it in such a way that the
smile seems totally valid and legitimate um but nevertheless you
take delight in these things uh that's because you have
a certain agenda as a self as a finite self
but see as the infinite self god has no agenda
other than the creation of everything furthermore the reason god
forgives everything doesn't punish anything is because god is the
very thing that you hate or judge or criticize god
is conscious of that but you as a finite self
are not conscious of that you see so when you're
a soldier and you're shooting somebody in the face and
then you smile and you're happy the only reason you
can smile and be happy about that is because you've
separated yourself from the one you shot and you're not
conscious of the one that you shot as being you
but this goes way deeper than that because like see
if you hear a news story about some person who
was torturing animals you're gonna hear that and your natural
instinct is gonna be say oh my god that sick
bastard how could he we should lock him up he's
evil that's from the human point of view but from
god's point of view from the point of view of
everything see god can't judge that because god is literally
doing that god is conscious that god is doing that
god is a torturer of animals god is a murderer
god is a rapist god is hitler god is stalin
god is terrorism god is every terrorist who ever lived
and god is every law enforcement officer who has combated
terrorism god is both the slave and the slave owner
at the same time see as a human self you're
not conscious of that because you just believe that you're
either a slave or a slave owner you're not both
at the same time or you believe that you're either
pro-animal rights or you're anti-animal rights or whatever you're not
both the same time or you believe that you're um
that you know you're pro-terrorism or anti-terrorism you're not both
at the same time but when you're conscious that you're
everything what does that mean that means you're everything everything
no exclusions no exceptions everything and so this is the
difficulty for humans and for finite self is that when
a when a human self hears that oh you're everything
that sounds kind of nice and uh hippie dippy sounds
kind of new-agey and cool until you actually start to
go through the ramifications of what that means and then
you you realize that this is this is extremely radical
and very threatening because all of a sudden you're a
chair you're a table your that corporation that you hate
think of a corporation that you hate just absolutely hate
you are that uh you're every person that you hate
not only are you the people that might be bad
like criminals and terrorists and stuff but um you're even
at a more deeper profound level you're the abstractions of
evil itself so think of not a specific terrorist think
of just terrorism in the abstract the idea of terrorizing
people and getting joy out of it think of that
as a pure abstraction you are that god is that
but see as a human finite self you've disowned that
aspect of your consciousness and of the universe and you
did it for good reason totally understandable why you did
it because if you didn't do it then how would
we structure society you see so for the structuring of
society for survival to occur you have to do this
and see god is conscious of this whereas you're not
conscious of this god is conscious that survival is completely
necessary at the level of finite consciousness so see god
is so infinitely conscious that it can't even judge you
for doing the survival activities that you got to do
to survive in the situation that you're in which is
why god forgives everybody because all everybody is doing all
the evil and devilry in the world is just nothing
other than people trying to survive struggling to survive in
different ways and the more twisted circumstances the more limited
of a circumstance a person find themselves in the harder
they have to fight to survive otherwise they're going to
die and so when people find themselves in very twisted
virtually impossible survival situations they turn into monsters this is
how a monster is created for example a little child
innocent little child is born and then gets abused every
day and molested by his parents who are drug addicts
let's say um and alcoholics and this child is just
constantly criticized and judged and physically abused and verbally abused
and emotionally manipulated for years and then is there any
surprise that this child will become a a murderer or
a mass shooter or a terrorist or something in the
future when when he's an adult no that's just his
coping mechanism for the years of abuse that he's received
you see so you as a finite human just trying
to survive in the world and be happy you don't
care about that you don't care about the truth you
just care about being happy but god god has no
attachments and it's infinitely conscious so it's completely conscious of
why this mass shooter or murderer turned out the way
he did because of you know the abuse that was
received and the virtually impossible survival situation that this that
this little kid was placed into um which which ended
up warping his psyche in his mind you see and
god isn't just conscious that that happened god is that
god created that you see so the reason god can't
judge you and god has to forgive you is because
god is you and god created you no matter how
evil you are it doesn't matter what you do in
life no matter how many people you kill or abuse
or exploit or manipulate or cheat or steal or whatever
it doesn't matter because while you will lose conscious of
the fact that you're god creating that god will never
lose consciousness of that god will always be conscious that
not only is that a part of god but that
god consciously created this because god is infinite consciousness god
is infinite creative potential so that possibility is just one
possibility out of an infinite number of possibilities of everything
that god is and god is completely conscious of that
and completely accepts that not only does it accept that
it loves it because it doesn't distinguish between any aspect
or part of itself because it has no self and
has no biases if you had no self if you
had no survival agenda you would have absolutely no biases
to such a radical degree that the the lack of
bias would not just be at the psychological level like
oh well you might say god likes all flavors of
ice cream equally god doesn't distinguish between chocolate and vanilla
and strawberry and coconut and whatever you know mint chocolate
mint chip whatever uh your favorite ice cream is see
you as a human have a favorite and there are
certain ones that you might think are gross that you
would never want to eat again after you try it
once but see god doesn't care god literally likes every
ice cream flavor equally but it's even more radical than
that because see in your mind you actually think there
is a difference between chocolate ice cream vanilla ice cream
strawberry ice cream coconut ice cream you actually think that
there's a physical material difference between these ice cream flavors
god is so infinitely conscious that god not only lacks
psychological biases and even deeper than that there's sort of
the biological level where like you might you might think
that well all the ice cream flavors okay maybe you
could imagine a human opens their minds so so radically
that he or she can appreciate all the ice cream
flavors but then if i give you a bowl of
[ __ ] with all the ice cream flavors and
then i ask you well okay so you can handle
all the different ice cream flavors but if i just
give you a bowl of pure [ __ ] it's
not ice cream are you still gonna be able to
enjoy it as much as all the different ice creams
you like see i would be pushing i would be
pushing the limits of how open your consciousness is and
you'd probably say no you know leo that's not ice
cream that's [ __ ] i'm not going to eat
[ __ ] and even if i am i'm not
going to enjoy it as much as ice cream that's
silly there's a physical difference between the two but what
i'm telling you is that god is so conscious that
it wouldn't even distinguish between the ice cream and the
[ __ ] and then but then we take it
to the next level is that we say this goes
so deep you become so conscious that literally the physical
difference between the different flavors of ice cream starts to
dissolve such that the difference between chocolate and vanilla actually
see a material a scientist would tell you well there's
a physical difference between the two they have different atoms
different molecules they hit the you know taste bud receptors
differently and your nervous system interprets them differently and maybe
one of them is good for you one of them
is bad for you maybe you're allergic to chocolate and
then it's bad for you see this is what a
scientist would tell you the science is not conscious enough
if you become more conscious than that you become super
humanly conscious which you'll start to realize that literally the
physical difference between the actual atoms of the chocolate and
the vanilla ice cream will itself start to dissolve such
that you literally will not be able to tell the
two apart and it'll go so radically deep that even
when you give you i give you a ball of
[ __ ] and you compare that bowl of [
__ ] to vanilla ice cream you will cease being
able to make the distinction between [ __ ] and
ice cream because the difference between [ __ ] and
ice cream you think it's a physical difference but that
physical difference is itself something you're imagining so there is
no such difference at a high enough level of consciousness
and then if you take this to its ultimate extreme
is of course that if i uh if i give
you a bowl of the most delicious vanilla ice cream
you've ever had on the one hand and then i
give you torture of children on the other hand an
actual child being physically tortured and i ask you is
there a difference between these two things you are going
to say of course there is and god from its
highest perspective is going to say of course there isn't
they're all just part of infinite consciousness such that there's
literally no difference so now imagine if you had that
level of consciousness at that level of consciousness you're not
human anymore because human is a distinction you're making within
consciousness you're saying i'm human and that's a table over
there see that distinction has to dissolve um at that
level of consciousness and so from that level of consciousness
what is there to judge what is there to criticize
what is there to condemn or to demonize is there
anything wrong at that level of consciousness you can't there
can't be anything wrong because you've literally transcended the distinction
between right and wrong good and bad pain and pleasure
imagine for example being so conscious that there is no
difference in your consciousness between an orgasm and being hit
in the face with a baseball bat see you as
a human it's difficult for you to imagine the blurring
of that distinction for you the distinction is so stark
so physical so inescapable that it would seem like leo
you'd have to lose your mind to think that there's
no difference between these two things and you're right you
would have to lose your mind you'd have to lose
that mind that ego mind that is attached to the
sensations of an orgasm versus the sensations of being hit
in the face with a baseball bat after all ask
yourself what's the difference why is it that you enjoy
orgasms but you don't enjoy being hit in the face
if you think very objectively about it what you'll realize
is that there's actually no good reason the reasons are
all purely selfish the reason i like orgasms is because
it makes me feel good and that's selfish and that's
part of my survival function and getting hit in the
face is the opposite of that that's why i don't
like it but when you become conscious enough this ceases
to matter because you also transcend the distinction between life
and death at that level of consciousness there is no
difference between life and death they merge into a single
unity of pure infinite consciousness so when this happens you're
so conscious that you realize that consciousness is nothing but
pure love that's what love is you see there's an
extremely profound metaphysics behind love a love is not merely
a human emotion the human emotions of love that is
love but that's like the tip of a spear you've
only felt the tip and what i'm talking about is
the entire spear when you see the entire sphere of
love which you realize that here's a technical metaphysical definition
of love for you this is so profound it might
take you 20 years to understand what i'm about to
say ready love is the realization that there is no
difference between anything love is a complete absence of all
bias that's really what love is at the ontological level
the deepest love you're ever going to feel the deepest
love that it's possible to feel is when you become
so conscious that you become conscious that the difference between
absolutely everything is imaginary and when you realize that what
you're left with is infinite love because if there is
no difference between anything that means everything is equally great
now you say oh leo but does that also mean
that everything's equally bad no it doesn't because bad is
a judgment your ego self is making that's a bias
you have when you remove all biases the end result
of that is not neutrality it's actually infinite love it's
infinite truth it's infinite self-acceptance the only reason you're rejecting
parts of reality is because you're scared of the suffering
of experiencing suffering but when you bite that bullet and
you're willing to experience anything when you stop having any
biases whatsoever what you're left with is infinite love what
this means is practically you're willing to experience everything and
the reason you're willing to experience everything is because you
realize you are everything and you stop cherry-picking experiences or
dreams see when you're infinitely conscious you're so conscious you're
literally untouchable you're immortal at that level of consciousness at
that level of consciousness you no longer care about excluding
any experiences from your consciousness because you realize the entire
purpose of existence is to embrace yourself when you're that
conscious you're too conscious to be able to resist your
own self and then what you realize is that the
game of reality not just the game of life but
even going beyond life but the game of reality itself
the game of existence is a deeper and deeper ever
deeper infinite embrace of one's self as all of existence
and so what happens is that you give up more
and more of yourself to embrace more and more of
yourself you give up more of your finite self and
more of your biases to be able to embrace more
of your infinite self and to realize more of your
infinite self but as you give that up you're literally
giving up your humanity you're giving up life you're giving
a pleasure you're giving up all of your goals all
of your dreams you're giving up all of that for
what for everything see you're giving up something for everything
you're giving up the finite for the infinite with the
ultimate realization that if you continue down this road what's
going to happen is that you're going to completely lose
all of your attachments and even your physical form you're
going to become so infinitely conscious that you will embrace
literally every possible dream that can be dreamt you will
become murder and torture and rape and genocide and of
course all the good stuff too and you're going to
become this at ever deeper and deeper and deeper and
more profound levels and as you're doing this all that's
happening is you're just surrendering to the truth of what
you are it's not that you're trying to create evil
in the world it's just you realize that evil is
just a part of everything and the way you're going
to overcome the evil is not by going around it
but by going through it so completely that you will
you will embody it to such a deep degree that
you won't be able to hate it anymore you see
that which you hate you are resisting embodying and so
you're going through your life judging people and then see
every judgment you make of others every condemnation criticism you
make now you yourself are forced into this sort of
dualistic game where it's like well if that person abuses
animals that means i can't abuse animals too because if
i do that makes me a hypocrite that also makes
me evil and you know that person does a mass
shooting that means if i shoot people that makes me
evil and so i can't do that and so now
you're living with all these limitations and you say well
leo but if we just let everybody do anything they
want is that going to create chaos yes it might
destroy civilization see this is why civilization like i said
in the past civilization is a house of cards built
on lies it has to be because it's not true
for civilization to to be the way that it is
it has to not be other ways see civilization's very
limited finite sort of pyramid scheme and in so doing
it marginalized a lot of people throughout history it abuses
a lot of people so the paradox of constructing a
civilization that as you're constructing a finite civilization all of
the trade-offs and limitations of being finite become very starkly
apparent this is why every civilization throughout all of human
history has has always been evil so ironically as you're
trying to build your your you know your beautiful civilization
you're commit committing a lot of evil in the in
the process so ironically see evil is the most counterintuitive
thing you think that by resisting by demonizing by hating
and judging and criticizing evil that you're gonna create a
world with no evil it's not gonna happen and actually
the more you push evil away the more it boomerangs
back on you so see you're not conscious enough to
realize that whereas god is therefore god realizes the only
solution to the problem of evil is not to fight
evil see if god was doing that god would be
stupid the solution to evil is to realize that it's
you it's nothing other than you it's something you're imagining
it's something you're doing it's not separate from you so
rather than trying to disown it the counter-intuitive move is
to own it own evil own it so deeply that
you stop having a problem with it own it so
deeply that it kills you i mean in the egoic
sense so deeply that it kills you in the egoic
sense and then you cease resisting what do you cease
resisting you cease resisting pain suffering and death you cease
resisting these things and then in this way you've transcended
death without physically harming your body although really to transcend
death see you can't truly transcend death if you're still
worried about maintaining the safety of your body now i
still want you to to care about the safety of
your body and treat your body well and so forth
but to truly transcend death do you understand what that
means it can't just be like at an intellectual level
where it's like oh yeah i've transcended death but then
i still care about my body like no to truly
transcend death means that if you die tomorrow you're okay
with it and if you're not okay with it then
you haven't transcended that it's a very radical thing to
transcend death very few people have done it it can
be done but the cost of doing it is so
outrageously high that almost nobody will do it and i'm
not claiming that i have done it at least not
permanently i've been in states where it's obvious to me
that it's possible um and in that state death is
transcended but then um if your state becomes finite again
you're gonna be you're gonna be afraid to die so
i mean really the only way to transcend death is
is to be in a in a permanent infinite state
of consciousness which is not easy to do so you
see the short of it is that since god is
everything since god imagines everything since god creates everything since
god incarnates as everything since god is truth since god
is love since god is one it has no option
but to forgive you because really when god forgives you
god is just for all god is doing in that
moment it's not really even forgiving you all god is
doing is god is just conscious that it's you god
is conscious that it is the sin that you feel
you committed another way to put it is uh sort
of in a poetic way god created the devil god
is conscious that god created the devil why why would
god create the devil because god is everything literally the
images of the devil in your mind are being constructed
and held by god's consciousness right now as i'm speaking
the idea of a devil the pictures you've seen of
the red sort of cartoon caricature of a red devil
with pointy tail and ears and horns and a pitchfork
that image where do you think that image came from
that came from infinite consciousness so i said earlier that
i'm going to be speaking here metaphorically and literally at
the same time well this is what i meant is
that god literally imagines the physical devil as you've seen
it rendered in books in movies in cartoons wherever you've
seen it in your own mind's imagination in your nightmares
if you had nightmares where you met the devil um
so literally god imagined all those but then also figuratively
speaking all the devilish stuff that humans have ever done
throughout human history god has also imagined and done all
those things god is all those things and god loves
all those things because god is too conscious to separate
itself from those things see to hate those things to
criticize those things to judge those things to condemn those
things you have to fool yourself into thinking you are
not those things you have to erect a barrier between
those things and you and that's only possible if your
consciousness has a a neck restraint around it when you
remove all the restraints from consciousness it's too conscious of
its own self to be able to judge or criticize
itself in any way because it realizes its own perfection
see you as a finite human self you believe perfection
is some sort of finite dream that personally suits you
so your version of perfection is something along the lines
of having the most beautiful sexual partners pleasing you sexually
in your favorite ways eating the best food that you
personally love looking physically however you personally want to look
living in the kind of house that you personally is
your dream house to live in living in a part
of the world that's the dream part of the world
to live in see that's your version of perfection but
this is the devil's version of perfection what you're imagining
there is a very finite form of perfection which isn't
absolute perfection because it's excluding so much see like if
you say that your version of perfection is like living
on a beach in hawaii in a 10 million dollar
mansion on the beachfront with a beautiful view of the
sunset and and coconut trees above you and the perfect
weather and no work and just uh supermodels sexually gratifying
you day and night new ones every day every night
and the best food you know sushi all the time
or whatever you like to eat caviar you know filet
mignon like just to your little human mind that seems
like that's such a good thing but that's just because
your conscience is so limited your imagination is so small
and you're so extremely biased in your appreciation of reality
see if you were truly conscious what you would realize
is just how cripplingly shallow that version of perfection is
because see if you're eating sushi or filet mignon think
of all the other foods you're not eating if you're
in hawaii you think of all the other beautiful places
in the world you're not at you're pretending as though
hawaii is is the most beautiful place in the world
it's not no one place in the world is the
best no one food is the best no one's sexual
partner is the best not even a hundred different sexual
partners is the best not even the experience of having
a hundred back-to-back orgasms is the best not even loving
your your you know your five children is the best
you think these things are the best they're not the
best the best from the most objective point of view
of infinite consciousness is infinity the best is everything no
one part of infinity can be the best because one
finite part of infinity is going to exclude another finite
part of infinity and when you're doing that you're missing
the absolute hole you're never in wholeness when you're clinging
to one thing no matter how good it is when
your conscience is low you're okay with that you're happy
with that and that is your version of heaven and
bliss but when your consciousness is infinitely high you can't
be okay with that because it's too limiting for you
imagine being so conscious that you don't want to just
live in a house in hawaii you want to live
in a house everywhere on the on the planet and
you don't just want to live in the luxury houses
you want to live in every house literally every [
__ ] house on the planet this includes the slums
of india the slums of brazil the slums in the
middle east the ghettos all around the world imagine you're
so conscious that you you want that but you also
want the mansions too you're gonna get it all so
you're not losing anything that's the thing see you as
a finite human self you think you're losing something by
living in islam because the slum excludes the possibility of
living in a mansion and living in a mansion excludes
the possibility of living in islam but to god there's
no exclusion it's all being included in an infinite dream
so it's going to include living in every house on
the entire planet um it's going to be but it's
also going to include being every every physical type of
human see for you there's like some sort of perfect
ideal image that you have how you might want to
be like if if we allowed you to do free
plastic surgery with no pain and no repercussions you would
redesign your face and your body to look totally different
and you would think okay now i've reached my perfect
form through genetic engineering and whatever plastic surgery um and
you think you'd be happy that would be perfection for
you is to reach that perfect form with the perfect
hair the perfect eye color the perfect facial symmetry all
of that and you think that'd be perfection but that's
not perfection true absolute perfection if you were infinitely conscious
would be that you would incarnate and take the form
of every human that has ever lived both the beautiful
ones and the ugliest ones the deformed ones the crippled
ones all of them and you see and we just
take this we just keep doing this and doing this
and doing this we keep including more and more and
more into consciousness until there's nothing left until we reach
infinity this means that see you think that well like
of all the different creatures you could be born into
in this on this on this one planet that we're
on you know let's say you had a conscious choice
as to what you're going to incarnate into before you
were born you could be a human you could be
a giraffe a kangaroo an ostrich a lion an eagle
a killer whale uh a a mouse an ant a
stink bug uh a vampire bat you know like of
all the different stuff you could incarnate as which one
would be the best for you you'd probably say something
like human but you see how biased that is or
maybe you say leo i want to be a bald
eagle flying high in the sky and you think that
that's your version of perfection or you want to be
a killer whale you know apex predator or something but
see your imagination is still far too limited why limit
yourself to any one of those when you can be
them all you see this is this is how god
thinks this is how a very very conscious entity thinks
the difficulty is that this level of consciousness is so
far above how most humans operate that it seems fantastical
it seems crazy it seems just like fairy tales like
i imagine some of you gonna listen to this and
you're gonna think this is just totally nuts but you
see that's just from your little perspective from god's perspective
what you're doing and your attachment to your little small
world that is what's truly nuts look at how narrow
and limited your experience of life is look at how
much you suffer and fear and hate and judge others
and yourself you don't even like your own self you
can't you can't even like your own physical appearance you're
going to spend the next 50 years of your life
hating yourself hating your physical exp appearance hating where you
live hating where you work hating what's happening to you
hating the people who you're in relationship with frustrated petty
and bitter and miserable this is the reality of human
life this is what you cling to so dearly this
is what you call sanity and then when i talk
about infinite love and infinite acceptance and all this you
think that's crazy talk you see it's all just a
matter of perspective if your conscious is very narrow then
what you want out of life is very narrow if
your consciousness is infinitely expansive then what you want out
of life is absolutely everything and see god is so
conscious that god is even conscious that you can't help
yourself in your little narrow perspective so god fully understands
that when you're locked into a little narrow perspective and
all that you want is a little bit of sex
and you want a little bit of sushi and you
want a little bit of filet mignon and you want
a little bit of hawaii and you want a little
bit of a 10 million dollar mansion and you want
a little bit of more money in your bank account
god fully understands why you want those things and why
you can't tolerate anything more than that and god forgives
you for that selfishness because you see god is so
selfless that it is not bothered by selfishness god is
so loving god is not bothered by hate god is
so non-judgmental god is not bothered by your judgments god
is so good god is not bothered by bad that's
the power of being completely selfless if you're completely selfless
you're completely unbiased nothing can bother you but god is
also conscious that you in your finite form aren't that
conscious therefore it's conscious that stuff does bother you as
a human so it's not like god is sitting above
you and saying ah ha ha look look at those
stupid humans look how petty they are they're just a
bunch of idiots no see god is too conscious for
that god is so conscious that god realizes that it
is the very ignorance and unconsciousness and selfishness that you
are right now so god is so conscious that it's
conscious of its own unconsciousness and it accepts that too
see right now god is conscious as i sit here
that it is speaking through me and that even though
this finite incarnation called leo has become conscious of god's
full consciousness god is also conscious that in this present
moment this leo incarnation is not infinitely conscious and that's
something the leo incarnation has to accept and learn to
love as part of its incarnation and so there's a
very deep compassion there there's a deep compassion for the
um the fact that finite conscious entities are stuck within
the finite domain it's sort of like god sees all
these people dreaming nightmares and god can't stop it from
happening because that's what god is god is everything you
might say well leo why doesn't god just snap his
fingers and stop it because god is everything if god
snapped his fingers and stopped all the nightmares god would
be denying all the nightmares god can't do that because
it's too conscious and is too loving such that it
loves the nightmares too see when you're asking god to
snap its fingers and to remove something from existence that
is not god's problem that's your problem that's a problem
your perception that's your biases creeping in and asking for
reality to be changed to suit you but to change
reality to suit a finite consciousness would be the very
definition of devilry see in asking god to do that
you're actually asking god to be a devil if reality
was suited to the human psyche reality would be evil
so reality can't be suited to the to the psyche
of any human or any one conscious entity god's job
is to ensure that reality is not monopolized by any
one entity it has to be for the good of
all not for the good of some and it's precisely
because of this that god won't snap his fingers and
remove the nightmares it's actually you who must accept the
nightmares and surrender to them and if you fully do
they will cease being nightmares the nightmares are there to
test your love think of it as like love is
like the ultimate test of your consciousness it's the ultimate
honest signal how much of reality can you love how
much of consciousness can you love can you love all
of it as a human no you can't because you'd
be dead but you can increase your capacity to love
more and more of it or at least to understand
it conceptually um and and so the tests can get
harder and harder and harder the bar can rise infinitely
high it can rise so high it'll kill you as
a human um uh but most humans for them the
bar is very very low as far as what they
can love and then the whole point of existence is
to raise that bar higher and higher and higher that's
kind of like the purpose the existential purpose behind life
is to expand your capacity to love until you reach
infinity and then you can reach god and then you
can come back down and start the whole thing all
over again but you see the nightmares are the true
tests of your love because you have to be extremely
conscious to be able to love a nightmare and so
life is just about things constantly rubbing you the wrong
way and as they rub you the wrong way they
cause suffering and pain and then eventually you get sick
and tired of the suffering and the pain and the
resistance and you start to surrender yourself to this thing
to that thing and as you do that that expands
your psyche part of your ego dies that expands your
psyche and then this makes you more godlike more admirable
as a conscious entity it makes you more conscious and
makes you more loving and makes you more selfless and
so things rub you keep rubbing you keep rubbing you
keep rubbing you the wrong way and if if you're
growing and living life properly then lessen love less stuff
should rub you the wrong way in life but see
a lot of people they fall to the trap of
of actually erecting barriers to sort of create a walled
garden that they live inside of where nothing rubs them
the wrong way not because they're able to surrender to
it and accept it and let it go of the
resistance but because simply they prevent that stuff from entering
into the conscious at all so it's a very sneaky
egoic tactic and this is what a lot of what
wealthy people do this is this is a lot of
what people's fantasies and even poor people have these fantasies
about wealth they think that they can use wealth to
create a walled garden and in practice a lot of
wealthy people do this they live in a gated community
with security guards where they never have to experience theft
rape murder they live in parts of the world which
are isolated entire neighborhoods not just a gated community but
that gated community is inside of like the best neighborhood
in the country where there's no homeless people again there's
no theft there's no murder or it's very low there's
no dilapidated buildings there's no slums there's no ghettos there's
no bad roads they're all nicely paved there's no bad
schools they're all private elite schools they send their kids
to elite universities which have billions of dollars of you
know endowments and donations and the best buildings and the
best teachers and the best food and the best this
they go to the best supermarkets so they completely isolate
themselves on yachts and in their luxury cars and the
even the social circles they hang out with they don't
hang out with ordinary people they can hang out with
other elite people who are just like them they create
this bubble from which they're isolated from pain suffering um
and they think that by doing this they're growing themselves
and they're self-actualizing actually they're not they're fooling themselves because
this person is very actually easy to penetrate their bubble
very easy their world is a house of cards and
it can collapse very quickly and then their whole life
becomes about maintaining that house of cards see every day
they're working 60 hours a week just to maintain all
their yachts and their golf courses and their luxury cars
they're spending more time maintaining that [ __ ] than
they did acquiring it and their life is unsatisfying there's
no satisfaction of that kind of life why is that
there's actually a very deep metaphysical reason for why because
the only thing that will satisfy the soul or spirit
or the god within you that you are the only
thing that's going to truly satisfy you is to actually
make yourself more godlike which means to expand your capacity
to love truly not to cherry-pick stuff the more you
start to cherry-pick life because of the wealth and power
you have and the fame you have fame power and
wealth allows you to cherry-pick everything you can cherry-pick your
sexual partners you can cherry-pick even your children you can
go to africa and adopt the perfect child that you
want if you have enough wealth you could buy them
a visa and a green card and a citizenship it
allows you to cherry-pick your employees it allows you to
cherry pick your friends the cars you drive the food
you eat the air you breathe the places you take
vacations at where you live you cherry pick absolutely everything
about your life and then you're still miserable why is
that because this little very narrow version of of of
perfection that you imagined is so [ __ ] narrow
compared to infinite consciousness that the spirit within you which
is intuiting the possibility infinite consciousness it can't tolerate that
it's too narrow it's too small you're thinking too small
when you're chasing billions of dollars and when you're buying
a 100 million dollar mega yacht what i'm telling you
is you're thinking too small but not in the way
you think you see it's not too small at the
level of dollar signs dollar signs are not the measure
of the bigness of your thinking and when i'm telling
you that you're having sex too small for example i'm
not saying that having sex with 100 people isn't enough
you need to have sex with 200 people no that's
never gonna solve it you can have sex with a
thousand people it's not gonna you're still thinking too small
when you're having sex with a thousand people that's the
fundamental problem in your life is that everything you're doing
is coming from a place of thinking too small you've
mistaken human notions of value with true scale of consciousness
the true measure is your is your degree of consciousness
that's the true measure not dollar signs not how many
people you have sex with not how many houses you
have not how many cars you drive not how many
trophies you've won not how big your business is these
are all false metrics the only thing that will make
you happy is becoming more godlike and the reason that
is because you're god you're god and deep down you
know you're god and you won't settle for anything less
nothing less will make you happy and only when you
finally realize that you're god only then will you understand
why you weren't happy with anything else the cars the
money the food the travel the vacations the houses the
women the children how could any of it have made
you happy you will realize how [ __ ] stupid
you were for thinking those things would make you happy
how could they how could anything finite make you happy
so one practical way for you to become more godlike
is to practice forgiveness because if you can't forgive the
ignorance and unconsciousness of others and also of your own
self you're not very godlike and if you want a
guided way of doing that i have an episode called
how to forgive anyone who's ever hurt you it's a
guided exercise a visualization exercise and i explained some theory
there as well about forgiveness which helps you to do
that it's very powerful forgiveness is very very powerful and
then of course the greater the evil you can forgive
the more godlike you are so let me ask you
this on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being
the highest godlike how strong is your capacity for forgiveness
be honest so 10 would be you completely forgive everyone
for everything and you completely understand the ignorance and unconscious
of others that means if somebody kills your child you
will completely understand and you will not hold any grudges
or resentments that would be a 10. so by practicing
that forgiveness exercise in that other video that i talked
about you can raise that score and then through other
spiritual work you can also raise that score don't think
that it's easy to raise this score this this score
can be raised at a sort of psychological level which
is nice um but ultimately to to bring that score
to a 10 you can't get to a 10 on
that score on that scale rather um through psychological trickery
alone that would require actually changing your state of consciousness
you need to actually access god consciousness to do that
and you would need to maintain that consciousness in order
to to really maintain that ten be careful here i'm
not trying to put unrealistic expectations on you see part
of what it means to have compassion and forgiveness for
others is realizing their limitations so i know you're a
finite human i'm a finite human too uh in a
certain sense and so because of that you don't want
us like now guilt yourself over not being a 10
on this scale this is going to be counterproductive you
don't got to be perfect and in fact it's actually
literally impossible for you to be at a 10 as
long as you're a human but what you can do
is you can begin the process of increasing your capacity
for forgiveness like if you're at a two right now
you could you could certainly move up to a three
to a four just by doing the exercises in that
video i talked about how to forgive anyone who's ever
hurt you that's a title search for it um and
that would significantly increase the quality of your life that
is what's actually going to make you happier not the
chasing of the money and the sex and the houses
and stuff this is the real work towards becoming more
happy and then if you continue doing other practices yoga
meditation self-inquiry contemplation visualizations psychedelics and many other techniques that
i've talked about many times in the past throughout all
my videos that will slowly increase your capacity for forgiveness
and for love really forgiveness is nothing other than love
and it's nothing other than just understanding ignorance and understanding
unconsciousness than just surrendering to it and and accepting it
and really it's nothing other than understanding and accepting yourself
all these things are ultimately synonymous so i hope that
this this helps you connect some dots in your mind
i hope this this explains some of the logic behind
how god works so that's that but i need to
issue an important disclaimer here everything i talked about in
this episode came from my own personal experiences and direct
consciousness it's not something i sat down and made up
one day it's not something i read in the bible
or from any spiritual school or book it's not something
i've heard other humans tell me and i have adopted
as a belief the things i'm saying are too radical
to believe they're literally unbelievable they're incredible it's taken me
some years just to integrate these experiences the reason i'm
talking about them is not so that you adopt this
as a dogma and you walk around telling people that
god will forgive all your sins that this helps nobody
this doesn't help other people and it certainly won't help
to increase the quality of your life to adopt this
as a belief the reason i'm sharing this is because
i am like i feel like i'm an explorer who
went into the amazon jungle hacked through it with a
machete and as i was doing that i discovered some
amazing things i discovered amazing rare birds and insects and
monkeys and cool creatures and cool plant life and even
you know remote villagers that i've never even contacted you
like i've experienced all this amazing rare stuff that few
have experienced and then i come back from the jungle
and i tell you some stories about it the purpose
of me telling you the stories is not for you
to then get lost in the stories and then to
tell your friends about my stories the purpose is simply
to present you with new possibilities and opportunities for what
you can also do in your life that's the purpose
of everything i talk about i'm painfully aware of the
limited nature of language and sharing stories and especially sharing
mystical experiences and infinite states of conscience these things literally
cannot be shared they're ineffable they're incommunicable so then why
do i spend thousands of hours talking about it simply
because very few in our culture talk about it they
don't talk about these possibilities in school they don't talk
about these possibilities at the workplace that you work they
don't talk about it on tv they don't talk about
it on facebook they don't talk about it on youtube
ads they don't talk about it in most of the
youtube videos you watch they don't talk about it in
most of the books you read or the magazines or
at the movies your friends don't know about it your
parents don't know about it even your therapist and your
preacher doesn't know about it so my function is simply
to present these possibilities to you you can go to
the amazon you can hack through that jungle and you
can see some amazing stuff and it'll change who you
are but it'll only change who you are if you
go and do it it won't change who you are
if you just listen to my stories and you believe
them and it won't change who you are just by
reading a book about it i could write a book
about all my crazy experiences and it would change nothing
for you other than maybe inspiring you to do it
yourself and that's really the goal here the goal is
twofold first of all it's to just open your mind
to these possibilities these are very radical possibilities and if
they're not properly explained what happens is your mind doesn't
even recognize that it's a possibility like you could go
to a catholic church and they will preach to you
about god and about heaven and all sorts of angels
and beautiful things and they'll talk about mystical experiences they've
had but your mind won't register this as a real
possibility the communication has to meet you where you're at
such that your mind registers like oh maybe i could
do this for myself so that's the first function of
these talks the second function of these talks is to
inspire you to do it with some charisma and charm
you know i'm sexing this stuff up some of this
stuff i'm exaggerating or i'm playing it up i'm kind
of dramatizing it for the benefit of you getting inspired
now actually there's sort of a there's a trick here
i say i'm exaggerating and dramatizing some of this stuff
i am but actually what i'm doing is i'm underselling
it it might seem like i'm overselling it and i
just said that i'm dramatizing and exaggerating sometimes but truly
i'm underselling how amazing this is no amount of words
can overstate how amazing infinite consciousness is or infinite love
or the realization that you are god or infinite forgiveness
so the reason i sometimes exaggerate and dramatize stuff is
because part of my job is not just to tell
you the truth it's to market the truth to you
it's to get you to realize like holy [ __
] this is important it's to interrupt the petty small
thinking that the majority of your life is somehow i
have to cut through that [ __ ] through all
of the programming of culture society of your friends of
your family and of your own ego mind all of
the all this nonsense we have to somehow cut through
that so because of that i feel entitled sometimes to
exaggerate or to dramatize stuff um because i know that
if you actually realize some of these experiences that i've
had and have them for yourself you will be so
blown away by it but that you will realize like
that i undersold it it's impossible to oversell infinity um
so that's kind of just understand that's kind of where
i'm coming from and so anyways the point here being
that um it's to show you the possibilities to inspire
you to actually do it and then maybe there's a
third function here which is to actually give you some
techniques if you're a consistent viewer and follower of my
content you know i've shared a lot of techniques with
you i've given you a lot of theory but i've
also laid out all the techniques the problem is you
don't want to use them the problem is you're still
thinking that you can just kind of skate by without
the techniques you still hope that if you just watch
enough my videos that that'll be good enough well it
won't just because you know of the possibility of going
to the amazon just because you're inspired to go to
the amazon for yourself and just because you have the
boat and the airplane and the machete and the food
supplies and the tent and the sleeping bag and you
bought all that equipment just because you've done all those
things does not mean you're actually going to go to
the amazon and do it that is the thing that
really matters is you doing it and there's nothing i
can say that will get you to do it as
long as all these other things have already been said
that's on you it's on you how much do you
want out of life like i said before life works
in a beautiful way where you will get what you
put into it if you're not actually willing to go
to the amazon you're gonna miss out on like 95
percent of what there is to know about the amazon
so what that tells me that you're not really a
serious explorer likewise if you're not actually willing to do
the practices if you're not willing to do some yoga
some self-inquiry some meditation retreats some solo retreats some um
you know psychedelics um other kind of practices i've talked
about some shamanic breathing for example if you're not willing
to do these practices and you're not going to do
them seriously then you're not a serious explorer of consciousness
and you're really not serious about life you're not serious
about being human you're not serious about getting the most
out of existence and so my biggest function here is
really just to hammer you in every episode i gotta
just hammer you and hammer you and hammer you over
the head of how much you are not well let's
put it this way how much you're leaving how much
you're leaving on the cutting room floor with the way
that you're living your life there's so much amazing stuff
that you're missing but you can't get it in an
easy way there's a trade-off the more amazing a thing
is that you're missing the more work emotional labor you're
gonna have to expend to actualize that thing that's when
your life really starts to go downhill is when you
stop taking it seriously when you get complacent and lazy
and you just want to coast through life and you
stop wanting to expand your consciousness that's the biggest danger
these days because people people get so easily complacent we
have so much amazing media entertainment i mean you could
spend the rest of your life on youtube watching funny
videos or comedy specials or movies or netflix or porn
or music or sitcoms tv shows playing video games you
could spend the rest of your life doing this this
is the greatest danger is 10 years go go by
and you've wasted all of it just doing those things
then 20 years go by 30 years go by then
but by that point it's too painful for you to
turn around and to get serious about life because you've
already wasted so much of it for you now to
get serious you have to admit to yourself how much
you've wasted that's going to be very very difficult the
longer you wait the more difficult it's going to be
life is meant to be lived on the edge where
you are challenging yourself you don't allow yourself to get
complacent or too lazy or too comfortable pushing yourself expanding
yourself in the right ways not falling into that trap
of of chasing wealth and luxury but there's only so
much i can say the rest really is up to
you the question is are you going to do it
and it's going to be difficult to do and the
reason i got to oversell this journey is because if
you don't have a very compelling vision of why you're
doing it you're never gonna persevere past all of the
grind and challenge and obstacles and the mundaneness of just
sitting down and meditating or doing yoga for an hour
every day for years and years and years you know
that's tedious stuff you're not going to go through the
tedium of it especially because all of your friends aren't
doing it all of your family members are going to
drag you down tell you to stop doing it your
culture and society will lure you away with with promises
of easy pleasure and wealth and luxury and get-rich-quick schemes
you see and so it's just so so easy to
lure you away to seduce you from truly living a
self-actualizing life um and so part of my job here
is to keep you on track with that to keep
reminding you of what life is really about and um
pointing out the traps and the distractions that's another maybe
fourth function of what i do here see i present
you with possibilities i inspire you to do it for
yourself i share techniques with you for how to do
it and then lastly i share all of the traps
and dangers and ways you can [ __ ] it
up and there's hundreds of ways that you can [
__ ] it up and by becoming aware of all
the ways you can [ __ ] it up that
helps you to avoid all the landmines as you're walking
down the minefield mind field not mine field mind field
you are in a mind field and this mind field
is filled with mind traps which is why we talk
about epistemology so much we talk about self-deception we talk
about self-bias and all the other ways that your mind
fools you all right that's it i'm done here please
click that like button for me and come check out
actualize.org that's my website on there you will find some
free and some paid resources that can help you along
on this journey um you can find my book list
which presents you with the most important pieces of theory
that you will need to guide you in your practices
also shares a lot of techniques and methods and practices
in those books you will find my life purpose course
which will help you to align your life with your
top values and get you a sense of purpose and
direction which is actually crucial for having motivation the life
purpose course really i could have called it the how
to get yourself motivated for a lifetime course it it
gives you the foundation for a lifetime of motivation intrinsic
motivation and without motivation you're never going to be successful
in anything that you do motivation is crucial inspiration is
crucial inspiration is literally in spirited to be inspired to
be filled with spirit which is what the source of
this whole episode was remember i started off telling you
that i was inspired literally i was filled with spirits
and then that manifested itself as this conversation here today
this is not leo coming up with this [ __
] this is the universe speaking through some sort of
meat vehicle this is spirit speaking to spirit you'll also
find my blog with exclusive content that i share lots
of free juicy stuff on my blog check it out
i share a lot of documentaries interesting stuff that i
find on youtube and elsewhere on the internet sort of
higher conscious healthy type of stuff that expands your perspective
if you'd like you can support me at patreon.com actualize
with some donations you can check out my second channel
called actualizedclips which features short little segments of my main
videos in case you don't have the patience to sit
through a two-hour three-hour talk and that is that i
want to end with some final point your life will
change the moment that you have some direct consciousness and
experiences of these advanced things that i'm talking about it's
crucial that you understand that what i'm talking about is
not just some armchair philosophy that i came up with
as i was sitting around smoking some weed this is
stuff you can experience for yourself not only can you
but you must if you're gonna follow along with me
if you only keep what i talk about at an
intellectual level and you never validate it through direct mystical
experience of your own these teachings can become very counterproductive
they can make you feel miserable and depressed they can
ultimately even make you suicidal because what's going happen is
that you're gonna have so many advanced and amazing ideas
in your mind and then but then in your normal
life when you wake up in the morning you're gonna
wake up and it's gonna be like well this is
just my boring shitty life and there's going to be
a huge disconnect between the theory you learned from me
about how beautiful and loving life is and then your
shitty life you got to bridge this gap somehow now
it's okay if you're just beginning with my content you
can spend six twelve months just just learning theory it's
important just to learn theory 12 months of learning theory
is not bad you spent 12 years in school just
learning theory right 12 months of theory is nothing all
all good and fine but then after one or two
years at some point you got to say okay enough
of the theory i gotta somehow bridge the gap between
the theory and my life what do i gotta do
to actually start to experience some of these things happening
in my life and if you if you don't do
that i'm telling you it's not going to be healthy
it's going to become dysfunctional that's one of the traps
i've warned you about this trap in the past many
times i've warned you about this trap but i gotta
keep warning you about this trap and i think a
lot of people don't realize how how serious this trap
can get i myself have suffered from this one of
the reasons i suffer from it is because look um
one of the biggest straps for me is that i
do this professionally i get paid for this this is
sort of my career and my life purpose but that's
still not enough for me to be happy and that's
still not enough for me to actualize the things i
talk about it's a lot easier to talk about the
things i talk about than to actually do them i
hope you understand this i hope you understand that i
talk a lot about a lot of stuff that doesn't
mean i've actualized all of it you might then wonder
well leo then you're a hypocrite and why are you
talking about stuff you haven't actualized well because if i
only limited my talks to the things that i fully
actualized myself and mastered this would actually be imposing a
limit upon you i don't want to impose my personal
limits upon you i want to show you the full
range of what's possible with a human life you're going
to only actualize maybe 10 of what i say and
that itself will be life transforming for you right i'm
not expecting you to actualize 100 of it i'm not
expecting myself to actually have 100 of it but i'm
not going to limit myself to that because there would
be such huge gaps in your understanding of reality if
you only limited the things you could think and talk
about to the things that you fully mastered there has
to be a sort of a bootstrapping process where you're
thinking about this stuff you're contemplating it you're you're making
mistakes you're misunderstanding some stuff you're getting trash you know
trapped in some epistemic you know problems but then you
correct as you keep going this is a sort of
it is a bit of a fake it till you
make it process you learn the theory you get excited
by the theory it motivates you have you actualized it
yet no you're just you're you're inspired by it you're
working towards it it might take you 10 years to
actualize some of it and that's fine how else could
it be you can't begin this journey and not make
any mistakes you can't begin this journey and be all
perfect you can't be begin this journey and already be
done if you were already done we wouldn't be talking
about it if i was done with my work i
wouldn't need to be talking about it with you because
i would even transcend the need to talk about it
with you talking about it with you is also part
of my process it's got pros and cons some of
the pros are that i get to talk this stuff
out i get to understand it very deeply the more
you teach something and the deeper you teach it the
deeper you start to understand it yourself look that's the
pros of it the the cons of it is that
i actually do suffer a lot from getting trapped in
the conceptualization of these things in a certain sense i
would be able to grow faster if i didn't have
to teach this stuff because i could just focus on
doing my spiritual practices and other development work not talk
about it with anybody in a certain sense there's that's
powerful that's powerful um i do have to overthink these
things so that i could teach it and the teaching
of it is not the same thing as actually embodying
it these are two different things there can be people
in the world who are amazing at embodying something just
amazing but they're not good at teaching it and moreover
they're not good at marketing it they're even worse at
marketing it and they're even worse at inspiring and motivating
you to do it these are all different skill sets
so be very clear that my embodiment is very weak
compared to my abilities to communicate these ideas i have
a special gift and talent for communicating these ideas somehow
my brain my mind is wired for it it comes
to me naturally spontaneously intuitively i get inspired to do
this to communicate these things i'm inspired just by the
act of communicating these ideas but understand that that's different
from embodying them and so for me one of the
greatest struggles is that my ability to inspire you and
to communicate to you about these ideas and even to
communicate them to myself for me that that's much easier
i have a much higher talent for that than for
actually embodying these ideas now of course that doesn't mean
i don't work at it and in fact lately i've
been i've been doubling my efforts at embodying these ideas
because sometimes i get to a point where it's like
i've talked so much about this [ __ ] and
now i realize just that you know the gap between
what i've talked about and what i'm actually actualizing is
getting too wide i have to i have to work
more on actualizing it and so that is definitely something
i struggle with and i know you guys yourself struggle
with it too and that's just part of this work
it's just part of this work this work is going
to be very messy and dirty in practice it's not
going to be this simple clear-cut linear path like oh
today i learned about enlightenment tomorrow i go to meditation
retreat i meditate a few times then i become enlightened
and it's all done it's all over it it's going
to be way more dirty and hairy than that you're
going to have backsliding and ego backlashes and confusions you're
going to you're going to jump between different spiritual schools
and different techniques and different paths and you're going to
listen to this teacher then that teacher then you're going
to quit spirituality for a year then you're going to
come back to it and do it hardcore for a
year then you're going to quit it again then you're
going to come back and do some other thing and
it's going to be all over the place you're going
to be doing your business or your life purpose and
then spirituality on the side then you're going to flip
that around and do it the other way and you're
going to have relationship things and then you're going to
have money problems and it that's the thing here is
that it's so messy and it's going to be uniquely
messy for you your mess is going to be uniquely
yours my mess is uniquely mine you're going to have
health problems arise you're going to have money problems arise
you're going to have relationship problems arise you're gonna have
spiritual crises arise you're gonna have moments where you're depressed
and miserable and you're doubtful that any of this stuff
is even possible or that it's real or that it
works or that it's gonna work for you and you
got to keep going you got to keep going and
going and going persevering past all these obstacles so the
obstacles are all guaranteed the mistakes are all guaranteed you're
going to be making them it's just a question of
the quantity and severity of them and whether you learn
your lessons from these mistakes so making mistakes is not
the problem the problem is when your mistakes are either
catastrophic or they just they they [ __ ] your
motivation they get you to quit that's that's the real
problem or when you keep making the same mistake over
and over and over again for decades that's also a
problem because your time is finite it's short you gotta
use your time effectively here you only have so many
decades and the decades as you get older they pass
faster keep that in mind all right so that's enough
i've given you plenty of warnings and disclosures here disclaimers
here rather [Music] so now you sort of understand the
realities of this work and of course stay tuned for
more you
