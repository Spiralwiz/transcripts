hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about grasping the illusory
nature of thought what is a thought exactly what really
is it this is one of those kind of questions
that everyone thinks that they know to the point where
they don't even bother investigating it or they take it
as some sort of philosophical question that has no pertinent
application to their everyday life and nothing could be further
from the truth one of the most important questions you
can ask in your life is this question of what
is a thought because after all you do think quite
a bit so if what you think a thought is
is not what a thought is then wouldn't that be
embarrassing wouldn't that be a source of potentially many problems
in your life if you were somehow fundamentally mistaken about
really the true nature of thoughts after all you're using
thoughts to think about your life and you're using thoughts
to analyze reality and you're using thoughts to grasp truth
and yet you've never really bothered to grasp what thoughts
are you've always taken them for granted pretty much always
from day one you've taken thoughts for granted and your
thoughts are a very odd almost quasi magical mystical thing
because they're not physical objects out in the physical world
they're happening inside your mind so to speak but what
exactly are they the nature of thoughts is illusory and
most people do not have awareness over what thoughts are
in this them into so much trouble the difference between
knowing what a thought is and not knowing what a
thought is is the difference between living in a self
constructed mental prison a hellscape in which you suffer all
the negative emotions that you suffer all your anger your
sadness your frustration all the difficulties you have in relationships
with money with business with your health and all that
stuff because all those problems are largely conceptually created they're
taking place in your mind it's the difference between living
in that kind of mental health scape and the opposite
of it which is living in a sort of a
freedom and getting to a self actualized kind of life
which is what I'm here to help you to do
so if you want to self actualize life you should
really concern yourself seriously with the question of what is
a thought and I don't mean just thinking about it
in some philosophical manner or reading what a thought is
in a text book or looking up in a dictionary
I mean getting a experiential direct awareness or consciousness or
mindfulness over what thoughts are in your experience because it
doesn't matter what you think thoughts are it doesn't matter
what you believe thoughts are because actually that's just more
thinking so see you can't escape this problem by thinking
about it more what you got to do is you
got to actually become aware of what thoughts are in
your direct experience so that it's functioning for you so
that the knowledge is functioning in your life and it's
making a difference you see and it's not just another
belief what does it mean to say the thoughts are
illusory well I'm not saying that thoughts are not real
a lot of people hear me talking about consciousness work
or meditation or maybe some enlightenment topics and I talk
about thoughts and how thoughts are tricky and they're deceptive
in their losery and say oh well yeah of course
yeah thoughts are so thoughts aren't real then but that's
not what I'm saying at all thoughts are very real
thoughts are as real as the car the tree the
house your body but there's a wrinkle to it see
thoughts are like chameleons the problem with thoughts is that
what they appear like on the surface is not what
they actually are or rather it's vice-versa thoughts as they
appear are exactly what they are but you take them
to mean a lot more than they really are you
attribute a certain depth to them that normally you shouldn't
attribute to them not if you were fully aware there's
a great story that I like about Picasso and Picasso
I don't know if you know anything about him but
basically he was a kind of a radical avant-garde cubist
painter and all of his paintings are not very realistic
looking in fact it's hard to even see what the
paintings are about sometimes you can have a painting of
a woman and then you look at it doesn't even
look like a woman so this is kind of like
abstract type of art and one day as the story
goes Picasso was travelling in a in a train and
he was just a passenger and there was a man
sitting near him in the cabin and they're traveling together
and the man he recognizes Picasso's is oh your Picasso
and Picasso's like yeah and the man says oh you
know I don't I don't like what you do I
don't like your work you know the art that you
do isn't very good and because it says what do
you mean the man says well what I don't like
about your work is that it's not realistic why do
you go to all this lengths to paint these paintings
which have nothing to do with life they're not realistic
at all and Picasso looks at him kind of puzzled
and says what do you mean they're not realistic show
me an example of what you mean and the man
he opens up his wallet and takes out a photograph
of his wife it's a little 2 inch by 2
inch little square black-and-white photograph of his wife and he
shows it to Picasso it says here look look look
at this look this right here this is real why
don't you paint stuff like this that would be more
useful than what you do and Picasso he looks at
the he looks at the photograph he takes in his
hand he kind of looks at it like this brings
a closer space he turns it to the side kind
of like looks at at the back of the photograph
then he tells the man you know your wife she's
awfully small and also she's very flat so that's just
a great little anecdote that I like which shows us
the problem with images is that images have a certain
like allure to them and they're able to suck us
in into their own reality without us being aware of
what the image really literally is as in the case
of a photograph it's a piece of paper with some
black ink on it that's what it literally is but
what the man makes it out to be in his
mind is his wife of course the photograph is not
literally his wife but it's really easy to get lost
in such my new show because the mind is very
good at abstracting and it tends to consider things that
aren't really the thing it thinks it is as something
that the mind imagines because the mind likes to abstract
stuff there's actually a great painting classic painting by Rene
Magritte he was a surrealist painter maybe you've seen this
one it's called the treachery of images and what it
is and I'll show it to you right here what
it is is it's just a very simple canvas with
a picture of a pipe and then it says I
believe in French it says this is not a pipe
kind of cool I like that one so uh what's
the significance of all this well I want to give
you some analogies for the treachery of thoughts so a
photograph is not the thing depicted right pretty obvious I
mean this isn't rocket science the is that we just
tend to ignore it we tend to ignore the significance
of such a simple little distinction that a photograph is
not the thing depicted because here's the problem is that
if you think that a photograph is the thing depicted
for example I can show you a photograph of a
pizza a delicious mouth-watering pizza and if you actually believe
and confuse the photograph for the real thing then you
might actually delude yourself into thinking that this photograph of
a pizza will be able to ease your hunger you
might actually pack for a trip let's say to go
mountain climbing and you need to pack some food and
supplies and instead of packing actual food that's going to
give you sustenance and allow you to live on that
mountain for a week what you do is you just
pack a box full of photographs of food now if
you did that that would be a fatal mistake now
of course this is kind of preposterous exaggerated example and
you say well Leo I don't really do that in
my life but I beg to differ this is exactly
what you do in your life you're just not very
aware of it yet and I want to help you
to draw this out in your experience so some more
analogies if I show you a three-dimensional drawing of an
object actually that's not a three-dimensional object it's a two-dimensional
object represented in a three dimensional way which kind of
creates a certain kind of illusion which draws you in
and makes you believe for a moment that it's actually
three-dimensional pretty common example another great example is a book
have you ever just taken a book and opened it
up into something I encourage you to actually go and
do pause this recording and actually go do this after
I tell you pick up a book and just kind
of flip through it and notice that all there is
in this book is just black markings on white paper
that's literally what a book is it's paper many pages
of it with a cover and black markings the story
that you think is in the book like let's say
this is a a mystery novel or a romance novel
or some sort of serious textbook on physics or mathematics
doesn't matter what the content is that's what we're calling
the story there is actually no story in the book
the story is something your mind creates out of the
black markings on the white pages you see it's really
useful to just to get that ship actually get this
ship directly in your experience because when you normally pick
up a book you're like oh yeah that's a sentence
that's a word immediately your mind without even thinking out
your mind starts to interpret these markings the mind doesn't
recognize that these are just markings because the mind says
well yeah of course they're markings I know they're markings
let's get beyond that let's see how these markings can
actually be useful to me and the use of the
markings to me is that they tell me a story
or give me some sort of information so let me
just go and jump straight into the information now that's
not a problem with books but it becomes a problem
when this analogy gets applied to your mental process I'm
just giving you analogies right now I'm going to tie
it in with how this fits in with your life
in a minute also think about language what is language
language is just arbitrary sounds of course your mind immediately
interprets meaning and assigns that to the sounds so the
sounds sound like they're actually words and that the meaning
in the words is inherent to the words but if
I spoke to you for example busca music eeeh llamo
Gustavo des Guevara 8et bhagava eat pie you ski Metheny
boo she made me a so it is ook is
not just unless of course you speak Russian and then
you can understand and decipher what those sounds mean otherwise
those sounds are just gibberish to you total gibberish that's
what language is it's just gibberish sound which your mind
then deconstructs and creates some kind of meaning out of
it so those are some analogy now how is this
possible how is it possible that meaning can be contained
within just gibberish sounds or just markings on a piece
of paper or pixels on a screen the way it's
possible is through symbols and a symbol is a really
fascinating thing it's it's remarkable what a symbol is look
at this look at the genius of what a symbol
is a symbol is a thing that represents something that
it itself is not did you get that really think
about this a symbol is by definition not the thing
that it represents that's pretty freaky if you think about
that symbols are actually completely arbitrary anything can stand in
as a symbol for anything else for example I can
represent the moon with any symbol that I want I
can represent it with a refrigerator I can represent your
mom with a fish I can represent the money in
your bank account with five chicken eggs I can represent
your entire life story with a can of coca-cola you
know like there is no limit to what the symbol
can be a lot of times we think like well
the symbol sort of has to resemble the original thing
and no it actually it doesn't not at all in
fact most of the symbols we use most of the
English language uh both spoken and written has nothing to
do with the meanings when I say the word cat
that has nothing at all to do it has no
resemblance whatsoever the actual animal cat you ever notice that
kind of funny it's like totally arbitrary right totally uh
portrayed and yet our mind is able to decipher it
because all that's necessary in our mind just a mapping
the mapping in the mind is just like well cat
equals the actual animal cat that's all the sensor and
you can change all those meetings around if you wanted
to can teach yourself new languages or you can even
reinterpret what an existing language means right now all this
might seem kind of obvious but also just notice how
unconscious this makes you because you're born into this world
and just after a couple of years already you're just
taught language you're taught language your mind is primed for
learning language and then this language is what you use
to think with so your thoughts are arbitrary symbols and
your you think in language you also think in images
but largely your thoughts are just kind of arbitrary symbols
which acquire meaning over time and what the human brain
is is a magnificent mechanism for shuffling around all these
symbols and then creating all sorts of meanings and interconnections
between these symbols and then see what happens after a
while after you do this for 10 20 30 years
what happens is that you start to create all sorts
of weird twisted meanings in your mind where something can
happen in reality and then it can make you feel
depressed or it can make you feel angry or pissed
off it can make you cry it can make you
yell I can make you fuming mad full of rage
it can make you kill somebody because of the meanings
that your mind assigns to certain symbols it's really quite
remarkable that this is even possible it's amazing the symbols
even exist but you have to also start to become
conscious that meaning what it is is because it is
arbitrary it's completely arbitrary that meaning is an illusion and
meanings are some of the most meaningful things to you
what's the meaning of money to you what's the meaning
of a relationship to you what's the meaning of love
to you what's the meaning of sex to you what's
the meaning of your car to you or your house
or your career or your job or how people think
of you whether they think of you as a good
person or a evil person all of these things are
meanings that are spun by the mind but also you're
not aware of what they literally are because a thought
has two components to it so to speak there's the
content of the thought or the story that's contained in
it the meaning in other words and then there's literally
what it is so if you ever get to the
point in your life where you're feeling bad and depressed
or you're having some kind of negative emotional reaction you're
suffering one thing that might dawn on you if you
are conscious enough is that all of these meanings are
not actually true how can this be the case I
want to show you with some practical examples and I'll
give you some exercises here but just recognize now the
significance of this breaking free from your mind requires that
you become aware of what meaning is and it's a
losery nature gaining mindfulness over your thoughts this is one
of the keys to all self-improvement work the more mindful
you are of your thoughts the less reactive and the
less distressed you will be by them because distress and
suffering is only contained within meaning there cannot really be
any suffering without meaning you might think there can be
like you might think that there could be extreme pain
and stuff like this but that's not really the case
almost all of your suffering comes from meaning and yet
at the same time meaning is illusory so you seeing
the significance of this extremely significant this is not philosophy
this is not just some like interesting linguistic theory that
I'm giving to you very practical I want to teach
you a little technique that I kind of came up
with myself I call it flattening the illusion and I
want to train you how to use this technique so
first we're going to train on just some very simple
examples that aren't very applicable to your life so the
first example I'm going to show on the screen right
now go ahead take a look at it so you
see a picture now what I want you to do
is I want you to flatten the illusion as I
say flatten the illusion so notice the meaning that's there
and notice whatever your mind is kind of projecting and
perceiving of the image and now what I want you
to do is how I should just flatten it look
at it literally what is it literally so literally it
is not a three-dimensional cube literally it's some flat markings
on a flat surface of course you could go even
more literal you could say well they're just pixels on
a computer screen that you're looking at that would be
an additional level of literalness but we can even just
kind of ignore that and just pretend like you're looking
at on a piece of paper or something but look
at this literally right it's just some flat markings on
a flat surface there's nothing three-dimensional about it even though
it appears three-dimensional so we might say that the content
appears three-dimensional that's the illusory nature of it the reality
of it literally is that it's just some two-dimensional ink
on a surface okay good now let's go on to
the next example so take a look at this example
this one might be a little more tricky for you
especially if you have a phobia on this issue so
take a look at this and now notice immediately notice
if you have any kind of emotional reactions in your
body or in your mind and what I want you
to do is I again I want you to flatten
the illusion so make a distinction between what's literally there
on the screen that you're looking at and what your
mind is projecting onto it what it's interpreting out of
it this might mean any labels you assign to this
object if you assigning labels to it or any kind
of memories that come up or any kind of associations
any kind of charged emotional reactions you might have any
kind of feelings of disgust or fear or avoidance notice
all of that is separate from what's literally there so
flatten the illusion right now practices actually do it okay
so you're seeing what's literally there and not the content
of the picture notice that the content is an illusion
okay good now let's go on to the last example
of this series so take a look at this now
immediately what I want you to do is to notice
the difference between the content and what's literally there so
flatten this illusion notice any kind of emotional reactions you
might have had to the words written on the screen
and how maybe you perceived it in some kind of
a charged emotional way maybe you related to it in
some way that offended you or made you feel bad
or shocked you or whatever notice that that's - all
your stuff that's not what's happening on the screen and
also notice that the words and symbols written on the
screen notice what those are the meaning of those is
again projected and interpreted by your mind so flatten the
illusion of the words on the screen to the point
where you don't even see them as words anymore but
just as symbols on the screen see the words and
the letters for what they literally are not for what
your mind thinks they mean okay so flatten that illusion
okay great so now you got the hang of it
right pretty simple now the trick though is to actually
get good at flattening the illusion with your thoughts because
your thoughts are just like words on a screen or
images on a screen the problem is that you're not
very aware of thoughts and it takes practice to actually
develop mindfulness to the point where you don't get sucked
in and reactive to the thoughts that you're having in
order to flatten something what I mean by flattening the
illusion basically you just ask yourself the question what is
this thing actually what is it literally it's a literal
way of looking at the world without any abstraction or
projection or any kind of vagueness it's just whatever's there
is exactly what's there and I'm not going to assume
anything about it I'm not going to extrapolate any meaning
out of it I'm not going to relate the thing
that's there to me in any way I'm just going
to see what's literally there so let's try some more
real-world examples with your thoughts now flatten the following illusions
think of your mother get a thought of your mother
whatever it is might be an image in your mind
or a story of memory whatever comes up for you
is fine not very important the details so think of
your mother and now flatten that illusion can you do
it actually do it so that you resolve the thought
and you break down its content and the thought loses
its content and you can just experience the thought as
a you might say just a sensation in your mind
because that's what a thought literally is a thought is
real in a sense that it has a certain feeling
or a sensation to it like if you have an
image of your mom's face that's real but it's not
your mom's face you see in the same way that
if I write a word like cat the word cat
is real but it's not a cat this takes practice
so let's do another one think of gravity whatever idea
or concept you have of gravity bring it up to
mind now if I ask you is gravity real you
would say yes it is of course it is but
now what I want you to do is just take
this concept of gravity and flatten the illusion what is
gravity actually you might say well gravity is a force
in real life no what is actually the thought of
gravity flatten that illusion notice what gravity literally is in
your mind gravity is not a force in the physical
world gravity is a concept in your mind now flatten
that and see that go from thinking of gravity as
a real force in the real world into seeing it
as a sensation in your mind because that is what
literally gravity is - sensation your mind and I don't
mean the sensation of the weight of your body I
mean the sensation of your idea of gravity because gravity
is an idea that's literally what is okay now we'll
try something a little trickier bring to mind your idea
of the external world so think about the external world
the fact that there is an external world that exists
so if you close your eyes you think there's an
external world right you don't think the world disappears do
you probably not so bring to mind the external world
now normally people would say well the external world is
a real thing it's the most real thing there is
but take a look at what the external world literally
is flatten that illusion the external world is not an
external world the external world is a thought in your
mind it's a sensation in your mind that you experience
so notice it for what it literally is got it
good let's move on to the next one think of
God whether you do believe or God in God or
don't believe in God doesn't matter just bring to mind
the idea of God or whatever you think God is
okay now flatten the illusion of God notice what God
literally is notice that you might have a resistance to
flattening the illusion of God you may not want to
see God as what God literally is because you've been
telling yourself part of the illusion of God is that
no God is real God is out there God's not
in my head God's not an idea that one might
be tricky for you if your atheist that's a really
easy one for you because you already believe that God
is an idea but that's a whole can of worms
I'm not going to go into here okay and now
what I want you to do and this is the
trickiest one of all be real careful about this one
think of yourself you not just the thought of you
but literally you who are you what are you think
of yourself the most truest sense of yourself that you
have bring that to mind okay got it now flatten
the illusion of yourself mm yeah that's a tricky one
you might have some resistance to doing that one that
one's even harder to do than God cuz you do
think you're yourself and part of the illusion of being
yourself is thinking that you're not an idea but that
you're really yourself you're real but what is yourself really
literally look at this very objectively don't let your mind
you flatten the illusion of yourself okay got it good
now that one might take you some more practice to
really get down it's a really tricky tricky one so
anyways these are all exercises that force your mind to
see reality literally and to deconstruct your thoughts into what
they literally are versus seeing the story the content or
the image of the thoughts I really like to draw
the analogy between what we're doing here and what artists
are taught to do when they learn to draw so
a good artist and if you go to a art
class what they'll teach you if you want to become
a good drawer is they'll sit you down though it's
going to be like a still-life like it's going to
be a maybe a flower pot with a vase and
maybe a bowl of fruit and it's going to be
nicely lit and you're gonna be sitting there with the
whole class you're going to be drawing this thing they're
going to ask you to draw that as accurately as
you can just with a pencil and piece of paper
you know very simple and the instruction that they'll give
you to make you a good drawer is they'll tell
you draw not what you think is there but literally
what you see and that's kind of what we're telling
you to do here don't think abstractly about what God
is or what your mom is real gravity is what
you are but literally just become mindful of what exactly
is happening in your experience in order to even render
the story of God gravity external world yourself or your
mom see and a good artist at first it's very
difficult because you might think that when you're drawing something
it's like well yeah I already know what's there but
what you quickly realize if you go to one of
these classes like no you don't know what your drawing
is you're kind of drawing your idea your image your
abstract fantasy of what's there when you literally draw what's
there it's a totally different experience even though the thing
you're looking at didn't really change it's the same thing
with becoming more mindful of your thoughts so this entire
episode what I'm talking about is how to become more
mindful of your thoughts and hopefully this is starting to
show you the power of mindfulness now mindfulness doesn't just
apply to thoughts you can apply mindfulness to feelings sensations
emotions all sorts of stuff sights and sounds but the
most important thing that you can apply mindfulness to is
your thoughts because your thoughts construct all the meanings in
your life what would your life be without meaning it
would be unrecognizable to you and all the problems you
have in your life what do you think those are
those come from meaning without meaning there cannot be a
problem to understand this a problem is a meaning is
a specific type of meaning that you assign to a
specific type of situation and then you tell yourself well
the meaning is baked into this issue you know I'm
angry because that person did something to me or I'm
afraid because I really don't have enough money in my
bank account to pay my mortgage next month you tell
yourself that but that's just more layers of meaning you
see it's like meaning masking meaning masking meaning masking meaning
that's what's so dangerous about thoughts with the picture is
really simple to see that a photograph of a piece
of pizza is not going to feed your hunger that's
easy enough to see but with thoughts you can't see
this because the thoughts just come one on top of
the next on top of the next on top of
the next and you just believe every single thought that
comes without questioning them without looking at them very carefully
and so pretty quickly you're overrun by thoughts and you're
just lost in the middle of a vast ocean of
flaws and then you start to drown and you really
believe because you're surrounded completely by thoughts that your reality
becomes thoughts you live in an augmented reality and then
from this many of your problems in life come if
you're shy the only reason you're shy is because of
thoughts thoughts make you shy the real world doesn't make
you shine doesn't make anybody shy if you're afraid of
something the only reason you're afraid of something is because
you're lost in a sea of thoughts the real world
rarely like if a lion jumps out at you from
the middle of nowhere yeah you're going to have some
kind of like really um a low-level reptilian brain response
to that so from there you can have kind of
a chemical fear but most of your fears are not
like that most of your fears are these higher-order fears
that are coming from conceptual interpretations of reality same thing
with anger and depression frustration and annoyance and every other
emotion you don't like and similarly with the positive emotions
a lot of those are stemming from the meanings that
you assign to objects and situations in the world so
can you see the potential power of gaining mastery over
the way in which you assign meaning to things very
powerful the trick is it requires practice this is not
something you just kind of like watch a video about
it or listen to me talk about it for an
hour so and it's like yep I got it leo
and now I can go and apply it and now
I don't have any more fears or anger any a
depression earning like that it's not going to work that
quickly for you because you've got so many meanings you've
got this giant web of meanings wrapped in another web
of meanings wrapped in another web of meanings that you're
just totally lost you're totally lost and it's going to
take you practice to unravel this web of meanings that
you've created but can you see the potential value of
making this investment in practicing and learning how to do
this you might not immediately resolve all your problems but
can you see that over time if you spend a
few months or a few years practicing this that over
time you're going to develop the mental facility or ability
to kind of become the master of your own mind
and your own meanings and you can become extremely good
at this you can become so good at this that
literally you can melt problems away just completely dissolve them
but that'll take some doing so how do you do
this how do you practice this well let me give
you an assignment what I want you to do over
the next week if you accept this challenge is I
want you to commit to the following I want you
to flatten 50 illusions that actually occur in your everyday
experience so regular stuff not just made up examples kind
of like what I made up here but real stuff
50 illusions over the next week and by illusions I
mean thoughts thoughts that you have you're going to flatten
50 of them and each one you're going to write
down carefully and accurately in a journal so let me
give you three examples of how this might work so
let's say tomorrow I go to work and something happens
at work and I really hate my boss so I
really feel like oh I hate my boss he's such
an okay good so number one so I write to
my journal number one I hate my that's what came
up as a thought I noticed it okay I wrote
that down now what I want you to do is
to break that down into two components one component is
the content and the other component is what it literally
is so I hate my boss what's the content of
that well the content of that is the meaning I
assigned to it so something like my boss is a
complete idiot and I wish he was fired like that's
the content that's the story but what is it literally
literally in your mind as it's happening what is it
so there you might write down something like image of
boss with a stupid face image of boss getting fired
feeling in my chest of contraction and heating because that's
the emotional component right so a charge thought is not
just a mental image but it's also like probably a
constriction in your body somewhere some kind of tension so
write that down as well that's literally what that is
so that's an example of flattening the illusion now let's
give you a second example let's say that you're going
about your day and you're in a crowd of people
and all of a sudden you feel shine insecure what's
the content of that so you write that down number
two I am shy let's say that that's your thought
what's the content there the content there is that it's
something like well I'm always insecure in groups you know
I really feel bad about being shy all the time
I wish I wasn't shy that's the content what is
it literally literally it might be something like butterflies in
your stomach ah feeling the pumping of your blood through
your veins and your arms and in your neck and
it might also be a kind of a feeling of
sadness and depression and an image of you being weak
and awkward looking and everybody laughing at you you know
maybe have that kind of image in your mind and
also the sound of I am shy or why am
I so shy why was I born this way that
might be literally what this thing is okay got that
and then the third example is something like let's say
you're going about your day and you have this idea
like oh you know I'm listening to all these actualised
old videos and I really have a plan for my
life I'm going to be rich I really want to
be rich I have this goal of becoming rich I
want to be a millionaire and I want to drive
around and BMW okay so you write that down number
three in your journal I am going to be rich
write that down that's your thought and now what's the
content of that the content is something like I'm gonna
have a million dollars and drive around in a BMW
okay and what's literally going on there in that thought
well you probably have an image of you with the
big stack of dollar bills or maybe it's in a
briefcase or maybe you're picturing digits in your bank account
like seven digits in your bank account and also you're
picturing yourself driving down the coast on you know of
California in a BMW and it's kind of like silver
colored red colored whatever color you want and also you've
got this kind of like positive light bubbly feeling somewhere
in your chest kind of that's kind of like the
happiness component because this this is a bowl you're so
it probably makes you happy to to picture yourself this
way so that's literally what this thing is notice that
there's a big difference between what it literally is and
the content that you attribute to it the meaning of
it big difference so those are three examples I want
you to come up with 50 of these from your
real life over the next week this will take some
commitment from you because you'll easily forget so make sure
that if you want to do this you really commit
to it and maybe set a reminder for yourself so
that you're not forgetting every single morning that you wake
up that this is what you're doing and keep your
journal with you throughout the day and write this stuff
down take it to work or to school wherever you
go I guarantee that if you do this 50 times
over the next week you're going to have some pretty
interesting insights and already this giant condensed web of beliefs
you have in all these meanings about how bad your
life is and how you can't do this and how
you feel deficient in this area it's going to start
to unravel not totally but you're going to start to
see the potential of this and hopefully what it'll do
is it'll just kind of get you to buy into
the idea that mindfulness is important and that understanding what
thoughts are important is important and maybe it'll show you
how poor your mindfulness skills are maybe it'll demonstrate to
you that man you know I thought I knew what
was going on in my mind but really I have
no freaking clue what's going on in my mind I'm
not even sure what I thought is what is the
flawed do this exercise 50 times and you'll just get
to the point where you'll be like oh my god
I can't believe I don't even know what a thought
is and that's true you don't know what a thought
is and doing 50 of these examples is not gonna
reveal to you what a thought is that's going to
take many hundreds of hours more of work but remember
how powerful this is this is one of the keys
to all personal development this is one of the keys
to unlocking your entire mind so don't treat this casually
don't expect this to come easy and effortlessly for you
you're going to struggle a lot with this but also
remember that you're shooting for something big here if you
actually do ever become fully mindful of what a thought
is that will be huge for you huge that will
be more valuable to you than all the self-help books
you could read in five years but it can't be
a belief it can't be an idea can't be a
theory of yours can't be an ideology you can't turn
it into a dogma you have to actually practice this
as a skill this is a skill no different than
hitting a golf ball well or doing a good tennis
serve or you know skiing excellently down a mountain without
falling down these are all like physical skills and so
is the awareness of your mind and of your thought
process you could think of it almost like a physical
skill like playing the piano and right now you're a
horrible pianist therein lies one of your biggest problems in
life the problem is that you have thoughts that tell
you that you're an excellent pianist and that you don't
need to learn how to play the piano because you're
just a natural at it you were born good you
were born knowing how to think so naturally you should
know what thoughts are but this is a very dangerous
thought to have and maybe one day you can become
mindful of the fact that you have that thought and
then you can flatten it and see what it really
is yeah see that and if you want to take
this to deeper levels read up on mindfulness I have
some powerful videos and additional episodes that talk about mindfulness
meditation how to practice it how to set up a
habit of developing a little bit more mindfulness every single
day you can also try different forms of meditation that
can build up mindfulness you can also watch some of
my other episodes that go into depth into revealing the
illusory nature of your mind and how your mind really
works you know I talked about what emotions are and
how they work I talked about what thoughts are and
how they work and many many other things like this
so this is a whole field for you right this

a little door that leads to a very vast new
universe which ultimately leads to freedom and to a self
