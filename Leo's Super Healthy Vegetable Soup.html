Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. Welcome to my kitchen
once again, and in this episode, I'm going to share
with you a recipe for making a very healthy and
easy vegetable soup. Now, it might seem like it's just
a recipe, but it's more than just a recipe, it's
really a whole methodology. What I'm going to show you
here is how to replace probably 1/3 of all of
your meals into this very healthy vegetable soup. So this
is something that's going to save you a lot of
time in your week, as far as your meals go,
you're going to have save a lot of hassle, as
far as choosing where to go and how to get
your meals and how to prepare your meals, it's going
to save you time and actually preparing your meals because
you're gonna make a giant batch of it, and it's
gonna last you for your whole week. And the best
part of all is that you're going to free up
all the physical and vital energy that is consumed by
all the crappy meals that you normally consume throughout your
week are going to free that up, which is going
to be energy that you're going to put towards self
actualization and consciousness work. So this is actually a technique
that I gleaned from Thomas Campbell, who started talking one
one time he started talking about how he does this
soup that he just stores in his fridge. And then
he keeps it in he just like ladles it out
every single day. And that's what he eats. And I
was very surprised by how simple and how ingenious that
is. And I was wondering like, would that actually work
for me. So I've been experimenting for the last month.
And it's been working quite well. And I think it'll
work well for you as well. So here's the, the
idea, the idea is that you get a giant pot
like this, that we're going to use to make our
soup, it needs to be big enough that you can
get almost a week's worth of soup in this thing.
The soup is just add vegetables. So the healthiest vegetables,
you can find, you're going to buy them chop them
up, preferably an organic form, and put them in here,
that plus some vegetable stock, some spices, some salt, and
some oil. And that's basically it. And then this thing
is cooked for one hour. I recommend you do it
on Sunday night, because then you've got your whole week
with the soup. And then you stick it in your
refrigerator, it stays fresh for all week long, so you
don't need to worry about it going bad. And that's
it, it tastes quite good. So you're not really sacrificing
much. I find that if you care about performance in
your life, and you want to be out there doing
stuff, you want to be active, you want to be
running a business, you ought to be working on your
life purpose, you want to be meditating, you want to
be reading and not falling asleep while you read. Write
if you want to be doing all this kind of
stuff, you got to supply the right food into your
body, both for your body and also for your mind.
The deeper you get to self actualization, the more you
will realize how important diet is. And the more you
clean up your diet, the more sensitive your body and
your mind will become to the effects of eating a
proper diet. If your diet is really, really terrible, you
might not notice the effects at first, right, you got
to wean yourself off of all that toxic junk all
the chemicals you're putting in your body to start to
feel the difference. And you really start to feel the
difference if you're meditating a lot. Or if you're doing
self inquiry, where you become attuned to the subtle differences
in your mind. That's where you really start to notice
the changes of your diet on that kind of work.
So what I'm going to show you here is I'm
going to show you how to assemble this whole thing,
I'm going to cook it for you, we're going to
do a sort of a time lapse thing where I'm
going to start the cooking. But then since it cooks
for an hour, we're going to make some edits, so
that it's quick and easy. And you can see every
intermediate step that goes into this thing. All right. So
without further ado, let's head back into the kitchen. And
I'll show you how to do this. All right, so
here we have a close up of all our ingredients.
And I'm going to show you how to put them
in and all the spices and all the stuff that
comes together in the soup. So the first thing we
need is just this giant pot. The bigger your pot,
the better. You want it to last you for an
entire week. So try to get something big. Now I'll
just explain the ingredients as I'm tossing the main here.
So But firstly, so we've got a bunch of vegetables,
all these vegetables are pre washed, I washed them, I
dice them up. And they're all organic. It took me
about 30 minutes to get to this stage. So cleaning
them cutting them up, takes a little bit of work.
But remember that in the long run, it's going to
save you time throughout the week. So just doing 30
minutes of PrEP is no problem at all. I've also
got some oil, I've got some spices. I've got some
juice from lemons. I've got some vegetable stock and I've
got some water and so we're going to put all
this together now. So let me just start tossing this
stuff in. This here is organic baby carrots, just an
entire bag full. I'm not giving you specific measuring quantities
here. Because the way that I do this, I just
go to the grocery store and buy whatever vegetables look
good, whatever vegetables look fresh, and whatever packages they come
in. So this is one package of baby carrots. I
start off with that. Then we've got some organic red
bell peppers, which I've diced up. This is for large
bell peppers worth, so it's quite a bit. Put that
in there. And then at this point, I like to
put in the vegetable stock. So this is one packet
is one quart of low sodium vegetable broth is organic.
And it just contains basically water, carrots, onions, celery, leeks,
tomato puree, mushrooms, garlic salt. And that's pretty much it.
So it's just a vegetable stock. And of course, that's
not all the liquid, most of the liquid in here
is going to be water, which I added the very
end after all the ingredients. But we want this base
of vegetable stock to give it some ready made flavor.
Then I've got one bunch of organic diced up celery,
so it's an entire bunch of it. And then the
main ingredients are going to be broccoli, which you can
see I have the most of this is organic chopped
up broccoli. We'll wait on that for a minute. I've
also got frozen green beans that I'm going to put
in there as well. But before we fill this pot
up, I want to make sure I want to remember
to put in the oil. So because this is an
all vegetable soup, there's not a lot of calories here,
there's no meat. And there's really no oil other than
what you add. So what I add is a organic,
extra virgin olive oil, and I add quite a bit
of it. So this right here is a one half
of a cup scoop, I'm going to add two scoops
to this. So that's going to be a full cup
of oil to the soup. Now that might seem like
a lot. But remember that this is first of all
is healthy oil. Second of all, this is going to
last you for like a whole week. So a lot
of the stuff we put in here like the salt,
you might also think that it's too much salt. But
actually it's not because this is the same just a
smaller bottle. Yeah, like I'm saying it's not too much
because you got to remember this this large quantity of
vegetables. And also you want the extra calories because if
it's just vegetables, you're going to eat the soup and
then it's going to you're going to go hungry an
hour later and the oil makes it taste better as
well. Okay oil I also have lemon juice. And this
I found is actually one of the secret ingredients to
making the soup taste really good. If you make it
without any acid, it's just not going to have that
kick to it that you want. So this is two
large lemons that have been squeezed. And I find that's
the perfect amount to give a little bit of tang
and sour flavor to the soup which really brings out
all the flavors. And now let's add the salt and
the various spices. So as far as the salt goes,
because this is a massive amount of vegetables, we want
to add quite a bit of salt. I use pink
Himalayan sea salt. This is a natural high quality salt.
Make sure that if you're going to be using large
amounts of salt like I am here, that you're not
using the regular, white, iodized stuff that you find in
the restaurants get a high quality salt. It's not that
expensive. So this is one teaspoon right here. And I'm
going to end up adding four of these so that's
1234 and you could even add a fifth one because
it's still not going to be that salty because there's
a lot of vegetables here and then I add some
some Ice is for flavor. So here's some white pepper
ground up a little bit of that for spice, some
garlic powder. Also to give a little bit of that
oniony flavor core coriander powder and lastly are the Bailey's,
I usually add about five large bay leaves per, per
soup. Okay, and that's all the spices pretty simple. And
let me just make sure that I'm not forgetting anything
other than these vegetables. Yeah, I think that's about it.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to add the green beans and lastly, I'm going to
top it off with the broccoli. Now here's the trick
that I discovered is you want to be careful not
to overfill this pot, because once we start boiling it,
it'll all boil over, it's going to turn into a
mess. So I put the broccoli in last. And you
want to be sort of conservative with it, I'm not
going to put all of it in probably because it's
going to be too much. That's pretty good. We'll see
I might add some more here in a minute. And
now what we need to do is just to fill
it up with water. So I have a giant pitcher
of water, I'm going to pour it to cover all
the vegetables. The thing I'll tell you about the water
is just make sure you use a high quality spring
water, I use those big five gallon water bottles that
you could see at your office cool water cooler, don't
get this water from your tap. Because you're going to
be boiling this and it's going to be evaporating any
kind of crud that you have in your tap water
is going to get all lodged in your soup. If
you're gonna be eating the soup on a regular basis,
the way that I'm recommending you do, you want to
make sure you're using quality clean water. Yeah, I think
it's worth the investment. So now we're just going to
top all this off and that looks like almost the
perfect amount. as this cooks, it will the vegetables will
cook down. So the general level of it will will
create some extra space. But that's pretty good. And if
we need more, I have some more water here. I
could add a little bit more water. Just like that.
And I might top it off a little more as
we keep cooking it. Okay, so this is done. Now
all we got to do is cook it for an
hour. So the technique for cooking is very simple. First,
I'm going to crank it up to a fairly high
heat to start to get this thing to boil. As
soon as I see that it starts boiling, what I'm
going to do is we're going to start my timer.
So right now, I'm not going to start it yet.
I'll start it for 60 minutes, the entire cook time
of this will be 60 minutes from the point that
it starts to boil. So it'll probably take 10 or
15 minutes just to get it to start boiling. After
which point I'll start the timer. And then I'll show
you what it looks like at all the different stages
of this process. So for now, we'll just yeah, we'll
just let it boil. And I'll come back and show
you what it looks like. So here we are almost
20 minutes from the point where I turned on the
stove. And you can see it's starting to boil. And
this is the perfect timing to mix it a little
bit. And then to put on the put on the
lid and we're going to reduce the heat to just
a simmer. And the key is to find the right
stove temperature so that it doesn't boil over and you
can leave it for about an hour. We're going to
set a 60 minute timer here. So it's boiling now
so I'm going to reduce this down to about a
three on my stove you're going to need to find
what that setting is for you to put a lid
on On this thing and Okay, so now here we
are at the 30 minute mark. So we're halfway through
the cooking. Let me show you what this actually looks
like. So it's already fairly well cooked through, but the
vegetables are still not totally soft yet. So we're gonna
give it another 30 minutes until it's all cooked together
and the vegetables get really soft I'm gonna turn the
heat down just a little bit, so doesn't boil over.
Alright, so here we are. We're done cooking at zero
minutes, it's been an hour. Since this thing started to
boil, I'm going to turn off the heat and show
you what the sky looks like. So basically, all the
vegetables are nice and cooked through. Everything is cooked together.
And it is done. At this point, what I'll do
is I'll let it sit on the countertop for a
few hours to cool off. It takes a long time
for this big batch of stuff to cool down, at
which point, I'll put it in the refrigerator. And it'll
last for up to a week, no problems. But just
to show you what it looks like. And to get
myself a bowl I'll just scoop some out right here
what else I'll tell you is that you can use
pretty much any kind of vegetables that you like. So
you don't have to stick to my particular recipe. Here's
what it looks like. Ready to eat, although it's very
hot. But like I was saying. You can use whatever
vegetables you like. So you don't have to particularly use
these you can experiment, try different variations, try putting mushrooms
in there, you can try different lettuce, cabbage, spinach. I
mean, there's all sorts of stuff you can put in
there. And the only thing I'll tell you not to
put in there are the heavy starchy vegetables. So avoid
things like potatoes. If you get the idea to put
rice in there, avoid rice. Avoid avoid pasta, rice. So
this is the standard stuff that you find in our
typical diet that we want to avoid with this. The
whole idea here is that here you're eating a very
healthy soup, you're basically it's just a ton of the
healthiest vegetables you can find. So stick to the green
vegetables, stick to the orange vegetables, stick to the stuff
that normally you wouldn't eat, or you'd only eaten a
salad, the stuff that's really healthy. When you cook it
in this soup, you'll find that it tastes good. So
cauliflower, green peas, you might even try some corn. Although
don't overdo it with the cord. That's another start empty
starchy type of vegetable. And just see what other kinds
of flavors you can get out of it, I'm sure
you can come up with different combinations, so that you
have different versions of this soup, so you don't get
bored with it. Week by week, you might come up
with four different recipes for this soup, that all tastes
quite a bit different. You could put some tomatoes in
there, tomato sauce, tomato paste, different kinds of oils, maybe
instead of olive oil, try different kinds of oil, like
sesame oil or whatever, just to get a different flavor
profile, so that you you have some variety in your
soup. All right, so that does it here is my
bowl of soup. I would eat it, but it's ridiculously
hot, I need to give it some time to cool
off. Before I even think of putting this in my
mouth. But the soup is done. I have a whole
batch of it behind me which is ready now for
the week to come. And that's it. What I recommend
for you is to give this a 30 day challenge.
Make this soup for the next 30 days, every single
week for four weeks, and just try out what effects
this has. What I will claim is that what it's
going to do is it's going to, it's going to
replace about a third of your diet. You can you
can replace a third of your diet with this soup.
Yes, it will feel a little bit boring compared to
eating out all the time or eating all the junk
food that you eat, but also compared to how you
feel. Notice the freeing effect that this has on your
meditation practices on your contemplation on your self inquiry on
your energy The levels and all the other stuff that
you are working on your life purpose, for example, your
business. If you have kids, then the energy you have
to invest with your kids, and so forth. So this
is very healthy, it's 100%, all of it vegetarian and
vegan, all organic. And it's relatively inexpensive, especially if you
want to go the non organic route, and just by
conventional vegetables, it'll be really cheap, the organic will be
a little bit more expensive. So that's it, use it
like a system, don't just make this soup once. And
then, you know, just have it like a recipe that
you make once a month, I recommend that you actually
turn it into a system where you replace meals with
it consistently. So that this is your go to thing.
So you always have it in the fridge. One of
the things that I really love about this is that
when I'm hungry, and I'm busy, I don't have time
to go out and eat. I don't maybe even want
to wait because I'm so hungry. Usually I would grab
some unhealthy snack in that case. But when I have
this soup in the fridge, it's really easy. So another
thing that will happen to you if you do this
is not only will you have more energy and mental
clarity, of course for your self actualization work, but also
you will lose weight very quickly. You'll just notice the
fat shed right off of you. Because you cannot get
fat on this soup. And you can eat it in
all the quantity you want. Eat as much of it
as you want. Of course, that means you have to
make more of it, but there's no limits on portion
size. You'll find that a bowl of this size, which
is what I have here, your typical soup bowl that
this will be a full meal. It's quite satisfying. So
you don't need bread with this. You don't need toast
bagels you don't need pasta, you don't need rice, you
don't need anything this is it. Just pure vegetables, and
some oil in here and some spices. That's all you're
dealing with. So I look forward to seeing what results
you get from this. So try this out on your
life. Post me your comments down below. Let me know
