            <ul>
    <li><b>Untapped Potential and Life Purpose</b>: Leo explores the concept of untapped potential, acknowledging how individuals can feel lost or sidetracked by societal or personal circumstantial pressures. He addresses the importance of finding one's purpose, not just discovering it but also maintaining focus and developing techniques to remain on track. He notes that internal limitations, not external factors like lack of money or opportunities, often prevent individuals from unlocking their full potential.
</li><li><b>Challenging Existing Mindsets</b>: Leo challenges conventional mindsets that hinder potential, arguing that resourcefulness and strategic thinking are the keys to success. He states that the difference between those living fulfilling lives and those who aren't is their approach to problem-solving and their ability to take action.
</li><li><b>Aiming for Significant improvements</b>: Leo expresses his enthusiasm to work with people interested in making significant (5x, 10x, or even 100x) improvements in their lives rather than just a 20% increase. Success for individuals could mean financial achievement, meeting fitness goals, an increased sense of fulfillment, or awareness and connection with the world.  
</li><li><b>Coaching Benefits and Expectations</b>: Clients can expect several benefits from coaching including clarity about their life purpose, strategies to move forward, improved resourcefulness and motivation, discovery of hidden potential, increased courage to pursue dreams, and enhanced time management and creativity. Clients can also anticipate accountability for their actions and support in maintaining the balance in all aspects of their life such as work, family, health, and personal development.
</li><li><b>Aligning Inner and Outer Game</b>: Leo discusses the necessity of aligning one's 'inner game' (mindsets and attitudes) and 'outer game' (actions and behaviors). He assists clients in developing long-range plans and holding them accountable for their actions, emphasizing that coaching provides quick personal growth and self-mastery, hence creating a more fulfilling life. 
</li><li><b>Inner game and fulfillment</b>: Leo stresses that true fulfillment comes from your inner game, not from external successes such as financial success, reaching fitness goals or attaining material possessions. Even after achieving all of these, one can still feel unfulfilled without the right mindset.
</li><li><b>Excitement and purpose</b>: Leo identifies the main feeling associated with a strong inner game as excitement - a sense of energy and aliveness that comes from knowing that you're on purpose, making a big impact, confident, and able to manifest your dreams into reality. 
</li><li><b>Aligning and clarifying life goals</b>: The coaching process involves clarifying your purpose, wants, and dislikes, as well as identifying strengths and weaknesses. Leo asserts that many people haven't taken the time to consciously think about these things, but doing so can make decisions easier and increase motivation and engagement.
</li><li><b>Feeling successful and accomplished</b>: Leo aims to help clients feel successful and accomplished not only by achieving their goals, but also by putting them on the right track towards their long-term ambitions. This process is not a quick fix or magic pill, but it can instill feelings of excitement, success, and confidence immediately.
</li><li><b>Motivation and optimism</b>: Coaching sessions with Leo are designed to inspire and motivate clients, leaving them feeling excited, optimistic, and positive about their future. If you aren't feeling positive about your future, Leo believes that something needs to change.
</li><li><b>Handling challenges and maintaining focus</b>: Leo highlights the importance of being equipped to handle life's inevitable challenges, and of maintaining a focused, high-level mindset that enables you to execute actions and feel proud of your accomplishments. 
</li><li><b>Starting coaching with Leo</b>: Those interested in coaching can avail of a free, no-strings-attached 50-minute coaching session. Leo emphasizes that his focus is on providing value, not upselling, and that he aims to work with individuals who are excited about unlocking their full potential and making significant transformations in their lives.
</li><li><b>Limited availability and free resources</b>: Due to limited availability, Leo encourages anyone interested in coaching to reach out soon. He also pointed out free resources available on his website actualise.org, where he shares his experiences and provides advice on creating an extraordinary life.
