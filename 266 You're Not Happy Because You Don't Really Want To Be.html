            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5a9q6yPiwP0' target='_blank'>You're Not Happy Because You Don't Really Want To Be</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Your Happiness May Not Be What You Think</b>: Leo Gura discusses the idea that you may not be truly happy because you don't actually want to be. He challenges the understanding of happiness, suggesting that people are often content with conditional happiness, where external factors determine happiness.
</li><li><b>Conditions of Happiness</b>: Conditional happiness means being happy only when everything goes according to your plan or your way, from having clean water and good food to being successful. However, because the universe is chaotic and things often don't go our way, Leo says this kind of happiness is difficult to maintain.
</li><li><b>Understanding Unconditional Happiness</b>: Leo explores the notion of unconditional happiness, happiness that is felt regardless of external circumstances. Most people want but struggle to accept unconditional happiness because it requires letting go of the conditions and rules they have set for themselves to be happy.
</li><li><b>Motivation and the Rules of Happiness</b>: Our motivational system in life is based on achieving certain things which we have created as a rule for happiness, such as success. Leo argues that this understanding is often flawed and leads to an improper grounding of motivation. 
</li><li><b>Happiness vs. Success</b>: Leo believes that most people have misprioritized success over happiness. He argues that every human being really wants happiness and fulfillment, not success or achievement, and suggests flipping the focus from success to happiness. 
</li><li><b>The Danger of Rules of Happiness</b>: Leo suggests that the rules people create to be happy, such as reaching a certain level of success, earning a certain amount of money, or having a perfect family, can be problematic. If these rules become the focus rather than happiness itself, people can get caught in a cycle of activity that no longer contributes to their actual happiness.
</li><li><b>Shifting Motivation Structure</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of shifting one's motivational structure from conditional to unconditional happiness. He argues the shift can be unsettling as it challenges one's worldview but is necessary for a better life. 
</li><li><b>Happiness and Identity</b>: He suggests that people often assimilate certain actions into their identity to maintain motivation, which can be detrimental when those actions don't bring happiness. 
</li><li><b>Disconnecting Success from Happiness</b>: Leo argues that the pursuit of success often leads to a disconnect from happiness. Instead, he proposes focusing on happiness and making everything else disposable to that end. 
</li><li><b>Challenging Negative and Positive Motivation</b>: The video transcript also covers the limitations of negative and positive motivation. Negative motivation involves punishing oneself for not achieving, while positive motivation involves rewarding oneself for achieving. Leo advises realigning motivation structures and adopting unconditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Positive and Negative Motivation Limitations</b>: Leo Gura asserts that even positive motivation, such as self-rewarding, contributes to conditional happiness because it necessitates moments where there are no rewards, creating misery. People generally train themselves with such rewards, turning themselves into their own trainers. This conditioning establishes that fleeting, emotionally validating reward as essential to happiness, but this methodology guarantees unhappiness in the long run. 
</li><li><b>Existing Motivation Structure</b>: Gura argues people's existing motivation structure is built on the concept of rewards and punishments, suffering or worrying about something becomes the trigger to take action. Yet this notion limits our perspective on happiness and motivation, and challenges the norm of what society deems as happy or acceptable. This structure, as argued, needs revision for a healthier mindset and authentic motivation.
</li><li><b>Identity and Happiness</b>: Gura highlights how certain behaviours or actions are assimilated into oneÂ’s identity to ease motivation, such as being a hard worker, a family person or a gym-goer. However, this can be problematic when these aspects don't bring happiness. They become so vital to one's identity that giving them up feels like losing oneself. The reluctance to let go of these elements, according to Gura, delegitimises the quest for happiness.
</li><li><b>Rules and Conditions for Happiness</b>: Gura criticises the societal propensity to fixate on rules and conditions for happiness: specific incomes, body fat percentages, relationships, external circumstances, and more. These rules, deeply ingrained since childhood, cloud the true pursuit of happiness. People tend to compile exhaustive lists of conditions to be fulfilled for happiness, but Gura argues this never works because the pursuit becomes about ticking off the list, not actual happiness.
</li><li><b>Unconditional Happiness and Identity</b>: Striving for unconditional happiness requires questioning these rules and possibly parting with parts of our identity. This challenging journey may seem unsettling, even threatening, but is necessary for attaining genuine happiness, argues Gura. He suggests that people's reluctance to accept unconditional happiness stems from a complex web of beliefs, identities, and societal conditioning. Gura insists that the key to happiness lies not in achieving all conditions but in allowing oneself to be happy without conditions.
</li><li><b>Different sets of rules influence happiness</b>: Each individual develops a unique set of rules that define their happiness, these rules are learned and developed throughout one's life based on experiences and societal expectations such as family values, religious beliefs, and societal norms. This paradigm often becomes a barrier to finding true happiness.
</li><li><b>Challenging and questioning these rules</b>: To achieve unconditional happiness one must examine and challenge these deeply rooted beliefs and rules. The process requires introspection and questioning why certain things or circumstances are considered necessary for happiness. Most of these perceived necessities stem from a perceived deficiency or 'hole' in one's psyche that one believes can be filled with physical things or external achievements.
</li><li><b>Understanding and accepting 'completeness'</b>: Instead of trying to fill these psychological holes with external things, one should understand that these holes are merely illusions. Every individual is complete and does not require external factors for completion or happiness. While it's good to enjoy experiences like a nice dinner or a good relationship, these are not prerequisites for happiness. Life is a collection of experiences and one should learn to appreciate each experience, whether pleasant or unpleasant, for what it is.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-actualization</b>: Self-actualization is essential in developing unconditional happiness. It allows an individual to appreciate experiences in their daily life, regardless of their nature. This development might start from simple things like a visit to a dentist and feeling grateful for the experience irrespective of the discomfort it brings.
</li><li><b>Redefining happiness</b>: Leo questions the commonly accepted conceptions of happiness and the bias towards pleasurable experiences. He suggests that experiences should be appreciated for what they are, instead of being obsessed with maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. Happiness should not be dependent on physical conditions and should be seen as a state that can be achieved regardless of the circumstances.
</li><li><b>Detaching from needs and overcoming fear</b>: The process of attaining unconditional happiness involves detaching oneself from physical and emotional needs. This requires confronting and overcoming the fear of death as well. Overcoming this fear can help an individual become less attached to meeting basic needs and concentrate on achieving an enriched state of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Purifying oneself and pursuing spiritual enlightenment</b>: Part of achieving unconditional happiness involves spiritual work, which may involve becoming enlightened about the truth of reality or engaging in laborious work to purify oneself from personal needs. The latter may even involve detaching oneself from basic physiological needs such as food, water, and air. Ultimately, understanding and accepting one's completeness and working towards self-actualization pave the way towards achieving true and unconditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Fear of Death</b>: Leo suggests that a person who claims not to be afraid of death is usually in denial, as fear of death is a universal human response. Overcoming this fear is significant in realising unconditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Definition of Detachment</b>: Detachment, according to Leo, does not entail abstaining from certain things for the rest of one's life. Instead, it is a state of not being attached to them. Highly self-actualised and aware people can live happily in very minimal circumstances, such as being alone in a box, acquiring joy from the mere consciousness of existence.
</li><li><b>Realizing Unconditional Happiness</b>: Leo emphasizes that to understand and realize unconditional happiness, one needs to deeply analyze their core beliefs and possibly change their worldview. This involves looking at the foundations of what they believe to be necessary for happiness - work, relationships, possessions etc., sometimes it may involve the disconcerting process of undermining one's motivational structure. 
</li><li><b>Power of Detachment</b>: Detachment promotes freedom and the capacity to enjoy anything more fully rather than being attached to it. Leo proposes that even when individuals enjoy something, they suffer if they are attached to it because they anticipate its eventual loss.
</li><li><b>Life without Attachments</b>: Leo explains life without attachment is not depressing, nihilistic, and demotivated. Instead, it offers total freedom to do whatever one desires. Despite the temporary feeling of lack of direction and confusion, getting rid of neurotic motivations leads to healthier and profound motivations. 
</li><li><b>Self-actualization Journey</b>: Leo motivates viewers to sign up for his newsletter and follow his ongoing discussion on self-actualization and human psychology. He emphasizes that the power to change one's life lies within, hinging on self-knowledge and worldview, rather than on external accomplishments.
