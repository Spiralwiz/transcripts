hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to introduce you to the pre-mortem technique
one simple trick to avoid failing at your most important
projects today I have another very practical episode for you
and this one is on the topic of the pre-mortem
this is a simple project management technique which is the
opposite of a post mortem and you've probably heard of
a post mortem before especially if you're in business or
you've done any kind of project development work so what
this basically is the post mortem is that after a
project is complete after you launch a service or a
product the people who worked on it come back together
sit in a room and ask themselves a couple of
important questions they ask themselves okay what did do we
what did we do right and what did we do
wrong and the point of it is that you learn
from your mistakes so that the next project that you
go and work on you can then learn these lessons
and apply them what the pre-mortem is is sort of
like the post mortem except rather than doing at the
end of the project you do it before you even
begun the project that might sound a little weird how
can you do a post mortem before you even started
the project well it's a really brilliant strategy that I
want to share with you I'm going to give you
a lot of examples for how this works but before
we get into that let me just remind you that
this fits into the larger picture of strategic thinking I
hope that as you go forward in your life whether
you're working on relationships business your health your spirituality your
personal development whatever that you're applying strategic thinking to it
remember how I told you about strategic thinking in my
strategic thinking episode that was a very important episode and
I'm going to shoot more episodes in the future to
show you how to apply strategic thinking well this episode
here is one example of that it's a specific methodology
that you can use to make sure that you are
thinking strategically about the most important initiatives in your life
and when I talk about projects I don't just mean
work projects I mean all the things you want to
accomplish in your life the personal stuff too that qualifies
as being a project or an endeavor and I'll go
into more depth about all the different areas of application
of this technique applied this techniques this technique in areas
in my life where you would normally think that this
kind of technique couldn't apply to you would think like
only oh this only applies to people who are like
in a corporation working on some big project no this
applies to everyone and it's going to be useful for
you even if you don't have your own business but
especially if you do or if you're thinking about starting
your own business or if you're trying to start up
your life purpose talk about a major project your life
purpose so let's talk about how the pre-mortem works it's
very simple basically what you do is you select one
project or endeavor as we're defining it here whatever that
might be for you maybe you want to lose 50
pounds of weight maybe you want to get a great
marriage maybe you want to start a new business maybe
you want to find your life purpose maybe you want
to get enlightened whatever so you pick that as your
project or as your endeavor now what you do before
you even begun the project is you imagine to yourself
that your project has failed spectacularly so you imagine your
marriage crumbles you imagine your enlightenment doesn't work you imagine
that your business goes into bankruptcy and so forth you
imagine that rather than losing 50 pounds you gain 50
pounds right you imagine a spectacular failure and now what
you do after you take a few minutes to visualize
it in a realistic manner then what you do is
you list every cause of failure that you can foresee
and here is where you have to be forward-looking and
at the same time realistic you want to imagine realistic
causes of failure not just some paranoid fantasies right and
then what you do is you make sure that you
include any subtle psychological causes of failure not just external
ones so a lot of times we get caught up
in worrying about like how the economy is going to
be bad and how someone's going to screw me over
or steal something from me like all these external causes
of failure and usually what we ignore is the most
obvious causes of failure which are your personal weaknesses your
personal neuroses your own idiosyncrasies and the way in which
you self interfere and self-sabotage so you want to make
sure you include and brainstorm all the possible psychological causes
of failure be very specific about that and then once
you have your list of failures maybe you're going to
have ten or twenty items on this list for your
one project then what you do is you prioritize reorganize
the bulleted list so that the greatest most threatening and
most likely causes a failure at the top and the
least likely ones are at the very bottom and that
once you've got this list that's a really sobering eye-opening
perspective into what your project is going to require to
succeed you're going to have to overcome all those obstacles
and so what you do now is you brainstorm a
list of solutions for each item on this list especially
the top three on the list which are your greatest
threats and you brainstorm specific and realistic solutions to each
one of those and then you're done that's the pre-mortem
and you do all of this before you even get
started so for example if you want to lose weight
you set that as your object as your endeavor and
then you list all the reasons why you would fail
to lose weight and then at the end of the
day you come up with solutions to address all those
points of failure see how it works pretty simple right
so let's take you through an example of how this
might look and the example that I want to use
is starting a new business so let's say you want
to start your new business now what do you do
you imagine you visualize okay I started my business and
then a year or two down the road it is
destroyed in catastrophe something very catastrophic has happened and it
failed why did this happen let me visualize and imagine
the possible likely causes so here's a random list of
examples that I would come up with maybe it would
be something like the economy goes into recession and I
didn't plan for that so I don't have enough cash
flow coming in don't have enough cash reserve and so
I'm not able to have enough operating capital and so
I have to go bankrupt that might be one reason
another might be that a competitor of mine in the
same field releases the same product I was going to
release but earlier beats me to the punch another might
be paralysis by analysis now this here is an internal
flaw an internal cause of failure so maybe I have
this tendency to read too many business books and so
I'm spending all this time you know dozens of hours
doing research reading all these books taking all these courses
going to all these seminars but then I get so
paralyzed I don't know what to do I don't know
how to take the next step so I don't even
get activated to build my business and because of that
I fail that would be a very astute subtle psychological
observation about myself is noticing that I hey I tend
to get into paralysis by analysis and that can really
damage my project success another point of failure might be
that I'm loose with my tax expenses because I'm so
stingy again this is another subtle psychological observation about myself
maybe I recognize that I'm stingy with money so I
try to get the maximum tax expenses that I can
and that leads to an IRS audit because I'm loose
with my expenses and then that creates problems for me
and leads to the shutting down of my business or
maybe I just psych myself out maybe I talk about
building a business with my friends and my family I
keep talking about and talking about it and talking about
it and having all these dreams but then the end
of the day my vision is just so big and
so grand I'm not able to take any action and
I just psych myself out and I quit I get
depressed by all the work I have to do this
again is another very subtle psychological inner cause of failure
that most people never think about when they begin a
project usually if people think about causes of failure for
starting a project it's usually only the most obvious external
stuff they never think that their own psychology could undermine
them and lead to failure and you know what most
people when they fail at anything whether it's losing weight
or becoming a Olympic athlete or becoming a famous musician
or following their life purpose or you know whatever it's
because of their psychology not because of external obstacles here's
another example of how that might work maybe I'm really
artistic so I start my business and I'm really into
the art of my business and so I start to
create my work my product I'm going to put out
there for my business but I guess so artistic with
it that I ignore the needs of my customers I
put my own aesthetics first the needs of my customers
second and when I do that I have no customers
and then the business fails and I'm shocked how could
the business fail well it's because I was too worried
about satisfying my own artistic tastes rather than trying to
get my help trying to help my customers get something
valuable in their lives another very subtle psychological um cause
of failure right because it's my clinginess to needing my
own artistic needs to be satisfied that led to this
failure or maybe I have creative differences with my business
partner or maybe I just get bored with the business
because you know it usually takes a couple years to
get a business rolling maybe I just get bored with
it the idea is not appealing enough to me to
stick it out for a couple of years and so
I just quit because of boredom or maybe because I
have this psychological need for financial security and so when
I go and I work on this business for a
year but then the business in a year usually doesn't
bring it back a lot of money yet so I
find myself kind of going deeper and deeper into the
hole but then I find myself unable to stomach the
debt that I'm going into or the lack of money
that I'm getting and I know that I can get
a nine-to-five job that gets six figures or something out
there in the regular world so I'm very tempted to
just go back and just take my old nine-to-five job
back and because of that I quit my business or
maybe I'm a problem in that I just can't motivate
myself I can't discipline myself every single day I wake
up late I go to bed late because I party
and drink and schmooze around with women and so I
end up slacking off on my business and don't do
enough work fast enough and therefore it fails or maybe
I get sucked into a relationship with a woman and
maybe I accidentally impregnate her and we have a child
together and now all the sudden we have a you
know I have I have to marry her and I
have to have a child with her and I have
to have a whole family and that takes up a
lot of time a lot of energy a lot of
focus goes into that and so that distracts me from
my business and my business collapses or maybe I lose
all the data for my business which is stored on
a server and the server crashes them because I fail
to anticipate that it might crash I didn't back it
up properly and so I lose all my most important
data in my business collapses or maybe I just worked
so damn hard I'm so excited about my business I've
worked at it 80 hours a week for two years
and then by the end of that even though the
business hardly become successful I just burn out and I
can't sustain it and I just have to quit or
maybe I get distracted by the money maybe my business
becomes successful after a few years the money starts coming
in and I lose focus of the fundamentals I forget
about why I started the business in the first place
I start chasing money start chasing success and eventually that
leads to the downfall of my business maybe I get
distracted by a new shiny business idea because hey you
know I love new business ideas and I'm a visionary
type of person and so like yeah right now today
this is the best business idea I've got but next
week I'll have an even better one and then next
month I'll have it even better one and then two
years from now I'll have an even better one and
so I just keep jumping from one to the next
to the next and I know that's a tendency of
mine so that could be a real serious cause of
failure or maybe I just get demoralized and I quit
because I've been working on this business for like six
months and then six months in some bad news in
my industry comes out some problem happens with my customers
maybe I lose some of my most important clients for
whatever reason and then I'm just so demoralized that I
can't persevere past that and I quit the way I
have with certain things in the past that tends to
be maybe a tendency of mine or maybe I lack
the technical skills like I have a good business idea
I know what to do I have a great vision
and I start working on it but I fail to
anticipate the fact that my technical skills are lacking maybe
I don't have the right writing skills I don't have
the right speaking skills I don't have the right programming
skills or the right artistic skills or whatever and that
is something that I would need to educate myself on
and to cultivate but because I fail to anticipate it
then later on it comes back to bite me in
the ass or maybe I lose sight of my big
vision as I'm working on my business you know I'm
working with people around me people have different opinions they
have different visions I have the big vision but their
visions compete with mine and because I'm so bad at
handling confrontations and I'm so bad at assessing other people's
visions communicating with them but still holding on and insisting
on my own vision that basically I got wrapped up
in their stuff end up choosing a smaller vision going
after smaller stuff and I lose track of my big
vision and because of that my business ultimately fails so
that would be an example to all these all these
examples that I gave you are what your list should
look like maybe 10 maybe 20 items and then when
you have all these items you want to prioritize them
and really introspect and ask yourself okay if this business
failed what would be the number one reason why it
would fail and you take a look at this whole
listing you're like man I don't know that's hard hard
to anticipate but you know one thing I really know
about myself is in the past I just keep getting
distracted by shiny new business ideas and I know that
I get bored really easily I lose focus very easily
I don't stick with anything that's been my number one
psychological weakness in the past and so you anticipate that
ah yeah that's probably going to be the thing that
that ruins it if anything ruins it it's probably going
to be that and then you go on to number
two find your number two cause and then go on
to number three fighter number three cause see make sure
that you really isolate those subtle psychological factors those personal
inner demons and weaknesses that you have and how those
will specifically manifest into tanking your business in this case
and then what you want to do is you want
to go through and try to brainstorm some possible solutions
for each one of these causes of failure so you
know what could I do so that I don't get
distracted by a shiny new business idea or what could
I do so that I don't get sucked into a
relationship and accidentally impregnate some woman that I wasn't intending
to and now I have to start a family what
I didn't want to wasn't ready for it or you
know what could I do so that I don't work
so hard that I burn out and quit or what
can I do to address my financial insecurity fears and
my lack of tolerance for financial insecurity what could I
do to prevent myself from psyching myself out and here
you want to come up with realistic practical solutions for
each one of those and that of course is going
to be different for every one of you so I
can't really supply you with all those answers so that's
it and then your pre-mortem is done now let me
talk about the different areas of application of this pre-mortem
you might think it's only applicable to business but actually
no of course this is excellent if you want to
start a business but it's also excellent if for example
you're quitting your job and you're moving on you know
I see a lot of people thinking about how oh
I'm going to quit my job and go do something
wonderful with my life uh that can really get you
into trouble failure to plan that out realistically if you're
going to be quitting your job which probably supports you
and pays your bills you want to really make sure
that you pre-mortem that and anticipate all the causes of
failure that will happen there if you quit your job
you really think that one through right a lot of
people don't think that one through and they end up
screwing themselves over also you can apply this to your
entire career whatever career you're in if you're a doctor
if you're an architect if you're a lawyer if you're
an engineer if you're a program if you're a designer
if you're an artist if you're a celebrity if you're
an actor if you're a writer or whatever you are
take your entire career which will probably span 3040 years
and apply a pre-mortem to it and ask yourself okay
if my entire career fails why would that happen what
would be the cheap causes of that especially the psychological
ones man that could save your career right there if
you do that and how many people actually do that
on their career very few very few people are that
forward-looking they usually only face the problem once it's already
too late once the problem is already there in their
lap how about your life purpose have you taken my
life purpose course I hope you did could really transform
your life you have it go check it out but
if you are on track with the life purpose course
and maybe you found your life purpose or you have
a hint of what it might be and now you're
working on it right well how about applying this pre-mortem
technique to your life purpose imagine if your life purpose
failed spectacularly why would that be the case what would
be the leading causes of it that could make or
break whether you achieve or fail to achieve your life
purpose right there are you in school or in college
well you could apply this pre-mortem technique to your next
year in college for example or you could apply to
your entire college career maybe you're going to spend four
years earning a degree well apply the preborn to it
ask yourself okay if my time in college fails spectacularly
why would that be the case and then list all
the reasons why that can make the difference between you
getting into a great graduate school or failing out of
college are you trying to lose weight that would be
an excellent place to apply this pre-mortem technique sit down
and really ask yourself what are the psychological causes of
failure for me not losing the weight and you probably
have experience with this already because you probably try to
lose weight a lot of times and you're in the
past in your life and you failed so you probably
are already familiar with common psychological causes of failure so
make sure you bring all those up into your awareness
and really plan it out and have realistic solutions for
each one of those psychological causes your entire life you
could apply the pre-mortem to so if you don't have
a specific project that you're working on how about your
entire life let's take your entire life from this point
on till you're dead and ask okay if my entire
life fails spectacularly why would that be what would be
the chief causes of that and especially what would be
those subtle psychological influences my own personal weaknesses that led
to that and then what kind of solution is going
to come up with think about how valuable that might
be how about enlightenment you trying to become enlightened are
you a real hardcore student of spirituality well how about
we take that as your endeavor as your project and
now we ask okay if you fail if your enlightenment
failed spectacularly how would that happen what would that look
like why did it happen how did you cause it
and come up with solutions or maybe you're trying to
learn a new hobby like playing the guitar or weightlifting
or playing a new sport you can apply the pre-mortem
to that how about relationships our marriage are you trying
to get into a great relationship are trying to learn
dating are trying to learn attraction are you trying to
get your dream girlfriend boyfriend and then marry them and
start to raise kids with them that is a huge
monster of a project right there if you want that
to succeed you better plan ahead you better think of
all the different psychological obstacles you have that will sabotage
you in that endeavor and I guarantee you got at
least a handful of those so take a look are
you traveling abroad I noticed some people especially young folks
who tend to watch my content maybe they finish high
school and then they want to go off and spend
a year traveling through Europe or through Asia or go
somewhere they haven't been you know that kind of thing
that kind of bohemian lifestyle that's good that can be
a really great way to learn about yourself to discover
yourself to find your life purpose maybe that's a great
idea for you but do a pre-mortem on it ask
yourself if I spend a year traveling abroad and that
fails spectacularly what are the chief causes how did I
caused it what are some solutions to that and lastly
you can do this for your entire next upcoming year
2017 is tomorrow or if you're watching this it's today
so 2017 is here it's a new year what do
you want to accomplish in 2017 what will it look
like if 2017 is a failure for you what would
it look like for you to waste all of 2017
the way maybe you did with 2016 or 2015 or
the last five or 10 years your life and anticipate
the causes of failure you probably have a lot of
experience of wasting prior years in your life so you
can easily anticipate what the psychological causes will be and
as you anticipate them and you bring up to your
awareness you can clearly see the obstacles which helps your
mind to then create creative solutions for them and to
not get blindsided by them personally in my own life
I've used this pre-mortem technique for losing weight excessively for
changing where I live successfully for example when I moved
from Dallas to Las Vegas where I currently live that
was a big transition for me in my life it
wasn't just a physical relocation it was a sort of
a new starting point for me and that was important
for me I used a pre-mortem on that to make
sure that I didn't waste my opportunity and also when
starting actualised org I did a pre-mortem that was very
important I actually sat down I anticipated all the causes
that would have led to my failure and that was
very important because if I didn't do that then actualized
other work probably wouldn't be where it is today so
that just gives you some idea of how you can
apply this technique I hope you can see the versatility
of it now what I've got for you is I've
got the assignment here's your action step I want you
to select one project or endeavor in your life just
one for now and then spend 30 to 60 minutes
doing a full pre-mortem on it using the worksheet that
I have for you to download it's free worksheet so
just click down on the link below the video and
you will find the worksheet and it'll guide you through
all the questions and all the steps for doing this
pre-mortem and after you finish that pre-mortem this is the
most important part I want you to get a sense
for how it feels to be strategic I think that
most people miss this when I talk about strategic thinking
there's a certain feeling to it when you're being strategic
in your life it feels like you're really being forward-thinking
you're being proactive you're anticipating obstacles it's like you're playing
a strategy game and you're really allocating your resources properly
to make sure that you're thinking 10 moves ahead so
you don't paint yourself into a corner I want you
to get a feeling for what it feels like to
live your life strategically now you got to be careful
here because you can take the whole strategic thinking thing
too far where you're overanalyzing every little move in your
life and you're being overly logical and not intuitive but
that's not proper strategic thinking so teacher thinking is highly
intuitive thinking it's both intuitive and logical at the same
time it takes into account the big picture but also
the little nitty gritty concrete details that are involved with
realizing any big picture or dream that you have right
so don't think the strategic thinking just being means being
super Machiavellian and very logical about everything no not at
all it always starts with big-picture intuitive thinking but then
also realizing that to get anything done in this world
you have to be practical you have to anticipate technical
details that will [ __ ] up your realization of
this dream and that's what it takes you got to
be able to operate on the big picture level and
also on the little picture level right so I want
you to get a feel for that and that's it
