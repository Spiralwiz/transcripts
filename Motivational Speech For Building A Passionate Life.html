[Music] I think it's time for a good old-fashioned motivational
speech to pick up your spirits and to re-energize you
in this process of doing self actualization work of really
working on your life you know when I originally conceived
actualized org I actually thought that a lot more of
my episodes would be devoted to motivational types speaking and
then what happened over the years is that there's just
so many topics at this point I have so many
hundreds of very deep technical topics that I'm covering more
my topics are becoming more and more technical more nuanced
they require more preparation a lot more thought more research
and as I got into that you know these are
the meaty topics those are good but actually you know
for for most people what they really need is to
get the the basic right mindset in place for how
to actually just follow through and do personal development and
stay on the path without falling off because one of
the hardest things is falling off the path and because
I'm delivering technical content a lot of times I just
kind of forget to talk about the motivational aspects kind
of like the vision and the hope and also some
consolation for those of you who are in the trenches
and are feeling stuck and are feeling like man this
work is so hard and I'm not getting the results
that I was expecting the results are taking more work
than I expected they're taking longer than you expected yeah
of course this is tough tough tough work and one
of the challenge is that when you see me up
here just a talking head talking about some technical topic
or analyzing something of course it looks easy right in
many ways the easiest part of my job is standing
here before you before the camera and just spouting my
mouth off that's the easiest part the hardest part is
all the stuff you don't see me doing behind the
scenes all the work that I do on myself and
it's challenging sometimes it's really challenging sometimes I want to
quit but then I remember my vision I remember why
I'm really doing this I reconnect and it's that ability
to reconnect or to console yourself when you're feeling down
you're feeling depressed maybe you have a terrible workday maybe
you were doing something then you screwed up maybe you
have a big ego backlash after a nice long string
of good meditation sessions or you have some big Epiphany
some mystical experience then you come crashing down the next
week you know that happens and that's when you get
the most discouraged that's when you most want to quit
so this speech is intended for those of you who
have already started the journey but are still shaky for
those of you who are in the trenches but maybe
our feeling down and depressed and feeling oh man maybe
I should quit maybe you're doubting yourself like this isn't
really gonna work is the stuff Leo talking about is
it just all pipe dreams and it's just for people
who are not like me or maybe it's just like
a probability thing where it's like yeah maybe 5% of
people who watch actualize a drug will get the results
and the other 95% never will because it's just a
like a roll of the dice it's just a gamble
it's not a gamble at all it completely depends on
how you use your mind and how you think about
these things which is why this speech is necessary and
I hope it helps you out and I hope that
next time that you get stuck which of course you
will if you're not stuck right now you will be
don't worry you'll be stuck many many many times on
this journey because this whole journey is not some piece
of your life it is your entire life the only
question is do you recognize that yet for some people
they start off and it's just a piece it's just
a hobby but then it starts to consume your entire
life then your whole life becomes it or really you
just realize that that's what your life has been all
along it's just that you work awake to it and
now you have become and now you start to take
the process into your hands and you start to do
it more consciously than just accidentally the way that you
were doing it before the way that your family members
are doing it the way that your co-workers or your
friends are doing it so here's the thing you got
to really understand about this is that life is hard
no matter how you slice it life is hard sometimes
it's just really really hard and that's life but life
is also magical it can be extraordinary with the caveat
that it will never be magical or extraordinary to you
if all you do in life is play video games
watch TV click around on the internet hang out with
your friends and go to work at McDonald's you're not
gonna tap into any of the magic of life if
that's the kind of life that you're trying to lead
not possible you're only gonna get from life what you
put into it so if you haven't been getting the
thing that is making you feel passionate about life making
you feel energized every time you wake up in the
morning making you feel like life is magical and amazing
and you're so thankful for and you're so grateful for
it and you love it you see the beauty of
it you see the profundity of it and it just
completely blows you away if that's not your life that's
because you simply haven't put in what is necessary to
be put in to get that out of life this
is not an accident thing this is not that some
people are lucky to have that and other people are
not lucky to have that no it's all about what
are you putting in and you might think like what
about I am putting in I'm going to work and
I'm doing this and I'm doing that no you're not
putting in nearly enough you have to put your whole
soul into your life it's not life that's supposed to
give you your soul you put your life in I
mean you put your soul into your life and then
your life will reflect the soul and passion and dedication
and spirit that you put into it you have to
infuse your life with spirit it certainly won't do that
for you the way that our society is structured you
have to understand is that it's extremely low consciousness it
targets the most gross materialistic levels of life it can't
it covers the lowest common denominator in society which is
utter mediocrity with no magic to it whatsoever it's people
leading lives of quiet desperation and many times loud desperation
so that's what she'll get as the default if you
don't do something different and the problem here is that
our society has become so easy these days and you've
been growing up for the last 10 20 30 years
of your life sucking on society's tit you're completely disconnected
from real survival you don't appreciate it at all because
our society masks and hides that entire process you don't
build your own shelter you don't brave the elements outdoors
you don't travel using your own two feet you don't
butcher your own food you don't hunt your own animals
you don't grow your own crops you see you're completely
disconnected from all of this all of this is just
given to you in exchange what you do is you
go to work at McDonald's from 9:00 to 5:00 to
get all that and that might seem like that's a
good bargain because you know it you could hyper specialize
you can be the the hamburger flipper at McDonald's or
maybe you do the french fry cooker thing and hey
you know that's easy that's easy to learn you can
just do that repeat every single day but then your
life becomes that it becomes this mind-numbing factory work and
you're completely disconnected from how that connects to actual survival
you don't even realize that life is this constant process
of fighting for the chance just to breathe just to
just to wake up every morning this is an act
of survival this is not something to be taken for
granted animals who live in the wild or human beings
who live in the wild they are deeply connected to
nature they are deeply connected this process of survival and
this is extremely important because otherwise what happens you get
very soft you get very lazy and you start to
just expect society to give you stuff it's the exact
same problem that you see with rich kids who are
the children of millionaires and billionaires and they just get
giant estates the sort of Herot paris hilton's of the
world and i mean she's actually become sort of successful
but uh but there are many people like her who
have no successful so ever because all they do is
they just live off the money sucking on society's tit
but see it's not just the rich kids it's the
poor kids it doesn't matter if you're poor or if
you're middle-class you are still completely sucking on society's tip
because society is providing for your food for your shelter
for your electricity for your internet for your entertainment for
for almost everything for your medical care and it might
seem like that's a great thing but actually see it's
paradoxical and counterintuitive because the human being is a creature
who actually degrades from lack of challenge and lack of
work and by work here I don't mean going to
McDonald's that's not real work that's that's factory work and
if you're not employed by McDonald's but you're a programmer
at some other company doesn't matter there's no difference between
someone who works at McDonald's and earns like what 1520
thousand dollars a year on minimum wage or someone who
works at a big company doing some sort of routine
programmer work who might earn a hundred thousand dollars years
you think that there's a difference because you earn five
times more than the McDonald's guy it makes no difference
you're still going and working at McDonald's it's just not
called McDonald's it's called something else and it makes you
thinking oh I'm doing better than McDonald's but no you're
not not at all there's still no passion in your
life you're not really putting any soul into your life
you're not taking ownership for your own life you're disconnected
from the process of survival see when you're really faced
with true survival your life is on the line and
everything becomes very serious all of a sudden there's no
room for being lazy slacking off laying on the couch
watching marathons of TV shows and cooking around on the
internet there's none of that kind of life and death
have a way of cutting all that kind of crap
out of your life and making things very simple and
very stark and then all the sudden you're you're engaged
you see you got to be engaged with like that's
the biggest thing that people are missing these days is
that engagement because they're so complacent they're way too comfortable
for their own good and I notice it happening in
myself as well because as I have become more successful
with my businesses and with actualised or again with with
how many people I have is subscribers and all that
sort of stuff and and the kind of little bit
of Fame that I have whatever that might be worth
and whatever kind of recognition that I get from people
that I help you know that stuff it all goes
to your head and then you get kind of lazy
you get complacent about it you get more and more
disconnected from survival what I love about entrepreneurship is that
when you're starting your own small business it all depends
on you it all hinges on you and it really
feels like oh yeah this is a little bit of
what survival is like you feel that but then again
I look at most people who try to start businesses
and they have no chance they have no chance of
survival in business because they don't really know what it's
like to survive they don't they have as much chance
starting successful business as they have chance at being dropped
off off into the Canadian wilderness in the tundra and
living there and surviving for a month they won't be
able to do it they'll die because human beings have
domesticated themselves we are our own worst enemies we take
lines we put them into zoos and then those lines
can't hunt anymore well what do you think you are
you were alive who's been put into an apartment into
a little box and now you live there in your
little room what's the difference being here room in a
prison cell very little difference the only real difference if
you think about it is that the prisoner in the
prison cell he has a little bit more rules about
when he can leave his room that's about it and
he eats worse food than you that's about it that's
really the only difference for most people that's not life
that's that's prison just because you don't have jail bars
across your windows doesn't mean you haven't put yourself into
your own Jail of your own construction what needs to
happen for you to get serious about self-actualization is that
you need to take your own life back into your
own hands and you need to get back in touch
with that element of survival and maybe what that means
for you is you actually go out and you you
spent a week living in the Canadian tundra and you
see what that's like or you don't need to do
that maybe you start your own business or whatever maybe
you don't even start your own business but at the
very least you you seize control back and there's a
certain kind of seriousness that comes with that it's like
I'm not around with my life anymore the way I
used to because when you're around with your life you're
playing video games you're eating bad food you're being lazy
you're just kind of like going with the flow and
here you you say no I want to live a
kind of life where I challenge myself even when there's
no direct need for me to challenge myself I recognize
that the best kind of life that I can live
is one in which I'm really connected with my survival
every single day so it starts there and that's a
moment where you got to sit down with yourself and
you really got a revaluation got to say okay I've
been stuck in this rut just kind of like going
through the motions of life and I'm tired of it
it caused me all this suffering I'm not really satisfied
yeah I'm playing these video games but they're Hollow I'm
going to the movies but they're Hollow I'm doing my
work but it's Hollow everything is Hollow it's not it's
not what I into it life can be and then
you say I'm gonna mobilize myself I know there's more
to life and I know that it's gonna take some
hard work to tap into that and I'm ready I'm
finally ready to go and tap into that by doing
the hard work that helps a lot because most people
have a very wrong notion of what the good life
is the good life is not what you think it
is the good life is a life where you are
on your edge pushing yourself challenging yourself where it's it's
hard not the easy life the easy life is not
the good life the easy life is the mediocre life
which everybody else has and they're miserable and they don't
even have a clue as to how much they're really
missing they will never know because they never worked towards
it they just assume that the mediocre life is all
there can be because they're just going along with the
herd they're going down the path of least resistance so
you start to accept that the good life is actually
the challenging life you start to realize the counterintuitive idea
that actually the easy life is the hard life you
don't want that and that actually the challenging life is
gonna ultimately turn out to be the easiest and the
most rewarding and that's what you want and then you
bite the bullet that self-actualization is gonna be hard and
that it's not some gimmick that you're doing for the
next year or two to get something you wanted to
just scratch some some little itch that you have but
it's it's a lifelong process because that's what life is
is it's a growth process it's not about enjoying comforts
it's about growing it's about discovering the truth it's about
becoming more conscious it's about overcoming all your inner demons
and personal limitations and so what you need to do
is you need to accept that and also two reminders
of that so if you're already in the trenches doing
this work you're meditating yourself inquiring you're working on your
life purpose all this sort of stuff that I talked
about great but keep reminding yourself because your mind will
easily forget and it'll fall back into that old expectation
of like oh well but all my friends aren't really
doing anything it looks like their life is so much
easier and then you'll tend to wanna like go back
to that kind of life you got to remind yourself
that you're working for something much bigger and that of
course that's gonna require a bigger investment from you and
that's okay because you realize that nothing good as possible
without discipline and discipline is a huge problem because society
today completely discounts discipline and in fact everything the society
tries to sell you is designed to help you to
avoid taking any kind of discipline for yourself everything is
supposed to make your life easier such that you need
no discipline whatsoever but then you become a lazy slug
and that's what your life turns into and then what
you got to do is you got to start to
trust in the principles as you work the path as
you follow through this process as you meditate as you
go through your life purpose as you work on your
relationships and your emotions and all this other stuff that
you're working on there are some key principles that you
want to write down and you want to return to
over and over again when you're in your most dire
need for them when you're the most depressed when you're
the most hopeless you want to trust in the principle
of radical open-mindedness that that will ultimately lead users something
amazing in life and you want to keep opening your
mind trusting that that will lead to good stuff even
though you're not quite sure where am I lead and
maybe sometimes it even scares you how open-minded you're becoming
but you push through that anyways because you're relying on
this principle your life is not lived by your whims
but it's it's based on solid strategic principles which want
to tell you now what I've talked about for years
now across various episodes I try to introduce these different
principles to you trust in the principle that exploring hundreds
of diverse perspectives studying them thinking about them contemplating that
this is something that will be extremely valuable for you
in the long run in your life and that it
will lead and open up it will lead to new
opportunities that you never imagined possible it'll open new doors
for you and you've got to remind us of that
because as you're studying all these diverse perspectives of course
you're gonna feel confused you're gonna feel conflicted you're gonna
feel like you don't know which perspective is the right
perspective or which one you should follow that's when you
got to console yourself by telling yourself the principle at
work here is gonna pull through in the end trust
in truth trust in unconditional love trust in beauty trust
that these things you can rely on for the rest
of your life and that if you if you honestly
genuinely pursue those every single day that's something truthful and
loving and beautiful will come out of that that's not
so far-fetched trust in the importance of existential investigation the
idea that you don't just skim the surface of things
but you go down to the core you try to
penetrate as deeply as possible and try to really wonder
what is a thing what is existence what does that
try to connect your life to the most cosmically significant
things that there are relative to the shallow superficial flimsy
stuff trust in the principle of consciousness and awareness trust
that consciousness and awareness is is one of the most
important things in life and that as long as you're
growing your consciousness and your awareness every single day in
every single situation that something remarkable will come from that
in the end you're not sure what yet but you
can Intuit that something remarkable will come from that trust
in life purpose and impassion trust I giving your life
a sense of purpose and focus and direction at the
cost of excluding other things that ultimately that will pay
off for you trust in your nascent passions and grow
them and slowly cultivate them and trust that if you
follow your passions and you cultivate them week after week
after week for years something remarkable will come from that
with passion it's like priming a pump you know the
first few pumps that you make they don't produce much
but after you pump it Pump It pump it then
it's primed and then every pump you put in it
gives you some water that's how those old fashioned pumps
used to work at the your great I'm father's farm
see it wasn't that you pump and then you get
water it's like no you pump you pump you pump
you pump you pump for like 10 20 a hundred
times then it's primed once it's primed then every pump
gives you water that's how passion works at first you
don't really have a strong passion and you start to
pump and pump and pump on it and you know
nothing happens so you gotta have the vision that something
will happen ultimately in the same way that a pup
is primed because you if you expected water at one
of those old-fashioned pumps just from the first two pumps
and you didn't get it well you would get despondent
and depressed and you would quit and you say oh
damn that thing it's a failure it's not a failure
it's just that you're not thinking of it the right
way building your passion for life is one of the
most important things because that's ultimately what you want from
life a good life is one where you're passionate about
everything that you're doing and how do you get there
is it by buying a bunch of stuff is it
by living in a great house is it by moving
to a cool city is it by having a hot
girlfriend or a nice husband no of course not the
passion is is what you bring to the situation it's
not about what material objects give you or how they
make you feel it's not about buying a fancy call
fast sports car and then being passionate about having it
that's not passion passion is is coming from you it's
coming from the inside to the outside not from the
outside to the inside pash is not something you're given
by watching a movie or playing a video game passion
is what you bring into your work or it's the
thing you bring into the movie or the video game
you're watching the movie or playing the video because you're
passionate which is not how most people do it trust
in the power of vision as a principle vision is
incredible people think that vision all well yeah you can
just sit on your couch and you can you can
imagine stuff all day long but nothing's gonna happen you're
not gonna become rich these sorts of people they completely
misunderstand the power of vision to actually be able to
sit on your couch and to visualize very clearly indefinitely
what you want in your life this is a key
skill and it will get you more than you can
possibly imagine if you can't imagine it it's hard for
you to get it so developing a strong imagination and
being able to vision deliberately and clearly this is a
lot harder than people think this is real work it
takes real work to vision things out without vision you're
not gonna get anywhere in life you're not gonna be
able to self actualize because you need to be able
to see that all this stuff that you're investing right
now is gonna pay off later people without vision can't
see that they can't keep themselves motivated and inspired through
all the tough times it's when you're in your toughest
moment that you need the vision the most so if
you're feeling depressed if you're feeling like something in your
life's not working if you feel like your life purpose
is right now or if you feel like you got
fired from your job and now you're feeling hopeless or
you're feeling like you've been meditating and nothing is working
for you go back to your vision slow yourself down
go back to your original vision and make it stronger
in your mind reconnect with it emotionally not just logically
emot-- your vision should be so strong it can make
you cry that's how strong your vision should be and
if you can't hit that point you're really not visioning
and you can definitely hit that point but that requires
some soul-searching you have to find what is it within
you that wants to connect with life at such a
deep level that it can bring tears to your eyes
just thinking about it just picturing it in your mind
what that is for you trust in the principle of
hard work good old-fashioned hard work ethic this is a
super rare thing these days I see people struggling to
self-actualize and complaining about lack of discipline all that that's
because you have no work ethic and that's because you've
been sucking on society's tit for most of your life
and even if you're not rich even if your parents
weren't rich you were still sucking on their tit for
a good long time and this has made you lazy
and soft commit to developing a strong work ethic how
do you do that by working hard there's no magic
solution there's nothing I can tell you that's gonna say
oh yeah Leo you told me something that now is
gonna make me a hard worker no you got to
go work hard there's no shortcut to it you just
go do it but again you need the vision to
to make you want to do it you need a
compelling purpose to do it you don't just work hard
just for the sake of working hard that's not what
I'm saying the hard work is the means to your
vision there's so much work for you to do to
self-actualize work meditating work visioning work planning work strategizing work
at the gym work on your health work on your
relationship work on your emotions journaling and taking notes and
reading there's so much work there's more work than you
can stuff into one lifetime when you really get serious
about it but most people they're lazy they don't really
want to work they will only work hard when they
are forced to if that's how you think you're gonna
live a good life forget it you have to develop
the ability to make yourself work hard in precisely those
situations when you don't have to when nobody is forcing
you when there's no fire under your ass another principle
you can trust in is extreme ownership I used to
call this one percent responsibility but I like this phrase
extreme ownership more you're taking extreme ownership of your life
it's actually a phrase I gleaned from Jocko will Inc
who's a ex-navy seal and a motivational speaker and writer
and just overall badass human being he's all about owning
your own life and very being very self-disciplined hardworking in
your life and just by doing that you start to
get remarkable results see most people they don't really own
their lives they don't take responsibility for the food they
put in their mouths the information that they take in
with their eyes and their ears and they don't take
ownership for their own consciousness they don't take ownership for
the for the people who they surround themselves with or
the place that they're living in see all these things
it's it's a pain in the ass to change these
things it takes work so the easy thing of course
is not to change anything take the ownership for nothing
and just sit there whine and and moan and criticize
and just feel sorry for yourself trust in the principle
of learning and reading do not underestimate how powerful learning
and reading are in this entire process you need to
learn more thousands of times more than what you currently
know you need to read hundreds of books so get
to work on that trust that something remarkable will come
from that if you don't know what to do pick
up a book because you can always trust that by
reading a book or two every single week every single
month that will move you forward trust in the principle
of mastery mastery is so important the idea that you're
gonna pick one thing you're gonna work on you're gonna
master it in your life have something that you're mastering
your life all the time and you can rely on
spiral dynamics as a principle as well if you know
that model I've talked about it before it's a little
bit technical so I can't explain it here but if
you're familiar with spiral dynamics trust that you are moving
up those stages and that that's Alton like the entire
map for what you're doing in your life you're moving
up those stages you roughly know where you are you
roughly know where you're going you roughly know what the
next stage is you can also look ahead at stage
yellow stage turquoise and think about what that means and
what it would be like to live in those stages
and then work on that here's an outline for you
for all success in a nutshell it always starts with
a vision a really compelling vision then once you have
that there's the learning and research phase where you need
to a lot of research because when you have a
new bold compelling vision you're gonna know how to make
it happen or even what the opportunities are so you're
gonna have to go learn a lot research a lot
then once that phase is complete then really the hard
work phase sets in that's where you get into the
trenches and you're working really hard on your vision and
all the stuff that you learn and research now you're
following up on all those leads and you're actually trying
to actualize those and that's what most people really quit
but then the next phase is building the momentum not
only to have to work hard for a month or
a year but you got to keep it up consistency
there it's important and you build up your momentum slowly
like a snowball rolling down a hill over and over
and over again and it starts growing and growing and
growing and the biggest enemy you're gonna face here is
just quitting you're gonna be so tough to quit your
mind is gonna try to trick you to quit with
any conceivable rationalization or excuse everything from your health to
your energy levels to your emotional system to your financial
problems to your family obligations to your uncertainty and your
doubt and maybe all maybe there's a better life purpose
thing I shouldn't be doing this man should be doing
that or maybe I should just do a little bit
of this and then mix it with that and then
see you're you're all over the place your focus gets
diverted by all the stuff that's happening around you you
got to refocus keep your eye on the ball keep
building that momentum and whatever you do you don't quit
and then only after a long period of doing that
do you find get success that's basically how all success
is made in any field whether in business or in
spirituality or anything else now of course here the the
really spiritual people will come in and say but Leo
there's nothing to do stop chasing you're telling people to
chase stuff and this is all just delusion well what
I have to say to you is to go yourself
because this idea that there's nothing to do and to
stop chasing this is a dumbest idea that I've ever
heard the most short-sighted and stupidest thing I've ever heard
this idea of stop chasing there's nothing to do you're
alive because there's a ton of to do every single
day there's a ton of to do and these spiritual
people who think there's nothing to do these are some
undeveloped they're not really conscious they're not really developed they
they have misunderstood spiritual teachings to rationalize their own mediocrity
and any kind of spiritual attainments that they have made
while they might be nice to some degree they have
nowhere near maxed out the possibilities because you simply can't
with that kind of lazy stupid attitude that there's nothing
to do and anything that you're doing is some form
of stupid chasing and some delusion that's not the case
at all what I encourage you to do instead is
to make your life a hero's journey take some on
some risk and some adventure in your life with adventure
always comes risk there's always the risk that you're going
to go down the wrong road you're gonna waste your
time you're gonna you're gonna do something wrong and it's
gonna be a waste of your resources your your money
or energy or whatever but then again it's the going
on the adventure that's the fun part that's the exciting
part that's what makes you feel alive and connected to
life is that you are on some kind of adventure
otherwise what the hell are you doing to those people
who think that there's nothing to do what the hell
are you doing with your life because if there's nothing
to do here's what's gonna happen you're gonna sit on
your couch watching TV and eating Cheetos that's what you're
gonna do that's what's gonna happen you when you stop
chasing and I'm not saying there aren't excesses to chasing
yes there's problems with chasing you got to make sure
you're chasing the right stuff you got to make sure
you're chasing high-quality stuff and in the end maybe at
the end of that after many many years maybe you'll
actually realize that there is nothing to chase and there
is nothing to do but that will only come from
a lifetime of some really hard work and even then
you'll realize that when you sit and you do nothing
that you slowly die you slowly deteriorate you slowly uh
become more and more of a slug choose to challenge
yourself deliberately precisely because it's unnecessary and some people will
say but Leo this is all so much work why
do all this stuff after all if life is meaningless
in life is purposeless and pointless why do it all
because what's your alternative what are you gonna get if
you don't do it you're gonna get what you have
now you're gonna have a mediocre kind of life you're
gonna have the worst possible life by not making this
choice to accept the hero's journey you have made your
choice you've made the choice of being a mediocre slug
so then don't be surprised if you get depressed or
if you hate your life or you see other people
uh killing it in life but then you feel like
you're less than them you feel like a victim don't
be surprised by that because you've made your choice you've
made your choice to be ordinary rather than extraordinary yes
this process of the hero's journey and self actualization it
will be difficult it will be a lot harder than
you ever imagined but on the other hand it'll be
a lot more rewarding than you ever imagined as well
so the two will actually compensate for each other but
yes it will be difficult and yes you will be
afraid deeply afraid on this work in this path doing
this work and yes you will be confused and yes
you'll be frustrated and yes you will have huge setbacks
at times and yes you will backslide and yes you
will feel bored by doing all this hard grindy work
and yes you will feel all alone in this process
cuz you're the hero you're on your own journey no
one's gonna provide you company and yes you will feel
misunderstood and yes sometimes it will feel hopeless and completely
impossible and yes sometimes you're gonna be in such a
tough situation you're gonna be so depressed or you're gonna
be so confused and uncertain about what to do that
you will cry and in those moments you will want
to quit but what you do is you go on
and you push through anyways you just do it anyways
you use your vision to carry you through those toughest
times you use these principles that I talked about to
carry you through the toughest times you remind yourself of
these principles you remind yourself of this vision of why
you're doing it because you want a passionate life where
you're connected to life unlike everybody else and you know
that the alternative is being like everybody else and that's
an unacceptable alternative you'd rather die than have that alternative
for you what you do is you take the survival
that an animal out in the wild experience every single
day that life-and-death survival that align or antelope experiences when
they're hunting or being hunted and you connect that with
living a passionate existence for you to survive is to
be living a passionate existence you connect those together so
that your life is not about just making it through
the day or just eating some food but it's about
being passionate about being conscious for you that's like your
oxygen you need that to breathe and without that you
don't want to live and you make that decision to
make a decision in life is to exclude every other
alternative possible so make that decision for yourself make it
consciously don't just make it because I'm telling you about
it sit down and contemplate the things I'm telling you
so that your mind it clicks it registered it's like
oh yeah what leo is saying actually makes sense and
because it does make sense this is a strategy that
I will that I will commit to not because he
says it not because I believe them because it makes
sense for me and because I can clearly see what
the alternative to it is and then you can carry
on through the tough times when you're in your toughest
moments on the path remember that you can always double
down double down even more on walking the path when
you feel like quitting when you feel depressed when you
feel angry when you're frustrated when you can double down
even more to double down means to say I don't
have a clue how I'm gonna make this work but
I'm doubling down anyways because I trust in these principles
I trust in my deepest intuitions that I want a
passionate life and that's not something I wanted to compromise
on it's not like oh yeah I'll have a passionate
life if things go my way if other people let
me if it happens to fall in my lap no
I'm committed to a passionate life no matter what that's
my number one priority and when things aren't working that
means I got to work harder so I'm doubling down
and I'm excited to double down to work even harder
I'm willing to work hard for what I ultimately want
because I know it will be worth it and so
you double down you become even more serious about your
principles you pull out your principles you read them you
console yourself and then you get back in the game
the paradox of this whole thing and of life is
that life is a totally pointless game and yet it
must be played with dead seriousness you must play the
game as if your entire life hinges on it and
yet simultaneously you must be conscious that it doesn't matter
at all what the outcome is but what does matter
is that you're playing the game with seriousness and yet
at the same time you can joke about it and
you note that it doesn't matter at all that's the
paradox of living the good life stop looking for shortcuts
stop looking for other people to help you stop asking
other people for answers to your problems stop asking people
to tell you what you want take ownership for all
of that and then of course you still read and
you still learn from other people and you still study
perspectives and you still can listen to and get advice
from people but you do not outsource the executive decision-making
for your entire life that you cherish and you you
relish that the most and you take complete ownership for
that and then you just go to work and that's
that that's all there is to it and when you're
feeling stuck you console yourself and you pick yourself back
up and you keep doing the work trusting in the
principles and then eventually what will happen is that you
will come out with such an extraordinary life that you
yourself will not be able to believe it it will
be too good to believe it'll be too good to
communicate to anybody else and be good that you went
through those lonely times all by yourself because you know
what you're gonna feel a little bit lonely in the
end with this amazing life your life is gonna be
so amazing you're not gonna have anyone else in the
world really to share the amazement with because the only
other people that will know how amazing life can be
is those people who have been like you and those
people are so rare and so few and far between
that um you'll bump into them occasionally and you'll be
able to to have a mutual recognition of each other
and the passion that both of you have but that
will be a rare thing most people you interact with
will not know about that and so you'll have to
be comfortable living all by yourself knowing that you are
sitting on an infinite goldmine of magic and beauty and
truth and love and passion infinite intelligence is at your
fingertips to be accessed all the time reality is the
most amazing thing ever and you will know that but
almost nobody else will and that will be both extremely
satisfying and also a bit melancholy and sad because your
deepest desire will be to to share that with the
world to help people access this infinite goldmine that you
have fortunately been able to access somehow for yourself and
you will know how challenging it was and you will
be able to appreciate why almost nobody does it because
it's not easy work you will remember all those difficult
difficult times when you were just this close to quitting
you'll remember that and you'll say ah yeah of course
of course now I understand I have compassion for all
these people who are not able to make it work
I know all their sticking points I know all their
traps I know all their deepest fears and insecurities all
their inner demons because I've had to fight and slay
my own and I can help them in my own
unique way now I can help them to figure out
for themselves and we can move all of humanity forward
towards ultimately getting as many people as possible to tap
into this infinite goldmine which is there which is unlimited
which cannot be exhausted which can be tapped by every
single human being without encroaching on anybody else life is
a non zero sum game which means that everybody can
tap into the infinite for themselves everyone's life can be
passionate and magical it's not a finite resource it's not
like there's only so much passion so much magic to
go around no it's infinite it's infinite it's an infinite
goldmine just sitting right under your feet and the thing
that will shock you the most is not that the
goldmine is somewhere out there somewhere beyond the stars somewhere
on top of a mountain something in some other country
or in some other place or anywhere or in some
other person that it was inside of you the whole
time it was right here it's right here right now
but that will require you going through the entire path
and ultimately coming full circle that's it I'm done here
please click the like button for me and come check
out actualized org see all the stuff that I have
for you there I have my book list my life
purpose course I have the forum which is getting pretty
fired up these days the forum is getting better and
better all the time and my blog I'm posting a
lot of stuff on my blog including exclusive videos I'm
doing now more like vlog style informal videos which have
some of my most profound insights actually but I consider
the more minor insights so I just post them on
the blog so check that out and stay tuned with
me for actualized I don't work for more content in
the future and especially if you're resonating with what I
talked about here make sure you check out my life
purpose course because that course outlines in extreme detail this
entire process we've only scratched the surface of this process
the course fills in all the details holds you by
the hand shows you how to put all the things
into place in your life the most important thing it
shows you is it shows you how to reconnect with
your deepest passions how to unearth that inside yourself how
to find your top strengths or top values and then
ground your entire life in that and every week now
I get testimonials from people who have taken the course
probably over 2,000 people at this point have taken the
course I get testimonials from them saying how the course
has changed their life has changed their trajectory a lot
of young people who are in that area where they're
like in high school late high school early college trying
to figure out their career benefit a lot from the
course because they have no idea really what they're going
into for example in their going to college and they
usually pick majors that aren't really right for them because
they don't really thought it through they don't know how
to think it through they don't have enough life experience
to think that stuff through which is plessy why I
made the course I made the course because I had
to struggle for about ten years to figure that stuff
out for myself by my own life purpose and that's
what I'm using to fuel actualize that or what do
you think actual I said I guess it's fueled entirely
by my life purpose it could not exist otherwise the
amount of work and passion that has to go into
what I'm doing here could not happen otherwise but uh
uh if I was really really clear about the kind
of impact that I want to have in the world
and what my deepest deepest passion is it's not just
about being passionate it's about finding your deepest passion and
that's a bit of a process and that's what I
guide you through in the course so check that out
and stay tuned of course as always for more you
