hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm talking about Maslow's hierarchy of needs and how
to use it to self actualize in this episode I'm
going to explain a bit about Maslow's hierarchy of needs
but more importantly I'm going to tie it in with
something that I see as being a really pervasive ubiquitous
problem in society and not only in society but really
probably in your life so the problem is is that
society is stunted I don't know if you've noticed this
but our society is stunted people are stuck low on
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and you can think of this
hierarchy like a pyramid or a staircase that people ascend
as they mature in life and as they develop themselves
psychologically and that really your job in life is to
ascend to the top of this pyramid as quickly as
possible but before I start talking about all that let's
just introduce the pyramid so here you go on the
screen you should see the pyramid so in this pyramid
let me just go through and talk about the different
rungs here there's going to be five of them and
actually there's also a sixth one which I'll I'll briefly
mention for is yet so the first rung is physiological
physiological means that you have physiological needs you need air
you need food you need water you need sex you
need excretion these are basic biological functions that are necessary
for you to even stay alive for more than a
few days if you don't get these things for more
than a few days or a few weeks then you
will die so that's the very basic stuff pretty obvious
once you've got those satisfied then what happens is that
the human or now has a new set of needs
that open up to it the second tier or the
second rung and these are safety needs so these include
physical safety like a shelter these also include stuff like
employment having resources in order to sustain yourself and being
able to secure and protect your own property also pretty
obvious stuff we would think that this is necessary for
a happiness in life so most people get that stuff
handled and then they move up to the third rung
or the third tier and that is love and belongingness
this includes having good friendships having good family and having
sexual intimacy so you might recognize that a lot of
people are busy attaining and chasing after these things because
these are very real psychological needs and so once you
fulfill those then you move on to the next rung
which is the esteem needs and this includes having a
healthy self-esteem having high confidence having achievement having respect from
your peers and also giving respect to your peers so
there's that rung and then only after those are satisfied
do you really get into some really cool territory and
this is the self-actualization needs and they are needs and
this includes stuff lofty stuff like morality creativity discovery acceptance
of facts truth awareness and contribution and you might think
that that's where it ends but actually towards the end
of his life Maslow added one final last step to
this pyramid the very pinnacle you might say and that
is called self transcendence and what that is about is
that's about true spirituality that's about enlightenment that's about transcending
the self which I won't get into here because that's
a really big hornet's nest so basically that gives you
overview so you see the picture you see how it
works pretty obvious stuff now what's the problem with this
well the problem with this is that most people like
I said are stuck quite low on this pyramid most
people have their physiological needs met but then even at
rung number two which is their safety needs which includes
shelter and employment and resources and property a lot of
people even here they have gaps and what you could
actually do is you can actually sit down and kind
of just do a self-assessment ask yourself okay which of
these things do I have really locked down in my
life and which are these things on the pyramid do
I kind of have problems with and I'm not really
secure that I you know have attained that thing so
you're probably cool with air and food and water maybe
sex is something you're struggling with maybe you don't have
sex in your life at the level that you want
umm then you go to the next level you ask
yourself okay how about physical safety do I have a
shelter that I like okay well maybe you do maybe
you don't employment how's my employment doing ah maybe your
little spotty on that one how about your resources how
about your property how about your bank account how's dad
doing yeah maybe a little spotty on that one to
see so already pretty low we're still very low on
the hierarchy but already you can start to see that
you probably have some gaps in your life but then
as we move up and up and up you probably
see that you know even more and more problems come
about maybe you have problems with making friends maybe have
problems with your family if you have problems with sexual
intimacy or with confidence or with achievement or respect or
anything else and so basically if you have too many
gaps if your pyramid looks like a I like a
triangular piece of Swiss cheese with holes everywhere then we
can make a pretty good guess that you're not self
actualizing or you're not spending the majority of your time
thinking about self-actualization which means that really your morals are
a little shaky you're not really doing anything creative with
your life your life is not about creative contribution you're
probably not going out there and disc offering new cures
or new scientific advancements because those things are not even
on your radar screen you probably have difficulty accepting facts
and being truthful and being honest with yourself because you
need to really develop yourself to the highest levels of
the human psyche in order for that to to remedy
itself because there's a lot of self-deception going on within
your worldview so you probably have that gap and your
awareness is probably a very spotty and very poor you
have very low consciousness in the way that you live
your life and quite frankly you're not contributing to society
or to the world in any really meaningful or positive
way and in fact maybe what you're doing is you're
like a leech on society sound pretty accurate uh for
most people that's exactly how their life is right why
is that because they haven't taken the time to handle
the basic [ __ ] they need to handle their
life so what's the lesson from all this the lesson
is get your [ __ ] handled get your basic
needs handled that's your whole game in life right this
right here this pyramid this is like your game plan
for life if you're born you should be thinking okay
how do I get the first rung handled as quickly
as possible then the second one then the third one
then the fourth one until I can get to self-actualization
than self transcendence right this is your goal in life
or it should be most people though you know they
don't even understand this model they don't even make these
distinctions so they're basically stuck very very low and this
creates for a low consciousness low quality society and all
the crap that happens a society all the negative stuff
basically is a result of this people being stuck very
low on their foundation being effective and successful is the
foundation of everything else in your life what I find
is that most people really struggle with the employment piece
of this pyramid finding employment and I don't just mean
having a job that's obvious enough you're pretty much obligated
to in this world but I mean finding your dream
career I mean finding your life purpose a lot of
people really get stuck there I'm going to go to
that problem and a little bit more depth here but
before I do I just want to mention that it's
interesting that even though there is this hierarchy and it
seems it's like you're climbing it in is kind of
like linear sequence you're climbing these rungs it's not actually
strictly true that you have to go through all the
lower stages to get to the very top in fact
there's examples of like Yogi's in India who will go
and just meditate in a cave they're called ascetics and
they'll do that you know without without sex and without
much food and without much of the luxuries or shelter
or other kind of stuff that you would think that
they would need and then they transcend itself so basically
what they do is they kind of short-circuit this whole
process and that's certainly doable and that's a very valid
way to go the problem is that it's a very
hardcore way to go and that most people including you
probably don't find the prospect of going living in a
cave and meditating for hours and hours for years very
appealing so that being the case we need a more
gradual and easy and more comfortable path for you so
what does that involve well that involves putting together the
foundation create the foundation for your life right once you've
got that then you can tap into those beautiful things
at the very top because that's what life is really
about is getting to the very top that's when life
takes on its sweetest flavors that's when you can appreciate
the love and the beauty that's around you until you
get to self-actualization here I can appreciate that stuff you're
going to be petty you're going to be worried about
stupid things and basically you're going to squander your potential
that's as as blunt as we want to put it
here so the thing is that we as a society
actually need you to be successful don't just think of
success as a way to build a cushy life for
yourself like Oh all success you know maybe you are
personal really value success and you want to put together
a cushy luxurious kind of life and you kind of
are shooting for that or maybe your person kind of
thinks of success and making money is like oh well
you know what's that really going to do for me
well I want to change perspective of what success actually
means so here's how we're going to do that let's
take a look at one of the biggest problems that
we have in society today here it is it's a
very simple problem and it's also quite easily remedied but
the problem is that people don't understand what's going on
and then they don't have enough um determination to want
to go remedy it here it is people haven't found
their gifts and talents when you don't find your gifts
and talents then you can't live a passionate life and
so in general people don't find their gifts and talents
and then they don't know how to live their passion
their top passion they're not living it by which I
mean their career is not their top passion they're just
working a dead-end 95 job then what happens is that
because of that they don't master anything in life they
don't become a master in any domain in life they
don't become very good at anything they're just mediocre worker
bees that's what most people are because of that they
don't ever develop a dream career and they never get
a life purpose so their lives have no purpose or
really deep meaning or significance because of this this type
of person cannot get motivated to do anything really significant
or worthwhile in life what does this person do this
person lives for comfort and luxury that's it and also
to avoid pain and discomfort that's a miserable very miserable
way to live life and so they're very frustrated and
unfulfilled on top of that this person because they haven't
mastered any domain in life and they're not called cultivating
their gifts and talents and their passion what's happening is
that this person cannot create massive value for the world
and for society they could if they found their passions
and cultivated them but they don't so they're not able
to generate massive value how can you generate massive value
when you're not a master of any domain in life
you can't so then these people can't truly become successful
and they struggle even to pay the bills because they
don't master anything in life and they're not really generating
any massive value and they're not contributing in any way
you're not able to contribute effectively to the world when
you're not passionate about by your work and also when
you haven't mastered anything and that means you miss out
on some really beautiful stuff also it means that the
goal of raising one's awareness is that of the question
for you in a sense you could say that the
entire objective of human life is to raise ones awareness
higher and higher and higher until you get to the
ultimate stages of enlightened awareness that is what you should
be doing that's what every single human being should be
doing and solely concerned with on this planet now how
many human beings are actually concerned with this less than
1% it's it's a pitiful number why is that well
because they're so low on the on the hierarchy that
this stuff to them seems uh you know it seems
airy-fairy it seems so lofty it seems so abstract and
so such a luxury that they never get to this
point and because of this they never reach the highest
levels of contribution and fulfillment that are possible in life
and that's a very sad thing and that's why I
work on actualized Oregon I shoot all these videos and
I do all the work that I do is because
I am really passionate about correcting this problem so you
see here in a sense the biggest piece of the
myth of the puzzle that's missing is life purpose people
do not have a life purpose they don't have their
dream career they're not living and working their passion and
so because of this this creates a ripple effect that
basically creates for a mediocre life here's a little anecdote
that I like an image if you will imagine a
man running through the jungle and he's being chased by
a bloodthirsty tiger now this man is he's running away
he's you know he's panting he's sweating he's running for
his life he's running away from this tiger and then
as he's doing that he he sees a tree stump
in the jungle he sits down on the tree stump
he pulls out a pad of paper and a pencil
and he starts composing some poetry very jarring scene it's
ludicrous right it's ridiculous it's really that would never happen
why is it ludicrous it's ludicrous because intuitively each one
of us understands Maslow's hierarchy we understand what comes first
saving your ass comes first everything else is a luxury
compared to saving your ass and then you know if
your ass is safe and you're not about to be
mauled by Allah by a tiger then you're gonna worry
about stuff like finding a good job and um procuring
a house or shelter or something like that you know
once you got that then you're gonna worry about maybe
socializing with your friends and maybe getting a better relationship
then once you got that handle you'll start worrying about
stuff like you know how do I become more confident
and have higher self-esteem and have a certain reputation my
community and then once you got that handled then finally
you'll come to the point where it's like okay what
do I want to really get done in the world
what I want to create what do I want to
help discover how do i how do I want to
advance Society how do I want to contribute I don't
want to give back to people how do I want
to help my community do I raise my awareness maybe
you're going to start getting interested in philosophy or science
or mathematics or poetry right that stuff is like the
icing on the cake you need the cake first as
the foundation so what I propose to you is that
you take success very seriously in your life and you
don't just treat it the way most people treat success
here's how I think about success for me low personal
success means that I'm going to be so busy being
selfish and petty that I'm going to squander my potential
in life so success for me is like air that
I breathe right without air I can't live and without
success I really can't live I mean you can live
but the kind of life you're going to be living
I believe this is a Seneca quote he says something
like you are alive but the kind of life that
you're living it's as though you're already dead and that's
basically what's going on with your life isn't it is
that what what's going on um so don't think of
success as building a cushy life for yourself I see
a lot of people making this mistake like oh I'm
going to become successful and buy myself a nice uh
you know high-rise apartment with a view and I'm gonna
go travel and I'm gonna go take my you know
I'm gonna go take my spouse on some cool vacations
I'm gonna go eat lobsters and sushi and I'm gonna
go like go buy myself a yacht this kind of
stuff no that's a that's a misuse of success to
me what success is about is growth and expansion I
have a very different picture of success then um you
might think growth and expansion you know this is challenging
stuff it's not always cushy why because the highest level
of fulfillment in life is not going to come from
a cushy life but from getting to those South self-actualization
flavors and to that self-transcendence flavor and you could only
really do that once you're successful I mean you can
try to short-circuit it but you're going to struggle you're
really going to struggle and until you've you've gotten yourself
some success in life then you're really just going to
be crippled and you're not going to be able to
self actualize and a lot of these videos that I
shoot all these cool concepts and distinctions that I share
with you these are just going to go over your
head you might even think they're cool but you're just
not going to be able to mobilize yourself to act
on them to actually realize them because you're going to
be so concerned with petty stuff like how do I
get my friends to like me or how do I
get some sex or how do I get you know
my landlord not to kick me out of my house
kind of thing ah so this notion of success it's
not just a personal selfish thing but actually it's something
that we need for Society in the world at large
we need it because most successful people once they've achieved
their success they naturally want to advance society and contribute
back to society and to be good because what else
honestly are you going to do at that point I
mean you've got your shelter you've got your sex you've
got your food you've got your friends you've got all
that stuff handled and that stuff is okay but you
know it's not really fulfilling the really fulfilling stuff is
at the very very top so that's what's going to
be on top of your mind is that stuff you
will naturally want to do that stuff and the most
important thing you're going to naturally want to do is
you're going to actually want to expand your consciousness your
awareness level and this here is the mother of all
problems in the world is lack of awareness so if
we can get more people to be more successful and
raise their awareness then that's going to be like a
route fix for many many many problems that we have
in society it'll fix stuff like wars and genocides and
rape and murder and all the other problems that we
have the socio-political economic problems that we have a lot
of them stem from lack of self-awareness so in a
sense this this idea of success is not a luxury
but this is a real necessity especially now in the
21st century where we're at this turning point in human
history and the history of the world where we have
the power to really make the world a very great
place or we have the power to completely obliterate it
and ruin it for future generations so now more than
ever it's important that you wake the [ __ ]
up and you start plugging every hole systematically in your
swiss-cheese hierarchy triangle fill every hole you can until you
get yourself to the very top or if you want
try to short-circuit and get to the very top I
don't really care how you do it but for most
of you it's probably going to involve a slow and
steady systematic plugging of every hole and that's a really
good strategy for self-actualization and it really is that simple
right this is a very simple model and I want
to give you a couple of exercise questions that you
can use to figure out exactly what your next step
should be right so we talked about the theory how
do you actually now take this and turn it into
a practice well I'll give you one really big clue
if you don't have your life purpose together get that
together that is one of the biggest missing pieces in
most people lives in most people's lives I find but
you know everyone's a little different so maybe you even
have your life purpose together but then you have some
other element like your relationship or your lack of sex
or lack of friendships that are holding you back so
here's the question I want you to ask yourself get
a piece of paper and write this down question number
one is where am I stuck on the hierarchy where
am i stuck on the hierarchy so you're going to
write down that question then you're going to sit down
at the end of this video and if you want
generate a small list of stuff and then circle the
one thing that has you stuck the most what is
it is it lack of sex is it lack of
food - lack of shelter is it lack of employment
is a lack of life purpose is it lack of
friends is it lack of an intimate loving relationship what
do you got going on so that one and then
the second question is what must I do to get
myself unstuck once and for all and so you're going
to select with your first question you know the biggest
thing that keeps you stuck and then you're going to
sit down and brainstorm how do I structurally change my
life around so that this gap is permanently plugged in
the hierarchy so that I never have to worry about
it ever again so you know if you've got a
problem with money ok that's your problem some money how
can i generate so much money that I won't ever
care about money ever again or how can I take
away my crippling need to have lots of money right
you don't necessarily need to make lots of money to
plug that hole there are other ways so think about
that and then commit to working on that that should
be the thing you're working on the most right now
in your life that should be your number one goal
for the next six to 12 months is plugging that
hole so whatever else you're doing that's the wrong thing
this is the thing you should be doing all right
so that's the exercise and now I want to briefly
mention the self transcendence part of the the pyramid the
very very top self transcendence this is really what life
is about self transcendence it seems counterintuitive that you live
your life and you know you spend a lot of
time worrying about yourself selfishly putting together this like cushy
lie of having money and having a spouse and having
security for your family and having a shelter and and
having friends and and having respect in the community all
this stuff like you fiendishly selfishly put all this stuff
together and then someone comes along and tells you hey
buddy there's something bigger out there for you is called
self-transcendence but the problem is that once you've spent 30
to 40 years of your life building this some this
massive ego worrying about protecting yourself then at that point
a lot of times what happens is you kind of
forget about the whole thing about self-transcendence and you're like
self-transcendence i don't really need that sounds kind of fruity
sounds kind of new-age sounds kind of low and spiritual
so let me just forget about that and let me
just focus on building the cushiest life i could possibly
build for myself and when you do that you have
completely lost your way the whole point of this journey
was to get you to self transcendence so you know
some of you might already be very successful and if
you are then what I encourage you to do is
to not get stuck at that place of material success
and not get stuck in your own dogmas and ideas
about life and your ego and all that stuff but
to have the courage to throw all that aside and
to go explore this new territory called self transcendence which
it took Maslow his whole lifetime to finally add to
the top of the pyramid right what I suggest you
do is that you spend your early 20s and your
early 30s in life putting together this foundation then in
your mid-30s and into your 40s 50s and 60s what
you do is basically you try to dedicate as much
of your time as possible to self transcendence that's the
game plan that I personally have set up for myself
that I'm going to be following because this is the
game plan that will create the most fulfillment in your
life there is no question at all that this is
the game plan that will create the most fulfillment in
your life and there is no even comparison to other
potential strategies there is no better strategy if what you
want is the most happiness you could possibly have this
is the best game plan that not just I have
found through my research but that sages and philosophers and
wise people have found for hundreds and thousands of years
all right this this path is is well known um
by those who actually care about creating a really fulfilling
life now those people that are just [ __ ]
around and are deceiving themselves well they think they can
do that through a cushy kind of life and that's
just not going to happen so that's it one thing
that I want to mention is that I did just
recently release my life purpose course which is specifically designed
to address probably the number one gap that you have
in your life which is a lack of purpose a
lack of understanding your own gifts and passions and how
to take those and actually translate them into creating your
dream career that's something that I've struggled with for the
last five years in my life even even further back
even in college I was struggling with all this stuff
right because I knew that I needed to get this
piece of the puzzle into place otherwise I couldn't get
to the higher stages I just kind of had that
intuition in me I hope you can see that this
is very important for your life I hope you can
see and you have that same kind of intuition that
you know you're trying to get to self transcendence and
if you want to get there creating a life purpose
creating your dream career understanding who you are at a
deep level discovering your top values and passions and some
strategies and ideas for how to actually use those to
create your dream career that that's going to be a
really really big step in that direction all right so
if you're interested go I encourage you and check out
my life purpose course I'll have a link down below
that's it I'm done for this one I'm signing off
go ahead post me your comments down below click the
like button please share this video with a friend and
finally come check out actualize that org right here I
have a free newsletter there that'll keep you up to
date with all the videos I release on a weekly
basis but also there's the life purpose courses there I
have my book list there some other cool resources there
so check that out and I'm adding more and more
stuff there every single month as actualized that org grows
but the reason really you want to stay onboard is
because man this this journey of self-actualization and ultimately self
transcendence this is uh this is a long road it's
like a marathon it's more intense than a marathon and
you need to know how to keep yourself motivated how
to keep yourself inspired on this journey you need to
know all the little distinctions and all the concepts and
models that are out there that have been discovered by
scientists and psychologists and you know researchers and and many
many people who devoted their entire lives to studying this
stuff um you want to get some of that wisdom
you want to get some of those techniques and ideas
they're going to be very very helpful for you on
this journey because this journey is so long it's very
easy to get sidetracked even if you think you're on
track right now a month from now a year from
now ten years from now you might not be so
the whole purpose of actualize that org is to help
you stay on that on that narrow road and help
you to ultimately get to self-actualization and self transcendence because
I know that when you get there you're going to
finally feel like you've you've gotten to the pinnacle of
life like you've actually lived life and then you died
having savored everything there is to savor most people they
died some were very low on the on the hierarchy
and they never get to the very top and to
me that's a very regrettable and sad thing and I
don't want to see that happening to you so sign
up stay tuned follow along every week and I'll see
you soon you
