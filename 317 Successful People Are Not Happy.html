            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Lzzu0kel7d0' target='_blank'>Successful People Are Not Happy</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Illusion of Success</b>: In our modern culture, there is an illusion of what success looks like. Individuals such as celebrities, successful friends, co-workers, and family members who seem to have a lot of money and appear happy are often seen as the embodiment of success. This illusion is often fueled by false role models highlighted in media, like Donald Trump, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Elon Musk, Tony Robbins, Oprah, Steve Jobs among others. 
</li><li><b>False Role Models</b>: It is important to be cautious of these false role models, as what they exhibit is only surface level success. Despite their perceived success, these individuals might be miserable, addicted to substances, overworked, stressed and depressed. They are all essentially masters at manipulating life, managing to have this air of success that people yearn for. Occasionally, we get glimpses of their personal troubles or behavioral problems which offer a reality check on this illusion of success. 
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding Self-Actualization</b>: The common misunderstanding is that self-actualization is about external success and achievements which simply isn't the case. The individuals who society tends to idolize for their achievements are often not truly happy, proving that this approach to self-actualization is misguided.
</li><li><b>Pyramid Scheme of Success</b>: The culture can seem like a pyramid scheme of success, where only the top tier individuals are deemed successful based on their wealth and public acknowledgment. However, the shocking reality is, even those at the top may not be genuinely happy. Moreover, to maintain this perception of success, these individuals often deceive themselves, further perpetuating the illusion. 
</li><li><b>True Self-Actualization</b>: Self-actualization is not about envying or aspiring to be like the "happy" and successful individuals we see in the media. If one were to become like them, according to Gura, they would potentially end up miserable. Hence, it's critical to break away from this societal norm and seek true self-actualization that isn't predicated on external representations of success but on individual growth and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Illusion of Happiness in Success</b>: Even with wealth, power, and capability to manipulate circumstances, it's easy for one to trick themselves into believing they are happy. Misconceptions of success can lead to unending cycles of chasing more success.
</li><li><b>Separating Success and Happiness</b>: Understanding the difference between success and happiness is necessary for personal growth. Oftentimes, the pursuit of success leads away from happiness because one's actions become more focused on success rather than achieving true happiness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Happiness</b>: Every human action aims at maximizing happiness, even those that are socially despised. Realizing and focusing on the goal of happiness is important as chasing success can result in actions diverging from realizing true happiness. 
</li><li><b>Happiness over Material possessions</b>: There's a tendency to value rational and gross material items more than the airy and intangible aspect of happiness. Understanding happiness and valuing it more than material wealth is a sign of wisdom.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of Happiness</b>: People often mistake the purpose of happiness, associating it with getting everything one wants. However, true happiness comes from being content with what one has, including even when one has nothing. Even spiritual pursuits like a loving relationship can be misguided chase of happiness.
</li><li><b>Surrender to Reality</b>: Happiness comes from surrendering oneself to reality, while success is about manipulating reality. To live a happy life requires aligning one's desires with reality rather than attempting to make reality fit one's desires.
</li><li><b>Unconditioned Happiness</b>: Happiness is not about acquiring anything, including supposed good or spiritual things. It isnt a thing to be acquired, but a state of being in the present moment, accepting the reality as it is, and being contented with it, regardless of the circumstances.
</li><li><b>Danger of Conditional Happiness</b>: Leo Gura warns against a lifestyle where happiness is conditioned by success, freedom, money, comfort, and possessions, proclaiming it a fragile strategy for life. He expresses concern over investing time and energy into achieving conditional happiness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Happiness on a Deeper Level</b>: Leo calls for a deeper internalization of the idea that money and material possessions do not equate to true happiness. He argues that the acquisition of these goods is akin to drug usea temporary boost in mood, thus delaying real inner growth and connection with being.
</li><li><b>Addictive Nature of Success and Comfort</b>: Leo underscores that success and comfort can become addictive, leading to a never-ending cycle of achievement, constantly striving for more. This addiction is sustained as societal and economic praise validate such success, trapping even the brightest minds. 
</li><li><b>Redirecting Success Principles</b>: While not advocating laziness or refusing the pursuit of success entirely, Leo insists on applying success principles to what he terms 'wise areas' such as the pursuit of truth, love, authentic relationships, and communication. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Societal Indoctrination of Success</b>: Gura encourages listeners to question the cultural indoctrination of the illusion of successusually represented by wealthy and powerful individuals, whom he terms "chimps in suits". Instead, he urges envy for individuals that seek and promote spiritual growth over materialism such as monks, yogis, and saints.
</li><li><b>Happiness Over Success</b>: In conclusion, he advises listeners to pursue happiness directly, avoiding detours masked as success. By shattering the illusion that success and happiness are synonymous, listeners can then move towards experiencing their most significant growth.
