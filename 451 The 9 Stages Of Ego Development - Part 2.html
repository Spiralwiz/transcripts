            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/G8fIhLDV3L4' target='_blank'>The 9 Stages Of Ego Development - Part 2</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of the Video</b>: The video represents part two of a three-part series discussing nine stages of cognitive development, with part two specifically addressing the 'post-conventional' stages, i.e., the pluralist and the autonomous strategist stages. 
</li><li><b>Classification of Post-conventional stages</b>: Leo explains that the post-conventional stages represent roughly 15-20% of the US adult population. This category includes the Pluralist stage, which accounts for about 11% of the said population, and the Autonomous/Strategist stage, encompassing about 5%.
</li><li><b>Foundations of Stages</b>: Each stage builds upon the capabilities of the preceding stages. Meaning, each stage is a developmental phase, neither good nor bad but simply necessary for growth and maturity.
</li><li><b>Study Method for Series</b>: Leo advises viewers to study the content repeatedly, emphasizing the depth and transformative potential of the material.
</li><li><b>Post-conventional Development Interpretation</b>: Post-conventional stage objects are seen as eternal though their meanings are context-dependent. The ego is seen as a 'meaning-creating machine', constructing the world and its meaning while denying this very act.
</li><li><b>Concept of 'Normies'</b>: 'Normies', or conventional-minded individuals that prioritise materialistic pursuits over metaphysical and self-development work, contrast with those at the post-conventional stage. The pluralist stage, which is the first post-conventional stage, involves a realization that reality is subjective and depends on perspective.
</li><li><b>Epistemic Problem for Post-conventional Pluralists</b>: Upon engaging deeply with relativity, pluralists face the challenge of a myriad of viewpoints and perspectives, which can complicate coping with everyday practicalities, and the recognition of observational biases.
</li><li><b>Significance of Cultural Exposure</b>: Travel and exposure to different cultures may lead to an existential crisis, which can cause a shift from equalizing all worldviews (pluralist mindset) to discernment among them. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Self-deception</b>: Leo discusses how the mind tricks individuals into constructing their own reality, emphasizing the dangers of cultural bias and unexamined beliefs and assumptions. The post-conventional mind is able to question the nature of beliefs and reality.
</li><li><b>Influence of Surroundings</b>: At the pluralist stage, awareness of societal and environmental influences on one's beliefs is apparent. There is an understanding of how media, culture, and language structure thoughts.
</li><li><b>Brainwashing Realisation</b>: At the post-conventional stages, individuals become aware of the extent of influence or 'brainwashing' they have been subjected to by education and other societal constructs.
</li><li><b>State of Disorientation</b>: The process of deconstructing one's established beliefs could lead to a state of vertigo, but this lets individuals explore multiple possibilities and question their own motives. There is recognition of the limitations of purely rational analysis.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Pluralist Stage</b>: The pluralist stage is where individuals start to value insight and breakthroughs and see problems as interplay between polarities. It expands focus beyond the analytical approach to incorporate intuition, dreams, meditation, and self-reflection as valid sources of information.
</li><li><b>Mind-Body Connection</b>: Pluralists recognize the importance of body consciousness and the link between psychological issues and bodily sensations. They turn towards practices like mindfulness and yoga to deal with these issues.
</li><li><b>Role of a Pluralist</b>: Pluralists, who might be seen as hippies or dreamers by others, strive to question conventional wisdom and explore different perspectives, even those of criminals. The challenge for them is to integrate different aspects of themselves without regressing to conventional thinking.
</li><li><b>Consequences at Pluralist Level</b>: Pluralists might face problems like feelings of isolation, relationship issues, traps of extreme relativism and issues dealing with difficult emotions and spiritual goals. 
</li><li><b>Emergence of Autonomous Strategist</b>: This stage is where individuals start to see themselves as part of an ongoing historical and evolution process. They can form an understanding of reality independent of external influences and work towards self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Role of a Strategist</b>: Strategists, or humanists and thought leaders, focus on helping others evolve, considering both tangible and intangible outcomes. They understand the need to work on themselves and exemplify what they teach.
</li><li><b>Understanding a Strategist</b>: The strategist lives life as a journey towards self-actualization. They understand the challenging nature of changing old patterns. Despite recognizing the negative traits within themselves, they strive to improve continuously.
</li><li><b>Role of a Strategist</b>: A strategist provides realistic assessment of situations without personal biases. They might face hurdles like fear of unfulfilled potential or societal disapproval due their ambitious visions.  
</li><li><b>End Note of Video</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of mastering the Pluralist and Strategist stages to achieve transformation. He encourages viewers to continuously study the content and support his work via Patreon.
</li><li><b>Post-Conventional Development and Deconstruction of Beliefs</b>: Post-conventional development begins with the deconstruction of beliefs and understanding the socially constructed nature of reality. Previously absolute beliefs and assumptions, based on religion, science or culture, are critically examined and questioned. There is a realization that the meaning of things depends on one's perspective and interpretation. This stage initiates deep self-reflection and awareness of one's unexamined beliefs.
</li><li><b>Post-rational Thinking and Self-Deception</b>: The post-conventional stage moves beyond rational thinking and starts to question language and materialist assumptions. The possibility of illusion and self-deception is acknowledged and the mind becomes more self-reflective, analyzing its own constructs of language and reality.
</li><li><b>Perspective-Taking and Reality Interpretation</b>: Individuals at the post-conventional stage begin to understand that meaning of objects, although perceived as permanent, is context-dependent. They start to question if meaning is inherent in objects or if it is projected onto them by the ego and its biases.
</li><li><b>Challenging Conceptual Boundaries</b>: The boundaries of previously 'fixed' concepts, like science, become more flexible at this stage. The definitions and boundaries of these ideas evolve, and there is a blurring between similar concepts such as science and religion. The mind starts to understand that these boundaries are not as clear cut as previously thought.
</li><li><b>Discussion on Post-Conventional Development and Absolutism</b>: Post-conventional development signals a shift from absolute perspectives, where there is strong attachment to a single belief system or worldview, into a more relativistic view of reality. This cognitive shift allows an individual's mind to step out of a single system of thought or perceptions and start comparing various systems or worldviews objectively. This mitigates the entrenched thought patterns common in conventional stages. 
</li><li><b>The Concept of Relativity and Various Perspectives</b>: At the post-conventional stage, open-minded individuals acknowledge and explore the idea of relativity. They are enthralled by multiplicity of perspectives. The observational fact that the nature of reality appears to depend on the observer makes the objective judgement almost impossible. The pluralist (a term used to denote an individual at this stage) becomes excited and fascinated with the exploration of multiple perspectives, rather than remaining confined within a single rigid perspective.  
</li><li><b>Appreciation of Existential, Metaphysical, Psychological, and Epistemic Questions</b>: One of the key factors that distinguish post-conventional thinkers or pluralists from the conventional thinkers is their predisposition to ponder existential, metaphysical, psychological, and epistemic issues. They appreciate the intricacies of these issues, unlike the normies (conventional-minded people). 
</li><li><b>Value in Exploration of various Cultures and Worldviews</b>: The pluralists embody the curiosity in exploring various cultures and worldviews. The very exploration of diverse perspectives enriches them as individuals and broadens their mindset. They accept the uncertainty associated with dispensing absolute views. 
</li><li><b>The Judgment Issue Linking Quantum Mechanics</b>: Relativity is linked to the principles of quantum mechanics, where observation is known to influence what's observed. This casts a shadow on the concept of objective judgment. The Pluralists become aware of the ability to change viewpoints, depending on how they are probed, thus recognizing the limits of objective knowledge. 
</li><li><b>Transition from Conventional Thinking to Deeper Understanding</b>: Post-conventional stage brings about a deep transition from conventional certainty to a broader understanding of worldviews. This transition involves questioning the fundamental hidden assumptions underlying popular belief systems like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. This allows them to evaluate their own belief system from an external viewpoint, revealing previously unseen aspects of their worldview.
</li><li><b>Struggles of Pluralist Stage</b>: In the pluralist stage, one struggles with managing all the diverse perspectives they gain and the practical demands of everyday life. This relativistic stage can make it challenging to make decisions, distinguish between different qualities of views, and balance exploration with living life.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Personal Biases</b>: Pluralists become aware of their own biases and subjective lenses. They realize that observations concerning different aspects of life, such as politics, religion, and science, are filtered through these lenses. This understanding humbles the mind and leads to an expanded perspective.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Cultural Conditioning</b>: There is an increased awareness of the influence of cultural conditioning on one's beliefs and values. Pluralists, due to their exposure to diverse cultures, values, and beliefs, realize that they're not fully in control of their own perspectives.
</li><li><b>Travel and Expansion of Worldview</b>: Traveling to different, especially exotic, parts of the world can lead to cultural shock, existential crisis, and an expanded worldview. This exposure causes them to question their conventional lifestyle and view of the world, and leads to considering all worldviews as seemingly equally valid.
</li><li><b>Adjudication between Different Worldviews</b>: The pluralist stage can lead to a propensity to see all worldviews as equal. This brings up questions about reckonings between diverse viewpoints, as well as dilemmas about the existence and determination of truth. The truth becomes challenging to find at this stage due to the relativistic perspective. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Pluralism on Concept of Truth</b>: The truth becomes grueling to find at this stage due to extreme relativism. Pluralists often express the concept of truth as subjective and varying from person to person. This can cause discomfort to conventional thinkers who believe in objective facts and realities.
</li><li><b>Exposure to Diverse Worldviews</b>: The exposure to a diversity of worldviews leads to a desire to be even-handed and fair. Pluralists tend to value and honor all ideas on an equal footing, which can lead to a denial of the existence of absolute truth. This viewpoint can often be challenging for people in conventional stages to accept or understand.
</li><li><b>Post-conventional Development - Pluralist Stage</b>: At this stage of ego development, individuals become increasingly aware of self-deception as a defense mechanism of the mind. This self-deception involves the construction of reality and the ensuing belief that this constructed reality is an absolute truth. Individuals also become cognizant of how society and environment shape personal worldviews and beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Self-Deception</b>: People start to realize that the human mind can fool itself into validating its constructed reality as an absolute truth. This insight offers a deeper understanding of self-deception mechanisms and how they enable the mind to construct its perception of reality. 
</li><li><b>Complexities in Interpretation of Reality</b>: In this stage, individuals grapple with the concept of truth, acknowledging that the idea of an absolute truth is more complex than conventionally believed. The understanding emerges that all groups and societies aim to influence the minds and ideologies of their members, reinforcing the idea that individual perceptions of reality are largely determined by societal, cultural, and environmental factors.
</li><li><b>Potential Dangers of Cultural Bias</b>: Pluralists recognize that cultural bias and self-deception poses a greater threat to the understanding of reality than external entities. It pushes for internal examination and acknowledges the possibility of self-deception in personal beliefs.
</li><li><b>Epistemological Questions</b>: In the pluralist stage, the understanding of knowledge, how it is acquired and believed, becomes more crucial. Individuals realize the importance of differentiating between beliefs and reality, and acknowledge that understanding and interpreting reality is separate from reality itself.
</li><li><b>The Role of Environment and Society</b>: It is recognized that an individual's beliefs and values are contingent on multiple factors  the historical context, geographic location, economic circumstances, societal structure, and media influence. The understanding that one's religious or atheist beliefs are mainly a result of upbringing and societal influences marks this stage.
</li><li><b>Brainwashing and its Effects</b>: In the process of self-reflection, individuals realize they are not immune to brainwashing. They even acknowledge educational texts as possible sources of indoctrination and blind belief. This realization can lead to an existential crisis, pushing individuals to question and challenge their beliefs. 
</li><li><b>Shaping of Perception</b>: The pluralist stage cherishes the ability to observe oneself and one's culture from an external perspective. The ability to question hidden assumptions, values, and beliefs paves the way for a better understanding of the self and the world. This stage also signals the awakening of an individual's self-awareness, awakening them to deeper existential questions.
</li><li><b>Appreciation of the Influence of Media, Advertising, Culture, and Language on Perception</b>: The transcript discusses the understanding that media, advertising, culture, and language profoundly influence our understanding and perception of reality. Language, in particular, is recognized as structuring thought, as one can only conceptualize ideas based on the linguistic abilities we possess. This understanding leads to questioning the education system's biases and the societal structures we often take for granted, such as capitalism. 
</li><li><b>Realizing Your Own Mental Molding and Brainwashing</b>: At the pluralist stage, there is a realization that our minds have far less control over their own molding and shaping than previously thought. There comes an understanding that there has not only been systemic brainwashing but also self-brainwashing. Education systems, including science and textbooks, are seen as potential sources of self-deception.
</li><li><b>Challenges and Threats of Self-realization</b>: Understanding the extent to which we have been influenced and molded by external factors can be a threatening and challenging experience. This realization that much of what we believed to be true was merely belief-based can create a sense of confusion and cognitive dissonance. Many people resist this mental and emotional labor, which is why it is uncommon.
</li><li><b>Moving from Material Gains to Inner Experiences and Self-reflection</b>: As one reaches the pluralist stage, there is a significant shift from chasing materialistic gains like money and sex toward focusing on inner experiences and self-reflection. This stage is often reached after one has tasted success in the material world and recognized its lack of ultimate fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Discovering the Subjectivity of Ones Worldview</b>: The pluralist stage also involves a deeper exploration of how subjective our worldviews are. This realization can be both liberating and confusing. It is liberating because it opens up unlimited ways to view the world, but it also leaves one in a state of vertigo for some time trying to make sense of it all.
</li><li><b>Temptation of Regression and the Importance of Courageous Persistence</b>: There is a strong temptation to regress to old ways of thinking in an attempt to make sense of the world. However, real growth requires resisting this urge and allowing oneself to exist in a state of groundlessness or rudderlessness while wrestling with different perspectives. Despite the emotional toll and confusion, this process is extremely liberating.
</li><li><b>Pluralist stage of perception</b>: At this stage, the focus shifts from rational analysis to an organismic approach which considers feelings, intuitions, and contexts. This stage sees a person questioning their actions, their motives, and their programmed beliefs, in a bid to discover a true sense of self. They begin to abandon actions that are performed purely due to societal or cultural norms.
</li><li><b>Transition to Psychological logic</b>: Post-conventional stages realize that logic can be a tool for self-deception as it is often co-opted by the ego to preserve itself. It's at this stage that logic becomes psychological, with the individual starting to account for how the mind can twist logic for its own benefit. 
</li><li><b>Exploration and self-awareness</b>: Pluralists prioritize exploration and discovery over the achievement of specific goals. They scrutinize their assumptions and value the mental freedom that comes with the stage. They begin to perceive problems as interplays between polarities, neither of which can simply be eliminated. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming the superiority complex</b>: Pluralists understand that solving a problem requires thinking from a perspective different from the one that created the problem in the first place. They appreciate the importance of understanding diverse perspectives rather than trying to eliminate them.
</li><li><b>Paradox and contradiction</b>: At the pluralist stage, individuals begin to embrace paradoxes and contradictions without feeling the need to eliminate them. They understand the existence of circular causality and strange loops, and can deal with them effectively.
</li><li><b>Post-Conventional Stage Emphasizes Paradox</b>: At this stage, the post-conventional mind sees paradox as a feature, not a bug, and relishes it as an inherent characteristic of reality. Linear logic gives way to a more holistic understanding and emphasis is placed on insight, breakthrough, and connection over part-analysis.
</li><li><b>Exploration and Creativity in Pluralist Stage</b>: This stage is marked by playful exploration of diverse perspectives, unlocking higher imagination and creativity. The pluralist prefers connecting dots over dissecting parts, and places value on sources beyond science such as intuition, dreams, and meditation.
</li><li><b>Embracing Feelings and Being</b>: In contrast to the achiever phase, the pluralist stage shifts focus from doing to being and feeling. Criticized as New Age thinking by rationalists, these aspects are embraced extensively in the pluralist stage. This abstraction of consciousness is recognized as a crucial aspect of reality.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Emotions throughout the Body</b>: The pluralist stage develops awareness of the mind-body connection. The understanding dawns that emotions, previously believed to be only in the head, are spread throughout the body. This can lead to releasing unprocessed emotions, thereby opening up new avenues for healing and spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Significance of Integrating Mind and Body</b>: For pluralists, finding connection between the mind and body becomes important. The physical manifestation of depression is recognized as being intricately linked with thought patterns and past traumas, signifying a shift in understanding disease from pure material causes.
</li><li><b>Recognition of intertwined nature of thoughts, feelings, and sensations</b>: Through the exploration of the pluralist stage of ego development, the realization dawns that feelings, thoughts, and body sensations all influence each other. This interconnection, once recognized, facilitates better self-awareness and promotes health in every aspect. It involves departing from compartmentalized binary thinking and embracing the intertwined nature of mental, emotional, and physical experiences.
</li><li><b>Breaking away from societal norms and stereotypes</b>:  This inward exploration is characteristic of the "hippie" ethos  free love, psychedelic experiences, eclectic cultural influences. Yet, this doesn't imply that adopting a pluralist perspective necessitates aligning with all stereotypes associated with a counterculture such as the hippies. A pluralist can lead a conventional lifestyle, complete with stable jobs and responsibilities while nurturing their unique perspectives and disregarding socially approved roles or tasks.
</li><li><b>Beyond judgement and embracing moral relativism</b>: From whats perceived as an amoral or overly relativistic attitude arising from a pluralist perspective, there emerges a more profound understanding of the world and society. By seeing the validity in all perspectives, even those society traditionally considers immoral (like a criminal's perspective), the pluralist adopts a transcendent morality that is unattached to societal judgments.
</li><li><b>Struggle with integrating diverse aspects of oneself</b>: As the exploration deepens, it becomes evident that an individual is a complex amalgam of various sub-identities  masculine, feminine, rational, intuitive, emotional, stoic, etc. The challenge lies in integrating these into a harmonious whole without suppressing any aspects, an exercise which a pluralist values highly. 
</li><li><b>Fear of regression and isolation</b>: Feelings of isolation may accompany the pluralist stage since most people are typically stuck in conventional mindsets. Further, when engaging in relationships with people rooted in conventional stages, conflicts can arise, fueled by the dread of slipping back into lower stages of ego development. There is also a fear of losing the space for individual self-expression and creativity in one's work life. 
</li><li><b>Navigating the pitfalls of the pluralist stage</b>: Some common pitfalls for pluralists include viewing all hierarchies as oppressive and considering all opinions, values, and worldviews as equally valid. The goal isn't to equate all perspectives, but rather to understand the rooted subjectivity of all opinions and to assess their healthy or unhealthy implications in actual circumstances. Despite inherent relativism, decision-making and evaluations remain essential.
</li><li><b>Extreme relativism and oppressive diversity</b>: The pluralist stage can have traps such as extreme relativism leading to indecision and false equivalency, as well as diversity and equality becoming oppressive positions - taken to extremes, they can backfire. An example is overzealous social justice campaigners who push so much for equality and diversity that it becomes counterproductive. This issue is sometimes exaggerated by right-wing narratives.
</li><li><b>Accepting the role of differing stages</b>: The leap in consciousness to the pluralist stage often attracts criticism but is a key part of development. Pluralists are typically tolerant of diverse ideas but may judge others who don't share their beliefs. They are often more concerned with their interior state than material achievements and live on the fringes of society.
</li><li><b>The autonomous strategist stage</b>: This strategy-centric stage, representing around 5% of the U.S adult population, allows individuals to perceive systemic patterns and long-term trends. It is the first stage that recognizes the need and value of all lower stages, giving way to adopting a global worldview. Strategists can generate independent ideas, take responsibility for their interpretations, and commit to creating meaningful lives for themselves and others through self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Self-responsibility and self-actualization</b>: The strategist undertakes a transformational mission aimed at self-actualization. Integrating various sub-personalities forms a more cohesive self, contributing to a grand vision for what humanity can become. The strategist highly values principles such as honesty, authenticity, and truth, and works hard to observe them. The strategist appreciates the rarity of their capacities and the challenges faced to be a mature, responsible adult. 
</li><li><b>Unique position of the strategist</b>: Strategists find themselves in a unique position to aid mankind due to their high level of self-developed capabilities. They aim to guide others through the process of self-actualization. However, they must keep in mind their own imperfections and the ongoing need for self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Post-Conventional Strategist Stage</b>: The strategist stage represents an evolution from the pluralist stage and involves a more rounded, realistic approach to personal and societal change. Strategists understand the complexities of existence and are aware of their personal shortcomings and the need for ongoing self-improvement. This mindset is usually found in roles such as humanists, developmental psychologists, coaches, consultants, thought leaders, and conscious executives.
</li><li><b>Understanding Developmental Processes</b>: Strategists understand the evolutionary developmental processes that individuals must go through. They meet people where they are rather than trying to force their own advanced perspectives onto them. This often makes strategists more effective in implementing realistic transformations in society, compared to the idealistic but impractical approaches of the pluralists.
</li><li><b>Commitment to Self-Improvement</b>: Strategists confront their own inadequacies and commit to continuously work on their self-development. This embodies the essence of the post-conventional development stages, which see self-improvement as a never-ending journey. They apply this awareness to their particular areas of work or influence, seeking not just tangible outcomes like profits, but also intangible outcomes such as work-life balance, serving community and the well-being of others.
</li><li><b>Role in Society</b>: Strategists often play roles as effective coaches, thought leaders, and conscious executives. They take into account not just profits but also factors like physical and mental health, work-life balance, aesthetics, and their impact on the community and environment. They understand the potential of their influence or business but prioritize personal evolution and helping others over maximizing financial gain.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Overcoming Biases</b>: Awareness of personal biases and work on understanding and overcoming these biases is crucial for strategists. They also understand the interrelation of systems and their long-term implications. This often involves a deep psychological vocabulary and sophisticated understanding of various personal and societal topics.
</li><li><b>Role of Strategists in Personal Development</b>: Strategists play an important role in personal development and self-actualization. They accept that their understanding and embodying of advanced concepts is a work in progress and continually work on themselves behind the scenes to embody their teachings. This self-awareness, humility, and dedication make them effective in leading others towards higher levels of consciousness and evolution.
</li><li><b>Awareness of Imperfections</b>: Strategists are acutely aware of their imperfections and inadequacies. This awareness often precipitates a deep commitment to personal growth and development so that they can effectively lead others towards the ambitious visions they have for humankind.
</li><li><b>Handling Self-Improvement</b>: The journey of self-improvement is continuous and does not have a static end goal for strategists. They see themselves as complex beings with positive and negative traits, understanding the trade-offs within personalities, and focusing on authenticity and aligning their lives with their true selves. As they face personal inadequacies, they continue to practice humility and continually strive for self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Strategists and transformation</b>: Strategists have learned to be more detached when pushing others to transform, understanding that not everyone is ready. The burden of change lies with the individual and not the strategist.
</li><li><b>Developmental thinking in strategists</b>: Strategists factor in how the self and others evolve, advocating for personal development. However, strategists recognize that many individuals are not ready for substantial personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Strategist's understanding of hierarchies</b>: Strategists acknowledge the necessity of certain hierarchies while recognizing that others can be oppressive and need to be eradicated. Strategists respect all individuals but recognize that not all opinions are suitable or valid. 
</li><li><b>Strategist's approach to life and self-improvement</b>: Strategists see life as a constant journey of self-improvement and are deeply aware of their own biases which they attempt to rectify. They are driven by a desire for a meaningful life and the fulfillment of deep life purposes. Despite their in-depth understanding of human nature, strategists may grapple with the danger of becoming arrogant or superior.
</li><li><b>Integration of negative feelings in strategist's mindset</b>: Negative emotions are acknowledged and experienced fully by strategists, transforming their intensity. They accept the complex nature of beings, understanding that indviduals can have both positive and problematic traits.
</li><li><b>Potential pitfalls for strategists</b>: Strategists may err by overly identifying themselves as transformers and show impatience with slow personal development in others. They discover non-possessive love, increase benevolence, and compassion towards themselves and others, and make subtle distinctions in feelings and emotions.
</li><li><b>Strategist's outlook on personal growth and self-actualization</b>: Strategists discard the idea of an end to self-actualization and instead consider it as an ongoing process. They prioritize being able to feel, understand, and communicate with emotions rather than being passively reactive to them.
</li><li><b>On Authenticity</b>: The strategist, a stage of personal development, seeks authenticity in all aspects of life. They utilize dreams, imagination, and vision to explore reality, and prioritize sustainable, root-cause solutions to large-scale problems for the betterment of humanity and future generations. They refrain from using blame as a defense mechanism in relationships, take responsibility for overall personal growth, and focus on becoming as authentic to their true selves as possible.
</li><li><b>Feelings and Spiritual Goals</b>: Despite their advanced stage of development, strategists still struggle with accepting reality as it is and at times struggle with difficult emotions. Their spiritual goal, at this stage, is to become enlightened. They tend to exude charisma and inspire others to follow their vision for an ideal world order for future generations.
</li><li><b>Shift in Humor and Personality</b>: Strategy-stage humor becomes light-hearted and centered around the human condition, as opposed to weaponizing humor against perceived adversaries. Strategists work on forgiving themselves and others, leading to diminished feelings of guilt and self-criticism. They can sometimes feel dissatisfied and unfulfilled if they fail to live up to their unique human potential.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Biases</b>: The strategist is capable of realistic appraisal of situations due to their understanding and overcoming of personal biases. They leverage sophisticated psychological vocabulary for conceptualizing and communicating about reality and human behavior.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Childhood Conditioning</b>: Strategists become visionary leaders who can identify interrelated systems and their long-term implications. They may experience anxiety and fear due to their ambitious visions and the societal pressures stemming from trying to live up to a universally ideal being.
</li><li><b>Using Differentiated Psychological Vocabulary</b>: Strategists speak in detailed psychological terms when discussing humans, society, cultures, spirituality and reality, reflecting their sophisticated understanding of these concepts.
</li><li><b>Coming to Terms with Self-Actualization</b>: Individuals at the strategist stage learn to view self-actualization as a never-ending process rather than a definitive end goal. They value authenticity and alignment of all aspects of their life with their true self. Tuning into their imagination, dreams and vision is valued as a source of exploration and understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Self-Care and Future-Oriented Thinking</b>: The strategist is aware of the well-being of future generations and may willingly sacrifice themselves for the greater good. While they still face difficulties in accepting life as it is, they aim to be forgiving, reducing guilt and self-criticism. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Authenticity</b>: Strategists continually aim to better align their thoughts, words, and actions with their authentic selves. As a part of this pursuit, they may experience dissatisfaction if they perceive themselves as failing to live according to their potential. 
</li><li><b>Refining Self-Understanding & Communication</b>: Strategists exhibit an evolved understanding of reality, and actively use a differentiated psychological vocabulary while discussing various elements of society and spirituality. They may also face fears or anxieties related to failure in actualizing one's vision or potential. 
</li><li><b>Challenges at Strategist Stage</b>: Strategists can face challenges like feeling dissatisfied when they perceive themselves as not living up to their potential, struggling with difficult emotions, and transient existential problem after retiring when they are not needed anymore. 
</li><li><b>Biases & System Analysis</b>: Strategists are able to make realistic assessments unclouded by personal biases, having a clear understanding of how biases work. They can also perceive how different systems interrelate and their long-term implications. 
</li><li><b>Self-Actualization & Leadership</b>: Strategists position themselves as visionary leaders inspiring others to follow their vision of an ideal world. Understanding failure as a part of the journey, they seek self-improvement continuously, focusing on authenticity and aligning all aspects of life with their true selves.
