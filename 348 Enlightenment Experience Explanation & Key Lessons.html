            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/BOM5dGWz7NM' target='_blank'>Enlightenment Experience Explanation & Key Lessons</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Use of Psychedelics in Enlightenment</b>: Leo Gura confirms that he did use psychedelics when he experienced enlightenment. He emphasizes that an awakening experience consists of understanding and an emotional component and that this is irrespective of whether psychedelics are used or not. The experience has a wide range of depth and quality, and different facets can be revealed. Some experiences may only offer small glimpses of the truth with limited understanding, while others can give a broader understanding of the truth and its relation to life and reality. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions on Enlightenment</b>: Gura tackles a common misconception about enlightenment, which is the belief that once enlightenment is attained, it provides a constant high for the rest of one's life. He explains that there are different kinds of awakenings, some of which may provide only a short glimpse of the truth and limited understanding, causing confusion afterward when the experience passes. He emphasizes that the most significant part of an awakening is not the state itself but the knowledge or understanding carried away and its application in everyday life.
</li><li><b>Authenticity of Enlightenment Experience</b>: Gura discusses the authenticity of his enlightenment experience, revealing that it was different from previous psychedelic trips as different aspects of his self-inquiry, meditation, retreats, yoga practice, and psychedelic experiences were coming together. He found a clear understanding of how all these facets fit together and what they really mean, motivating him to share his experience authentically despite potential criticism. He acknowledges that it was a risky move given his reputation as a teacher and how people project their expectations onto him, but he stresses his opposition to the concept of guru and the associated expectation of perfection. Gura encourages open and authentic experiences that can offer valuable lessons once projections and expectations are set aside.
</li><li><b>Complexities and Nuances of Enlightenment</b>: Gura addresses the complexities and nuances of enlightenment. He criticizes the naive understanding of enlightenment as an on/off switch, categorizing people into either enlightened or not. He argues that such a view is overly simplistic, given the intricate nature of the human brain and psyche, and enlightenment does not happen all at once. Instead, varying degrees of awakenings and glimpses of the truth occur, implying a more gradual nature of the enlightenment process.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Enlightenment</b>: The perception of enlightenment as a sudden complete transformation is misguided due to the complex nature of the brain and psyche. Instead, it's a gradual process with varying degrees of awakening and glimpses of truth. The notion of enlightenment does not imply a total transformation of one's thought processes or behaviors instantly.
</li><li><b>Levels and Facets of Enlightenment</b>: Awakening experiences differ in degrees. People glimpse different aspects of the truth with varying degrees of clarity and duration(Different degrees of temporal sustained 'glimpsing'). Achieving the pinnacle of enlightenment involves the understanding and integration of all facets of truth, rewiring the mind, psyche, and emotional system. 
</li><li><b>Beware of Self-Delusion</b>: Leo warns against assuming that one's spiritual journey is complete after a profound awakening. Enlightenment is an ongoing process, the spectrum of which is wide-ranging. There is the danger of falling into a place of complacency and underestimation of the depth of the field.
</li><li><b>Becoming Conscious of Facets of Absolute Truth</b>: An enlightenment experience involves becoming conscious of some facets of absolute truth. The depth of this consciousness can be shallow or deep, and can be temporary or permanent.   
</li><li><b>Choosing Teachers for Enlightenment Journey</b>: Leo advises being cautious with the teachers you choose to guide you on your enlightenment journey. Consider the depth of their understanding, the facets of truth they've glimpsed, and how well they embody these in their own lives. Many teachers fall short of these qualifications, even if they appear to be skilled or experienced in the field. 
</li><li><b>Different Perspectives on Enlightenment</b>: Every tradition has its own understanding and interpretation of enlightenment, awakening, and self-realization. Leo emphasizes the necessity of studying different traditions and perspectives instead of limiting oneself to a specific one, to gain a broader and more comprehensive understanding of what enlightenment truly is.
</li><li><b>The Continuity of Enlightenment</b>: The study points out that the states of "heightened consciousness" may not remain constant. They can vary in intensity and duration. However, profound experiences might leave lasting understanding and impact. 
</li><li><b>Personal Realizations and Experiences</b>: Post a deep experience, Leo states that he holds a firm belief that he is not his body or voice, and he is not in a physical universe. He has become more conscious of the empty space he inhabits, the "nothingness" that he is part of. This, according to Leo, indicates his detachment from physical bindings and identification with absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Clarity through Consciousness</b>: In this section, Leo Gura advocates that he does not believe in a physical universe or physical brain due to his heightened state of consciousness. The physical universe and the brain are simply concepts for him that he no longer subscribes to.
</li><li><b>Practicing mindfulness and being in the present</b>: Leo discusses, in his recent applications of mindfulness to all aspects of day-to-day life, seeing everything around him as a piece of the absolute. He encourages the practice of slowing down and being present in every action taken. His practice of mindfulness helps him realize addictions, emotional reactions that he deals with, and lets him reorganize his life in a more conscious manner.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and the Importance of Groundwork vs Expectations</b>: Leo identifies himself as a researcher who seeks new routes and methods in lieu of traditional paths. He acknowledges that even though his path might involve the usage of psychedelics, Zen Monasteries or Indian Yogi practices might be better suited to the needs of others. 
</li><li><b>Potential fallacy of long-renowned practices and seeking unorthodox methods</b>: He claims to have found unknown aspects of enlightenment through his unorthodox methodologies that even experienced practitioners have failed to see. This convinces him further that his path lies in sampling various methods while also exploring specific aspects in-depth. 
</li><li><b>Change requires long periods of time</b>: He alerts his viewers that enlightenment, even at its peak, doesn't change foundational structures of the mind immediately. Old habits and emotional reactions persist, and require deliberate, long-term efforts to be changed, even if one has had profound experiences of enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Need for Personalized techniques for Personal Growth</b>: He acknowledges that different personalities need different approaches to confront the unique problems and traumas they deal with. Leo envisions a future where he can produce a variety of techniques for individuals with different needs. He emphasizes this personalization as crucial to one's journey towards spiritual development.
</li><li><b>Relevance of Personal Obstacles and Modern Challenges in Enlightenment Journey</b>: Leo Gura discusses how personal obstacles and new-age challenges like internet addiction or video games can hinder the process of achieving enlightenment. These unique issues might not be well understood by traditional teachers, given their cultural and generational differences.
</li><li><b>Significance of Choosing the Right Spiritual Practice based on One's Needs and Situation</b>: Leo suggests that one should choose a spiritual practice that resonates with their personality, requirements, and aligns with their specific issues. He stresses that the effectiveness of popular spiritual practices like Zen may depend on these factors.
</li><li><b>Multidisciplinary Approach in Spiritual Development</b>: Leo talks about using a hybrid approach encompassing different techniques like yoga, Vipassana, self-inquiry, meditation, retreats, and psychedelics for his spiritual development. He emphasizes the potential benefits of understanding and exploring the whole field, rather than strictly adhering to one orthodox tradition.
</li><li><b>Significance and Potential of Psychedelics in Personal and Spiritual Development</b>: He shares his perspective on the use of psychedelics as a transformative tool, which helped to change his behavior on a daily basis. He is still researching its potential to catalyze the process of spiritual development and warns against immediate neglect based on existing biases.
</li><li><b>Embracing an Ongoing Journey</b>: Leo clarifies that he doesn't consider himself "fully enlightened" and views personal growth as a never-ending journey. He emphasizes openness to new perspectives and feedback, which can help correct any self-delusions.
</li><li><b>Personal Plan for Continued Growth and Sharing</b>: Leo discusses his intention to continue his spiritual journey, ready to accept more teachings and experiences, emphasizing that more layers of realization and truth could be awaiting. He acknowledges the importance of staying vigilant about delusions and carrying on with personal development explorations.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and Personal Development</b>: Leo Gura talks about how consistent awakening experiences have transformed his life and doubled his understanding of personal development. Through these experiences, he can distinguish key elements of personal development and enlightenment, which allows him to guide others more effectively on their personal journeys. 
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Fear</b>: In his awakening experience, the importance of authenticity was made evident, leading Leo to realize the need to break through personal inauthenticity. Achieving 100% authenticity, despite facing fears and obstacles, is a primary goal in personal development. He advocates for honesty and transparency, explaining how facing fears head-on can be a powerful technique for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Fear and Honesty</b>: Leo highlights the significance of fear in personal development, acknowledging that facing and overcoming fear plays a significant role in this process. He acknowledges the power of radical honesty as a technique for personal development. He advocates for cultivating self honesty, even if it brings discomfort, as this process ultimately weakens your ego and promotes authenticity.
</li><li><b>Self-Honesty and Ego</b>: Leo stresses the importance of self-honesty and the cultivation of truth to propel personal development. By allowing painful truths to sting your ego, it gradually weakens and erodes the inauthentic self, which is beneficial to personal growth and enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Authentic Suffering</b>: Leo introduces the concept of authentic suffering vs inauthentic suffering, where authentic suffering is the experience of opening oneself up to truth. He suggests moving towards situations that bring about authentic suffering, thereby shortening the distance between the birth and death of the self, leading to a life conscious of infinity and the miracle of existence. 
</li><li><b>No Mind & Mindfulness</b>: Emphasizing the importance of achieving "no mind", Leo suggests silencing mental chatter and reinforcing daily mindfulness practice is crucial in achieving enlightenment. Being in a state of no mind for most of the day requires consistent effort separate from pursuing enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Realization of Absolute Presence</b>: During his awakening experience, Leo Gura realized that the absolute is omnipresent. He feels like looking for it somewhere else, when it's actually "right here", is a fruitless exercise.
</li><li><b>Vision for Life and Role of Passion</b>: Gura had a transformative vision of devoting his life to selfless living. From his experience, each awakening experience increased his passion towards this selfless living and sharing teachings with the world. He also notes that if one's passion originates from the ego, it'll disappear during spiritual awakenings, whereas a heart-based passion will strengthen. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Non-Doership</b>: Gura emphasizes the need to acknowledge that we are not in control of anything in life and everything happening is inevitable and directed by a higher source. The process of becoming more enlightened involves purification of personal lies and deceptions to be a better channel for this divine force.
</li><li><b>Transition to an Effortless Life</b>: Gura suggests that life can become more effortless by the process of "relinquishing doership", surrendering the illusion of having a choice about things. This idea is terrifying for the ego as it fears losing control.
</li><li><b>Significance of Slowing Down</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of slowing down and simplifying life, warning against the vicious circle of a fast-paced lifestyle which feeds unconsciousness and hinders appreciation of present moments.
</li><li><b>Understanding Obstacles to Enlightenment</b>: Gura talks about gaining insights into why people fail to reach enlightenment. He suggests one of the biggest obstacles is the assumption of a physical universe and the reluctance to accept that enlightenment implies physical death.
</li><li><b>Importance of Shattering Preconceived Concepts</b>: Gura notes that some individuals, despite using psychedelics, fail to experience the profound effects he does because they retain limiting concepts like brain, physical universe, time and space.
</li><li><b>Future Plans and Implementing Lessons Learnt</b>: Moving forward, Gura will continue creating videos and work on incorporating lessons from his enlightenment into everyday actions. He believes that his awakenings and teachings are connected to his life purpose and contributing to the world.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Connection Between Personal Enlightenment and Life Purpose</b>: Leo Gura discusses how his personal awakening is linked to his life purpose and the contribution he wants to make in the world. He views himself more as a student, undergoing self-actualization, rather than a spiritual master. Gura stresses that he wants to be authentic and share his experiences and developments with others as they occur, including his mistakes and delusions. 
</li><li><b>Gura's Plans</b>: Gura has booked two upcoming solo mediation retreats in Hawaii to focus on his own spirituality, during which he will record his experiences. He also plans to host Actualized.org videos with live audiences, starting in the United States' west coast in 2018, in order to test himself in front of people. 
</li><li><b>Variations in Spiritual Journeys</b>: According to Gura, standardized, mainstream methods from traditional spiritual schools or traditions may not apply to everyone because each person's spiritual journey is unique, given their different life circumstances, neuroses, and personality types. Because of this, he believes that personalized techniques and teachings are necessary to effectively address each individual's unique spiritual challenges and limitations on their journey. 
</li><li><b>Align Life Purpose with Career</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of aligning one's life purpose with their career. He suggests that pursuing an inauthentic career can hinder spiritual development, and encourages individuals to find careers that are more congruent with their personal authenticity. 
</li><li><b>Forthcoming Content</b>: Gura promises that he will continue to release more videos documenting his journey, and encourages his audience to stay with him for more content.
