            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding self for success</b>: Understanding oneself is crucial for success, meaning knowing one's values, what one finds meaningful and what one is passionate about. One's work and passion should align; otherwise, success will either not occur or will be quite shallow. More self-exploration may be required to discover what truly resonates with an individual.
</li><li><b>Role of hard work in success</b>: Hard work is key to becoming successful. This does not necessarily mean building up a large company or making lots of money, but rather developing oneself. Success is not so much an outer-world condition as it is an inner-world state. It is dependent on understanding oneself, following principles, and maintaining success. Habits and discipline are also important foundation blocks of success. To achieve success, it's necessary to think strategically, delay gratification, think long term, and resist addictions.
</li><li><b>Choosing and committing to a career path</b>: One needs to choose a career path that they'll commit to mastering over a period of at least ten years. There should be no space for going back, only forward movement. Dabbling in diverse areas without focus leads to failure. Success is a slow process that takes time, possibly taking 10-20 years.
</li><li><b>Finding one's passion</b>: Individuals need to discover what they're curious about, find meaningful, rewarding, and interesting. This passion should align with their values. Applicants might have to do some exploratory brainstorming, journaling, or take a strength survey to identify their major strengths that can guide their career path.
</li><li><b>Consideration of career and lifestyle preferences</b>: Individuals should take into consideration what they don't want, i.e., their dislikes, in choosing a career path.
</li><li><b>Consideration of Career and Lifestyle</b>: It's vital to consider your career choices along with the lifestyle they bring. Elements such as travel preferences, the level of financial independence, creative autonomy, and the type of work environment (social or solitary) should align with personal preferences.
</li><li><b>Identity Reflection and Entrepreneurship</b>: Personal experiences and reflection of strengths and weaknesses can lead to profound realizations such as inclination towards entrepreneurship. This realization would involve understanding one's inability to implement others' ideas and a strong desire to bring personal ideas to life.
</li><li><b>Committing to Mastery</b>: The journey to success necessitates commitment towards mastery and being ready to devote years or even decades to a chosen path. When hard work, self-awareness, alignment with life purpose, and a path of mastery are coupled, success inevitably follows.
</li><li><b>Self Mastery</b>: Overcoming challenges requires self mastery which includes understanding and controlling one's own psychology and emotions. Your career progress, relationships, money management abilities, fitness, and overall life success, flow from self mastery.
</li><li><b>Learning from Successful People</b>: Successful people study success and learn from others who have achieved it. Involving oneself in seminars, reading books, and interacting with successful people are beneficial habits to develop.
</li><li><b>Giving Back</b>: True success is found in positive contributions to the world and providing value to others, not just in accumulating wealth or fame. 
</li><li><b>Value Provision</b>: In order to be successful, more value should be provided than what is charged for. When people perceive that they are receiving excellent value, they want to associate and interact with you, leading to success.
</li><li><b>Continual Learning and Immersion in Success Theory</b>: It is important to immerse oneself in the theory of success and to continually learn, staying on course for the long run as success is described as a marathon, not a sprint.
