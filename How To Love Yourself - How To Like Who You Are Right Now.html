hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about how to love yourself
alright let's talk about this how to love yourself and
no I'm not talking about that kind of love you
pervert I'm talking about how to really how to be
satisfied with yourself you know how to like yourself how
do you be comfortable with who you are as you
are because we're not perfect right and some of us
are less perfect than others or at least we might
think that you are probably thinking about that right now
if you feel like you don't love yourself then you
probably feel like you're not as good as other people
you're not as good as you could be whether that's
because you don't like the way you look there's something
about your looks or something about your health something about
your physique in general or something about your behaviors something
about how you feel something about your tendencies or you
know angry patterns that you have or negative thinking habits
that you have or maybe even some of the circumstances
that you have in your life for example maybe you
don't like the kind of career situation that you're in
or the relationship that you're in and because of that
you can't love yourself well here's here's a scoop on
that you know it's not always easy to like yourself
and you know for some people it is harder than
for others you know for me personally I've always been
insecure about my looks and every time I look in
the mirror I would always find something to nitpick about
something to nitpick about they didn't like some way I
could be better always criticizing myself kind of holding myself
down comparing myself to other people it's hard to get
there right hard to get there so sometimes it'll take
some work it'll take some real inner work to start
to understand that you can be comfortable with who you
are you can be very happy with who you are
even if you've got imperfections and other people can be
happy with how you are even if you have various
imperfections especially physical imperfections right that's especially something that most
people actually don't judge you for as much as you
judge yourself for that's something that's really coming more from
you because when you're comfortable with being who you are
other people they'll just kind of vibe with that and
they'll resonate with it and usually stuff will go well
but what really hurts is when you're insecure about your
own flaws and imperfections and then you're constantly kind of
expecting other people to be judging you for it and
then what you expect you actually kind of find and
the reason that is that it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy
you kind of just manifest it so if you don't
like yourself then ask yourself the following question do you
really not like yourself or do you not like an
aspect of yourself big difference right is it you all
of you that you don't like or just an aspect
I bet it's just an aspect so if that's the
case first of all realize how much you're focusing on
it right and I want you to take that camera
that you have right now and you're totally zoomed in
on this one imperfection that you have you're totally zoomed
in on it I want you to zoom out and
see yourself and your whole life and the whole history
that you have of your life and where you're going
see all of that and put that in perfection that
one imperfection is a context right it's still there I'm
not denying it might not be there maybe you have
some crooked teeth or you have a big nose or
you have a fat ass or whatever or maybe you
have some you know character flaws in you not physical
problems but character flaws and you don't like yourself for
those reasons okay let's admit that there let's say that
it's true it's there well that's that's one aspect of
a much bigger picture so first of all realize that
that's the case and if that is the case then
also realize this point is that you have a choice
of what you focus on you've got this you've got
this like laser beam in your mind which is your
focus right your awareness and this laser beam it's it's
consciously guided by you not all the time but you
can guide it and so if you're always hating on
yourself then what you're doing is you're taking your imperfections
and you're always like shining a magnifying glass over it
so that's what's happening you're shining this magnifying glass on
your imperfections sometimes all you do is you just stare
at them all day right and that's why you feel
so bad about yourself sometimes because you stare at those
imperfections ceaselessly well if you've got an imperfection there's you
only got two choices either you're going to fix it
either you can change it or you can't now go
out there and try to change it if you can
I mean that's what I'm all about I'm giving you
a lot of advice and stuff with all my videos
about you know how to put your life into place
may actually make it really good objectively good but if
you can't change it may be like your physical appearance
you can't you feel like you can't change it or
you don't really want to go that far then that's
fine you can then learn to accept it in the
sense that you're going to shift your focus away you're
going to kind of accept it and not look at
it anymore stop looking at it because it's the cost
of looking at it and the relooking and the relooking
and the relooking that is that's really killing you you're
going to start to focus on other areas of your
life that are great and what you're going to realize
when you make that shift is you're going to realize
that well that little imperfection it's not that important anymore
and then maybe a couple of years down the road
you will actually laugh you will laugh because you'll laugh
and say how could I have possibly been so concerned
about that it's so insignificant now because I've got all
this other awesome stuff flourishing my life I have an
exercise for you all right this is an exercise that
you got to do to start to love yourself you
have to start to love yourself unconditionally right unconditional love
for yourself that means no matter what you did what
you're thinking who you are you still love you you
still think you're the greatest person on earth not in
some sort of arrogant conceited way but because I mean
you're all you got really you are you you're the
most important thing to you and if you don't like
you if you don't love you then you can't be
resourceful out in the world you can't do a lot
of good for others in the world you can't really
have a powerful life in fact you're probably going to
cause a lot of misery and pain for other people
not only yourself because it tends to just spread it's
contagious the negativity you feel about yourself is going to
be negativity that will spread into all your relationships and
everyone you come into contact with so here's the exercise
I want you to go after this video is done
finish watching it but then go and look in your
bathroom mirror get really really close to the mirror so
almost your nose is up to it and really have
a good look at you have a good look at
yourself look yourself straight in the eyes and look at
your face and really take all that in and as
you're doing that don't be tempted to judge yourself just
look at yourself look at yourself face to face in
the mirror and tell yourself the following I love and
accept you exactly as you are I love and accept
you exactly as you are and you're saying that to
yourself right you're saying it to yourself just the way
that I said it to you right now and I
want you to say to yourself 20 times 20 times
in a row say it to yourself and really believe
it believe it as you're saying to yourself now you
might be looking at yourself and you might not like
how your face looks you might notice a freckle or
a pimple you might notice a crooked tooth you might
notice some hair missing like I do when I look
in the mirror right you might notice whatever or you
might think of something bad you did or you might
think about some character flaw that you have as you're
looking yourself straight in the eyes and that's exactly the
moment that I want you to say that I love
and accept you exactly as you are for that particular
trait for that particular problem for all of you despite
that trait you still accept yourself you still love yourself
because you are so much more than that one trait
and you are more than your current personality you are
more than your current character flaws you are more than
your past and some of the bad things you might
have done and that you can you can change all
that and you can also accept it and make issues
you don't even need to change anything you can just
accept it as it is so go ahead and do
that exercise and see how you feel it'll probably make
you feel a little weird at first it'll make you
feel weird because it's so it's so unconventional right it
seems very selfish it might also shock you because you
might realize for the first time in your life just
how much you've been criticizing yourself and how how tough
you are on yourself you might notice that you can't
even say the words or that you hesitate maybe there's
a whole two seconds of hesitation maybe you have to
muster every nerve in your body just say it and
not even crack up or maybe it'll just be like
a fraction a millisecond of hesitation maybe you actually think
that you're you're pretty and that you're beautiful maybe you
think that you're already pretty awesome and yet you go
and you do this exercise and all of a sudden
you realize wow why did I hesitate for a you
know a hair line of a second why did I
hesitate and then ask yourself why did you hesitate why
isn't that automatic for you you might learn something important
there and then say it anyways force yourself just say
it say it say it say it's gonna be more
natural than where you say it alright so to love
yourself you might ask yourself well how does that reconcile
with being better you know what if my character I
do have character flaws and my personality does suck or
there's ways that I can improve you know what if
I could go and get a nose job and reduce
the size my nose what if I get a boob
job what if I can go get some liposuction what
if I can remove that people who have freckle or
what if I can change my diet and then improve
myself in that way or whatever it is right stop
being fat whatever go to the gym more maybe get
a better job you know whatever it is even like
about yourself shouldn't you try to improve it so this
is kind of a classic paradox of self-help is this
this kind of this split between on the one hand
you have to accept yourself and love yourself on the
other hand you have to develop yourself and grow yourself
so a lot of times most of my videos are
actually on the growing part and I'll actually criticize you
make you feel bad about how how horribly you're living
your life how ugly your life is I'll make you
feel bad about that because sometimes that's necessary to get
a little bit of that emotional leverage to start to
move forward but also sometimes it's the opposite some people
have the opposite problem is that they're so hard on
themselves all the time that their problem is not that
they need to really get better their problems that they
just need to accept themselves that's how they get better
that is an improvement in and of itself so really
it is a paradox it's hard sometimes it's even hard
for me to reconcile and draw the line exactly you
know how to walk that line between self-acceptance and self-development
but the fact is for now just accept it as
a kind of paradox and tell yourself that really you're
going to be blending both they're not contradictory you're blending
both and that this is not an excuse for you
to now be an this is not an excuse for
you to be lazy this is not excuse for you
to say well nothing can be done I'm not responsible
for anything it's not excuse for you to play the
victim this is excuse for you to love yourself and
accept yourself and yet you're still going to be developing
yourself a lot right accept yourself right now in the
moment as you are but you can develop yourself you
can change some of the aspects of yourself that's what
I love about life is that you can do that
that we have this because for me it's very easy
to matter in a reality where that wasn't possible where
we were just kind of born and we were who
we are and we couldn't really change anything until death
and then it was too late and basically our life
would have been kind of like a train running on
one track well what's nice about reality that it doesn't
just work that way and that really we can go
in any direction we want we're not a plane we're
not a train running on a track we're more like
a helicopter you get a helicopter fly anywhere you want
that's more what life is like you have a lot
of freedom of choice there and so that's that's open
for you these are the possibilities but right now who
you are except that too and also ask yourself you
know who are you really who do you think you
are are you your body are you your imperfection are
you that problem that you have in your life or
are you something greater are you something bigger are you
something and I hesitate to use this word without qualification
more spiritual you have a higher self that you're living
up to right start to start to expand your your
limited view of yourself and what if you could absolutely
love yourself exactly as you are without needing to change
a single thing do you think that's possible what do
you think is holding you back from that do you
think it's your girlfriend or boyfriend do you think it's
your boss do you think it's your mom or your
dad some mean friend that calls you names do you
think that is what's holding you back from accepting yourself
or do you think it's just a decision like that
just like a split second decision where you just decide
inside that I'm going to accept myself right now as
I am exactly as I am it it's just that
it's a split-second decision inside you then nobody can firm
at you from doing from making that decision except yourself
and right now I'm giving you permission give yourself permission
to forgive yourself for any imperfections you've had any flaws
anything you've done everything you don't like about your life
and just accept it and know that you're going to
work from this place you're not going to be a
lazy slug you're not going to be complacent you're not
going to turn and become mediocre no you're going to
use this as a foundation to build upon right you're
going to build from a foundation of okay I already
love myself I accept myself I'm awesome now I'm going
to become awesome ur an awesome ur an awesome R
and every day I become more and more awesome right
it's absolutely possible absolutely possible for you to completely love
yourself completely accept yourself the only thing that's holding you
back is some perhaps limiting belief that you've have lack
of even making this decision lack of awareness all these
things are mindsets ultimately it's happening in here in your
head and that's something that is fairly straightforward to work
with all right so go do that exercise and really
take what I told you here to heart because if
you hate yourself if you're always criticizing yourself then you
cannot be resourceful in the world and you cannot really
share your gifts with us you cannot share your gifts
and relationships nor in your career or anything else that
you do because you're going to be constantly miserable when
you're happy from the inside happiness will flow from you
and you will be able to go out there and
create the things that you want to create alright this

a problem with beliefs with mindsets lack of control and
