hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I want to talk about how to unleash your
ambition you the key idea that I want to get
across to you in this episode is that if you're
an ambitious person or even if you just have an
inkling of ambition within you then it's your job at
whatever cost it takes to figure out a way to
realize that ambition and that it's your job to play
big rather than play small because in society if you
don't unleash your ambition through your own sheer will then
what's going to happen is that you're going to get
sucked down into the muck with everybody else and that's
going to be a real disservice that you do to
humanity because we need more ambitious people doing ambitious things
one of the themes throughout my entire life that I've
struggled with this has been a theme for me since
I was in my teens all the way up till
today is basically I had this ambition inside of me
like in here this passion this desire to go create
something to shape and impact the world to leave a
legacy behind I had something like that right but it
was so unrefined it was so unstructured and I had
no idea how to take the say ambition and how
do I actually do something with it in the real
world and that for me has been like the defining
theme of my entire life is like learning how to
take this abstract ethereal creative drive that was in that
my muse and then figure out how do I actually
get that muse to have traction in the real world
because in the real world once you know you come
up with all used dreams and ideas you have and
all this lofty cool stuff I can maybe plan a
sort of business or you plan to start a charity
of your planet you know go change the world in
some way that's all good on paper in your mind
when you're daydreaming it but then when the rubber meets
the road it's like you have to actually start a
business you have to hire employees you have to know
what you're doing you have to have uriens you have
to have knowledge you have to have marketing skills you
have to be able to make money so the thing
is self-sustaining you have to be able to manage the
whole thing you have to be able to avoid all
the different obstacles that are there you have to know
how to compete with in a very competitive and global
marketplace so there's a lot of moving parts right and
if you get any one of those wrong the whole
thing just self destructs not even that but it doesn't
even get off the ground it just stays like a
dream in your mind so that's been a real struggle
for me and what's really challenging about that is that
when you first start in life you know when you're
in your teens or early 20s you don't really know
how this stuff really works and the world can be
quite ruthless quite cutthroat especially the business world so how
do you get something going and it's like how do
you even change the world if you don't do it
through a business or through you know some amazing career
that you start it's hard to even think of what
it would be like you need you need some sort
of organization through which you can have this change happen
and what happened to me is that when I got
my first job out of college it was a pretty
good job I got a game design job up in
Boston and this was my first job and so it
was an interesting experience for me kind of really eye-opening
experience so I go to Boston I moved to Boston
from California and I'm working there for about a year
and when I start noticing as I'm looking around me
looking at the people around me some of them are
more ambitious some of them are not really ambitious at
all and I kind of compare myself to them and
think about the grand ideas that I have and I
had already a lot of ideas before I even went
and started that job but ultimately you know I had
my own ideas that I wanted to implement which wasn't
what I was doing at that job at that job
I was on implementing somebody else's ideas right I was
like the grunt laborer for some other leader and there's
nothing inherently wrong with that except for me it was
a problem because I felt like I had something to
say I had a bike a voice that needed to
be expressed self expression needed to happen that was that
creative drive that was my ambition but when I told
myself the time is like well Leo I mean you
can't just expect to go out there and create it
you know your own game company you can't create your
own studio just yet you have no experience so go
in this career and just kind of like be the
grunt worker for five or ten years save up some
money build up some experience and then eventually you'll get
promoted up the ladder and you know the standard career
track and eventually maybe you get to work on some
cool ambitious project that you've always dreamed of so just
kind of bide your time and wait for 10 or
20 years for that to happen that's what I told
myself that was my original plan because I didn't know
how to start a business I didn't have the capital
or the the experience or the expertise all I had
was like cool ideas but no knowledge of how to
implement those ideas so I had to kind of subject
myself into that system I felt I had to follow
that system but what I discovered is that if you're
a really ambitious person and you have a very large
vision for a business or a product or a project
that you want to start or a novel you want
to write or whatever you want to do however you
want to impact the world if you've got a great
vision like that it's going to be very difficult for
you to subjugate yourself and be the grunt worker for
somebody else's vision very difficult and subjecting yourself into the
system into the bureaucracy into society quote unquote you know
the structures that have been set up for you by
other people that have come before that might not be
your best move because what I found myself doing is
I was kind of like dumbing myself down I was
taking that talent and that actually the most valuable thing
I had was that ambition and that creative force I
was taking that and I was just kind of denying
it and suppressing it just so that I can be
a good worker for somebody else and I think that
um I would bet I don't know I haven't done
statistics or taking surveys but I would bet that there
are thousands tens of thousands of very ambitious uh like
bright people out there that could transform the world if
only they figured out how to take this ambition it
actually channel it into something concrete and not get sucked
into the system because once you get sucked into system
all those grand ideas you have they basically become mediocre
and the status quo takes hold and the system the
system doesn't fight for higher ideals the system doesn't really
fight for truth or for justice or for beauty or
for changing the world or for helping humanity that's not
what the system fights for the system fights for preserving
itself and that usually means especially in a business context
that usually means like earn some money entrench your monopolistic
position within business and just kind of like make sure
that you survive it's not about thriving it's just about
surviving it's about doing the same thing it's about not
incurring too much risk it's about not shaking the boat
that sort of thing right but that's all mediocrity and
what happened to me is that I was naive and
I didn't really know anything and so I just kind
of subjected myself to that system thinking that just that
that was my only option that's the way that things
were going to have to go and that eventually I
kind of had the hope that it would all work
out but I saw differently about a year and I
started to see differently after I spent a year in
Boston because I saw that man you know um it
would kill me inside he would like kill my soul
inside if I didn't pursue my ambitions for real and
I had this really critical decision point right to say
to myself [ __ ] I can stay in the
system and hope the system takes care of it for
me but I know that it probably won't I know
that probably all the system will do is lead to
mediocrity and more of the same and that's not what
I want I couldn't live myself with that if I
did that so um so I had to just embark
out into the wilderness on my own to see how
I can make my ambitions real and that's when doing
and that led to me starting my first business very
interesting that I have a client now that I'm coaching
and he's also a game designer and he's facing a
very similar problem to me and the issue with him
is that he's a very ambitious and really hard-working very
creative guy and I can see from coaching this guy
now for over a year I can see that this
guy has so much potential if we just took him
and we gave him a company gave him his own
studio gave him his own team this guy would produce
a project that would you know really advance the industry
that he's working in because he's just you know he's
got that in him you can just tell from people
and they got that in them this guy has it
but the problem is is that he's stuck in the
system he's working within a studio system and there he
has to deal with the you know the corporate higher-ups
and all the finance people the business people and yadda
yadda yadda he has a lot of red tape it
has to work through and that red tape is suffocating
him and it's not letting his greatest talents and abilities
come forth even though he's still doing a good job
there and you know he rather enjoys working there to
an extent um but to me I you know I
listen to him and I just think to myself man
what could this guy accomplish if he just had the
tools and the know-how and he really went out there
on his own and kind of uh went all-in I
call that going all-in when you just decide to say
you know what [ __ ] it [ __ ]
the traditional system I'm going to go carve my own
path in life and yes that's dangerous yes that's risky
but that's where the coolest [ __ ] happens that's
where you can really make a difference in the world
that's where you can earn your greatness because there you
have to be a true leader and you can't rely
on these systems anymore and that's scary to do that'll
scare the [ __ ] out of you if you
really consider doing that in your life but here's what
I told them I told them this if you have
more ambition and a larger vision than everyone around you
then that means you have to be the leader the
leader in a very kind of like deep and it
fascinating sense when you study leadership what you discover is
that leadership is not just someone who stands up and
assumes power or takes power or someone who has the
most money and therefore becomes the leader of the of
the tribe or the company or the country it kind
of seems like that might be the way it works
but actually it doesn't what happens is that leadership is
driven by evolutionary forces and the person with the greatest
vision and with the most ambition that's the person who
naturally rises to the top and becomes the leader because
that's the person that others can rally around they can
rally around his vision so if you're in a job
right now or in a career right now where you
honestly feel that you have a greater vision for the
company or for the industry or for the project then
your boss does or then you're you know Board of
Trustees does then that's a sign from the universe that
you've got that muse inside of you've got a gift
to share with the world and what I want to
tell you is that it's your responsibility to honor that
because not everyone has this some people listening to this
to this episode this might not apply to them at
all they might not have this ambition I'm specifically talking
to people who do have this ambition or a semblance
of it right usually it starts off as just a
little like intuition a little hunch little clue a little
bit of passion that you have it not might be
well formed and you might not have any idea how
to actually make it real but something is there something
is pushing you forward and if you don't realize that
then a part of you is going to die and
your whole life is going to be much less than
it should be you're not really gonna live a fulfilling
life if you do that so he who has the
greatest vision is the leader and if that is you
then you must position yourself as the leader now this
doesn't mean that you go depose your boss or start
a fight with your board of trustees or whatever sometimes
it means that you have to leave the organization that
you're in what I felt like when I was in
Boston is that I felt like I was a small
fish in a small pond but that I was destined
to grow into a huge whale of a fish that
would be bigger than the pond so what that meant
for me is that [ __ ] I mean yes
right now I can still swim in this little pond
because I'm still a little like a fish I don't
have that much experience yet but I can already see
that I'm growing fast like really fast because I'm ambitious
so that means I got to jump into a much
bigger pond ideal I gotta like go into unlimited boundless
ocean of opportunities where I am completely at the helm
directing myself and that's what I ended up doing and
it's paid off enormous Lee for me in ways that
I couldn't have even even anticipated back at a time
right but that was a very scary thing to do
not easy and it was risky and who knows maybe
I just got lucky and things worked out for me
in a sense I did have some good luck but
also I like to think that I did apply principles
and I did apply hard work to the problem you
know and I did work for it so there's kind
of an element of both of those in there but
either way you're you are taken risk when you do
that because you're going into uncharted waters and who knows
what lurks in those uncharted waters maybe there's a Leviathan
there that will gobble you up but if you are
this type of ambitious person what I'll tell you is
that you need to stop waiting for permission you need
to stop with the false modesty you know that false
modesty where you say to yourself oh well maybe my
ideas aren't so good after all oh well maybe I
need to like wait a little bit more time bide
my time maybe my boss does know more than me
maybe I should just take a backseat to him that
sort of thing you have to stop that you have
to honor your news you don't need to bide and
do more time in the corporate system that's not what
you need what you need is you need to go
off on your own and release yourself from all the
red tape so that you could do it your way
the way you envision it not the way the status
quo the entrenched system envisions it because if you're working
within that system you're going to be handicapped for your
entire career and that's going to be frustrating and gnawing
at you for your entire career because you know that
if only people did it your way then the world
would really change then the industry would really change then
something beautiful would really materialize well if that's the case
go fight for that you have to fight for it
it's not going to happen spontaneously it's not going to
come easy it's going to come with a real fight
a real battle and that's why you have to steel
yourself and take on the challenge of being the warrior
be the warrior in life make that choice that's a
choice you make that's not something that just kind of
spontaneously happens or falls on your lap you have to
make that choice if you have gifts inside of you
some talent some vision some higher ideal that you could
be fighting for and you don't share that with the
world not only are you robbing yourself but you're robbing
the whole world of those gifts you have to do
that you have to fight for that so stop holding
yourself back stop playing small and start thinking real hard
about the highest leverage thing you can do it I'm
going to tell you what that is right now the
highest leverage that a person like you can the highest
leverage action that a person like you can take is
to position yourself to share your gifts now that's an
abstract thing I'm telling you to do position yourself to
share your gifts sounds like well Leo that sounds nice
but how do I do that yes you got to
go and figure out how to do that for every
one of you it's going to be different because your
gifts are different and because your position in life is
already different so you're starting from place and you get
from A to Z and how you're going to get
there who knows you can't even predict it let alone
me try to predict it for you but what you
need to do is you need to like sear this
idea into your mind right this high-level abstract idea that
what I should be doing every single day of my
life until it's complete is finding a way to position
myself so I can share my gifts so that there's
no more red tape around me so I'm totally liberated
to do what I need to do to let this
news come forth that should be your number one priority
in life that should be the thing that you're spending
all your time thinking about when you're waking up in
the morning you should be thinking about it when you're
brushing your teeth you should be thinking about it when
you're in the shower you should be thinking about it
when you're on the toilet you should be thinking about
it when you're eating your lunch you should be thinking
about it when you're doing some menial job for your
boss you should be thinking about it when you're having
dinner think about it when you're watching television be thinking
about it when you're going to bed think about it
it's this thinking process that generates new ideas and that's
exactly what you need is you need some powerful new
ideas about how you could position yourself maybe for you
this means going to start your own business maybe for
you this means selling your house and moving to a
third world country and then working from there maybe for
you this means telling your boss to go [ __
] himself maybe for you this means some you know
some other alternative I don't know there's many alternatives depends
on what kind of gifts you got to share for
me what it meant is that I have to go
off and start my own business just so that I
can raise the money that I need to then start
the next business which will be the one that's actually
right for me so my first business wasn't designed to
be the one it was designed to be a stepping
stone to the one and that's exactly how I used
it although it was a lot more difficult in practice
than I make it sound here because what happens I
took that first stepping stone and it's really hard to
say no to a successful business once you've already got
it which is something that I had to wean myself
off of so I can go on to the next
thing right because as they say the enemy of the
great is the good and that's what was happening here
but I did say no and eventually I went off
and I started actualized already and that was for me
where all of this was leading to but when I
first started this journey I had no idea I didn't
even know about personal development when I started my first
business and I had no idea that eventually that would
lead me to starting actualized I don't know idea and
that's part of the beauty of life and the beauty
of taking on this journey is that you get to
discover even cooler things that you can imagine right now
because once you move to the next stepping-stone and the
next one your horizon expands and all of a sudden
you can see even cooler goals and even cooler possibilities
for yourself so what I want you to do right
now is I want you to imagine the payoff if
what you do is you position yourself to share your
greatest gifts what would the payoff of that be in
your life think about that can you picture that ten
years from now twenty years what's going to be the
payoff and here's key question that I want to give
you and by the way this thing that I'm asking
you to think about about the payoff this is something
you should be thinking about constantly not just once while
watching this video but like constantly you need to be
like psyching yourself up in this you need to be
stewing and marinating the juices of this some amazing this
vision for the for your future you got to be
doing this and here's a key question that you should
probably spend some time really thinking deep on what could
I accomplish if I went all out what could I
accomplish if I went all out because I can pretty
much guarantee that right now you're not going all out
what if that ambition you had one of those greatest
gifts that you had what if you shared them fully
with the world what would happen then what if you
expanded yourself what if you decided to transform yourself transform
your entire identity in the direction of this one cause
of this one goal or purpose this one ambition that
you have if you became the vehicle for that and
you pushed it all the way through to its fullest
possibility what would happen would that lead to a cool
life would you rather be living that kind of life
or the kind of life you're living now or you're
settling and you're letting the system guide you remember that
the system is not designed to guide you greatness the
system is designed for the average unambitious human being who's
just stumbling his way through life in a herd of
sheep being one of those sheep and that whole herd
is going to walk off a cliff in the very
end that's what the average person is doing that's what
the system is designed for the system is not yet
designed for the higher virtues of life the system is
not designed to promote beauty and truth and excellence and
elegance and love and artistry the system is not designed
for this so if you want to tap into that
and that's the most beautiful thing you can tap into
in life I think is that those higher virtues you
have to do that on your own you have to
chart your own course you can't follow someone else you
can't rely on anyone elses course right that has to
be self driven self-motivated and if you're one of those
rare individuals that has an inkling of that a seed
of it within you then I'm really excited about helping
you to unleash that out into the world that's really
the whole point of actualized org all these different topics
that I cover from relationships to how to be happier
how to overcome your depression really for me all of
it is about this and the whole point of building
up a powerful psychology and a powerful personal life is
not so that you enjoy a cushy life I don't
care about you enjoying a cushy life what I care
about you doing is going out there and finding that
thing that you're going to fight for making you a
warrior and your personal life should only be as good
as it needs to be to empower your fighting abilities
in this cause that's what I'm interested in and I
think that the most important element to all of that
is life purpose if you don't articulate very clearly what
your life purpose is and what exactly you're shooting for
and you don't align that with your top values and
your top gifts if you don't even know what your
top gifts are then you've gotten really no chance no
chance of succeeding here it's going to be very difficult
even after you identify your life purpose but until you
do you've really got no chance you're just stumbling around
in the dark and so much of your ambitions are
going to be leaked out into empty space it's going
to just going to radiate like heat and you're never
going to be able to get it back again and
that's a frustrating feeling so that's why I worked really
really hard on this life purpose course the ultimate life
purpose course I just released it I'm real excited about
it because I think there's so much possibility there if
I can find those people out there that have that
seed of ambition in them and then get them to
realize all these amazing psychological principles very deep and profound
principles that if you start to apply those to that
seed what it is it's like taking an acorn planting
it and then watering it every single day and you
water it and water it and water and use you
soak it in these up juicy principles and what happens
is that it starts to grow you see it growing
and at first it's just like a little seedling and
then a little sapling and then it grows bigger and
bigger over here and then all of a sudden you
know before you know in a couple of years in
five years and ten years it's just giant magnificent oak
tree and people come up to it and they look
around and they see it's a this is amazing it's
this huge oak tree where did it come from well
it all came from that seed and it came from
this watering process that you apply to it every single
day very methodically um and that's what I'm excited to
do in my own life that's what I'm currently doing
in my own life and I'm really excited to share
that process with you because I I know that once
you once you get a taste of that you see
how amazing life becomes when you are growing this oak
tree you are that oak tree right if life is
miserable or frustrating for you it's because what you are
is you're an oak tree but you're planted inside this
little pot and you never receive any water or any
sunlight and so what you are is you're like this
little wilted stunted little one-foot oak tree that should be
a 30 or a 50 foot oak tree so I
think it all starts with life purpose and that's why
this ultimate life purpose course was really designed to do
is designed to help you to figure out what your
greatest gifts are what your greatest values are what your
greatest strengths are as a human being what you actually
want out of life because you got to be very
clear on all that but then what I talk about
is also very practically okay how do we take all
those things which are very abstract and ethereal and start
to actually get you taking action on them so that
you could go out there and carve your own path
in life and that's not just about techniques a lot
of that is about instilling you with mindsets that can
make you self-sufficient and ground it right because when you're
off in the woods hacking through the dark woods with
a machete what you're going to discover is that there's
no one there covering your back you got to do
it all yourself and when you're doubting yourself or you're
feeling afraid or you know you think it's not possible
or maybe you think you've lost your way that's when
you need these principles kicking in that's what you need
that self-sufficiency that backbone which is what I help you
to develop in this course right and that backbone is
grounded in timeless classic psychological principles many of which are
counterintuitive and many of which we were never ever taught
not in school not by our parents not by our
employers because by and large again the system all of
that is the system the system is not designed to
grow you into this giant oak tree the system is
designed to grow little saplings many many many of them
millions and billions little saplings but not to get that
sapling to grow into its full potential that takes work
from you that takes a concerted effort a battle from
you a choice to go on that journey because if
you don't make that choice you're never going to go
all right that's it if you're just a course go
ahead check it out there's gonna be links down below
or at the end of this video so you can
find it on actualize that org um what I want
to leave you with is just again this idea that
if you're ambitious you owe it to yourself to fight
for that ambition to be unleashed see you soon all
