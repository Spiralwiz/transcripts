[Music] what is consciousness now of course i've talked a
lot about the theory of consciousness and what it is
and explained it to you many times in the past
but that's not what we're going to do here today
today i want to instead of giving you more theory
and more stories and explanation i want to actually guide
you through some examples and point you directly to consciousness
so this will be a hands-on exercise and while we're
doing these various exercises here you will hopefully be able
to grasp a little bit of it start to feel
it for yourself and also i will reveal some pretty
amazing properties of consciousness as we go so let's get
into that so let's begin by just becoming aware or
conscious that you are conscious right now so can you
notice that difference between when you started this recording of
course you were conscious when you started it before i
even started talking but when i told you that you're
conscious right now what i did is i triggered you
to self-reflect in a sense and to become conscious of
the fact that you're conscious and just by telling you
that that already put you a little bit more in
touch with consciousness because usually you're taking consciousness for granted
because your consciousness is focused on other things like the
things that i'm telling you some idea or some physical
object out in the world but right now just become
conscious of the fact that you're conscious and wonder what
is that what is that consciousness what is that it
should feel mysterious it should feel nebulous it should feel
amorphous it should feel like you can't exactly say what
consciousness is but it's obvious to you that you're conscious
right obviously so the mistake that people make here when
the question of what is consciousness comes up is that
they start to look elsewhere for consciousness they start to
look to science they start to look to religion they
look to theory they start to speculate in their mind
about what consciousness might be they have images in their
mind of consciousness being generated by neurons or by atoms
or by whatever some way to explain consciousness away and
that all of that takes you away from consciousness that's
a trap that you want to make sure you avoid
and even when you bring to mind non-dual teachings and
maybe even things that i've said in the past about
consciousness that too is a trap that's the tricky nature
of consciousness is that as soon as you start to
encapsulate consciousness in some sort of scheme or model or
system or framework you're already starting to lose it so
don't look to science to tell you what consciousness is
because you're conscious the only one who can tell you
what consciousness is is yourself science cannot be conscious for
you i cannot be conscious for you only you can
be conscious for you that's the amazing thing about consciousness
but also what you should notice here is that there's
no need to speculate about what consciousness is going off
into theories you don't need to speculate about consciousness because
you're conscious all you need to do is be conscious
focus your attention on the consciousness the speculation actually takes
you away from that you need to develop a sort
of a comfortableness with the mystery of consciousness it's a
mysterious thing rather than trying to cover over the mystery
and skip over it and come up with some sort
of speculation to explain it away just bask in the
unknowingness of what consciousness is be comfortable with that just
sit there and be comfortable with that and the longer
you can do that the better that is the essence
of meditation and ultimately the only way you're going to
understand what consciousness is is by doing this for very
long steady periods of time and the longer you do
it the more profound this empty experience will become until
eventually you might have some breakthroughs all right so it's
not just that you are conscious it's more than that
you are consciousness and consciousness is the only thing that
exists notice that notice that there's nothing outside of consciousness
you have never experienced anything in your life outside of
consciousness everything you've ever experienced was consciousness anything you think
or claim isn't consciousness is consciousness just notice that try
to invalidate what i'm saying don't just believe me see
don't believe me oh yeah leo said that consciousness is
all there is and that's it and then you believe
that no no no that's a mistake you need to
validate whether what i'm saying is true you can sit
there for five hours and go through examples go into
the past and think about stuff that has happened to
you in your life and try to come up with
with an example of something that wasn't consciousness and what
you'll notice of course is that you can't find such
an example and anything you think of which you might
think of oh i found one leo i found one
look a little bit deeper and you'll realize oh wait
a minute of course that was also consciousness so this
is something that you should practice for the rest of
your life this practice see nothing can exist unless it
is held in your consciousness this is the key mistake
that people make they think that stuff like atoms or
objects or people can exist outside of consciousness that math
or science or religion or space or time or history
or even the universe can exist outside of consciousness it
can't everything is held and conceived within consciousness even the
hard stuff even the physical stuff even the quote-unquote objective
stuff the infi the entire universe is just an infinite
field of consciousness that's all it is and you are
this field for example think of a refrigerator think of
your refrigerator it seems that a refrigerator exists but this
refrigerator is actually being held within your consciousness it seems
like the refrigerator conventionally speaking is made of parts plastic
and metal molecules atoms energy no the refrigerator is made
out of consciousness universal consciousness the field of universal consciousness
is imagining a refrigerator that's literally what's happening right now
as we're talking about this refrigerator now you might say
okay leo yeah i mean that i might be able
to see how that's true when i'm just thinking about
my refrigerator but what about the actual refrigerator like if
i go to my kitchen and i put my hand
on the refrigerator door to pull it open it's made
of steel or whatever that what about that are you
i mean that's not consciousness of course it is what
is that refrigerator actually made out of it's made out
of the perceptions and feelings which you call a refrigerator
colors sounds smells feelings when you put your hand on
the refrigerator might feel cold the steel might feel cold
it has a certain color it makes a certain hum
noise it has a certain smell coming out of it
when you open the door what is all this this
is figments of consciousness coming together in a very sophisticated
highly intelligent highly ordered way to create the appearance of
a refrigerator you might say well what about the actual
refrigerator underneath the appearances what what actual refrigerator underneath the
appearances where have you ever experienced anything underneath appearances why
do you assume there is anything underneath appearances why would
such an inefficient mechanism be necessary for the universe why
would the universe have two layers of reality why would
it have the appearance layer and then the whatever is
underneath layer that you imagine why does it need the
second layer why can't it just be one layer i
mean why would it waste its energy creating these different
layers for what purpose now you say ah leo but
where would these appearances come from if they weren't coming
from something sourcing them from behind the scenes from underneath
you see we need that second layer to explain the
first layer but what explains the existence of the second
layer if the first layer requires a second layer why
are you stopping at the second layer why isn't there
a third layer and then of course you need a
fourth layer using your logic to explain the second and
you need uh i mean you need a third to
explain the second you need a fourth to explain the
third and so on and so on to infinity and
so you see the absurdity of this whole notion you're
not solving anything you think that you're solving some sort
of metaphysical problem of explaining away appearances by postulating hidden
layers beneath the first layer but actually all you're doing
is you're just fooling yourself you're losing yourself inside your
own mind and all of those layers that you imagine
are precisely that imagination there are no other layers all
of those layers if you take a close look are
just imaginary it's all one layer so within the layer
of appearances there are additional pseudo layers that you imagine
that you think are underneath the first layer but really
they're just couched within the first layer there is no
refrigerator outside of consciousness the actual physical refrigerator in your
kitchen is actually held within your consciousness that's what it
means for a thing to exist see you thought your
whole life you've been told by others who didn't know
any better that to exist means for there to be
something on a deeper layer on a secondary layer beneath
the layer of appearances and it's only if something exists
at that second layer then it exists otherwise if it
only exists at the first layer then it doesn't exist
it's sort of an illusion but when you realize there
is no deeper layer there's only one layer to reality
uh the layer of appearances that that literally is what
existence is to appear is to exist is to be
conscious and that's it it's actually very simple you're making
it too complicated so i'm asking you to change your
paradigm of how you think reality works you have always
thought that reality is this thing that has existed long
before you and will continue to exist long after you
die and that you are inside of this reality and
that you are one of these objects this reality is
filled with a bunch of physical objects and that you
are one of these physical objects and then you have
appearances you have perceptions of various kinds of physical objects
which are somehow coming to you so one object is
somehow perceiving another object none of this is actually happening
this is all an illusion it's a story that you've
invented to try to explain away consciousness there is only
consciousness consciousness is a very personal thing you're personally conscious
the universe the nature of the universe is such that
the universe is self-aware see you when you buy into
science and materialism you tend to believe that the universe
isn't inherently self-aware you as a biological creature are one
thing that happened to evolve within the universe that became
self-aware but the universe wasn't self-aware until living beings showed
up that's not true the universe was always self-aware the
universe is consciousness it was always consciousness and it will
always be consciousness the only reason you are self-aware is
not through some good fortune and luck to have been
born as a living being the reason you're aware is
because the only thing that exists is self-awareness the entire
universe is self-aware therefore you by necessity are self-aware nothing
can exist which is not aware to some degree now
granted there are many degrees of awareness some things are
not very self-aware others are more self-aware most humans in
fact aren't that self-aware [Music] but but hey that's the
nature of awareness is that awareness comes in degrees there
are degrees of awareness but awareness is not some secondary
feature of the universe awareness is the bedrock of the
universe this is very different from what you've been taught
in school by science and by mainstream culture which doesn't
think that awareness is primary it it thinks that it's
secondary well it's just a different paradigm you have to
learn to think from this new paradigm that i'm trying
to show you here how can you validate that what
i'm saying is true rather than just believing it well
sit here and actually experience life have you ever experienced
unawareness you might say yes leo i have when i'm
asleep deep asleep i'm experiencing unawareness but actually you're aware
of that right now see it's a very tricky tricky
mechanism here it's not so simple something very tricky is
going on here notice that the universe is a tricky
beast it's not straightforward it's a trickster it's playing with
you you're inside of a giant mind that's what the
universe is so when we're talking about a physical object
like a refrigerator just like try it's so it's so
sicky try to actually become conscious of the fact that
a refrigerator is being held within consciousness that's what a
refrigerator is that's what it's always been you've just misunderstood
it as something material here's the trick is that materiality
itself is something that consciousness is holding or imagining you
see so when you say no leo that refrigerator it's
not imaginary it's it's tangible it's real it's solid yeah
that is what consciousness is holding when you do that
that's how consciousness creates the illusion of materiality it literally
fools itself into thinking that a refrigerator is material and
then that becomes what's true for you you're constructing that
illusion on the fly so consciousness can hold something as
immaterial or it can hold something as material for example
you could you know consciousness right now so just try
to experience this hold a unicorn in your consciousness right
now imagine a unicorn okay now what is that obviously
consciousness is holding that form now it's sort of a
loosey-goosey form because it's just a thought it's just an
idea in your mind it's a little faded image in
your mind of a unicorn it's not very tangible it's
not very concrete it's not as lifelike as an actual
horse in the real world so you hold it as
less real as inferior and so forth but now imagine
if you held that unicorn so strongly in consciousness that
it literally became real that's what the horse is now
of course the mistake people here make is they say
oh leo but but then how can i make a
unicorn into a real horse how do i actually materialize
this unicorn well i'm not saying that you have that
capacity you see maybe that's a capacity that you haven't
developed maybe that's a capacity that you would need some
sort of new technology to actually be able to to
actualize that that that capacity but regardless of that that
refrigerator or that horse that you consider is real it's
being held by your consciousness whether you want to admit
it or not i mean where else is it occurring
but in your consciousness see the nature of the universe
is such that the universe can conceive of a rock
an atom a tree a dog a computer salt a
nuclear explosion a cartoon pain pleasure cancer a heart attack
golf chess a female a toilet the english language the
sun time space energy science religion a conspiracy theory a
cheeseburger torture proof mathematics a refrigerator and anything else there
are no limits to what consciousness can hold and all
of these things i'm not just saying that the universe
can think about these things the universe can hold these
things in a more strong way than just thinking about
them of course we acknowledge that the human mind can
hold these different things and think about them but we're
going one step deeper here beyond the human mind what
we're talking about is the universal field of consciousness which
is more powerful than the individual human mind the individual
human mind is a subset sort of like a little
bubble within the larger field of universal consciousness that larger
field can literally imagine for example a nuclear explosion and
that nuclear explosion is what is manifested and what kills
many many people it's not just fake or a fantasy
it'll actually kill people we're talking about a mental universe
with different degrees and layers of mentality to it at
first blush this seems kind of crazy and wacky it
seems like wait a minute leo why would the universe
be this way that's so weird it seems unreal it
seems magical it seems airy fairy and kind of new-agey
to conceive the universe in this way it seems like
it violates occam's razor because you know rockham's razor says
the simplest explanation of the universe is probably the right
one so just go with the simplest so isn't it
the simplest to imagine a universe in which a nuclear
explosion isn't some imaginary thing it's some real thing it's
physical it's tangible no actually that violates outcomes razor the
mental universe that i'm presenting to the universe as an
infinite mind this is actually the simplest construction of the
universe it's the most elegant solution to the problem of
reality because in the scientific materialistic model you need to
have multiple layers you need to have the layer of
appearances then you need to have layers underneath and then
those layers themselves need further layers to justify them and
then them and then them they have an infinite regress
problem you have to deal with all these problems you
have to deal with the problem of how uh matter
and molecules and brains can generate consciousness all of these
in solvable problems these problems are not just insolvable in
practice they're insolvable even in theory even the best scientists
and philosophers for the last 2000 years have been trying
to come up with even just theoretical solutions to these
problems like the mind body problem and they have not
been able to formulate one that should maybe tell you
that you're thinking about the universe in a very uh
wrong way think about how much more elegant it is
when the universe is nothing but pure consciousness once you
make this paradigm shift it's actually so much simpler everything
makes so much more sense you walk outside you you
hear birds chirping and you realize oh yeah of course
that's just consciousness chirping at itself a car drives by
you and you look at the car and you see
of course yeah the car is just consciousness of course
just conscious why wouldn't the universe be an unlimited infinite
mind what's preventing it from being that way you say
well but but but leo how could it be that
way it's impossible but how could it be physical why
do you assume that physical matter existing in some vacuum
is somehow more plausible it's not any more plausible if
you can even generate one atom from nothing not to
mention the entire big bang as science says if you
can generate even one atom from nothing can you see
that that is as impossible and as outrageous and as
magical as generating a universe that is purely infinite mind
can you see that it doesn't matter to the universe
which way that it is because the universe has no
limits what would limit it who is there outside the
universe to tell the universe what it can and can't
do that's the magic of being the universe when you
are the entire universe and when i say universe here
i'm not saying it in the scientific sense i'm saying
it in the more existential more metaphysical sense of universe
with a capital u which includes any multiverses that might
be outside of our little universe that we conceive of
as the scientific universe so i'm when i say universe
i'm including any possible multiverses or any other kind of
things that are outside of our universe to infinity every
possible layer all at once so when you get all
of that as a single thing when you realize that
we might also call that reality you realize that this
thing is singular it must be singular because we've included
every other thing outside of it inside of it so
it's singular and if it's singular there can't be anything
outside of it to limit it or to prevent it
from being however it wants so it's going to be
however it wants to be now this seems kind of
crazy and outlandish and it seems impossible because we're so
used to being limited by physical laws and rules we
tend to think of like well but the universe just
is the way it is the universe can't choose the
way it's going to be that's impossible it has to
be the way that it is like it has to
be made out of physical stuff why do you assume
that why can't the universe choose the way it's going
to be open your mind to such a possibility we
usually don't think of the universe as a mind and
because of this we tend to artificially lower our expectations
of what the universe is capable of we don't think
of the universe for example as being able to make
choices we think of choices being something that higher order
biological beings like humans can do within the universe but
the universe itself can't make a choice that's crazy that's
some sort of spiritualism leo you're anthropomorphizing the universe this
is the sort of the ant anthropomorphic fallacy that many
religious people make is they tend to think of you
know inanimate objects as having human qualities no you got
it backwards human qualities are aspects of the larger universe
where did the human qualities come from they came from
the universe what i want you to just become conscious
of right now is that you sitting there right now
being conscious of the things that i'm saying you sitting
there hearing my words seeing colors around you in the
room that you're sitting in making sense of the things
that i'm saying these ideas that are flashing through your
mind various images and feelings and so forth that's the
universe you are the universe you are not a human
inside the universe doing human stuff that the universe is
not capable of doing you are the universe imagining being
a human and constructing humanness by holding that and all
of its constituent components and elements in a cohesive manner
such that you could be human what we call human
you could just as easily imagine yourself being a kangaroo
and you would become a kangaroo or an alien and
you would become an alien or a robot and you
would become a robot or a coffee table and you
would become a coffee table or a basketball and you
would become a basketball or a video game and you
would become a video game what it means to be
human is that the universe is limiting all of the
things that it could possibly imagine itself being to that
stuff that you experience as what we conventionally call being
human pain and love and fear and sadness and frustration
and difficulty and you know pleasure and and all the
stuff that's associated with being human see if you didn't
experience any of that you could become a coffee table
for example if you were a coffee table just try
to maybe imagine what it's like to be a coffee
table if you were the universe being a coffee table
then you wouldn't have these conventional human emotions you wouldn't
have pain and pleasure you wouldn't get angry or sad
you wouldn't have dreams and goals you wouldn't love other
things you wouldn't think you wouldn't do philosophy you wouldn't
watch youtube videos you would just sit there and be
a coffee table it's a much simpler simpler existence a
lot less problems you wouldn't fear death you wouldn't even
think about how you were born or where you came
from you would just be a coffee table just a
dumb coffee table so i want you to expand your
possibility space and give the universe some more credit see
you've been you've been very arrogant your whole life us
humans we're very arrogant creatures we like to think of
ourselves as the center of the universe as somehow superior
to the universe as like the most advanced things in
the universe this is a deep delusion because we take
credit for those aspects of the universe that are actually
generating us as humans we take credit for consciousness we
take ownership of awareness we take ownership of perception and
colors and feelings and emotions and we say this is
all our stuff and when we think and we do
rationality and logic and intelligence when we do mathematics and
science we say that's us we're doing it the universe
isn't doing science humans invented science humans are doing science
humans are smart the universe is stupid humans can make
choices the universe can't humans can have feelings the universe
can't humans can have consciousness the universe can't how [
__ ] arrogant is that recognize who owns you the
universe owns you you don't own the universe the universe
created you that means the universe is smarter than you
this is the core delusion of science and materialism and
logic and rationality and atheism is that people who subscribe
to this worldview fundamentally do not want to admit that
the universe could be more intelligent than them they've misappropriated
their ego has misappropriated and usurped the intelligence of the
universe and confused it in its arrogance for human intelligence
all human intelligence is a tiny figment fragment of universal
intelligence anything a human can do the universe can do
better because a human is a part of the universe
how do you know that what i'm telling you is
true you don't believe me this is not a philosophy
this is not an ideology this is not something you
speculate about like oh yeah maybe the universe is intelligent
no no no what i want you to do is
actually to recognize that you are the universe when you
connect the dots and you realize wait a minute he's
right i am the universe this is the universe if
i can feel pain that means the universe is literally
feeling pain right now if i can get angry that
means the universe is getting angry any quality that i
have the universe has if i'm horny the universe is
horny see this is not how materialism tells us to
think about reality materialism creates a separation between the universe
and us humans it puts us human into this little
bubble of sensations and feelings and emotions and and colors
and sounds and so forth locks us in this little
bubble and says that little bubble that's all [ __
] and then there's objective reality over here the universe
and all of the intelligent conscious stuff is happening in
this bubble let's forget about that we don't know how
to deal with that stuff and let's just worry about
the objective hard stuff the the matter of the universe
the energy in the matter the scientific stuff and that
stuff it has no intelligence it has no feeling it
has no capacity for consciousness it's just completely dumb substance
this is madness this is literally insanity this world view
you are denying the universe it's intelligence it's feeling it's
sentience it's very spirit you are literally robbing the universe
of its spirit thinking that you're being objective and of
course the irony is that it's the universe that is
doing that it's not you who's creating this materialist delusion
the universe is the universe is imagining itself being a
materialist a rationalist an atheist a reductionist a scientist the
universe is imagining that it is not imagining the universe
is imagining that it's not intelligent the universe is imagining
that it's not conscious while holding that unconsciousness within its
consciousness it's a trick and the reason it's a trick
is because that's the nature of consciousness it's it's mental
and because it's mental it can be tricky it can
play tricks on itself it's very squirrely consciousness in the
universe has this squirrely uh aspect or property to it
it doesn't have to be it can be straightforward like
a coffee table is straightforward but us as humans were
very very squirrely we get lost in our own fantasies
and uh because we have you know we have these
big minds that's that's one of the that's one of
the trade-offs with having a big mind is that there's
a lot of rope there to hang yourself with a
table coffee table can't dilute itself into thinking that it's
something other than what it is a human can so
i want you to expand and take all the limits
that you've ascribed to the universe i want to take
take every single limit off the universe so when you
entered this episode you might have believed tacitly at least
that for example the universe cannot design a video game
now i want you to change that now i want
you to realize the universe can design a video game
in fact every video game you've ever played or enjoyed
was designed by the universe now you told yourself that
it was designed by some human actually the universe designed
the video game by first designing the human who's going
to then design the video game you see how it
works you've also believed your entire life until this episode
perhaps that the universe could not feel depressed angry scared
lonely horny tired confused insecure excited embarrassed pain suffering pleasure
ecstasy you thought these were all fluffy human emotions now
you're taking all the limits off the universe and you're
realizing oh of course the universe can experience all these
it's experiencing them through me what does it feel like
when the universe is angry it feels like what it's
like when you're angry what does it feel like to
for the universe to be horny you know what it's
like to be horny the universe can cry what does
it feel like to cry the universe can have an
orgasm see you thought before this episode you thought humans
have orgasms animals have orgasms perhaps but not the universe
now you realize the universe has an orgasm when you
have an orgasm before this episode you came in here
thinking that the universe can't be logical the universe can't
do mathematics now you might have thought that the universe
is run by mathematics that's its own problem it's actually
not but uh that's a projection of your own mind
but anyways uh no what i'm saying here is that
the universe itself can be logical the universe can do
logic better than any human because the universe is simultaneously
doing the logic of every human that has ever lived
and all logics that exist in higher minds alien minds
and so on that we haven't even discovered yet the
universe can do all of that see the whole model
of science is backwards science thinks that like evolution is
building more and more advanced biological creatures who are able
to do more and more complex stuff within the universe
that ordinary matter and the ordinary universe before we evolved
couldn't do actually it's completely the opposite it's that the
infinite universe that existed could do absolutely anything it had
no limits whatsoever it could be logical it could feel
emotions it could design video games it can engineer cars
it can build rocket ships it can fly to the
moon it can do whatever it wants and then it
artificially limits itself in order to be a human living
on the savannah in africa somewhere the universe can engineer
a car better than any human can the universe can
believe in conspiracy theories the universe can go and gamble
in las vegas and lose all its money the universe
can go dancing and have a ball at the nightclub
and get drunk the universe can sit there and appreciate
music in fact if you really want to be able
to appreciate music truly to appreciate and to hear music
for the first time in your life that will happen
the day that you realize that you are the universe
appreciating the music that the universe is creating so when
you're listening to music the music that is playing is
the universe creating that music and you listening to it
and appreciating it and seeing the beauty in it vibing
with it so to speak that's the universe appreciating its
own creation the universe can write poetry see you thought
that no only humans can write poetry no the universe
can write poetry the universe can be a nazi the
universe can send people it doesn't like to concentration camps
and gas chambers universe can do that the universe can
do science on itself the universe can think about itself
the universe can even watch a youtube video about self-actualization
talking about and explaining what the universe is and of
course the universe can love this is perhaps the greatest
mistake of science and rationalism is consigning love into the
category of airy fairy human emotions of no significance or
import in the existential from the existential perspective you couldn't
be more wrong see what happens when you flip your
paradigm from the materialist paradigm to the consciousness paradigm that
i'm talking about now the paradigm in which you realize
that the universe is a mind not a physical object
or some clockwork machine but a mind in this paradigm
one of the key differences is that a mind is
capable of love unlike a clockwork machine so when we
talk about love and you're looking at love and thinking
about love from the clockwork paradigm it makes no sense
love makes no sense and you are forever doomed to
be disconnected from love in your clockwork paradigm and basically
from the clockwork paradigm you treat all of life like
a clockwork and you behave like a robot without any
soul spirit or heart and that's no way to live
that's not a satisfying way to live living this mechanical
robotic existence that you do because really what you've always
wanted from the from your life and from the universe
is love soul spirit heart the problem is that the
paradigm that you were indoctrinated with by your culture when
you were raised that you got deceived by and didn't
know how to find your way out of that this
this this paradigm has robbed you of your capacity to
love and to experience soul and spirit and that fundamentally
is why you have all the emotional problems that you
do this is why you're angry this is why you're
frustrated this is why you're lonely this is why you're
depressed this is why you're suicidal this is why you're
desperate and horny for sex this is why your any
other negative emotion because you're lacking the love so one
of the most important things you can do is switch
your paradigms such that now love even though you don't
really know how to master love yet at least now
there's a possibility see now when you realize the universe
is a mind love becomes not just a secondary emotion
of biological creatures love is more fundamental now at least
that possibility exists you still haven't actualized it you still
don't really understand what i'm talking about when i'm talking
about love but at least there's a little bit more
open mindedness within you and that creates space which in
the future through practices of various kinds that i talk
about you will be able to actualize and you will
be able to to fully realize that love is not
just something the mind is capable of love is actually
the very substance of mind and soul purpose but that's
a topic beyond the scope of this lesson now here's
an exercise we have some more exercises to do to
really get you to understand what i'm talking about i
really want to blow your mind open blow all of
the limitations that you've placed upon consciousness blow them all
away i really want you to start to see the
universe as an infinite thing as an infinite mind so
do this exercise with me i want you to imagine
the english language imagine every piece of the english language
as you personally know it as this human every word
every meaning every implicit connotation every bit of grammar every
possible sentence you've ever spoken or will ever speak in
your life imagine this just in your mind's eye but
this is not truly the fullness of what english is
this is just your limited comprehension comprehension of english no
matter how good you are with english your your knowledge
of english is still very very minuscule now let's expand
upon that i want you to add to what you've
just imagined imagine also the entire domain of english all
the stuff you're missing imagine every possible word in the
english language all the dictionaries that have ever existed imagine
every possible sentence that could be written in english whether
short or small imagine every book that could be written
every research paper every conversation that could be had every
possible communication in the english language every possible multiple meaning
that any word could have all the english words that
existed in the past that we no longer use and
all that will exist in the future forever in perpetuity
to infinity every possibility of english that could ever possibly
occur imagine that all at once turn this into an
abstraction sort of in your mind's eye picture all of
these words sentences meanings just coming together and just fusing
into one lump of this nebulous abstract singularity it's just
like a dot you're going to imagine like this white
glowing sphere you're you're putting every single word and meaning
into it and you're just packing this thing full and
full and full in full until literally it it takes
up your entire field of vision and it's just this
glowing white dot what you're imagining here is the entire
possibility space of english now what i want you to
realize is that the universe is capable of knowing all
of that that's not just some theoretical possibility space that
entire thing the universe has that mastered it knows everything
within that singularity of english all of it it knows
it's conscious of all of it it doesn't need to
learn it it already knows it it's already known it's
known it forever it's known it since the beginning of
time before there was time the universe knew english perfectly
all of it in all of its permutations everything the
universe has a complete understanding of english better than any
human and that every individual human across time that exists
and has some understanding of english like shakespeare for example
was pretty good with english they say see the universe
the only reason shakespeare knew english as well as he
did is because the universe gave him a piece of
its infinite knowing of english to shakespeare a little tiny
piece less than one percent and then it gave a
little tiny piece to somebody else and then to somebody
else and to somebody else and to all the great
writers in the universe that or in human history let's
say that have existed it's given a little bit of
english to each one of them but every little piece
of english it gives it's just an infinitesimally small piece
of its infinite understanding of english it's giving to all
of these people and then to you it has given
whatever understanding of english you have to be able to
understand what i'm saying now it's giving a little piece
of english to you that's what's really going on of
course this is very different than how we conventionally think
of the universe pretty cool huh but notice that is
just the domain of english we've only talked about english
we have a lot more to talk about here so
hang in there uh if you need to pause this
recording to actually go through this visualization visualization exercise do
it and i want you to actually kind of try
to become as conscious as you can that the universe
is capable of doing this of course i'm not saying
that you as a human can now know all of
english i'm not saying that you're limited because like i
said the universe only gave you a tiny portion and
it's not gonna give you the whole thing just because
your ego wants it but anyways try to do that
exercise it's helpful to actually do the exercises when i
tell you to do them it's very important that you
don't just turn this into ideas this is more than
ideas i want you to feel it and to become
conscious of it as as much as you can you
know it's difficult this is difficult work now you might
wonder but leo how is it possible this is crazy
it's impossible for the universe to know all of english
but under your materialist scientific paradigm how is it possible
for the universe to know any english at all i
mean obviously if you're a scientist and you're a materialist
and you're an atheist you still have to admit that
the universe knows some english because you know some english
just by the very fact that you're understanding what i'm
saying demonstrates that consciousness is able to know english so
obviously english is knowable by reality you feel it you
experience it don't deny the obvious so if you can
understand english that already demonstrates that at least a little
bit of english can be understood and now the only
thing you have to realize to understand what i'm saying
is simply realize that if the universe has been running
for let's say 14 billion years and it's going to
continue to run from many billions more imagine all of
the different english speakers that have lived and will live
in the future across thousands of years you know shakespeare
and many others and you and all the people you
know um and everyone in the future who will live
and know english i mean obviously reality you admit that
reality is doing that right where else is that occurring
but within reality so obviously all those people know english
so if that's possible why is it so hard for
you to understand and just to make that one final
leap to realize that it's no harder for the universe
to know the meaning of a single word like cat
or dog than it is for the universe to do
that infinite pure ball of of white understanding of english
everything possible within english you think you would think sort
of conventionally speaking you think that well it's easy for
the universe to know what a cat is and what
a dog is but it's really difficult for the universe
to know what everything is within english no neither one
is easier than the other they're equally difficult they're equally
impossible the confusion that you've come up with in your
mind that the the chief delusion you think that oh
well it's easy to like have a single atom exist
or it's easy for it to have the word like
a cat exists and to be able for the brain
to be able to understand it that's easy but it's
hard for you know the universe to understand everything no
it's just as difficult to create one atom as it
is to create an infinite number of atoms it's just
as difficult to understand the word cat as it is
to understand every single english word that could ever possibly
exist these things are not difficult for the universe because
the universe is infinite and it has no limitations placed
upon it all of its limitations are self-imposed that's perhaps
the chief delusion of science is that it actually thinks
that the limitations of the universe are somehow imposed upon
it from the outside and are not consciously chosen by
it this is a delusion every limitation of the universe
has been consciously chosen by the universe for its own
purposes and what those purposes are well that's something you
have to discover why are the why are these limitations
why did the universe choose these specific limitations it's a
good question there is an answer to that but beyond
the scope of this conversation so now what i want
you to do is because you you obviously you've imagined
the all of english as a as one domain but
then you might get the next kind of logical step
in this contemplation you might realize well but that's just
english so if the universe can know all of english
could it also know all of chinese of course could
it also know all of german of course could it
also know all of spanish of course would it be
hard for the universe to know all of russian is
russian harder than english well we think so conventionally speaking
russian is considered a difficult language could it know scandinavian
that's also considered a pretty difficult language or i don't
know what is it called norwegian um uh icelandic that's
considered a pretty difficult language some of those scandinavian languages
are kind of squirrely and tricky so um is that
too hard is is is the universe gonna give up
because oh icelandic it's a man i could know all
of english but icelandic i can't know all of icelandic
that's too much for me is that is that what
you think the universe is is limited by it no
of course not the universe can know every language and
in fact it does so now expand this white singularity
to not just be about english but incorporate into it
every possible language that could ever possibly exist not just
for humans but for all species aliens whoever you might
imagine exists out there and could know language every possible
language all of it imagine an entity that knows all
of that imagine a mind that knows all of that
good sounds pretty cool that's a very powerful [ __
] mind very powerful mind to do that right you
can barely handle two languages or three maybe five maybe
ten languages if you can if you could know ten
languages even half decently so you're fluent with them you're
you're a genius amongst humans but you're an idiot compared
to what the universal mind can do and this knowledge
understand it's perfect right this is not fallible knowledge where
it sort of knows something no it's perfect knowledge perfect
this is profound stuff i'm telling this should be blowing
your [ __ ] mind right now this possibility of
just the universe knowing all possible languages perfectly and also
imperfectly too so you think that oh well there's the
perfect knowing of it but then what about the imperfect
knowing of it well of course the universe can know
it imperfectly as well in all of its imperfections that's
included in this white singularity of perfect knowing see because
once you know everything perfectly how easy is it then
to [ __ ] your own self and limit yourself
to some sort of partial distorted limited understanding easy it's
easy see if i have an infinite amount of money
how easy is it for me to pretend as though
i'm poor really [ __ ] easy all i have
to do is create a bank account put a couple
thousand dollars into it and then you know keep the
other infinite dollars that i have in a separate bank
account and just kind of like deny myself access to
that you know change the password on that account so
i can't access that infinite money but it's there maybe
somewhere like the bank has my name written on that
account so you know it's there but i could i
can i can forget i can kind of trick myself
to forget all that and then i think that i
have just one account with with a couple thousand dollars
but where did that thousand dollars come from from the
infinite money that i have you see likewise when you
whatever limitations you might feel like you have with english
or some other language if you think that you you
know you struggle with english that's because you're pretending you're
this infinite mind that has a perfect understanding of all
languages and you're pretending that you don't understand some word
sounds a bit outrageous like leo but i don't know
icelandic how could i be pretending you're telling me i'm
pretending that i don't know icelandic and that i really
do know it yeah but uh good luck uh stopping
pretending that see when you're pretending that you're doing something
in my formulation of how things work that doesn't mean
you can just easily stop it doesn't mean that your
ego knows how to stop in the same way that
when you lock yourself out of your bank account with
infinite money and you truly forget your password and you
forget that this account even exists and you can't access
it at all then to you effectively you're poor until
maybe you you find the password or the key that
unlocks that infinite account and then maybe things will change
for you but hey finding that key might take you
a lifetime maybe you won't ever find it i don't
guarantee that you'll find the key that unlocks every language
for you but maybe you will i don't know up
to you so that's just all languages now in this
contemplation you might say well leo so that's just languages
but wait a minute if the universe can do that
what else can the universe do and now of course
you start to get where we're really going consciousness is
infinite imagination infinite imagination has infinite domains what do i
mean by a domain so a domain is something like
all of english that's one domain all possible languages that's
another domain mathematics that's another domain and so on so
let's explore some of these domains for example the domain
of movies i want you to imagine every movie that
has ever been made in reality in the universe and
every movie that will ever be made imagine that as
just a possibility space but let's expand that not just
every movie that has been made but every movie that
could be made see that's different that's a larger domain
you can see so we're talking about nested domains here
all the movies that actually exist is a circle about
this big all the movies that could possibly exist is
a circle that's so big that it would need a
thousand screens to fill that circle now imagine some one
specific movie like star wars let's say the original episode
what for a new hope star wars right uh uh
although you kids you probably aren't even familiar with it
how many of you have even watched star wars leave
a comment down below um the original one uh anyways
so that original one how many different ways could george
lucas have filmed or written that star wars imagine the
entire possibility so so a new hope that's one specific
instantiation of the entire possibility space of what that movie
could have been right like luke could have been named
john and han could have been named larry and princess
leia could have been named princess peach or whatever you
see and uh jabba the hutt could have been a
hairy wolf man rather than a slug and the storm
troopers could have been wearing black armor instead of white
armor and the lightsaber of darth vader could have been
purple instead of red and the lightsaber of luke what
was it was it blue yeah instead of blue it
could have been like yellow so imagine all the i
mean we're talking about trillions of possibilities here you see
i mean we're talking niggly little details of how this
movie could have been different all the dialogue could have
been different all the camera angles could have been different
all the sets could have been different all the characters
could have been different the story could have been completely
different the name could have been completely different and have
to be called star wars um it could have been
five minutes long it could have been 60 minutes long
it could have been two hours long it could have
been three hours long could have been five hours long
it could have been a 20 hour movie it could
have been a tv show it could have been a
cartoon it could have been shot in 3d it could
have been uh like a pixar film could have been
anything really of course the further we get away from
its original instantiation the less star wars it gets the
less original it is so to speak um but still
you know however george lucas created at the beginning you
wouldn't have known any different so now imagine the entire
possibility space of what star wars could have been as
this kind of giant white singularity it's good now imagine
epis the next episode you know empire strikes back imagine
all the possibilities of that that's another singularity see they're
two separate domains then you have return of the jedi
it's a third one third domain now merge them all
together now merge together all the possibilities of how all
of star wars including all the video games all the
action figures all the toys all the advertisements all the
cartoons all the tv shows all the novels all the
books the entire extended universe everything how it could have
been and how it could ever possibly be in the
future imagine every possible alternative formulation of star wars that
will ever exist imagine everything star wars in one giant
white singularity okay now we've got star wars now let's
move on to another movie jurassic park let's do that
with the entire jurassic park universe okay we've got that
now of course you see where we're going we can
keep doing this with every possible movie now imagine every
single film and every single cinematic universe that could ever
be filmed ever in the universe there's trillions of possibilities
here right a lot lump them all together lump the
entire cinematic genre of human art let's say let's call
it art let's let's lump all that together into one
giant white singularity okay we've got that let's throw that
aside for a minute now imagine music imagine every possible
formulation of music that could ever possibly exist that was
ever invented or ever will be invented by humans so
imagine that as one white singularity now merge that with
movies as well so we've got movies and songs together
so these are two separate domains now we merge them
together set that aside notice that each of these domains
is infinite are you seeing that they're all infinite there's
no end to them you can keep making new movies
forever you can keep making new songs forever it's inexhaustible
now let's imagine video games every possible video game that
could ever be made imagine that now lump that in
with the previous stuff now imagine every invention that every
a human could ever invent the telephone the radio the
transistor the laser beam the toaster the wheel the all
the inventions lump them all together into one not just
the ones that were invented but the ones that will
be invented as well lump that all together and then
merge that into everything we've imagined so far now how
about software the domain of software every piece of software
that could have ever been made excel word photoshop after
effects i don't know what kind of software do you
use these days um yeah lump them all together all
possible versions of software as well so we're talking about
every operating system ever written for every machine that has
ever existed and ever will exist lump that all together
merge it with the stuff we've had so far now
imagine every vehicle that could be invented helicopters airplanes cars
motorcycles go peds mopeds tanks suvs you know electric cars
[Music] submarines all of them lump them together also notice
that we can see we can kind of zoom out
we can also zoom in so for example we can
take a we can take a category or a subdomain
such as flying vehicles right so a subset of all
possible vehicles is the sub-domain of flying vehicles okay how
many if we if there you can hopefully see that
there's an infinite number of different vehicles we can make
right okay that's pretty obvious how many flying vehicles can
we make also infinite but it's a smaller infinity it's
a subset of infinity so it's infinity of an infinity
infinity comes in orders so we can make an infinite
number of airplanes and helicopters and other types of flying
vehicles rockets and so forth but we can so within
vehicles we have flying vehicles within flying vehicles we can
zoom in further and do a sub-domain of helicopters how
many different kinds of helicopters can we have infinite but
a smaller infinity than all flying vehicles now of the
helicopters we can zoom in further we could say how
many helicopters that are gas powered rather than electric or
some other propulsion that's a smaller subset how many gas
powered helicopters can we have infinite but smaller than the
subset of helicopters now we can zoom in further and
say how many helicopters can we have that are gas
powered that have the capacity to uh carry 10 or
more passengers how many of those can we invent infinite
and how many helicopters can we invent that are like
that and have the color you know have a a
white paint paint scheme on it infinite and you can
see that we can keep doing this forever we can
subdivide consciousness or imagination forever to infinity we can get
more and more and more and more detailed until we
get to the point where we're like just changing individual
atoms within helicopters and even that becomes infinite pretty cool
huh so when we're talking about all possible vehicles i
want you to realize that a white gas powered helicopter
that can have capacity for 10 passengers that's one little
tiny speck within that entire possibility space and we can
zoom in further and further within just that subdomain forever
so we've got that now imagine every possible chess game
that could ever be played as one white singularity also
imagine every possible board game not just chess but go
and all the possible board games monopoly and so forth
that have ever existed or will ever be invented imagine
all that as a singularity now imagine sports all the
possible sports that could ever be invented and played imagine
every possible for example football match that could ever be
played and watched and every possible way in which a
single football game can unfold every possible goal that could
be made every possible penalty every possible violation of the
rules every possible upset every possible victory in defeat condition
all of it imagined as one singularity see that imagine
every possible food that any living being ever could possibly
eat including humans animals anything anything that counts as food
imagine that imagine every possible joke that has ever been
told and could ever be told in the universe imagine
all that as one singularity imagine every possible file name
that you could give to a file on a computer
those are infinite because they can be infinitely long there's
no limitation here on the length of these file names
per se imagine every living being that could ever possibly
live including humans animals aliens and anything like that imagine
all that as one singularity uh imagine all possible diseases
cancers and other diseases not just of humans but of
course of every living being that could ever possibly live
so you know cats have their own unique diseases that
humans don't have dogs have their own you know elephants
have their own hippopotami have their own and snakes have
their own diseases and so on aliens will have new
diseases that we don't even understand can't even imagine imagine
all those diseases imagine every city that could ever be
built on any planet in the entire universe and all
the possibilities of how you can rearrange that city you
know you can have a skyscraper that's a thousand feet
tall or a thousand one foot tall it could have
this kind of decor that kind of decor this kind
of color glass steel whatever and all the skyscrapers could
be arranged in different ways all the different city possibilities
as we're imagining this we're lumping it all together into
one ever greater singularity of pure white potential imagine every
subfield of science biology chemistry micro biology molecular biology you
know evolutionary biology physics quantum physics cosmology astrophysics blah blah
blah blah blah imagine all the possible fields of science
imagine all the works of art all the possible paintings
sculptures works of architecture works of poetry works of literature
all of it add it lump it all together into
this white hot singularity imagine every orgasm that every human
has ever had i don't just mean an orgasm i
mean every possible orgasm you know orgasms can be different
you've had some strong ones you've had weak ones you've
had long ones you've had short ones you know men
and women experience different kinds of orgasms even you know
a man can experience different kinds of orgasms you can
experience sort of a traditional orgasm you can experience an
anal orgasm a woman can experience clitoral orgasms vaginal orgasms
whatever many different kinds of orgasms lump every orgasm that
every human has ever had together into one singularity and
then also on top of that add every orgasm that
every animal and every living being every alien that will
ever possibly have in the future we'll have all of
that together lump together every possible emotion that can be
felt by any living being in the entire universe as
one singularity imagine every possible set of physical laws that
could create a universe that's alternative to our our own
imagine all of that as a singularity imagine every thought
and idea that you could ever have ever whether you're
a human or an animal or something beyond human an
alien or some sort of ai a robot whatever if
those ever have ideas and thoughts lump all the thoughts
and ideas together into one singularity and finally imagine every
possible self that could be held within consciousness what do
i mean by a self i don't necessarily mean a
human i mean a self i mean you are a
self your entire life is what i'm pointing at that's
the self the self in this case is so there's
you i mean you are familiar intimately with your own
self but then there's like the self of your mom
or your brother or your dad or some friend of
yours that's a separate self you think for example yourself
is not the same as your mom's self or your
dad's self or myself leo's self you think of yourself
as a separate self for me in a certain sense
you're right as far as lower case selves go lowercase
ls selves go so imagine every possible self that the
universe could ever hold within consciousness and merge them all
into one single possibility space of every possible self and
now of course you understand where this is going imagine
the entire possibility space of all possible possibility spaces including
everything that's impossible all at once imagine everything that's it
that's consciousness that's the universe that's reality that's god that's
love everything that is infinity absolute infinity this infinity contains
an infinite number of subdomains of itself which are also
all infinite but lesser infinities than absolute infinity it contains
infinite movies infinite video games infinite orgasms infinite emotions infinite
beings infinite thoughts infinite scientific laws physical laws infinite universes
infinite thoughts and ideas infinite vehicles and cars infinite helicopters
infinite jokes independent sports infinite chess games infinite file names
infinite diseases infinite cities infinite planets infinite stars infinite novels
infinite poems infinite songs infinite languages infinite everything everything that
is infinite mind that's what you are your infinite mind
and that explains everything there's nothing left to explain but
let's do a little more narrow exercise here because there's
something very profound about the following exercise that will be
helpful for you let's focus on this idea of selves
infinite selves i want you to try to grasp and
actually become conscious of and feel try to feel that
yourself is being held within consciousness again what do i
mean by yourself what i'm talking about is that sort
of first person sense of what it's like to be
you a self all of your memories your personal story
your history where you came from where you were born
how you grew up your schooling all of your beliefs
and theories whether you're scientific or religious or spiritual or
new age all of that all of your emotions all
of your habits and quirks every thought you've ever had
uh every desire you've ever had all the fears you
have all the aversions that you have and all the
attractions that attract you yourself you which is different than
your mom or your dad or me right because i
have my own set of those things and your mom
has her own set and your dad has his own
set and your siblings have theirs and so on so
what i want you to understand is that self all
of that that's like a conglomeration of various feelings emotions
and thoughts lumped together into sort of a cohesive bubble
almost we might say it is that's being held right
now try to feel this you're you're being held by
consciousness consciousness is imagining that right now as i'm speaking
it's doing this it's doing it very consistently such that
it feels completely physical and real but it's also it's
not it's not completely rigid it's also it's it's it's
fluid yourself is fluid it's changing it's morphing you know
one hour you feel good the next hour you feel
depressed one hour you feel horny the next hour you
feel hungry whatever you know it's it's kind of it's
it's morphing very gently but it's still maintaining overall it's
it's structure and it changes throughout your whole life as
you get older as you grow as you mature as
you learn as you uh actualize yourself and so on
so this self that you are identified with completely that
you think you are that was born and that's going
to die i want you to imagine stopping doing that
and swapping to being your your mother for example imagine
what herself is like and imagine that these are two
separate bubbles and you can jump from this bubble to
this bubble now when you jump to this bubble realize
that you lose everything in this other bubble you lose
all your memories you lose your sense of identity you
lose your name you lose everything such that when you
become your mother you're your mother you don't even have
an idea about how you were the old you you
or your mother now that's the new you that's the
new self and now imagine switching from being that mother
self to being the leo self you're the guy who's
creating all these videos and talking all and talking about
all this uh mystical mystical stuff imagine being me having
all of my memories and my name and my um
you know my bank account and all of the stuff
that i have imagine that but when you're me you
no longer have any memory or idea of having been
you or having been your mother and now switch to
some other person switch to donald trump imagine being donald
trump and being the donald trump self and now what
i want you to become conscious of is that all
of these different bubbles of selves these are just something
that consciousness is imagining very vividly at any moment it
can jump between these effortlessly it doesn't care it can
imagine all these cells simultaneously imagine every possible human self
that could ever exist hitler napoleon caesar jesus buddha trump
etc etc etc imagine every possible permutation of every possible
self all the memories that hitler could have had all
the experiences that jesus could have had but didn't all
the ideas that buddha could have had but didn't all
the stuff that donald trump could have done in his
life but didn't maybe in some you know alternative life
donald trump could have been uh you know uh a
spiritual teacher an awakened buddha maybe he could have had
a youtube channel maybe he could have been like a
cartola or something or sad guru but hey that that
that didn't pan out for him for whatever circumstances but
imagine that all the things he could have been all
the different selves that he could have been all the
different cells that you could have been but you know
you made certain choices that sent you down certain roads
and not others so see the problem is that you
are attached to your particular current self and everything all
the other cells that i'm talking about to you is
just a fantasy they're just ideas it's not tangible it's
not as tangible as your current self that's right because
what we're talking about is preserving your life here you
see can you see that your life is on the
line this is not just a cute activity when we're
talking about jumping between cells this is not just like
a fun activity it's like oh yeah that sounds fun
i'll just turn into my mom i'll just turn into
leo i'll just turn into donald trump no if i
snap my fingers or if there is better to put
it this way better to put it this way if
there was a red button that you could push right
now you push this button and you will become donald
trump but understand that when you become donald trump it's
not going to be like oh yeah i become donald
trump for a day and then i return back or
i become donald trump and i keep all of my
ideas all of my philosophy all my spiritual development i
keep all that no if you push this button you
truly become donald trump precisely you don't keep your old
memories none of your old ideas none of your self-actualization
work remains you're gonna be this egotistical arrogant [ __
] uh who's ignorant as a doorknob if you push
that button will you push that button and what will
happen once you push that button see i mean this
is gonna be the most terrifying decision you've ever had
to make in your life you are gonna you are
not gonna push that button even you might say well
that's because donald trump is this awful human being okay
well even if we select the human being you admire
the most who do you admire eckhart tolle or something
um or the buddha let's say you could push the
button and you can become the buddha would you do
it no because you're terrified of losing yourself pushing that
button is the very definition of death that's what you
call annihilation there won't even be a a remnant of
a memory of who you used to be if you
push that button hey i mean if you're crazy you
might push that button but 99 of people will not
push that button so now you can appreciate the distinction
between self with a lowercase s and self with an
uppercase s so when i use this distinction sometimes in
some of my recordings what do i mean by that
self with a lowercase s is a specific instantiation of
a self like donald trump or me or you or
your mom right different memories different life stories different experiences
different people that's the lowercase self the uppercase self is
when we take all the lowercase selves and we literally
fuse them into one infinite singularity of potential selves that's
the uppercase self every possible self the infinite self this
uppercase s self is otherwise known as god every possible
self got it now the only problem is that you
still for you this is still all just ideas it's
just philosophy it's just fantasy none of this feels real
to you it seems like some dude just gave you
some crazy ideas they sound interesting and philosophical and cute
but hey you know leo this is not real right
none of this could actually happen in real life it's
impossible or maybe you're wrong who knows find out for
yourself you might wonder leo is there an end to
this infinity of course not even though we've imagined this
infinity of all the possible stuff as this one single
sort of blob or this singularity it might seem like
this one singular thing which has a definite boundary around
it like a sphere but of course infinity can't have
a boundary it can't be a sphere it it's so
infinite that it fills up the entire space and it's
infinite in all directions and in all domains and subdomains
infinitely subdividing itself consciousness is capable of infinite subdivision nesting
within itself ever more and ever more and evermore subdividing
itself forever and this process is endless sort of like
a geometrical line you know a geometrical line it just
it just goes in both directions forever and ever and
ever it doesn't end that's how reality is except it's
not a line nor is it a plane nor is
it a cube nor is it a sphere but it's
infinite in all directions in all domains in all dimensions
in all qualities in every possible way it's all possible
possibilities including of course the paradox of everything impossible as
well everything including of course nothing you might say leo
if if i'm imagining everything this is the opposite of
nothing and therefore it's still not everything because then everything
is here and then nothing is somehow outside of this
right but you still haven't gone all the way when
i mean everything i'm talking about everything with an uppercase
e i mean everything which of course means nothing too
because if you exclude nothing from everything then it wasn't
really everything was it it was everything except nothing so
here is finally where you realize and fully understand what
it means to say that reality is nothing what the
zen people teach you what the buddhists teach you reality
is nothing because it's everything [Music] or god it's god
people say oh leo but the buddhists don't believe in
god people just don't understand buddhism even many buddhists don't
understand buddhism nothingness is god so there you are i
encourage you to keep trying these experiments keep contemplating this
stuff i know that right now for you it's just
at the level of imagination sort of just conceptual imagination
it's just fantasy but hey you might be surprised where
this leads you remember that to really get somewhere in
life first you have to be able to envision it
and conceive of it and yeah it's a fantasy at
first but then you work on it and then you
might be surprised at how much of it you can
actually actualize or start to grasp in various kinds of
ways for yourself now the last point i want to
make here is that sometimes there's this confusion within spiritual
teachings about states of consciousness people sometimes say that awakening
is not a state of consciousness enlightenment is not a
state of consciousness that there are states of consciousness and
there's something else called enlightenment no there's only states of
consciousness consciousness takes different states that's what consciousness does that's
what consciousness is it's a substance that has no substance
which can take any state it can take the state
of a refrigerator of a car of a cat of
a human of a dog of an alien of anything
okay some of these states of consciousness are very very
intelligent and conscious and mystical others are not others are
as dumb literally as a doorknob or a coffee table
of course in the absolute sense no state of consciousness
is better than any other state it's not better to
be a human than it is to be a dog
or than it is to be a coffee table it's
just different they're different they have different pros and cons
different capacities in a sense it's great to be a
human because you can experience an orgasm a coffee table
can't experience an orgasm but on the other hand you
can experience a lot of suffering as a human that
the coffee table is safe from so maybe it's not
so bad to be a coffee table you lose some
things but you also gain some things that's the nature
of all form every state has its pros and cons
to it there is nothing but states of consciousness there's
an infinite number of course of different states of consciousness
there are thousands and even millions of different awakened states
of consciousness there is not a singular awake or enlightened
state of consciousness there are millions of them there are
different degrees of them this is one of the biggest
misconceptions that i see and self-deceptions that i see within
spiritual circles and spiritual teachings is that they frame awakening
or enlightenment as a singular state that is achieved or
even they get tricky and they say oh it's not
even a state some some traditions call it turia for
example it's supposed to be the stateless state the fourth
state you know they have uh sleeping dreaming waking and
then they have toria the fourth state the non-state state
but that's still a state if you have a state
where consciousness is completely empty of form that's still a
state that's the state of emptiness you can be in
a state of total emptiness you can be in a
state of the state you're in right now you can
be in some psychedelic state there are millions of different
psychedelic states you can be in a meditative state there
are millions of meditative states they're all different they all
have their own pros and cons and benefits and and
uh and negatives and you can explore all these different
states and you can also realize the nature of all
the states without necessarily having to explore the policy i
haven't explored all states but i have become conscious of
the the nature of consciousness and how it takes on
these different states and your life consists of these different
states but for our purposes there are certain states that
are more resourceful for doing this work that we do
than other states for example if you're drunk you're in
a certain state but that's not a very good state
for self-actualization work it might be a great state though
when you're in a nightclub and you want to dance
or you want to hit on some girls and you're
feeling shy and anxious having a couple of drinks of
whiskey or whatever might be perfect for that situation on
the other hand you can also take it too far
you know drink too many whiskeys and then you're going
to have a terrible state and then you're going to
regret it the next day and that's going to be
a problem so you have to be careful with these
states which kind of states are you putting yourself in
you know when you're watching television for five hours that
puts you in a certain state when you're watching one
of my videos that that changes your state of consciousness
just you know a little bit when you take five
amio dmt that changes your consciousness like a [ __
] and then how much dmt you take changes your
state even further you can take a little dim tea
a medium dose a giant dose a whiteout dose you
can take a dose of dnp so so so great
you'll become so conscious that you'll literally become that infinite
pure white singularity of everything possible you'll think you're dead
you might even die conventionally speaking but really you'll just
become infinite you'll become that singularity so uh in a
certain sense it doesn't matter what state you're in but
in another sense it matters very much from a practical
perspective it matters very much what state you're in because
the state you're in determines what you're able to do
in life for example if your brain the so-called imaginary
brain of course the brain is imagining but if your
brain is filled with toxins heavy metals and other chemicals
and your body because you're eating terrible food is filled
with toxins as well this is going to actually shift
down the state of your consciousness such that you're not
going to be able to think straight you won't be
able to concentrate or focus you'll have add symptoms you'll
be autistic or whatever and you're not going to be
able to do this work you're not going to be
able to sit and just meditate because your mind is
going to be all over the place you might even
have suicidal thoughts you might even have homicidal thoughts you
might be in a state of insanity that does exist
states of madness those exist so be very careful what
you put into your body and how you program your
mind because that does affect your state the kinds of
videos you choose to watch on youtube affects your state
the kind of websites you visit affects your state the
kind of porn you watch affects your state the kind
of chemicals you put into your body affect your state
don't let a spiritual teacher that tell you that state
is not important state is crucial your baseline state in
a sense dictates everything in your life what you're doing
is stemming from your state if you're having difficulty awakening
it's because your state is wrong you're stuck in a
lower state many spiritual teachers won't tell you this they
like to pretend as they're like oh state is irrelevant
you can just ignore state no you can't ignore state
state is super relevant which is why psychedelics are so
powerful and important because they can show you these higher
states that otherwise would be very difficult to achieve and
what a lot of many meditation teachers don't take into
account is that today especially now in the last couple
of decades uh in a sense awakening is harder than
ever because of the state that society is inducing in
people all the social media all the junk food all
the video games all the porn all the virtual reality
all of the cell phones and smartphones all of the
conspiracy theories that are going around these days all of
this is changing people's states and it's putting people in
a very rigid state such that they can't even sit
in focus for five minutes because their minds are so
scatterbrained with 80 d symptoms and autism and all this
sorts of junk and so when some zen master tells
you oh i just sit there and meditate and you'll
awaken no you won't because of the state you're in
your your your mind and your brain is filled with
such bad ideas world views theories and also toxic chemicals
uh that some of you have zero chance of awakening
even if you sit there for 30 years now of
course don't uh don't freak out don't let they'll let
that be a limiting belief i'm just i'm just telling
you be careful what you put into your mind what
you put into your body you need to actually if
you really want to awaken deeply and reach some of
these higher realms of consciousness you need to really start
to clean up your diet clean up your information intake
various detox protocols that i will share with you in
the future this will all be super important um and
yeah i'm just putting that out there because it's easy
to get tricked into thinking that state is irrelevant it's
not irrelevant state is very relevant and awakening is a
state the reason that you have difficulty awakening or really
you can't even awaken from hearing some teacher talking to
you and you've probably heard eckhart tolle or rupert spira
or sod guru or whoever is your favorite you know
non-dual teacher you've heard them droning on and on and
on about consciousness and awakening and enlightenment and no self
and god and love and all this but to you
it's just words falling on deaf ears no matter how
much you try nothing changes for you you don't awaken
why is that because you're in the wrong state and
they're not telling you that that's the truth but that's
also good because that means you can change your state
you can put yourself into more resourceful states that will
help you get closer to awakening and of course there
are many different versions and degrees of awakened nests depending
on how awake your state really is that's another way
in which spiritual teachers deceive you is usually they take
their own awakened state as the limit of what awakened
states can be but that's rarely the case there are
an infinite number of different awakened states far beyond what
all of your teachers and masters have told you about
so just keep that in mind that will open your
mind to to to to keep growing and growing and
growing forever and uh it's very worthwhile to explore these
different states don't let teachers fool you into thinking that
oh exploring states this is just a waste of time
no it isn't you learn a lot from exploring different
states now of course there is a trap in chasing
pleasurable states i'm not telling you to fall into that
trap of course you want to avoid that shooting up
heroin will put you in an amazing pleasurable state for
a few hours but it has terrible consequences and you're
not going to be able to maintain that state and
it's not going to be a very resourceful state it's
sort of a lazy state of pure pleasure which feels
nice but then it goes away so that doesn't work
um likewise even with psychedelics you know you can take
fibromyalgia and put you in an amazing state um better
than heroin but uh with less side effects negative side
effects but still you're gonna you're gonna drop down from
that state and then and then what what do you
do then so but just because that happened does that
mean that the 5-meo dmt state is now a bad
state and you shouldn't pursue that state no that it's
a super important state for most people to experience that
state it'll completely transform your life but on the other
hand don't fall into the delusion of thinking you can
just like grasp onto that state and hold it like
a baby blanket you won't be able to so there
is value in having peak experiences of different kinds of
states it teaches you about the possibilities of consciousness it's
very important uh sometimes even just being in a terrible
state will teach you a lot about consciousness now of
course that doesn't mean you want to live from that
state for the rest of your life but it can
be very illuminating and this is why having a terrible
trip can be actually a very powerful growing experience because
you have a terrible trip of course you don't want
to be locked into that state forever but that states
shows you some stuff shows you how serious consciousness is
how brutal it can be how sometimes how impersonal it
can be how unloving it can be sometimes in these
horrible trips it feels like you're losing your mind but
at the same time you get more appreciation of the
diversity of states that humans and other beings can experience
that makes you more compassionate towards what others are going
through and then you realize that all of the stupid
stuff that people do in society and in the world
all the nasty things they say to you and all
the devil read that they do it's actually coming from
the limited state that they're stuck in and then you
get an even deeper sense of compassion for them because
you know that they're locked in that state and no
matter what you say it's not going to probably change
their state very much so the ultimate thing you can
do in your life is to change your state but
of course there's right ways and wrong ways to go
about it and there's always traps in this in this
process so be careful you can certainly get lost in
the pursuit of endless states without upgrading your baseline state
so one of the most important things you can do
is not just to pursue the peak experiences but then
you pursue those those show you different possibilities and then
what you do is you come back to your baseline
state when you're sober and calm and you can raise
that and then for that there are certain techniques like
yoga meditation contemplation self-inquiry etc etc that we've talked about
but also the peak states those do add to the
increase of your baseline state so there's a sort of
a complex relationship there it's not simply that you hit
a peak come back down and then you're back to
where you were no you could you that just hitting
a peak could forever increase your baseline state or it
couldn't it just depends there's so many variables here so
i'm uh i'm trying to show you the big picture
of how all this works all right that's it the
practice that i want to leave you here today with
for the next week i want you to notice how
everything physical is actually being held by consciousness like a
refrigerator a coffee table and so on try to notice
how that's being held within consciousness that's not a physical
object it's just being held in consciousness as a physical
object try to notice that distinction all right that's it
i'm done here please click that like button for me
and come check out actualize.org that's my website you will
find additional resources on there that are not available on
youtube you will find my book list a live purpose
course you will find my blog where i'm posting exclusive
content sometimes videos sometimes articles sometimes links sometimes memes sometimes
funny stuff don't miss that sometimes profound stuff some of
the most profound stuff i post is on my blog
don't miss that i put a lot of effort into
it check out the forum where you can talk about
this stuff with like-minded people and the last thing i'll
say is just a little bit about psychedelics to get
the full effect of this episode i recommend that at
some point you experiment with psychedelics in a responsible manner
however you want to do it and you use this
episode as sort of a guide you can use this
in your psychedelic trips and experiences you can you can
really fully appreciate some of these exercises that i took
you through and you can start to notice in a
tangible way the infinite potential of all these different subdomains
and how conscious works and how a refrigerator is actually
something that you're holding in your consciousness you can start
to make these distinctions this is going to be very
crucial for your growth to the highest levels of understanding
of reality and then just make sure that you don't
get trapped in the chasing of those amazing states that
psychedelics can put you in because that is definitely a
danger and you do have to be careful and responsible
about how you use psychedelics
