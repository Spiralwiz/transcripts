hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I am going to cover fear of
public speaking and of course what everyone wants is to
know how to overcome it alright so fear of public
speaking I consider myself somewhat qualified to talk about this
because I've been doing a lot of public speaking lately
that's what I'm doing right now in a way even
though I'm not in front of a large audience I'm
just in front of a camera but it's basically the
same skill and when I started actually shooting videos about
two years ago and I just first started experimenting with
shooting videos and posting them on YouTube my videos were
horrible I was nervous I didn't know how to talk
he didn't get my thoughts across and this is still
something I'm working on so fear of public speaking I
think it's the number one fear actually statistically if you
if you go and you pull the whole country it's
the number one fear the people have literally people would
rather get I don't know they would rather get a
nuclear apocalypse happen or a zombie apocalypse then to have
to go and speak in front of a large audience
it's scary why is this scary because well we fear
embarrassment we fear that we're going to screw up we're
we fear that we're going to say something stupid we
fear that we're going to freeze all these fears we
fear that we're going to be judged and ridiculed and
so of course all that is scary and every person
that you're adding on top of that ridicule is getting
worse and worse and maybe the worst one of all
is you feel that you're going to get rejected which
is the fear that people are not going to like
your ideas they're not going to accept who you are
they're not going to like your personality your mannerisms and
they are not going to want to be your friend
or associate with you so all those are sub components
of the fear of public speaking as far as how
to overcome public speaking so we've gotten the point down
I hope that this is a normal fear everybody fears
public speaking there's no natural public speakers out there not
when you start and here's what I discovered because I
had the same fear when I started and I do
do public speaking in front of groups of live people
and I find that most times now because I've practiced
and trained myself it's actually quite easy and actually very
enjoyable and it's not scary at all the trick is
that you have to practice it and that's the problem
is that the reason people around the country have so
much fear about public speaking because they never do public
speaking and that doesn't mean that you don't have fear
when you do it that just means that they haven't
practiced it and anything that you haven't practiced is going
to be a little bit scary for you especially when
it involves the social pressures of rejection and embarrassment and
humiliation and looking like a fool all of that so
when you have that much social pressure on you yeah
you're going to be scared that's just part of our
of our psychology because we grew up in a in
a tribal in tribal communities of 100 to 150 individuals
back in the cave and days and at that time
it was important to look out for your social standing
in the the little tribe that you were in the
hierarchy and so when that hierarchy was getting disrupted or
you you look like you're going to make a fool
of yourself or ruin your status that was actually a
very real and and physical threat to you to your
survival so it's almost like coded in our genes that
we become anxious when we're in front of people and
that that's something that we have to kind of get
comfortable with the flip side of that is that you're
also a natural-born leader and that it's also in your
genes to be a leader of people and to communicate
your ideas because we were in those tribes and there
were leaders in those tribes and each one of us
has that in us as well so how do you
actually overcome the fear of public speaking how did I
do it I think the best way absolute best way
and something that's super practical you can do tomorrow is
you join a Toastmasters and Toastmasters what that is they
don't make toast they make toasts or they make speeches
and what that is is basically it's a large nonprofit
worldwide organization and they basically have little groups self organized
groups of about ten to thirty people that meet up
once a week in your city and they do about
an hour to an hour and a half meeting where
they stand up and in a very friendly casual non-threatening
environment they stand up and they deliver speech and the
speech is usually five to ten minutes long and the
speech their various speeches on various different topics you can
craft your own topics and so you can join one
of these groups it's called Toastmasters you could find them
on Toastmasters org and they literally have an organization in
every city across the whole world not just that they
have multiple organizations I'm in Las Vegas right now shooting
this video and they have I think 70 Toastmasters clubs
in Las Vegas alone and this is by far not
that big of a city in Los Angeles they literally
have thousands of them in every city across the country
I don't care how small it is there are Toastmasters
multiple of them so you can go and you can
find one that fits your schedule fits your time fits
your the type of people that you like to hang
out with every Toastmasters club is a little bit different
has a little different vibe to it but in the
end they all follow kind of same script the same
formula they follow the same kind of procedures and so
it's a great opportunity to learn and get the experience
of speaking in public because here's how you ultimately overcome
public speaking you just go and you do public speaking
and then it becomes easy it took me about I
don't know about 10 to 20 speeches at a Toastmasters
club to really numb down my anxiety and my fears
the first time I did it was scary the second
time it was also scary and third time was less
scary the fourth time was less scary and then by
the 10th 20th time you really don't care so much
it's actually awesome it's awesome it's awesome it's awesome so
the reason people are always afraid is because they don't
go and they don't do this they don't have many
opportunity to speak in front of large audiences or even
small audiences for that matter and so when they do
get the opportunity that rare occasion we have to get
up at work and deliver a presentation all the sudden
you're scared of it because this is your first time
or maybe your second or your third time and you
haven't done 20 speeches I can guarantee this though if
you do 20 speeches your fear of speaking is going
to melt away I would say 95% you're gonna have
5% of fear there still and of course if you
go and all of a sudden you have to give
a speech in front of a thousand people you're going
to have a new kind of fear but you're going
to be comfortable working with small groups you're going to
be comfortable working in groups of 10 15 20 30
people pretty easily by just joining a Toastmasters it's very
cheap it's a very supportive environment nobody there ridicules you
they give you very supportive feedback even if you give
a very lame speech there's still be very supportive of
you because they recognize that people that go in there
are scared are nervous and we all start that way
every public speaker I don't care how good he is
today he started off at some point in his life
whether he was old or very young giving his first
few speeches and those first few speeches were terrifying it
just it just has to be that way and what
you're going to rep what you're going to recognize with
public speaking is that it becomes really enjoyable because once
that fear melts away what happens that your natural voice
comes through and you're actually able to express yourself articulately
you're able to express yourself clearly and you're able to
impact people which is the most important thing is that's
why you're speaking right that's why you're giving that presentation
even though it seems like your boss forced you to
give that presentation the reason he forced you to do
it is because he wants you to have a certain
impact on the team in the company on the CEO
or whatever and you can really use your voice to
have a positive influence in the world whether it's communicating
some expertise that you have like I'm doing here maybe
it's to inspire and motivate somebody maybe it's to educate
somebody maybe it's to give a humorous speech and you
want to do that and you want to entertain people
with your speaking so there's all these different facets of
public speaking and you can become an expert in each
one of those you can train each one of those
in Toastmasters I'm sure there are other organizations out there
besides Toastmasters that you can get your to get your
feet wet in speech making and speech giving I personally
haven't even researched them that much because Toastmasters is just
like the go-to choice it's so simple they're everywhere it's
inexpensive if you want to get good at public speaking
there's really no reason not to go you're also going
to learn leadership skills and organization skills when you're there
you can make a lot of great friends and know
this is not a pitch for Toastmasters I'm not affiliated
with them other than the fact that I do go
to a Toastmasters every week because I want to practice
my speaking skills and so that's how you get good
and I actually recommend that if you are not in
a position where you need to like give a speech
the next week then you still join Toastmasters there's so
many benefits to public speaking to being proficient at it
that I encourage almost anybody to go and do 6
to 12 months of Toastmasters and just see the benefit
that it has it's going to make you more confident
more secure and you will never have to worry about
public speaking and the fear of public speaking ever again

speaking please leave me your comments I'd love to read
