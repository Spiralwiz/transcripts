let's talk about how societies evolved how human culture changes
across time and introduce you to some new research called
the World Values Survey this is going to be a
new model that we're gonna bring in to help us
to understand sociological issues culture society the evolution of mankind
and your place in that as an individual because of
course you're not just actualizing yourself as an individual you're
part of a community part of a society part of
a culture and all of that creates a very serious
and crucial backdrop against which now you're trying to self
actualize and excuse your epistemology your metaphysics and many other
things so this episode here is really a piece of
the puzzle of what I call conscious politics I have
a four-part episode series called conscious politics where I go
into a lot of depth on that and this will
be another puzzle piece and that to help you to
understand why politics works the way that it works and
it'll help you to understand yourself so let's get into
that but before we do let's also reintroduce very quickly
here the other two models we've talked about in the
past that are going to be helpful here because there's
going to be a lot of correlation and the first
one is spiral dynamics of course hopefully you're familiar with
that if you're not go see my six-part or even
more part series on spiral dynamics many hours over 10
hours I talk about that model it's a very sophisticated
model which basically describes the development of human values and
here on the screen you're gonna see a slide of
just the essence of what sprawl and AMEX is so
if you want a quick refresher to refresh your memory
there's stages here there's seven or so these stages different
colors purple red blue orange green yellow turquoise moving upwards
as we move upwards we encounter more complexity and a
sort of a evolution of cultures and human value systems
and you can see there are the various descriptions of
what those different stages mean I won't go over those
again here you already be familiar with that if not
go check out that many series multiple part series so
we're gonna be relying on this keep this in mind
and also we're gonna be relying on the old classic
model of Maslow's hierarchy of needs so here you see
it on the screen the classic pyramid you might have
learned about this in high school or in college I've
talked about this in my episode called using Maslow's hierarchy
of needs to self actualize so basically what you see
here is you have you see different levels of priority
that the human organism and human society as well has
in terms of what it needs to survive at the
very bottom of course you just have the basic stuff
like food water sleep sex and so forth and then
as you satisfy those of course higher needs come online
the need for maybe a nicer shelter for a family
health then beyond that you have friendship sexual intimacy beyond
that you might have self-esteem needs a need for achievement
a need to get respect of your colleagues and friends
and then beyond that you have stuff like the need
to be creative the need to have freedom to discover
to explore to travel to contribute to the world and
then at the very very top you have the self
transcendence needs which is the need to move beyond your
human identity and things such as truth spirit consciousness being
an unconditional love so keep all this in mind because
this will be very important for what we'll be talking
about throughout this episode so now let me introduce you
to the world values survey that's what it's called sometimes
it's abbreviated as W V s this is some groundbreaking
and remarkable research that's been done over the last 40
years and hardly anybody knows about it they don't really
talk about it in the news when you listen to
politics nobody really talks about it nobody really knows about
it so I want to introduce this to you this
will help you to situate yourself and understand what's going
on around you it gives us important insights into human
evolution and development it explains culture politics really well so
that culture and political debates no longer just devolve into
left versus right or conservative versus liberal but you see
something deeper this is sort of a meta analysis of
what's really going on and why these you know cultural
wars and so forth happen that you see in the
news so this world value survey this is a global
research project spearheaded by social scientist named Ronald Englehart and
many others alongside him so by no means just himself
in fact there are dozens and even hundreds of social
scientists involved with this research it's a very big project
one of the reasons it's so big is because it
covers the whole globe the other reason is so big
is because it covers a long chunk of time so
basically they've been doing this survey from 1981 till 2020
and it's still ongoing and every four years they do
a new wave of surveys to add on top of
the database of data so what are they really surveying
here well they're trying to ask people all around the
world ordinary people basically what they think about fundamental issues
such as the economy the environment gay rights religion do
you believe in God or don't you about beliefs in
science about their ideas about what the right and best
government should be their satisfaction in life and so on
and so forth and so they've been doing this since
the 1980s and the whole point of it is not
just to gather the data once but to keep regather
ofor years in as many countries as feasible and to
get a picture of what the trends are how are
these values shifting over time and what are the causes
and effects and factors that lead to these values changing
and so we're going to be talking about that in
a lot of great detail and giving you insights from
that in these surveys over 100 countries are involved which
accounts for 90 percent of the world's population so it's
important understand that these surveys are not just being done
in first world to developed countries in the West these
surveys are done all around the world in as many
places that they can do it it includes South America
it includes Asia includes Africa it includes the Middle East
basically the whole world and they're expanding it as far
as they can so it's very widespread so of course
you know sometimes there's criticisms of surveys where it say
oh well this data only accounts for Western Europe or
only for Americans well here we want to make sure
that we understand how all cultures evolve we don't want
to be chauvinistic and we don't want to assume that
the Western worldview or the European worldview is the only
true one and what you'll see in this data is
that there's a lot of commonality of course there's nothing
special per se about Europe or about America or about
the white race that makes them more important than than
any other we'll see that many of these trends are
common across all these different countries but of course countries
are at different levels of development countries are not all
the same and we do need to make those distinctions
which we'll be making so how is this data collected
it's collected through questionnaires so they have political and social
scientists around the world who are responsible who are volunteers
who go out there and administer these questionnaires in their
local areas and countries and then they bring it back
to some central location where it's all compiled into a
database giant database of all the raw data after the
raw data is compiled over a period of four years
that constitutes a single wave then that data is released
and it's available for free to everybody who can then
study it and then you can see if you could
find trends you can create graphs and charts and do
analysis on this data we're gonna be covering a lot
of the analysis because we don't really care about the
raw data itself here we're more interested in the analysis
of what the data means and the the particular people
I want to give credit to here for the some
of the analysis that I'll be offering is Ronald Englehart
of course and his colleague Christian Wells all their central
to some of the analysis that I'll be providing so
the World Values Survey network it's a network of scientists
has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and the
world values database all the raw data is published for
free online you can go and download it at World
Values Survey org alright so that was sort of just
a little bit of the preamble now let's get into
the meat of what this is and I'll be quoting
a little bit here from Wikipedia which describes and does
a nice introduction to what we're talking about wikipedia says
quote the World Values Survey is a global research project
that explores people's values and beliefs how they change over
time and what social and political impact they have the
World Values Survey measures monitors and analyzes the following support
for democracy tolerance for foreigners and ethnic minorities support for
gender equality the role of religion and changing levels of
religiosity the impact of globalization attitudes towards the environment work
family politics national identity culture diversity insecurity and subjective well-being
otherwise known as happiness data from the world value survey
has been used to better understand the motivations behind events
such as the Arab Spring the 2005 French civil unrest
the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the Yugoslav wars and
political upheaval in the 1990s the world value survey has
over the years demonstrated that people's beliefs play a key
role in economic development the emergence and flourishing of democratic
institutions the rise of gender equality and the extent to
which societies have effective government end quote that's all from
the Wikipedia page about the World Values Survey so now
let's start showing you some of the charts and some
of the data from the survey and start to do
the analysis on this so this is perhaps the most
important thing that you need to know about this survey
and here on the screen you're going to see a
slide of the first set of data so what we're
doing here is we're mapping all the countries that we've
surveyed onto two main axes the horizontal and the vertical
on the horizontal x-axis we have the survival versus the
self-expression values so that's going to be one key distinction
is a nation predominantly survival oriented or self-expression oriented and
we'll explain that in a second and then on the
vertical axis we have the the y-axis we have another
dimension that we're going to use for mapping these these
different countries which is traditional values versus secular - rational
values so some countries are more traditional some are more
secular and rational so you can see that slide here
now what does this mean here's a description of traditional
values countries that value traditional values emphasize the importance of
religion parent-child ties deference to Authority and traditional family values
people who embrace these values also reject divorce abort that
abortion euthanasia and suicide these societies have high levels of
national pride and generally a nationalistic outlook okay and then
that contrasts with secular rational values which are the opposite
we might say of traditional values in these societies less
emphasis is placed on religion traditional family values and authority
so in these societies it's not about obedience to Authority
it's more about independent thinking and rationality and in these
societies divorce abortion abortion euthanasia and suicide are seen as
relatively acceptable and then the next axis of course we
have is the survival values versus the self expression values
so here's what the survival values mean in these countries
emphasis is on economic physical security it is linked with
a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and
tolerance high corruption and authoritarian styles of government so in
these countries they are closer to poverty they have more
food shortages and basic physical survival is more difficult so
if you think about Maslow's hierarchy of needs you might
say this is the bottom half of that pyramid all
the very fundamental stuff how do you feed your children
how do you get a job how do you get
basic health care how do you get access to food
and water and such things electricity and then that's contrasted
with the self expression values so in these countries that
are self expressive a high priority is placed on environmental
protection a growing tolerance for foreigners gays lesbians and gender
equality rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and
political life and these countries tend to be more democratic
so in these countries it's the upper half of Maslow's
hierarchy of needs because they've already satisfied the lower half
so then now they're working on the upper half so
these are the different dimensions that we can use to
classify countries now if you look at that slide you
can see how some of the countries are arranged basically
they're arranged into three tiers there's the low income countries
the mid tier and then the high income countries and
this is just measured by GDP and per capita income
so let's just quickly list off some of these so
that were clear what we're talking about so in the
low tier we have countries like Zimbabwe Jordan Morocco Egypt
Bangladesh Iraq Iran Turkey Thailand India Vietnam Russia Romania Colombia
South Africa Peru Pakistan Indonesia Venezuela China Ukraine and Guatemala
and by the way even though we're classifying these countries
and we will be here and what we're gonna be
classifying different regions and people's and real even religions into
like low mid and high tiers be careful not to
confuse this with some sort of racist secret agenda right
we're not saying that these are bad countries we're not
saying that they are irredeemable we're not saying that they
can't outgrow the current position that they're in we're just
evaluating you know stuff like objective measures of their wealth
and corruption and other things like that now the mid-tier
are South Korea Taiwan Hungary Croatia Poland Chile Brazil Mexico
Puerto Rico Argentina Uruguay Malaysia Hong Kong now of course
I know Puerto Rico isn't isn't a country of its
own but anyways it's a region so and then we
have the top tier Germany Japan Italy Spain Ireland the
USA the UK Canada New Zealand Australia France Belgium Norway
Finland Netherlands Denmark Iceland Switzerland Sweden Slovenia the Czech Republic
now of course these designations are somewhat arbitrary somewhat subjective
depends on how you want to categorize them but that
just gives you a little bit of an idea of
how countries can be classified in terms of their level
of success at least economically and then we'll also be
looking at culturally as well we're gonna be matching the
economic and the cultural and we'll see how it all
inter place together so it's not so simple to separate
for example democracy from economic success and from cultural tolerance
these things tend to go hand-in-hand which is why this
data is so valuable it shows us that and we'll
see more that in a minute so the less developed
countries are more traditional and survival oriented in their values
this is spiral dynamics stages purple red and blue the
lower three stages and then the more developed countries tend
to be secular rational and self expressive in their values
and this is spall dynamics orange green and yellow and
above so why is this the case that's what we'll
be looking at it's easy to think like oh well
yeah of course the unsuccessful countries are the religious ones
they're the religious fanatics and the scientific countries they're the
more successful ones and they're the ones associated with Western
culture it's it's much more nuanced than that so be
careful not to take that sort of arrogant position we
have to really take a look at what's going on
here so perhaps the most important thing that needs to
be stressed now is the function of survival in driving
all of these values and dynamics survival drives everything people
don't just adopt values willy-nilly your values are a survival
strategy that the human organism and the super organisms of
your community and your tribe adopt in order to meet
the survival challenges that you're facing and survival is not
just about keeping your body physically safe as I talked
about in my two-part series understanding survival if you haven't
watched those two episodes part 1 and part 2 of
understanding survival go watch those because that will change how
you understand what survival is survival is a much more
robust notion just than just physical survival it includes cultural
survival it includes survival of the self image and identity
that you have and it brings in with it ideology
worldviews dogmas perspectives biases and so forth that all of
this plays into the survival of what you call yourself
and what your society calls itself so it's really about
the survival of identities see so without meeting basic survival
needs you can't evolve and even care about self-expression needs
so of course it makes sense that before you go
caring about creativity and art and truth and consciousness and
all this sorts of stuff first you gotta be able
to feed yourself and clothe your children pretty obvious from
Maslow's hierarchy of needs we can see that just from
your own life you can see that it's for you
to care about the lofty stuff in life when you're
struggling with very basic things you got to take care
of the basics and build upon that foundation that's how
life works right we are dealing with certain physical limitations
and biological limitations when we're talking about life understand that
people around the world and even within your own country
in different regions of your country especially if your country
is is large geographically they face very different survival challenges
not everyone faces your survival challenges and one of the
most tricky things to wrap your mind around here especially
for those of us who grew up in in the
luxury of a first world developed countries in opulent neighborhoods
if you had a good childhood where your parents took
care of all your financial needs basically you never had
a shortage of food you never had a shortage of
electricity and clean water and all the sorts of stuff
was taken care of for you that is not most
people's experience of life around the world that's an exception
to the rule the rule is that many people close
to 40 percent live near poverty near starvation around the
world we just don't see it in the developed countries
because we're sort of in our own little bubble and
if you are watching me chances are you grew up
in such a bubble now of course some of you
did struggle with paying your bills and getting your food
and I totally understand that in which case you have
a little bit of a different appreciation for what real
physical survival challenges are like you're very familiar with the
bottom half of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and I know
that many of you are struggling with that even in
many developed countries people still struggle with that I understand
that but remember we're generalizing here and we're talking about
sociological trends so survival challenges dictate one's beliefs values and
worldview that's crucial to understand most people take their beliefs
values and worldview as function of truth like well I
believe in God I'm a Christian because it's true or
it's like well I'm a capitalist because it's true because
there's something valuable there because I really believe in it
I'm a libertarian because you know that's the right way
to look at the world this is a naive approach
to life when you start to study different perspectives and
why people believe the things they believe and what this
data shows us from the world value survey you start
to see that actually your beliefs values and worldviews are
almost entirely dictated by the survival situation that you grew
up in if you're a Christian you're a Christian only
because you were raised in a Christian family in a
Christian nation most likely of course there's a few exceptions
here and there but most likely if you're a Muslim
you're a Muslim because you were raised in a Muslim
part of the world not because you independently derived Islam
for yourself and independently of your own will decided to
become a Muslim you didn't have a choice about it
you are programmed to be a Muslim and now here's
the kicker that's difficult for many Westerners to swallow if
you're an atheist rationalist secular scientifically minded person that too
is not something you arrived at independently you didn't just
decide to be that way you are that way because
you grew up in a culture in which having those
beliefs values in that worldview was conducive to your survival
and you ain't doing anything original in taking on this
worldview now of course all of us love to rationalize
and justify to ourselves how actually no no no Leo
if I had a choice I would choose the beliefs
and values and worldview that I currently have but that
there that is the ego bullshitting itself so we got
to be careful to not fall into those traps your
worldview and values isn't based on truth it's what was
necessary for you to survive and that's difficult pill for
many people to swallow to admit that just to admit
that is very threatening because it threatens to undermine your
entire foundations of reality imagine admitting that your Christianity is
contingent on something like where you were born not that
it's true in any important way and furthermore imagine acknowledging
that even your scientific worldview is also not true in
any objective sense but is contingent upon the culture you
grew up in see people don't want to admit this
if you could admit this to yourself you're already making
some real good progress because a lot of people get
really stuck at this point so I just wanted to
point that out to you and now we're gonna really
get into the analysis of some of the data I'll
be quoting extensively from Ronald englehart's book called cultural evolution
and I recommend that book if you want you can
go purchase it and read it in detail it explains
a lot of this data but for those of you
who aren't gonna go that deep I'm gonna pull out
some of the best juiciest quotes and then offer some
of my analysis and commentary on them especially sort of
from my perspective for my sort of higher consciousness experiences
and understanding so here we go quote a culture is
a set of learned behaviors that constitutes a serve a
society survival strategy the norms governing this strategy usually change
very slowly often persisting for centuries but under certain conditions
they can change rapidly though fashions change quickly basic values
tend to change slowly through intergenerational population replacement with multi-decade
time lags end quote let's pause and explain this because
this is very important so as I was saying about
survival a culture as a whole what is that that
is a collective survival strategy of millions of people that's
really what a culture is oftentimes we don't think about
it this way oftentimes we think of culture as just
something like you know all well those people over there
do things one way and these people are here do
it another way and it's kind of like well those
people over there are weird they have weird food weird
dress weird customs weird rituals and we over here have
our own if you're an absolutist you think yours is
the best if you're a relativist you think that all
different cultures have different pros and cons but still have
you really contemplated and wondered what is a culture and
why are there different cultures why don't we all just
have one culture and the reason is is because of
course geographically and historically we're trying to survive as humans
and as clans and tribes in different geographies different conditions
in the world which leads to different climate different weather
different animals to each different plants too to use for
medicines a different humidity different numbers of sunlight versus nighttime
hours depending on your you know your latitude and longitude
and all of that on the planet whether you're near
an ocean or you're in a desert all of these
play huge factors which shape culture for example cuisine why
does the Japanese cuisine contain a lot of raw seafood
and seaweed and stuff like that well because they live
on an island and there's a lot of seafood around
you're not gonna find a bunch of raw seafood in
the Middle East why not cuz they live in a
desert there's not much to go around they're difficult to
keep that stuff from perishing when it's 100 degrees outside
see so that's just a little a little example but
of course there's a lot more so all of the
different rituals and and cultural customs and even ways of
dress all of this is adapted to be an optimal
survival strategy in that particular situation in that particular part
of the world but of course not just a part
of the world but also a certain slice of time
so the way you survived in Japan thousand years ago
is not the same way that you survive in Japan
today even though the geography hasn't changed fundamentally it's still
the same in a thousand years not much geographical change
but see what's unique about us humans is that our
culture becomes its own ecosystem so once we start to
create culture unlike other species which mostly adapt to fit
their environment our environment becomes our culture to survive today
you have to survive within a culture to get a
job you have to fit in within the jobs and
skill sets that your culture requires otherwise you won't be
having a profitable job to find a mate to start
a family with to have sex with to spend your
time with this is all cultural in different cultures there
are different ways to find mates it might be an
arranged marriage through social connections it might be by paying
a giant dowry to hire in order to basically buy
your bride and just convince her family to allow you
to marry her and it might be like that or
it might be going to a nightclub and getting drunk
and you know high on Molly and that might be
how you find your true love or it might be
going to Burning Man to some hippy festival in the
middle of nowhere and then there you find your true
love you know different ways of finding your true love
and then of course different ceremonies for how to tie
that knot and different legal codes and bla bla bla
bla bla but why all these differences because people are
in different places and also people have different environments cultural
environments social environments that they're trying to navigate and these
environments they're changing they're not the same the culture of
Japan a thousand years ago is not the one of
today the culture of America 50 years ago is not
the culture of America today and people forget this and
they tend to treat culture as a sort of a
monolithic static thing it's not static at all culture evolves
much quicker then the landscape upon which the culture was
built see and we have to be adaptable to that
and what this World Values Survey data shows is that
values change they change to track the changes in the
culture and of course technology plays a huge part in
this as well because as we develop new technology our
technology literally changes the landscape we clear forests we build
skyscrapers and concrete jungle cities we build suburbs we build
roads and highways and bridges and airplanes and airports and
power plants and cars and computers a lot of people
these days are surviving online we have a whole new
dimension to survival online survival I'm one of those people
I get most of my money through online business you
see so something that's sort of unreal like the Internet
you might say well how tangible is the Internet it's
not very tangible it's almost some sort of virtual space
on the other hand if you do business through the
internet if you're a remote worker that's huge for you
your entire livelihood and survival depends upon having an internet
connection you see literally I'm I'm tied to having a
high-speed Internet connection I can't just go live on some
island somewhere in the middle of of the Pacific Ocean
because they're not gonna be enough internet for me to
even upload one of these episodes and then how am
I gonna eat maybe I'll eat coconut see I'll have
to adapt but that's exactly the point and the trait
of course is that people don't like to adapt the
mind is notoriously rigid and dogmatic and ideological once it
adopts a set of values and a perspective and worldview
it doesn't like to change that and so that's the
part of this quote the second part of the last
part of this quote that's very important which is he
says that basic values change slowly through intergenerational population replacement
and multi-decade time lags so what this means is that
we have generations basically every twenty to thirty years is
a new generation so the time it takes from a
baby to grow up and have its own baby start
its own family that's about 20 to 30 years on
average and so of course what happens is that a
baby is born it gets programmed with all of the
values of the culture and society that it's growing up
in it doesn't really have a choice it just gets
programmed through family through religion through going to church through
going to school going to university hanging with friends going
to work all of that programs you as a baby
and even as a teen and even as a young
adult so the first 20 years of your life you're
just being programmed like a robot and then for the
rest of your life you're gonna be acting out that
programming and you're gonna be very resistant to changing it
it's almost like setting a foundation for a house in
concrete once that foundation is set it's very difficult to
change and that's exactly how the human mind works we've
talked in the past about things like imprinting how the
mind can be imprinted and then it gets stuck within
those imprints and those beliefs it's very difficult to change
those so you know if you were born into a
Christian household and they baptized you from a very early
age and they read you Bible stories and so forth
that becomes the foundation of your sort of mental operating
system that you use to understand the world and it's
going to be very difficult for you to ever transcend
that completely in your life it's set in stone now
that doesn't mean you can't transcend it if you really
wanted to but it'll take serious work and most people
won't do it so what happens is that each generation
sort of leapfrogs the previous generation because when a new
human is born it's soaking up the new values of
the culture but there's a sort of a delay of
20 or 30 years between different generations and so really
society inches along gradually like an inchworm one generation at
a time and as one generation is born on all
generation dies when the old generation dies all of the
values that it had and all this worldviews die with
it and this is actually a very good thing because
it frees up the sort of the that ossified matrix
it makes a little bit more fluid and the new
generation can come in of course it'll take 20 or
30 years for the new generation to really come online
mature into adults and then really have an impact in
the world and that's when we'll see those new set
of values and worldviews start to shape the culture into
something new and this is how society moves forward the
next quote says quote historian Ian Morris after examining a
vast array of historical evidence concludes that each age gets
the thought it needs with foraging farming and industrial societies
developing appropriate value systems through an evolutionary process end quote
C so each age gets the thought it needs so
if you are in a foraging society you're gonna have
world views and beliefs and morality and even spiritual practices
which perfectly suit a foraging society if you're in a
farming society you're gonna have a different set which suit
are suitable for farming if you're in the Internet age
and you spend most your time on social media you're
gonna have a set of world views and beliefs that
fit that getting this the next quote is quote one
of the most pervasive concepts in social science is that
one's basic personality structure crystallizes by the time one reaches
adulthood considerable evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely
fixed when they reach adulthood and change relatively little thereafter
end quote so that's exactly what I was describing with
the sort of setting into concrete your minds operating system
that's exactly what happens and so what you have to
appreciate is that whatever culture and social norms exist today
right now they are mostly enforced by the oldest generations
in our society and that if you want them to
change you basically have to wait for the older generations
to die off to free up the space the cognitive
space we might say for new generations to come in
and change that now of course the old generations can
they're capable of change but by large they don't want
to they're stubborn they're dogmatic they think they're right they're
arrogant their minds are set in stone of course there's
always some exceptional older people whose minds are not set
in stone but that's an exception okay next quote the
feeling that the world is secure or insecure is an
early established and relatively stable aspect of one's outlook when
they are insecure people give top priority to materialistic goals
end quote now this is crucial again because here's one
of the most important factors in determining your worldview or
outlook on the world did you grow up as a
kid in a part of the world where you felt
secure or did you rub in a part where you
felt insecure did you grow up in a war zone
or did you grow up in a nice suburb somewhere
in California this is huge this shapes your entire outlook
on the world if you grew up in a war
zone you're basically gonna treat the whole world as unsafe
you're gonna have that paranoia with you for the rest
of your life because you've seen firsthand how dangerous it
is and it was necessary for you to develop that
sort of paranoia because that kept you alive in that
war zone whereas if you grow up in a cushy
opulent suburban California somewhere with a silver spoon in your
mouth and your parents were millionaires you're so out of
touch with physical insecurity the idea that you can go
hungry you can run out of water or electricity or
basic services or the idea that there's no decent roads
or that the government is corrupt or that the police
are corrupt these these never even entered into your mind
so you grew up in such an idyllic environment that
you take much of this survival for granted and in
a certain sense this is a positive thing because you're
not now paranoid you don't think everyone is out to
get you to screw you over you basically probably believe
that people are nice and decent and that there's no
reason to go to war there's no reason to to
steal loaves of bread and so forth whereas someone who
grew up in a war zone to them stealing loaves
of bread this is this was a necessity of survival
see so these people have very different worldviews and even
if you take one of these insecure people and you
transport them into a modern luxurious environment where they have
all their physical needs taken care of and deep down
their psyche has not been instantly transformed their psyche is
still insecure at some fundamental level and that's going to
affect how they vote what kind of culture they subscribe
to what kind of ideas they have about democracy or
authoritarianism what kind of political people they support and have
their views on gay rights their views on religion and
many other factors right so understand this survival is everything
in determining your worldview it's everything it's so crucial it's
so much more crucial than people give it credit for
next quote there is a huge difference between growing up
knowing that survival is insecure and growing up and taking
survival for granted end quote so that's exactly what I
was just explaining it's nice to be able to grow
up to he survival for granted in a sense we
need that because that's what actually ultimately leads to the
progression and evolution of culture culture used to a lot
more brutish violent and unfair because a thousand or 2,000
years ago almost everybody was living in a part of
the world which was insecure but as we developed more
technology and more material wealth as we build better infrastructure
better bureaucracies better governments we craft new constitutions which give
more civil rights in all of this and we create
better government as we do that we're moving out of
insecurity towards security as we become more secure were afforded
luxuries like compassion and empathy and caring about social justice
and democracy in all of these sorts of quote-unquote luxuries
that many of us take for granted in first world
countries it's difficult for someone who grew up in a
first world country to appreciate that democracy isn't just something
that comes about naturally or organically not everyone is just
born believing in democracy or freedom of speech or equal
rights for men and women or tolerance of homosexuality or
appreciation of science these are things that had to be
hard fought for over millennia and over centuries you in
a sense if you're living in a personal country you're
standing on the shoulders of giants on a pyramid or
on a pyramid of the corpses of millions of and
of your ancestors all the old generations it's almost like
in you know in geology they have different sediments you
can slice through mountain there's different sedimentary layers well that's
how human society is - in developed societies advanced societies
we have many many layers that we take for granted
but those layers are absolutely crucial as soon as those
letters stopped a function everything falls apart see and also
you need understand that in other parts of the world
where those layers haven't been built up yet well you
can expect that they won't be able to appreciate some
of the things you appreciate because you already have those
layers in place see you might go to some place
like in Saudi Arabia you might wonder oh my god
is there is so barbaric there they they sentence homosexuals
to death and they barely even let women drive and
women have to wear these these black burkas that cover
their whole body it seems so crude and barbaric why
don't they just throw a party at the pool and
everyone's walking around in bikinis and listening to pop music
I said no you don't get it they haven't developed
themselves to that as a culture see this is a
matter of life and death for them it's not just
a matter of like all yeah let's just be nicer
to women no no no you have to understand that
in Western cultures we also had those same things just
it might have been hundreds of years ago it might
been thousands of years ago but we had the same
sorts of attitudes we've just evolved and they evolved less
now why did they evolve less that's a different issue
and we're not gonna tackle that too much here but
suffice to say that it's not because they're an inferior
race there's a lot of geological geographical factors and just
historical developmental factors involved there so it's not it's not
that one culture is better than another culture every culture
has its pros and cons some cultures developed faster than
others in different environments depending on all the factors involved
there's thousands of factors involved there's no one single factor
to explain it let's keep quoting here quote individuals under
stress yearn for rigid predictable rules they want to be
sure of what's going to happen because survival is precarious
and their margin of error is slender conversely people raised
under conditions of relative security can tolerate more ambiguity and
have less need for the absolute and rigid rules that
religions provide people with relatively high levels of existential security
can more readily accept deviations from familiar patterns than people
with who are uncertain that their survival needs will be
met and quote so this is crucial as well see
you might wonder how is it possible that in certain
blessed of all parts of the world they actually vote
for autocrats and tyrants into office how come they're not
all clamoring for democracy because democracy is actually something that
is a luxury that comes later if you or your
society and your culture are under a serious existential threat
like there's a threat of war or invasion you will
gladly take an authoritarian or a dictator and throw out
democracy and free speech and you will impose rigid rules
because the most important thing for you is survival not
free speech not individual liberties those are all luxuries that
come only once you've handled your basic survival see so
people who are on the brink of starvation they're much
more open to rigid rules they're much more open to
strongmen and leaders who could come and take charge and
try to lead them out of that situation so the
crucial mistake that many Westerners and so-forth make is they
look at an autocrat or a dictator somewhere they say
oh my god is so terrible he's so evil how
could he oppress his his fellow countrymen that way no
you don't get it that's not what's going on it's
not that he's evil it's that the conditions the survival
conditions in that part of the world at that time
in human history are such that the citizens themselves put
forth such a person to take charge and lead them
out of that situation in that situation your simple democracy
doesn't work for a democracy to work you need to
have some rule of law democracy doesn't work when I
can aka 47 and just go shoot your family you
can't have a democracy that way and there are many
parts in the world where that's how issues are settled
rather than going to court people come at each other
with knives and with guns with pitchforks see you have
to develop a court system you can develop a police
system which is not corrupt in order to handle these
sorts of issues such that then we can go to
a forum a public square and debate out our differences
democratically so to speak and then we can go to
a to a voting booth and vote democratically for something
right to be able to vote democratically there need to
be on intimidated voters the voters need to have a
certain level of education they need to be literate they
need to be able to read the names on the
on the ballots and all this might seem so basic
that you might think that everyone has this but no
just a few hundred years ago the majority of the
world's population was illiterate I don't know what the rate
is now but it's it's still substantial see next quote
threats increase the need for strong norms and punishment for
deviant behavior to maintain order tight societies with autocratic governing
systems that suppress dissent provide strong deterrence and control of
crime and tend to be more religious nations that encountered
severe ecological and historical threats have relatively strong norms and
low tolerance for deviant behavior and quote so this explains
a lot of why like for example in the Middle
East or that they have very low tolerance for homosexuality
for feminism they can be quite xenophobic and and so
forth and they're also very very religious is because that
religion is a sort of a binder it binds people
together into a nation or into a tribe or into
a clan and it keeps people aligned thinking in a
certain direction valuing the same things one of the greatest
challenges is managing a group of people whose values are
incoherent with each other you know one person believes he
can do this other person believes he can do that
and there's a thousand such people how do you get
so many people to work together against a common enemy
let's say we have a tribe of a thousand people
and we're gonna we're gonna have invaders coming in next
month well what's gonna happen if you know I decide
to just go spend the next month having sex somebody
else decides to go then spend the next month playing
video games somebody else decides to spend the next month
you know starting a business we're gonna get exterminated we
could get together mean to come up with a common
set of values and things we can agree upon that
will bind us together so that we can act as
one larger unit of a thousand to fend off this
invader we're gonna build a wall we're gonna build weapons
whatever to do it see so under these conditions you
don't have the luxury to just go and play video
games or go have sex with whoever you want or
to to be homosexual or to to advocate for women's
rights and so forth and I'm not justifying these things
as proper I'm just saying this is simply what's required
to survive in that particular situation if it is sometimes
it isn't required but sometimes it is so in these
sorts of societies where they're closer to physical danger where
they're not as secure they tend to be a lot
more conformist there's a lot less individual expression or room
or tolerance for that you follow the norms you obey
Authority because the Authority is the thing that keeps you
alive whether it's the church authority or the government authority
or even a local authority like a chieftain or an
elder next quote submission to Authority has high costs the
individuals personal goals must be subordinated to those of others
under conditions of insecurity people are willing to do so
under threat of invasion civil war or economic collapse people
tend to seek strong military figures who can protect them
from danger conversely prosperity and security are conducive to tolerance
of diversity this helps explain a long-established finding that rich
societies are much likelier to be Democratic than poor ones
under conditions of insecurity people may readily submit to authoritarian
rule and quote which is just what I was describing
so next here I want to show you a chart
and this chart here on the horizontal axis shows the
percent emphasising self expression values and then on the vertical
axis it shows the level of effective democracy in the
country and what we can see here is a very
clear trend that those countries which have the most effective
democracies which means the democracy is the least corrupt it
works the best for the most people in those countries
countries such as Finland New Zealand Canada Australia Switzerland Denmark
the United States the United Kingdom Iceland so forth in
these countries they have a very strong emphasis on self
expressive values these are values of free speech individual rights
the right to Liberty life and happiness all that sort
of stuff this stuff in the Constitution civil rights and
so forth whereas countries like Zimbabwe or Pakistan or Jordan
or Bangladesh in these countries democracy is very ineffective there's
virtually no democracy there they're highly corrupt and of course
they emphasize survival values not self expression values because they're
struggling just to maintain themselves and then in the next
slide here this is some data which is completely separate
from the World Values Survey but I wanted to introduce
it here anyways because it correlates nicely this is some
data from the transparency international organization this is the 2018
Corruption Perceptions Index the CPI they call it so this
is a number from 0 to 100 so this nonprofit
organization basically tracks and monitors the corruption levels of police
courts and governments in all countries around the world and
they give a number from 0 to 100 zero meaning
totally corrupt 100 meaning squeaky-clean and you can see what
this looks like and you can see that many of
the Western countries especially northern European countries countries in North
America are some of the least corrupt Australia and New
Zealand's these are some of the least corrupt countries and
then the most corrupt countries are often in parts of
Asia of course a lot in Africa South America Russia
Eastern Europe and and so on and this correlates very
nicely with the World Values Survey data because the more
corrupt your country is the less democracy it has and
vice versa and here in the following slide is the
same data but now just displayed in a different way
you can see the different levels of democracy and how
countries are arranged here and the corruption index is going
horizontally and then vertically is the different levels of democracy
so there's full democracy flawed democracy hybrid regimes and autocratic
regimes at the very bottom those four levels you can
see going horizontally across so yeah it's pretty self-explanatory there
and you can see just how well a full democracy
tracks with low corruption and just how well high corruption
tracks with autocratic regimes down at the very bottom at
the left all right so let's do some more quotes
quote economic development brings systemic changes in society's beliefs and
values 40 percent of the world's population is moving from
starvation level poverty to a modest level of Economic Security
all of the low income and lower middle income societies
again without a single exception fall into the lower left-hand
zone which is the traditional slash survival value oriented world
view a very clear that's a very clear correlation from
this data quote low income societies remain solidly opposed to
gender equality and tolerance of gays & quot why is
this is it because they're ignorant and closed-minded and evil
and bad people no it's because in a low-income society
maintaining that strong family unit that traditional family unit is
very important to be able to survive see and in
these societies there's clear delineation of roles for genders the
woman is supposed to take care of the kids the
man is supposed to take care of the woman and
the kids by going to work and this is just
how it's arranged because that's how it has to be
arranged to survive in that environment in those conditions now
of course as you outgrow that as the environment conditions
change a society becomes more technological a man no longer
needs to support the family so much the woman is
able to support herself and her kids more because technology
equalizes that physical difference between the strengths of them you
know the brute physical strength between men and women which
on average exists and then there's more tolerance for homosexuality
in more advanced societies because now it's not so important
to raise eight children to help you to maintain your
farm now you can be sexually promiscuous and you can
even not have children and that's considered okay because the
society already has a massive population by that point it's
overpopulated so it's not so important to breathe I Kravitz
you can sustain yourself even with one or two children
or no children there are systems in place that when
you get old you don't need children to take care
of you you can earn enough money to put in
a bank account put it in some IRA and then
live off that savings get an annuity live off of
it and retire live in a retirement home but you
see in low-income societies there are no retirement homes the
children have to take care of the parents when they
get old see so having lots of children in disease
is their insurance policy in a developed society we have
social security in a low income Society the Social Security
is having eight children and not being gay that's the
Social Security now again make sure you don't misunderstand me
I am NOT justifying homophobia I'm not making any judgments
about it one way or another I'm not saying it's
good or bad right or wrong I'm just explaining where
it's coming from it's a survival thing your worldview is
a survival thing and if you're homosexual realize that that's
only because you're living in a certain society that allows
you to be all openly homosexual that's a luxury probably
in most other times and places in the world you
would have had to kept that keep that deeply under
wraps because if they found out you would have been
excommunicated demonized tarred and feathered or even executed or locked
in jail which is not to say there weren't homosexuals
2,000 years ago of course they were but it was
just treated very differently even homosexuals themselves thought of themselves
very differently 2,000 years ago than the way they think
today because world views have evolved even homosexual people have
evolved their own world views about themselves that's all part
of cultural evolution and that's all part of survival next
quote people who experience threats to themselves and their families
or their communities during their faith their formative years tend
to be far more religious than those who grew up
under say safer and more predictable conditions end quote so
this is big because religion is one of the strongest
forces for unifying people under one common banner or umbrella
of values religion helps to set up a moral system
that people can agree upon which is why religion plays
such a huge survival function religion is not just people
the way that way that's some atheists portray it or
some rationalist portrays like oh well religion is just believing
in the Flying Spaghetti Monster because you're stupid and because
you don't want to think rationally about the world no
no religion is a is a very powerful mind-control device
that gets disparate people to come together and to create
a proto legal system because without religion how do you
get people to agree on what's right and what's wrong
you might say oh that's obvious just you know leo
you can be an atheist and you can still be
moral you don't need to be religious to be moral
maybe not but still that relativism this idea that you
can just say well you know cannibalism is it really
wrong or is it sort of just something that we
invented to even have the luxury to consider that maybe
cannibalism is something that's only relatively wrong and not absolutely
wrong or to consider that homosexuality is only relatively wrong
and not absolutely wrong those those sorts of considerations already
are only possible in advanced societies that have already met
their survival needs you see one of the functions of
religion and for example and a lot of people criticize
Islam as being a negative force in the world but
these people don't really understand the function that Islam played
back when it was invented Islam wasn't affected today Islam
was invented in 400 AD or something like that in
the Middle East totally different survival conditions at that time
there in the Middle East it was tribal warfare it
was tribes slaughtering other tribes they didn't even have the
ability to set up a nation that could defend itself
why not because you had so many different tribes all
these tribes had their own clan alliances and allegiances and
identities and they couldn't even agree with each other about
the fact that it's not right to kill people insane
so there was so much bloodshed going on there Islam
was a unifying force that was able to unify the
different tribes in the Middle East and allow them to
advance to become larger nation states and countries see it
created a sort of a moral code to which everybody
in that very conflicted region could agree to and then
by following these strict rules they were able to reach
a new level of peace and prosperity now of course
today you might look at and say well but today
the Middle East is one of the least developed regions
of the world that's right but you have to always
look at it within the context historically as it developed
so it doesn't really matter where it's at today today
it might not be so developed and maybe today Islam
is holding the Middle East back maybe it is but
you also have to consider what would happen if you
got rid of it or if it wasn't there in
the first place it might be much worse always consider
that if you get rid of something in society you
think is it necessary that might actually make things much
worse than you assumed they would be now you say
well why can't I just become atheists they could of
course but that will take the more evolution to get
there and of course the challenge with survival is precisely
that those rigid systems you at one level of survival
to survive you're gonna have to transcend those and release
and detach from those to reach the next level of
survival and so on and so on and so on
that's what all spiral dynamics is about each stage to
ascend up each stage you have to let go of
the previous stage you have to recognize its limitations you
have to sort of detach from it but that the
minds ability to detach is is quite rare most minds
attach to stuff and don't let go until they're dead
you see so this is what's going on here's a
chart that shows on the horizontal axis we have um
same-sex legislation scale which basically shows you how lenient legislation
is in a various in various countries or their attitude
towards towards sex how permissive they are and then on
the on the vertical axis is whether these are self
expressive values or based sort of traditional values and what
you see here is clearly how the different countries align
countries like in Sweden Norway Canada Spain and so forth
basically same-sex marriage has been legalized and then in countries
like Iran Saudi Arabia Bangladesh and so forth you get
the death penalty basically for for homosexuality so it just
shows you the differences very clearly and keep in mind
whatever you think you know if you have to take
this attitude that well I live an advanced country and
we are so much better than all the other countries
so much more advanced keep in mind that that's only
a recent development if you rewind the clock 500 years
even the most progressive countries of today would look a
lot like Saudi Arabia and Iran just keep that in
mind if you are in advanced country today it's not
because you are just part of some master race of
people who are smarter wiser more compassionate by default no
it's because you've already gone through all that other stuff
you've gone through the barbarity that certain other countries are
still struggling with today you're a little bit further ahead
that doesn't actually make you better you see you're basically
just standing on the shoulders of giants that came before
you next quote in traditional societies up to 95 percent
of the public say that god is very important in
their lives yet in secular rational societies as few as
3 percent do in survival oriented societies up to 96
percent of the public say that homosexuality is never justifiable
and in self-expression oriented societies as few as six percent
do end quote so you see this is not just
merely a matter of like do you believe in the
Flying Spaghetti Monster this is this is life-and-death stuff and
if you don't see it as life-and-death stuff that's because
you already have your life-and-death stuff taken care of and
you have the luxury to not look at it as
life-and-death stuff and then you can start to make arguments
about Flying Spaghetti Monster 'z and you can start advocating
for homosexual rights and women's rights and all this sorts
of good stuff only because we've gotten to that point
because there's bureaucratic systems there's education systems there's Technology there's
all this stuff there's a decent economy that enables this
there's a lack of threat from the outside your nation
isn't being invaded there's no threat of you getting raped
and butchered and murdered these are real threats that many
people face in the world if you don't face the
threat of rape murder genocide theft on a daily basis
you're and living your living the good life appreciate what
you have that's not how it was for most of
mankind for most of mankind's history quote the shift from
survival values to self-expression values also includes a shift in
child-rearing values from emphasis on hard work towards emphasis on
imagination and tolerance as important values to teach children and
quote so this is a good way to see where's
a person at you can ask someone like ask your
friend for example if you have children would you prioritize
teaching them hard work or would you prioritize prioritize teaching
them imagination and tolerance what you'll find is that if
your friend is highly developed and lives in a developed
country grew up in a developed country and feel secure
about his survival or her survival then they will tell
you that of course imagination tolerance is much more important
than hard work but if your friend is from some
poor struggling country they will tell you hard work is
everything and imagination and tolerance that's some fluffy [ __
] stuff that is intangible that's some woowoo stuff which
is why for example parents in India and in China
they drive their children like slave masters they push their
children to get solid well-paying jobs engineering jobs computer programming
jobs doctor jobs lawyer jobs why because those parents come
from these countries like India and China which were at
poverty levels 40 years ago they still have huge poverty
today but 40 years ago it was even worse millions
of people in China and indeed in India die from
poverty so for them these parents the worst thing that
they can imagine for their children is that their children
end up in poverty so of course they push their
children to to work extra hard study extra hard get
college degrees get good well-paying jobs and when you tell
one of these pairs that you want to become a
philosopher or an artist or a musician or a poet
what do they do they they they can't take you
seriously because from their point of view survival Trump's everything
and to them survival means you got to be a
sigh like a doctor or a lawyer to earn good
money otherwise you ain't surviving so these parents are looking
out for their children but also what these parents don't
realize is that survival conditions change so China in India
today are not as bad as they were 40 years
ago there is more opportunity to be an artist to
be a poet to follow your dreams to be more
imaginative to be more tolerant of course there's more opportunity
for this but there's also still dangers it is still
possible that you get some philosophy degree and then you
end up broke and then you know come begging your
parents for money which they may not have and then
you become homeless and then what see but if if
you grew up in a country where your parents are
rich have plenty of money then your parents will not
push you hard to be working all the time they
will give you more more of a push to be
more imaginative more artistic more tolerant and more liberal generally
speaking next quote people who emphasize serve out survival values
tend to be significantly less satisfied with their lives and
less happy than people with self-expression values and code so
this is an important point which basically says that there
is a clear trend and a reason for why societies
move from survival values to self expression values because it
increases happiness overall as a human you don't get much
satisfaction from just meeting your basic survival needs from eating
[ __ ] having sex going to work this produces
a relatively mild level of satisfaction the true satisfaction in
life is found when you can be artistic creative free
to pursue your life purpose and your vision for the
world when you are free to be spiritual not in
some stifled religious way but you can be spiritual in
your authentic way the way that's true for you see
but these things are luxuries for most people so don't
take that for granted if you have these opportunities which
is where self actualization comes into play self actualization is
basically what you do after you've satisfied the majority of
your basic survival needs then you start to ask the
question what's next what do I do with my life
how do I impact the world how do I be
creative how do I live a life of purpose how
do I help uplift others how do I grow myself
cognitively morally spiritually how do I educate myself to to
higher levels how do I understand more of the world
how do I become more conscious how do I find
out what the truth is where did reality come from
all these sorts of questions now become important to you
whereas before it was just about eating [ __ ]
having sex making money so here's a chart which shows
and maps the GDP on the horizontal axis this is
per capita GDP basically this is the wealth of the
country per person per citizen and then on the vertical
axis is life satisfaction means score which is just basically
how happy are people in this country so which you
can clearly see is that the the people with the
highest happiness the countries that have highest happiness basically tend
to be the wealthier countries there's a correlation there and
and then at the very bottom of this chart the
bottom left you see basically the poorest countries and they
have the lowest life satisfaction scores which makes sense I
mean if you live in Iraq in some war-torn part
of the world it's gonna be harder for you to
be happy because it's harder for you to get access
to basic things that you need and it's harder for
you to live from your heart and to follow your
heart without a bunch of restrictions but also notice what
this chart shows it shows that for the bottom half
of this chart basically with the with this kind of
curve shows is that for countries which are lower income
and have weak economies for them one of the fastest
ways to raise the happiness of everyone in that country
is to build better infrastructure and develop a higher economy
that works for everybody more equally that is the fastest
way to raise your happiness there on average but then
countries who are towards the second half of the chart
in these countries you can raise the economy more but
you're gonna get diminishing returns in terms of satisfaction and
happiness so once you have most of your basic needs
met at that point chasing more money chasing luxury is
not going to lead to a lot of fulfilment and
that's what a lot of movie stars and wealthy people
discover because after a certain amount of money more money
doesn't really do anything for you then you need to
be switching over to self-actualization work to spiritual work to
growing yourself to contributing back to society that's where the
real fulfillment comes from not from a better economy which
is one of the reasons why in American politics for
example you know many politicians in America push for you
know more more capitalism even better economy and while I
can understand that many people in America do want more
job opportunities and many people in America are still struggling
with poverty and so forth don't forget we even have
poverty in America and in Europe it still exists but
still this emphasis on just never ending growth of the
economy never ending growth of the stock market this becomes
counterproductive after a while and what a lot of Americans
need is not more of the economy what they need
is they need more personal development work which really is
getting badly neglected as we go chasing material success so
be careful about that but also what this chart shows
you is that if you are in a country where
you're struggling materially there's nothing wrong with handling your basic
material needs you need some of that in order to
have a sort of a foundation from which you can
do the rest of the work and I do see
this problem with some of my students some of you
guys I know are in underdeveloped countries some of you
are from Iraq some of you are in Iran some
of you are in the Middle East or in Asia
somewhere or even in Africa and hey I totally get
it it's much harder to self actualize from those countries
you don't have the same resources you don't have the
same economic power it's hard for you to even like
buy a self-help course because your money is so devalued
relative to a country that would have produced a self-help
course in them in the first place you know like
you're not gonna find a self-help course made in Africa
for the most part self up courses are made in
America or in Europe see and you're gonna have to
be paying dollars or euros for it and you're you
know your African currency is not gonna match up very
well against dollars and euros you might not even be
able to afford a course like this that's right that
makes it harder for you now of course don't turn
this into a limiting belief I'm not saying it's impossible
but it is harder and it's important for us to
acknowledge that it's harder you know so don't don't let
people Gaslight you if you're in India if you're in
China if you're somewhere in the Middle East yeah you're
gonna have a difficult more difficult time studying my work
and embodying my work because chances are that your family
and your culture are gonna be at such a low
level of development and also economically there's gonna be less
opportunity for you so because of this you're gonna struggle
with more basic survival needs and people will judge you
more for deviating from traditional cultural values your parents won't
understand this thing called non-duality you know good luck convincing
your friends and your family that you're a god when
you awaken they won't be so understanding cuz they can
barely tolerate homosexuality let alone the idea that you're God
even though you are even though they are but hey
you know they're not at a level where they can
open their minds to that so it will be harder
and of course one of the best things you can
do if you're in a you know one of these
poorer countries and if you really care about self-actualization is
find some way to move to a better country but
if you can't and I understand many of you can't
or don't want to then you can still you can
still improve yourself greatly it'll just be more difficult all
right so just let's acknowledge that all right this next
chart I have for you shows some trends of where
countries and parts of the world have moved over the
last few decades in terms of their values so we
can see for example Japan has made a big leap
from survival to self expression values and then Protestant Europe
as well Catholic Europe a little bit less english-speaking countries
as well but then there are some countries that actually
you can see some regressions for example Russia you can
see a serious regression from secular rational values to traditional
values and the reason that is is because under communism
it was sort of dictated from above that God was
outlawed religion was outlawed in all of Russia for example
the entire USSR so once that collapsed in the 1919
90s then traditional values what the doc's Christianity came back
into full force there because it was never really transcended
or outgrown it was merely suppressed from up high so
that's what that's what explains for example the the Russian
trends in China as well you know China has been
dealing with a lot of poverty and a lot of
political upheavals so that explains why there's a little bit
of progression there but overall also you know China has
done a lot to secure its survival in the last
60 years let's say and and so oftentimes when you
see this sort of regression from secular traditional values to
traditional values that's when nationalism also becomes a powerful force
in politics so we can see nationalism in Russia we
can the nationalism in China we can see nationalism in
ex-communists Europe we can see nationalism on the rise in
India as of late we can see nationalism on their
eyes for example in Brazil so do keep that at
night and one of the things that leads to the
rise of nationalism is a situation where people feel that
their survival is more threatened so for example when the
economy starts doing worse people are much more likely to
go nationalistic because basically they're operating out of fear and
they're looking for some strong authoritarian to come in and
rally them together and to maybe push something through but
oftentimes of course this ends up backfiring and they end
up regretting it in the long run kind of like
with Nazi Germany all right let's keep going here quote
life experience pectin sees incomes and school attendance rose from
1970 to 2010 in every region of the world poverty
illiteracy and mortality are declining globally and war crime rates
and violence have been declining for many decades end quote
so this is important to acknowledge sometimes people boo moan
that society is regressing especially lately with the rise of
Trump or various nationalist movements around the world people you
know turn on the news and they say all this
negative stuff on the news and they say oh my
god the world is going to hell the world is
not really going to hell the world right now is
the best that's ever been it's the freest that's ever
been it's the wealthiest that's ever been it's the more
fair and just than it's ever been and you might
say well that's crazy there's we have high income inequality
we still have plenty of racism and homophobia and xenophobia
and nationalism and all this how could you possibly say
that well you're not appreciating just how much worse it
used to be culture and society is always progressing forward
even when there are temporary setbacks and there can be
some serious temporary setbacks but it's always progressing forward towards
higher consciousness higher complexity and higher love and that's something
that's challenging to explain to you if if you don't
have a high perspective to see that but that is
the case that is the trend and that's what can
keep you optimistic and hopeful about mankind is that we
are progressing forward now you might say we're not progressing
forward fast enough well of course fast enough slow that
this is relative fast enough compared to what compared to
your lifetime maybe but then again culture changes quite a
lot like even just in America take a look at
our politics twenty years ago the idea of legalization of
recreational marijuana this was opposed by the majority of people
and it was considered outrageous and wrong and today the
trends have completely flipped and likely in the next ten
years America will legalize marijuana at a federal level because
we've already done it in many of the states and
it seems to be working fine people are happy with
it there seems to be no problem even many of
the conservatives are now not really against banning marijuana views
have changed in the last twenty years on that issue
same thing with gay rights 20 years ago the idea
of gay marriage even in liberal circles many liberal politicians
Democratic politicians would have laughed you out of the room
to say that we would have gay marriage recognized by
the Supreme Court and yet today it is and today
even many conservatives and Republicans basically have resigned themselves to
accept that gay marriage is a thing it's not going
away any anytime soon gay rights are just gonna become
more robust I mean it's just like you can't put
that genie back in the bottle and this is happening
on many levels now of course there are some you
know regressive trends especially with Trump and the Conservatives in
power now yes there's regressive trends but you have to
have a long time horizon you have to see that
these regressive trends will play themselves out and these regressive
trends are merely a launching point for even more progressive
trends coming in the future and why do I say
this with such certainty is it because I'm some bleeding-heart
liberal and social justice warrior no it's because look at
the data look at the data look at human history
look at what's been happening over the last 2,000 years
of human history we went from being complete animals and
barbarians to being animals and barbarians only part-time that's big
progress name I said all 2,000 years that's a long
time well relative to your lifetime it's a long time
but actually it's pretty quick in the evolutionary time so
actually even though it seems like progress is slow it's
much faster than anything else evolution is done that we
know about technology is advancing very quickly culture is advancing
quite quickly it's a conveyancing so quickly that actually we
have these regressive nationalist movements why do we have them
because the culture is advancing so quickly to try to
keep pace with the technology which is advancing even quicker
that a lot of people are being left behind and
they're scared what's gonna happen with automation well how do
we handle you know legalization of drugs and homosexuality and
sexual promiscuity and all the sort of stuff you know
how do we deal with birth control pills and women
having control over their reproductive body and and going to
work all of these things these are relatively new developments
that many people are still like struggling to wrap their
mind around because most people have very simple minds that
are not processing all of this information most people go
to school maybe they finish college and then that's it
that's the end of their education they don't learn anymore
they don't grow anymore now they coached off of that
and they and they look for ways to validate and
entrench themselves in their worldview they're living in a bubble
of their friends and they have to live that way
in a sense because that's how they survive as the
kind of self that they are for them to survive
in a different way you could say well Leo can
they just grow they can grow but that means they'd
have to face the fear of surrendering their ego self
which of course they don't want to do can Christians
outgrow Christianity of course but that means they have to
die as a Christian identity they want that no that's
the last thing in the world they want they're terrified
of that therefore we have Christianity being dogmatic same thing
with Islam same thing with scientism same thing with atheists
same thing with rationalist so don't think that this is
all just some something to blame on simple-minded primitive religious
people no scientific people face exactly the same challenges just
on a slightly higher level next quote if economic collapse
occurs cultural changes start to move in the opposite direction
so we've already touched on that next quote two-thirds of
the average countries respondents fall within one standard deviation of
their country's mean score on both dimensions and 95% fall
into two standard deviations despite globalization nations remain an important
unit of shared experience and the predictive power of nationality
is much stronger than that of income education region or
sex end quote now this is an important point so
it's a little technical here he talks about standard deviations
all this really means is that if you're within a
country the similarity you share within the country with your
fellow citizens is much stronger than the than the similarity
between for example your same gender in a different country
or your same religion in a different country see and
the reason that is is because each country basically has
its own national education system this education system indoctrinates children
and you it indoctrinated you with a set of values
a shared set of values which sort of define what
that country is a certain language a set of values
a certain religious orientation or a secular one if that's
what your country is is into and that creates a
sort of a shared experience of your fellow citizens which
is distinctly different from that of some other far away
country or even a neighboring one for that matter see
so you might think that women living in America have
a lot in common with women living in India because
they're both women and you would think like well women
are all women so all women should be for feminism
and women's rights right because in America women are for
feminism I mean the majority of are are for gender
equality and you know they stress the importance of dinner
club but in India many women are not and you
might wonder why is that that's because totally different levels
of development totally different education systems totally different cultures you
see so it's not just about breaking people down in
terms of gender income education or sexuality a lot more
depends upon their values it's much more accurate to break
people down across their values are their survival value oriented
or are they suffix pression value oriented are they traditional
value oriented or are they secular rational value oriented these
are far better dividing lines than something like gender next
quote individualism is not a static individual level psychological attribute
it is shaped by a society's level of development modernization
facilitates a shift away from collectivism towards individualism bringing increasing
emphasis on individual autonomy weakening traditional hierarchical norms and quote
so this one is for you libertarians out there who
tend to treat everyone as an individual and think that
everyone is just individually responsible for themselves no it's never
really been this way this is a modern development individualism
is only facilitated by collectivism you can only be an
individual in a modern society because of the technology and
all of the bureaucracy that has been built up by
government this is the the chief absurdity of libertarianism this
idea that we should do away with government and all
just live as individuals no if you do away with
government you can only live as a tribe you're gonna
have less individualism when you get rid of government not
more if you take a look at primitive tribes they're
extremely collectivist there's no room for individualism in some Amazonian
tribe they're your entire sense of individualism is erased and
you're part of a a giant tribal unit you don't
think of yourself as an individual there you're not gonna
have a libertarian philosophy in one of these tribes because
in these tribes these tribes can only survive in the
middle of the Amazon when they work together and they
share collective responsibilities they live as a commune which is
sort of the last thing that some of these libertarians
want it's only because of how far we've come that
today you can be an alienated individual in a developed
first world country and you could sit at home on
the Internet earn your money off the internet or something
like that and you can be relatively comfortable and you
can make snarky libertarian comments online about how we should
do away with government and how taxation is theft and
all the sorts of nonsense because you've completely neglected your
roots and the foundation upon which this individualism is built
see when you take a look at a group of
chimpanzees they are not individuals they act as a social
unit and they work together they live as a commune
that's where humans came from there was never a time
in human history where humans lived as some romantic lone
individual off in the forest chopping my own trees and
providing myself with my own security this this was never
the case it's impossible because those people who band together
can create a more powerful tribe and they will simply
go and attack any individuals they will rape them they
will enslave them or they will kill them so individualism
doesn't work at that level individuals have comes about later
once we've got court systems laws taxation a strong government
police roads and all this or stuff then you can
be an individual and even so society oscillates between individualist
and collectivist and that's what sprawl dynamics will teach you
if you watch my multi-part series on spousal dynamics each
biodynamic stage is either more individualistic or collectivist and it
swings back and forth there's no there's no sense of
like collectivism is evil and individualism is the best or
vice-versa it's always finding the right balance and always the
kind of an oscillating swinging back and forth to find
that sweet spot and of course it's all about what
fits your environment in certain environments it's more conducive to
be collectivist in your worldview and in other environments it's
more conducive to be individualistic in your worldview and if
you happen to be an arch libertarian that's because you
grew up in an environment that has made survival easy
for you as an individualist that's why it's not because
libertarianism is true or individualism is the best or something
like this this is these are you know fantasies you
tell yourself to justify how it is that you're surviving
because you're not conscious of how it is that you're
surviving and why you do the things you do necessitated
by certain survival conditions next quote simply holding elections will
not establish effective democracy in the Muslim world end quote
that was pretty obvious when the United States invaded Iraq
under george w bush in the in the aftermath of
9/11 it was pretty obvious that it wouldn't work yet
we were bamboozled and promised by the likes of Dick
Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz and George W Bush and and
all of his cronies that if we just if we
just topple Saddam Hussein and throw him out we can
establish a flourishing democracy and everything will be nice and
and and peachy in that part of the world no
because the problem is it wasn't saddam hussein that was
the problem like I said earlier the problem is the
level of development of the entire population their value system
you can topple Saddam Hussein but you cannot change the
value system of every Muslim in Iraq or Syria you
can't do it they have to grow themselves through that
see Saddam Hussein would have naturally been toppled as Muslims
in that part of the world developed more and moved
from survival values to self expressive values it might have
taken 50 years or a hundred years there might have
been other dictators that came after him and of course
that I was saying was a terrible dictator and he
you know brutally murdered many people but on the other
hand you have to take into account that murdering of
of many people that he did why was that necessary
was it because he was a monster no it was
because that's how business is conducted in that part of
the world under that value system because there are many
conflicting tribes and if you take out Saddam Hussein you
might get something worse like Isis like terrorism so as
bad as Saddam Hussein was he wasn't a terrorist in
the same way that that many terrorists groups are in
that region now he was actually interested in building a
stronger unified nation of Iraq where as many of these
terrorists in that region now they're not interested in that
they're interested in building sort of Caliphate or you know
doing other kinds of low consciousness things and the next
quote here is quote Islamic fundamentalist see Western culture as
something to guard against end quote and that's generally true
of of all secular trends every time there's a secular
trend in society there's always a countervailing fundamentalist trend fundamentalism
is a reaction against the secularization of society which is
why there are Christian fundamentalists Islamic fundamentalist Hindu fundamentalists Buddhist
fundamentalists and and others because the world is becoming more
secular and as that happens those old egos are clinging
to the old belief systems that they're trying to preserve
old traditions and so then there's a fundamentalist backlash against
this secularization because they view the secularization as a collapse
of society as a existential threat you see if you
grew up in a survival situation where religion was the
sort of the binding force that brought everything together and
gave life meaning and allowed you to survive and to
thrive it to some degree then when you see others
trying to secularize society and remove those religious elements you
could look at that you can say well great that
means we're gonna go to the next level or you
could look at it say no that's terrible because that
means we're losing all of our traditions and all the
things that make us who we are of course that's
a fear-based egoic reaction which basically all fundamentalists are are
prone to and guilty of but you should also understand
why it is that they feel that way because they're
afraid because they're insecure because they don't understand that the
next level could be that's even better than we then
we currently have you see so if you want to
if you want to really help fundamentalists help them to
see that there's a next level and that they don't
need to be afraid of losing their fundamentalism of course
that's that's not easy to do because fundamentalists by definition
tend to be very closed-minded and dogmatic and ideological and
they don't want to listen to what's coming next because
they think they're already at the absolute best that there
could be you know you can't tell some fundamentalist evangelical
that there could be something better than his current form
spirituality because he thinks his spirituality is the one true
one well that's that's his problem right there of course
that's not true maybe his spirituality was good at a
certain point of time but now it's time to move
on to something better but that requires an open mind
next quote quote younger birth cohorts and people born in
diverse metropolitan areas are considerably more supportive of new cultural
norms than older people and those from rural areas as
younger cohorts replace older ones major cultural changes continue so
that's what I was talking about at the very beginning
of these quotes with the inchworm inching its way forward
old people die new generations come online and values evolve
and here I just want to show you one more
chart which is basically the same sort of data we've
been talking about survival versus self expression values on the
horizontal traditional versus secular rational values on the vertical and
here though you can see them you can see different
sort of groups countries not just as individual countries but
broken down to sort of into these larger regions like
all of Protestant Europe or all of Catholic Europe Orthodox
Slavic countries African Islamic countries Latin American countries Confucian Asian
countries some Baltic countries you can kind of see where
they're at and where they might be headed gives you
a bit of an idea so as you can see
they're the African Islamic countries are are the most traditional
and the most survival oriented and also the least developed
again that doesn't mean they're bad or evil it doesn't
mean that they're permanently gonna be that way it just
means that they have more growing to do okay so
now let's talk about some of the various insights from
this world value survey data number one human values evolved
in predictable ways there are clear trends with lower and
higher it's clear which way Zimbabwe and Bangladesh will evolve
in the future there's no mystery about this it's clear
which way Russia and the United States will go in
the future there's no mystery about this not in the
long run in the short run we can have a
bad election cycle we can have some sort of nationalistic
movement we can have a war or something that will
regress any of these countries but in the long run
we know that they are moving in that sort of
upper diagonal direction towards more self expression values and towards
more rational secular values another insight is that the largest
increase in basic survival happens from agrarian to industrial societies
so countries that have not industrialized yet they're still stuck
in survival values so industrialization is a very important event
in a nation's development and it corresponds to the larger
shift in secular rational values so highly industrialized nations tend
to be highly secular and rational America is actually a
bit of an exception in this regard it has a
pretty strong kind of religious undercurrent that is being clung
to by conservatives you know come what may another insight
is that survival to self-expression values come with increase in
individual agency so modern societies make individualism viable that's what
I was talking about the libertarian stuff another insight is
that the largest increase in individual agency comes with the
advancement from industrial societies to knowledge societies that produces the
largest shift in self expression values because in a knowledge
society now it becomes more important to be educated and
as you become more educated you naturally want to express
yourself more life becomes not just so much physical but
it also becomes more intellectual as well and this sort
of intellectualism spreads across society as more people finish high
school and graduate from colleges another insight is that democracy
is driven by self expression values not the other way
around if you want democracy in the Middle East help
them to advance to self expression values and then democracy
will naturally flourish but if you just depose some dictator
and try to install democracy it's not gonna work because
their values haven't shifted from survival values see so this
is why war and brute force doesn't work so well
for growth you can't just beat a child over the
head with a stick to get him to learn to
read or to write or mathematics the learning is not
about physically beating somebody it's about showing them the value
of learning the value of growth getting them excited about
that getting them bought into that and that's the sort
of a soft skill that's a diplomatic skill that's an
education problem that needs to be solved that's not a
problem that you solved with bombs and rockets and invasions
the next insight and this here's a quote quote the
strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found
in Islamic of the middle-east and quote we already talked
about that another quote the strongest emphasis on secular rational
values and self expression values is found in the Protestant
societies of northern Europe end quote we've sort of also
alluded to that the next insight is that desire for
democracy is universal it is not only a product of
the West as some people like to portray there's a
lot more commonality between human values around the world yes
there's a lot of levels different levels of development but
overall if we give these countries enough time we will
see that they will develop into sophisticated democracies advanced democracies
with quote unquote Western values they're not really Western values
these are just values that come about when you get
a certain number of your survival needs met and you
become comfortable with that when you move to a certain
you know second half of the Maslow's hierarchy of needs
then Western values become everyone's values some more insights is
that high the higher your education the more liberal you
are the younger your generation is the more liberal you
are the less survival threats you face the more liberal
you are so in generally the conservatives are less educated
older generations and face more survival threats it's pretty obvious
then I have a quote here for you between 1981
and 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries
that were surveyed in that period so happiness is rising
because our material wealth is rising education is increasing healthcare
is increasing all these things so overall the trends are
good it just may not be happening as fast as
you individually want but you know if you want to
have it faster than participate you can get politically involved
you can vote more you can be more active you
can volunteer you can donate there's a lot of stuff
you can do you can have a life purpose that
helps to awaken mankind you can become an educator you
can improve mankind's consciousness through your business and in many
other ways now an insight about happiness in low income
societies a better economy leads to massive increases in happiness
or as in high-income societies more democracy more self-expression leads
to ha to higher happiness see so if you're living
in a high-income country kind of society you need to
dial off the economy it's not about the economy stupid
and if you live in a low income society then
yes you need to you need to rapidly develop your
economy because that's gonna massively increase the happiness of of
you and everyone around you but don't take it overboard
realize when the economy has gone to a level where
now you're just getting diminishing returns now I want to
paint you a little bit of a picture of how
societies evolve because that's the title of this episode so
here's how it works basically human societies go from hunting
and gathering to horticultural which is raising of small animals
in non-math scales then agrarian which is basically massive farming
then from agrarian to industrial and then from industrial to
post-industrial which is sort of a knowledge worker economy and
a service economy which is a lot of northern Europe
and America Canada and so forth so we have the
pre-industrial era we have the industrial era and we got
the post-industrial era and really some of the some of
the key distinctions here is is a citizen college-educated or
not our citizen interest citizens interested in philosophy and science
or or not are they knowledge workers or are there
a manual laborers these sorts of distinctions are very important
for determining for the political trajectory of a country most
people are not educated enough for anything but manual labor
at least right now in the world that the case
as more people come together but they are not very
well educated they need to be organized by some sort
of higher intelligent force and oftentimes this needs to be
through brute force because they don't understand anything else so
this leads to totalitarian regimes and autocracies and dictatorships and
tyrannies right you have thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of
people who are not intelligent enough to do anything but
manual work so what do you do you corral them
together into one group so they can defend themselves against
invaders right and for that you need some sort of
tyrant or dictator then what happens is that as you're
organizing these people your population becomes so large that it
requires more and more bureaucracy because you know if you're
all only organising a thousand people you can do that
through word of mouth if you're trying to organize a
million people now you need records you need writing systems
you need language you need accountants you need bureaucrats to
manage that for you but these bureaucrats and these accountants
and so forth what do they need to be they
can't be dumb manual laborers they need to be knowledge
workers they need to be intelligent they need to go
through years of education to learn language to learn how
to think to learn some philosophy and so forth so
as as the population grows education becomes imperative and so
we build bureaucracies that provide education school systems and then
as more people become educated those who rise to the
top are not the manual laborers but the elites who
are the most educated because actually the education of the
intelligence it takes to organize manual labor is far more
valuable in the grand scheme of things than manual labor
itself and then as we do this as we create
better organizations for our society this leads to better and
better economic efficiency more trading more opportunities for technology as
we developed more technology of course technology leads to better
education and puts more demand on education because you need
to be more educated to learn to use the technology
effectively right you got to be pretty well educated to
learn to use a computer and so forth you know
some illiterate person can't just use a computer so everything
here turns into this sort of upward spiral where economic
success leads to more education and more technology and then
yet yet more technology and more education leads to more
economic successes this creates this upward spiral until we get
out of the rut of having to be worried about
basic survival needs like food water shelter and so forth
this becomes relatively easy to acquire after a certain point
and at this point we've built up so much social
infrastructure in order to manage all of this that now
we are also much more socially interconnected with each other
and this allows for more self-expression to flourish this puts
pressure on people because they're more knowledgeable and educated to
push for democracy now people are not just satisfied with
putting food in their belly and clothing and sheltering their
children now people want more they want us to have
a say they want to run for office they want
more civil rights they want more gay rights they want
more sexual rights they want more technological rights they want
free speech they want all this sort of stuff and
survival brute survival starts to be taken for granted and
now survival moves into the the more abstract creative domain
the self-expressive domain values shift from the traditional survival values
- now the secular rational self expressive values and now
people demand democracy we're before an autocrat or a tyrant
or a king could manage this whole affair now people
see the injustice of that they demand democracy and so
really democracy is the fruit of dictatorship and monarchy so
if a king or a dictator becomes very very successful
at organizing people eventually those people will overthrow the king
or the dictator so the king or dictator ends up
undoing his own self which is why basically all kings
and dictators have a very short life time they don't
tend to live very long precisely because when they succeed
they become irrelevant and when they fail well of course
they they also become irrelevant because they get replaced by
somebody more vicious than them also what happens is that
as we have more knowledge workers and more education in
a society workers in general rather than just being dumb
manual labourers now they have a more understanding more sophistication
they think cognitively in more sophisticated ways and now they
are able to organise better with each other because you
see to be an effective knowledge worker means that you
need to have more education and the more education you
have the more free you're able to use your mind
to look at the world and to see in justices
in the world and to demand freedom for self-expression and
so higher education increases the need and demand for democracy
and as this happens organized religions declined because with higher
education now we're more empirical and we start to question
our own dogmas and ideology so we go back we
we examine our old traditions and we realize that many
of our old traditions and religions and dogmas they were
they were not absolute truths they were just vehicles to
get us to where we are today they were certain
survival patterns and habits and that now that our environment
has changed it's time to outgrow those and so we
outgrow those and oftentimes we go more secular and rational
as this happens also xenophobia racism sexism homophobia and Elite
ISM all of these decline because all of them basically
were coming from fear and insecurity once we become more
secure in ourselves we don't need to fight everybody for
food and shelter and so on and once we start
to transcend and question our old traditions from religion now
we don't need to be so xenophobic we can be
friends with our neighbors even though there are different race
or different nationality now we can be more tolerant of
of different genders we can see the Equality we can
be even taller in homosexuality and and so on we're
moving away from fear and towards greater consciousness and self-acceptance
now of course as this secularism prevails over the population
fundamentalist movements break out as ego back collective ego back
lashes to try to go back and this breaks out
amongst people those parts of society which are not as
educated and are not being advanced as quickly to the
cutting edge of where society is going so basically that
part of society which you tend to leave behind and
which you don't educate that part of society which doesn't
experience the economic prosperity that the other half of society
does they tend to get resentful and fearful and perhaps
rightly so and they start these fundamentalist and nationalist movements
but these are temporary because remember the society still keeps
getting more evolved more wealthy more prosperous so eventually it
will at some point all trickle down even to the
fundamentalists and it will make them more pacified and more
secure and eventually they'll be ready after a certain point
to let go of their fundamentalism or if they're not
then their generation will simply die out and the next
generation will start from a cleaner slate and be less
infected with those dogmas and ideologies so the success of
previous generation creates the foundation for the next generation which
is free to be more liberal and more self expressive
so this is how society works and every generation basically
becomes progressively a little bit more liberal than the previous
one the trick though is that prior generations don't fully
understand newer generations because the past generations are still weary
of the old survival threats and nowhere is there a
better example of this than for example in America with
this whole debate around capitalism versus socialism so today we
have politicians like Bernie Sanders and others aoc who advocate
for democratic socialism it's not the same thing as socialism
but a lot of the older generations the Boomers they
are very leery of this and they tend to conflate
Bernie Sanders with an old-style Soviet communist which is really
silly it's a silly conflation but you can see how
it happens because the baby boomers actually lived through the
Cold War so the Cold War was a serious threat
to them they grew up as children having to duck
and cover under desks in school from the threat of
a nuclear war from the Communist Soviets so of course
they still carry those fears those fears are deeply wired
into their into their minds such that when there are
60 or 70 years old they're still stuck in that
mindset they can't see that what Bernie scientist Sanders for
example is advocating in his policies and his politics has
nothing to do with Soviet Communism it's it's a it's
the next level it's the level beyond capitalism not the
level that came before capitalism so there's a conflation sort
of a pre trans fallacy that happens there with the
boomers so that's because the old generation can't quite understand
the new generation which is why what's going to happen
in practice is that all those boomers in the next
20 years they're going to die and once they die
off the new generations are going to be much more
accepting of the label of socialism and the kind of
politics that Bernie Sanders is advocating which is why Bernie
Sanders has the most support among young people under age
45 and why he has the least support amongst people
who are aged over 65 because they've been so threatened
by the Cold War that they can't tolerate anybody with
the label socialist see now who's right who's wrong well
that's up to you to decide I'm just trying to
explain to you how some of these dynamics work but
also notice that when your opposition to something comes from
a place of deep fear or insecurity that ends up
being a problem in and of itself and what many
of these baby boomers don't understand is of course is
that survival threats change Soviet Russia ain't Soviet Russia anymore
communism of the old school type is long gone it's
not the 1950s or 60s or 70s or 80s anymore
there's no cold war anymore things are different now of
course there can be still problems with Russia unless anything
is perfect but the situation has changed our technology has
changed our culture has changed infrastructure has changed government has
changed a lot of stuff has changed society is not
static in those 50 or 60 years the baby boomers
were growing up a lot of stuff has changed so
stuff that didn't used to work might now work think
of society as a collective memory Bank of mankind baking
in lessons from each generation for the next generation so
your children when they are born what's going to happen
is that they are gonna get programmed with the collective
lessons of all of mankind for previous generations those are
the lessons that they will need to survive at least
until they become adults and then they will need to
think for themselves independently and generate new ideas and new
world views and new paradigms to take society to the
next level and so in this way each generation is
sort of passing on the baton to the next one
and the next one and the next one and baking
in all those lessons within our culture within our institutions
within our bureaucracies our legal system our language our books
our technology and see layer after layer after layer every
20 or 30 years there's a new layer added on
top of this thing we call civilization and basically society
is growing just like a tree with those rings in
a tree each ring represents one year or one generation
we might say see and it's progressively evolving but the
key is to recognize this entire dynamic from sort of
a big-picture perspective from an elevated perspective and not to
get too attached to any one ring or to any
one generation one of the biggest problems we have right
now is that the baby boomers are so clinging to
power and their old value systems that they're not allowing
the newer generations who have a better more conscious worldview
to occupy positions of power and make the change that
we need for example right now we badly need action
on climate change but many baby boomers don't want to
lift a finger on climate change why not well because
they've already lived their life so for them why should
they pay a lot of money to clean up the
environment to them it doesn't make sense because they're gonna
be dead in 20 years but to their children it
makes a lot of sense because they still have their
whole life ahead of them but the baby boomers have
most of the wealth in society at least in America
and they also occupy many of the positions of power
politically and so forth so of course it's frustrating for
Millennials and other younger generations dealing with these baby boomers
Cuzzi baby boomers take all the money take all the
positions of power and then they don't really want to
advance forward as fast as we need to to take
care of some of these new existential challenges see it
when the baby boomers were born environmental issues weren't a
thing environmental issues are relatively recent development that's because the
population of the planet has since the baby boomers have
been think about that doubled when people were born in
the 50s or 60s the planet was half as populated
that's crazy that's crazy if you think about it there
are so many more people which means that all of
the problems that come with the scale the mass scaling
problems like pollution trash co2 emissions all of them are
exponentially worse and they're keeping and they're they keep getting
exponentially worse if we don't do anything about it see
but the Boomers are not used to thinking in this
way because they weren't raised with this sort of mentality
but newer generations are now much more environmentally conscious because
they need to be for purposes of survival because now
it matters when you have lead in your water or
mercury in your in your teeth fillings see now this
sort of stuff or we care about this because we
know we have the science now to tell us how
seriously this affects crime rates how it affects the body
function endocrine system glands autoimmune issues and so forth and
this is just a tip of the iceberg of environmental
issues so I just want you to notice how society
is like a treadmill it's always or maybe even better
like an escalator it's always moving up and it's always
churning through itself there's always new stuff being developed it's
not the same statical society of a hundred years ago
you can never go back to how great things were
in the past this whole idea of make America great
again it can't possibly work because going back to the
1950s that was a different world there was half as
many people on the plan in the 1950s today there
were no environmental issues there were no nuclear issues barely
back then the technology has completely changed there was no
internet back then everyone didn't have a personal vehicle back
then there were not certain diseases that exist today there
were not certain pollutants that exist today corporations were not
as big and as powerful as they are today a
lot of stuff has changed and you can't put those
genies back in the bottle so we need new solutions
not just going back to the past you can never
go back to the past you're never going to go
back to a society with a bunch of coal producing
power plants the way that you know Trump has promised
this is never gonna work this is fantasy and this
needs to be understood and acknowledged the solution is not
to yearn for some fantasy of the past but to
go boldly into the future to face the future challengers
take them head-on and to deal with them truthfully courageously
fearlessly and to be visionary to be innovative and to
take some of the risks yes it's risky to go
into the future into the unknown but what other choice
do we have that is just the very nature of
evolution I've said in the past and this is somewhat
controversial when I talked about conscious politics that liberals are
more evolved than conservatives and of course this pisses off
a lot of conservatives to say this but it is
nonetheless true and this World Values Survey data is the
proof of it the trend of societies goes from traditional
survival to secular rational self-expressive from conservative to liberal conservatives
are mostly traditional survival oriented liberals are mostly secular rationalist
self-expressive oriented every generation becomes more liberal even if you're
a conservative today you're a liberal by the standard of
your ancestors notice this even the most arch conservatives of
today would never support something like slavery whereas your ancestors
would without any hesitation they would support slavery why is
that simply because what conservatives is about is about preserving
the status quo whatever it happens to be if it
happens to be slavery that's what you're preserving but if
it happens to be you know whatever conservatives want to
preserve today then it's that gun rides or whatever now
of course this is all denied by conservatives that's part
of the whole problem and conservatives will say that this
this is so uh this is so biased and unfair
to say that conservatives are less evolved than liberals but
look look at the data look at the historical trends
look at it in an objective way step outside of
your ideology and have the courage to admit that maybe
your ideology is not equivalent to all other ideologies maybe
there is a maybe there's a sort of a progression
here and that is in fact what you'll find but
of course that's exactly what you don't want to do
as a conservative you don't want to consider other perspectives
you don't wanna consider the possibility that there might be
better ways of doing things than your current ideology because
you're attached to it and you're protecting and defending it
out of a sense of insecurity and fear notice that
today today's liberal is also tomorrow's conservative so also if
you're a liberal don't get cocky because you might say
all the odds so liberal yeah you're liberal now but
when you turn 60 years old relative to new generations
you're gonna look like look like a old conservative fart
and yet you're still gonna cling to power and think
that you're right you see today's conservatives are yesterday's liberals
humans 100 years from now will be extremely extremely liberal
by even today's most liberal standards today's liberals will be
uncomfortable with the crazy liberal ideas of humans 100 years
from now but luckily they'll be dead a hundred years
from now so it won't be a problem which is
why death is actually a very important component in the
progress of mankind if generations didn't die out but live
forever this would be very problematic because the whole system
would get constipated because you got to have a mechanism
for flushing out old ideas people who cling to power
attach to old ideologies but all of this doesn't mean
that conservatives are evil or always wrong conservatives could still
have valid opinions I'm not saying that liberals are right
about everything don't don't got so reductive and simplistic about
this it's just that there's a clear trend and we
want to be conscious of what this trend is the
arc of history bends liberal and democratic you can clearly
see that if you study history the biggest obstacle to
liberal democracy is threats to basic survival this is the
classic tug of war between fear and love basically liberalism
is more love oriented and conservativism is more fear driven
self expressiveness brings back spirituality in true form after secular
rational values so this is one of the things that
many scientifically-minded rationally minded atheistic lis minded and liberal people
get wrong from this data is they think like oh
we'll leo so this means that in the future religion
will be completely wiped out and there will be no
spirituality and it will be just all pure secular and
rational right and that's precisely wrong in the future what
will happen is that there will be even more spirituality
but it will be more powerful more authentic more true
more individual conservatives practice a sort of dogmatic conformist authoritarian
spirituality sort of a top-down spirituality whereas in the future
when we get past the secular rational values there's gonna
be other levels this data here doesn't show you all
the future levels that will exist remember this data is
only tracking what's there now it doesn't tell you about
the future so much but I've sort of been to
the in the sense that you know you can become
more conscious and then you can you can clearly see
where the future is if you become more conscious you'll
clearly see that spirituality is gonna play only a bigger
role within science not less of a role but it
will be a different kind of spirituality it won't be
religion from the old Bible sort of thing it's gonna
be mystical experiences it's gonna be psychedelic it's gonna be
meditation it's gonna be yoga and these sorts of things
basically everything that I teach here on actualize that org
with non duality so spirituality is by no means dying
and this is one of the problems that fundamentalists face
is they think that well if we open the doors
for science that's gonna kill God and kill spirituality but
the opposite is the case it will only kill our
old dogmatic ideas of God and spirituality but actually the
science will open the doors for actually realizing God it
and an even deeper level and practicing spirituality at an
even deeper level which you can do with psychedelics with
various kinds of you know scientifically tested meditation methods and
even brain training machines you know iíve used brain training
machines to have powerful meditation sessions that's science helping you
to be more spiritual so the folly of the fundamentalists
is that they don't understand that actually science and secularism
this is not going to lead to a downfall of
religion and a loss of morality and depravity and devil
Rhee actually it will take us to a new even
better way of doing spirituality because true spirituality builds on
top of rational secular values that's what people don't understand
fundamentalists to understand this and even the secular rationalist scientists
don't understand this but that's because there's that there's another
level that we haven't even talked about here so liberals
and conservatives are not merely polar opposites they are not
just two equal sides of the coin there's a clear
directionality their society never stands still it's always evolving no
one culture racer group has a monopoly on democracy or
evolution we have a lot more in common than we
often realize world happiness is rising keep that in mind
keep in mind that your values are not true or
original any sense and that many of your justifications for
your values in your worldview are really just self biased
and self deceived so liberals need more compassion and understanding
of conservatives things like racism homophobia transphobia sexism xenophobia and
nationalism authoritarianism are not simply moral failings they are survival
responses this is something liberals don't understand and if you're
a liberal I want you to understand the following if
you were born into a harsher survival situation you too
would be a racist a sexist a homophobe xenophobe a
transphobic authoritarian and nationalist and if you deny this you're
kidding yourself you are only a liberal because you happened
to be born in the right place at the right
time standing on the shoulders of giants thanks to them
thanks to their education systems that they constructed thanks to
the bureaucracies and the legal systems that they constructed thanks
to the government that they constructed thanks to the amazing
economy that they constructed thanks to all that now you
can sit on a sort of a on a perch
and look down at others below you and call them
racist sexist homophobic zeenat hope folks nationalists and authoritarians and
Nazis and so forth but if you just happen to
be born a little bit off to the side you
would be the one who would be call these names
by some other liberals that's a very humbling thought experiment
to go through I recommend you actually contemplate that one
and recognize how privileged you are if you are a
liberal you are woke because you stand on the shoulders
of giants liberals need to admit that conservatives are not
evil and conservatives need to admit that liberals are more
developed but of course liberals and conservatives are mostly just
happy to be attacking one another liberals love to attack
conservatives as brutes and as hypocrites and barbarians and then
conservatives love to attack liberals as being airy-fairy and woowoo
and you know unrealistic and in this game this name-calling
game it turns into sort of a mud wrestling contest
this stalls our further development forward the difficulty of seeing
social evolution is that it doesn't happen precisely until the
current generation dies off the mind tends to block out
from its own view those things which don't fit its
existing worldview biases and perspectives which don't serve its survival
so when I talk about cultural evolution how fast everything
is progressing forward many people might say well Leo what
I don't see any evolution what's happening it's all sort
of the same you don't see it precisely because it's
not in your interest to see it because if you
saw all of the evolution that was happening all around
you you couldn't maintain your old worldview and that would
be very threatening for you so either you're gonna wake
up to what I'm saying here and start to agree
with me or you're gonna deny and resist entrench yourself
deeper in your worldview stick your head in the sand
but then eventually you're gonna die as your generation will
die necessarily and then it won't matter what you believe
because the new generation your children and their children they
will transcend your limitations so either do it willingly or
not but it's gonna happen either way you are not
going to stop the evolution of society no matter how
conservative you get you're not gonna stop you can only
[ __ ] it for a short while but eventually
you're going to lose so my question to you is
why be on the losing side of history why not
look into the future a little bit and be more
open and accommodating of the new changes that are happening
in culture and society be more open-minded be more willing
to learn and adopt trends that are coming to you
in future generations listen to younger generations than you rather
than just acting arrogant and thinking that you've got it
all figured out the reason many people don't see cultural
evolution is because it doesn't suit their survival to see
it see many Muslims and Christians and Hindus don't want
to admit that religion evolves the Christianity of today is
not the Christianity that it was a thousand years ago
not even close totally different Islam of today is not
the Islam of a thousand years ago Hinduism of today
is not the Hinduism of a thousand years ago and
yet these things this evolution needs to be denied precisely
because that it creates a sort of a bubble we
could say well Christianity was just this one monolithic thing
that which has existed for 2,000 years no it hasn't
but that's a fantasy that's really convenient if you want
to just defend Christianity blindly because as soon as you
start to admit that Christianity evolved here and there and
there and there and there and there then all of
a sudden you have to admit that maybe maybe many
of the Christian practices and beliefs you hold today and
that you that you do that they weren't even there
they weren't even practice by Jesus so you can't go
back and kind of ground yourself in Jesus's original teachings
the way that many Christians love to do and the
fact most Christian today have nothing to do with over
the teachings of Jesus they they practice and preach exactly
the opposite of what Jesus would have practiced or preached
many Christians in America today are pro-capitalist which is completely
absurd if you think Bernie Sanders is a communist what
would you have called Jesus see but people don't like
to think about these things they just blindly sort of
follow tradition so in conclusion I want you to notice
how well the world value survey that we covered here
corroborates spiral dynamics Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the corruption
perception index that we showed a chart of all of
these things work together to sort of give you a
bigger picture of what's really going on that's what's so
nice about all these models and all this data now
let me issue a few final warnings about the world
value survey do not use this data to make some
sort of racist nationalistic claims or theories about how all
the West is the best because it seems to this
data seems to show it's the most advanced and the
least corrupt that's only a function of history that doesn't
prove that that white man is more intelligent or better
or smarter or anything like this also the world value
survey it doesn't show you the highest stages of development
it doesn't even go as far as spa the damage
because pile dynamics will show you stages yellow and turquoise
which are barely shown in this world of value survey
remember this is raw data from 1980s to the 2020
and it's tracking you know these are questionnaires that are
tracking very broad trends so if a trend or a
set of values is not prevalent in society let's say
it's only prevalent in 1% of society then this survey
is not going to pick it up and now the
case with for example spa dynamic stage sage turquoise it's
so rare right now so few people have reached stage
turquoise that is less than 1% which means that it's
not going to be present in these surveys but in
let's say 50 years when stage turquoise maybe becomes 5%
of the population then the world value survey will start
to pick it up more and you're gonna you're gonna
see you're gonna see that reflected in the data in
some way see but every model has its limits violet
Hammond's is also limited but it's not as limited as
the world value survey because they're serving different functions see
is it's one thing to track what's already happened it's
another thing to anticipate the future and to track and
kind of speculate about where mankind is going I also
want to warn you that don't get the wrong idea
that secular rational values are somehow the end-all be-all not
at all as stage turquoise shows you there's there's something
beyond the sexual to secular irrational there's something called post
rationality there's something called vision logic there's mystical experiences there's
non duality there's a lot of stuff beyond the secular
and rational it's just that it's not it's not very
widespread yet and people are still very closed-minded about it
which is why it remains sort of hidden what is
there for you to access if you want and my
work will help you to access that if that's what
you're interested in if you want to reach the highest
levels of human development keep in mind also that this
is just one model it's one lens that you can
use to look at reality through I like to use
many different lenses no one lenses conclusive or absolute so
hold it loosely don't turn this into an ideology or
a dogma don't use this data to justify all of
your personal biases and worldviews that would be a mistake
rather use this data to sort of zoom out and
look at the big picture correlate it with other models
compare it with other models notice its limitations every model
has certain limitations it makes certain assumptions it has certain
biases keep all that in mind and the final warning
is don't let collective conclusions limit you so you might
have heard all this and then you might say well
Leo this is so depressing because I live in Bangladesh
and this seems to show that in Bangladesh is impossible
to self-actualize it's impossible to rise to stage turquoise it's
impossible to become a mystic it's impossible to do non-duality
is impossible to self-actualize no these are very general trends
even in the lowest and worst of countries there are
people who can be at stage turquoise there are people
who can be powerful mystics and sages and gurus in
India in Bangladesh you know wherever you are if you
really want to you can do it you as an
individual is a very different matter than your entire society
collectively now will you face additional obstacles and challenges because
you happen to live in a very underdeveloped society yes
you could could you even be in more physical danger
could you life being threatened yes it could but I'll
not also not necessarily don't get paranoid about it it
doesn't have to be you can learn to be a
conscious individual no matter what country or society you live
in you can find ways to make it work if
Jesus could do a 2,000 years ago you can do
it today alright so in general be very careful with
these sorts of studies and models because remember these are
generalizations that apply across millions of people you can always
be an exception to the rule there are always exceptional
people and don't fit these models and if that's you
if you want to be mega successful if you wanna
you know rise to the highest potential of mankind go
for it don't let this be an excuse don't create
some victim mentality around this data use this data to
empower yourself where it can help you and then in
those areas where it seems disempowering ultimately forget it let
it go it's not serving you go find those techniques
and methods that will serve you because in the end
what you ultimately care about is waking up growing yourself
developing yourself and then being a powerful leader in the
world so go focus on that that's what you can
directly control you can't directly control what a million people
around you think or believe you can play a part
you could influence them to some degree but ultimately first
you gotta take care of yourself build yourself up actualize
yourself then you can worry about how to transform people
around you to be more conscious and more woke and
more developed so I hope that this world value survey
has given you some deep insights into the nature of
politics and culture really if you use this lens you
can you can you can look at politics in a
totally different way all of the political battles that you
see between liberals and conservatives and so forth you should
be able to break all of that down and see
the silliness of it all these battles between gay rights
versus non gay rights or gender this or gender that
gender equality you can you can look at all this
and you can see you can see how foolish it
is from both sides that people are arguing about these
things like pro-abortion anti abortion you can see that there's
no truth in these debates it's just people acting out
their survival and adopting ideologies to help them to do
that and yet even though that's the case the sides
are not equal there is still a trend from conservative
to liberal notice that society is constantly changing around you
and constantly growing what is it growing towards contemplate that
I suggest that if you do you'll discover that it's
growing towards more consciousness more equality more democracy more justice
more love less fear and then the only question is
which side of history do you want to be on
do you want to be on the side of love
and consciousness or do you want to be on the
side of fear do you want to be on the
side of self lessness or on the side of selfishness
that's up to you but understand that fear will always
be conquered by love and selfishness will always be conquered
in the long run by selflessness and falsehood will always
be conquered by truth in the long run but then
again as some famous economist I think once said in
the long run we're all dead and that's the end
all right that's it for me I'm out of here
that's my website right here actualize that org come click
on it check out my blog you can find new
insights and videos that I post there every week check
out the forum check out the life purpose course check
out my book list lots of books on this topic
and more if you'd like to support me on patreon
go to patreon.com/scishow to video that you can click on
and you can chip in 5 10 bucks a month
that helps to support the research that I do and
sustain this channel and I'm grateful for that and in
general I just want to I guess put out a
word of appreciation just for the fact that you know
I'm really lucky and fortunate that I get to do
this content that I get to do what I love
most which is thinking about these deep petty topics talking
about metaphysics and epistemology and earn decent money doing it
and able to sustain myself and able to you know
share this wisdom with you just to be in this
position took a lot of work and I'm really grateful
to be here and really it's been amazing the last
seven years has been so amazing that I've even sort
of sort acclimated to it to the point where now
I I take it for granted that I'm even able
to do this most people are not able to have
the kind of job that I have and sustain themselves
doing it and also share this deep wisdom with the
rest of the world helped uplift the world this is
this is what I've worked for very hard to to
actualize my life purpose and if you want to know
the exact techniques and principles that I use to do
that check out my life purpose course in a life
purpose course I talk about the sort of mindsets and
the sort of worldview that I needed to find my
life purpose I give you exercises is extremely practical so
if you're one of these people that wants to live
a life purpose centered life where your life is not
just about going to work but about doing something for
mankind and of course finding that fulfillment within it if
you want to self Express you know speaking of self
expression values then the life purpose is all about that
it'll help you to find your values it will show
you how to express yourself and how to start to
build some sort of career or business around your deepest
passions and help you to find what that is and
to get you a clear vision of a way forward
and I guess the final thing I want to say
here is that a lot of people treat politics as
just some sort of dirty side affair that's not what
politics is politics is extremely important and it's more important
than ever to infuse consciousness and our politics today without
politics there cannot be awakening because politics creates the infrastructure
the fertile soil in which the seed of awakening can
be planted there is no possibility for awakening in some
terrible country which is completely corrupted and which barely allows
you to meet your survival needs it's very hard to
awaken still possible but very very hard for the majority
of mankind to awaken so in the future awakening mankind
is not just going to be about going to a
meditation retreat it's about creating policies and bureaucracy and infrastructure
and a kind of society and technology in such a
way that facilitates that for a meditation to retreat to
exist technology and politics is required a certain kind of
level of government is required for that to happen you
can't just go to Saudi Arabia and host some hippie
dippie mystical retreat they're going to charge you for blasphemy
against Islam because they're not open-minded enough to that you
see and that's just one example there's a lot of
political change that we need to make awakening more readily
accessible even in developed countries let alone underdeveloped ones and
democracy is the way that we do it and healthy
democracy requires conscious citizens and conscious citizens are created by
doing this work that we're doing here so it's all
it's all interconnected is what I want you to see
and it's time that we start to evolve our politics
beyond the kind of stuff that you see on CNN
and MSNBC and Fox News or even on most of
YouTube the way of the future is conscious politics and
if you want to know what that looks like go
check out my four-part series called conscious politics part 1
2 3 & 4 where I outline that a bit
and this episode here is in addition to that and
I will have more episodes in the future that help
you to develop a sort of a political consciousness get
your mind thinking in the right directions because as we're
seeing with all the rise of various nationalist movements that
are regressive around the world in America in Europe and
South America we see these trends it's more important than
ever not to take our democracy for granted it's more
important than ever to talk about conscious politics and to
stop thinking of politics as some sort of dirty business
that some politicians do but something that you gotta keep
an eye on as your self actualizing because society is
not just a collection of individuals it's also a collection
there collect if forces involved see and you are part
of this collective and you are responsible if you're conscious
you're responsible for what this collective is doing there are
certain things you don't like that a collective is doing
and you know what you don't want them done in
your name and as a collective ultimately what are we
moving towards as I talked about in college politics we're
moving towards greater consciousness so if we're moving towards greater
consciousness that means we need more consciousness in our politics
to help us to build systems and infrastructure that will
facilitate more consciousness so stay tuned in the future because
we're going to have more political topics but also not
only political topics we're still going to have a bunch
of just ordinary individual self-help topics as well you
