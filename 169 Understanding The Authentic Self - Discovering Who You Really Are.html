            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/K6GyCk8cIJ4' target='_blank'>Understanding The Authentic Self - Discovering Who You Really Are</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misunderstanding of the Authentic Self</b>: People often interpret the notion of the "authentic self" as a fixed, unchanging image based on past and present behaviors or characteristics. This default position often leads to stagnation and rationalizing the avoidance of personal growth.
</li><li><b>Defining the Authentic Self</b>: The authentic self is not who you currently are or who you were in the past, but who you will become after achieving self-actualization. The authentic self is a highest possible potential self to be pursued and not an established identity to fall back on. 
</li><li><b>Change and the Authentic Self</b>: The second level of understanding "who you are" suggests that this identity is not static, but a complex, dynamic system constantly changing and evolving, much like a country changing over time in terms of geography, population, and ideologies.
</li><li><b>The Authentic Self as a Guiding Concept</b>: The "authentic self" should not be used as an excuse to resist personal growth or to stay in one's comfort zone. Pursuing self-actualization and personal growth enables an individual to evolve towards their ideal or "authentic" self.
</li><li><b>Attachment and the Authentic Self</b>: The third level of understanding the self posits that individuals are more than their bodies, brains and minds, and are actually the entirety of their experiences and reality. However, this advanced level contends that even the scientific model of the self is illusory, and that our identities are not fixed, but constantly changing and evolving.
</li><li><b>The Construct of Identity</b>: The concept of "identity" is a construct and fiction created by the brain and ego. There is no fixed "authentic self". Instead, individuals are made up of pure awareness of life, only encountered through introspection and mindfulness.
</li><li><b>"No Self" in Personal Development</b>: The concept of "no self" challenges the reality of our self-image and personal strengths. By letting go of our ego, we can improve performance, reach a state of flow, and expand our connection with everything. This understanding promotes personal growth and fulfills individual potential. 
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Redefinition</b>: Defining and redefining the "authentic self" is a challenging process that requires introspection, willingness to grow, and the conscious decision to venture outside of comfort zones. The belief that something "isn't who we really are" can limit personal growth and development.
</li><li><b>Authentic Self vs Lazy Self</b>: Leo explains that people tend to fall into "lazy self" pattern where they do what is comfortable and convenient, leading to stagnation and plateauing in life. This natural trajectory often continues throughout someone's life if no effort is made to expand oneself.
</li><li><b>The Downside of Comfort and Mediocrity</b>: Leo warns that living a "comfortable" lifedoing the bare minimum to get by and avoiding any significant challengescan lead to internal decay and a lack of fulfillment. He suggests that remaining in this state can hinder the actualization of one's full potential.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Actualization and Growth</b>: According to Leo, self-actualization, as proposed by Abraham Maslow, is not a luxury but a necessary component of psychological health. It involves pushing ourselves to achieve our greatest potential, utilizing our unique talents, and making meaningful contributions to society. 
</li><li><b>Challenging the Idea of 'Natural'</b>: Leo discusses how people often use the concept of "natural" as an excuse for not taking on challenges or refusing to step outside their comfort zone. He stresses that this mindset can prevent personal growth and hinder the realization of one's authentic self.
</li><li><b>Working Hard for Self-Actualization</b>: Rather than settling for a "natural" life, Leo emphasizes the need to strive for a self-actualized life, which might be challenging but proves more fulfilling. The fulfillment comes from high-level pleasures such as personal growth, overcoming boundaries, and sharing your unique gifts with others.
</li><li><b>Authentic Self Description</b>: Leo provides a detailed description of what an "authentic self" would look like. This includes being confident, assertive, disciplined, internally grounded in values, emotionally stable, passionate, without limiting beliefs, possessing high self-esteem, driven by higher consciousness, healthy, and fit among other characteristics. 
</li><li><b>Continual Growth towards Authentic Self</b>: Leo suggests that our authentic self isn't who we are now or were in the past, but the person we can become through persistent effort and personal development. Achieving this level of self-actualization requires challenging our comfort zones in order to unlock our full potential.
</li><li><b>Definition of the Authentic Self</b>: Leo Gura defines the authentic self as being comfortable with your physical health and appearance, including your gender and your bodys level of energy and vitality. Your authentic self is comfortable with embracing your distinct level of masculine or feminine energy, as well as accepting and understanding the opposite gender. Being open-minded and willing to change their views, authentic individuals do not take offense at new ideas, regardless of their nature. They aim to always take the high road in their interactions, aiming for noble thoughts and actions. 
</li><li><b>Authentic Self versus Perceived Self</b>: There is a potential difference between our authentic selves and our perceived selves. Often, because of past traumatic experiences, social conditioning, personal insecurities and negative thinking, individuals may feel that their authentic self is far isolated from the idealized self Gura describes. This does not mean their authentic self does not have the potential to match those qualities. The authentic self is the individual without any societal grime, negative conditioning and limitations, with confidence, fearlessness, passion, and sociability being key tools in an individual's tool belt. 
</li><li><b>Authentic Self as Nonstatic</b>: The authentic self is not a fixed entity, but a changeable and evolving one; we are constantly becoming our true selves. We undergo changes and evolution in every action and experience, gradually making significant transformations, leading to profound personal growth.
</li><li><b>Identity and Self-Image</b>: Our self-image, a collection of beliefs about ourselves, shapes us and is largely determined by external factors, such as upbringing, experiences and the media. This self-image is not wholly representative of who we truly are and should not be taken too seriously since these external influences are often random and out of our control.
</li><li><b>Role of external influences in shaping self-image</b>: Various forms of media and external experiences such as reading a book or being called a nasty name at school can alter our perception of self. These influences are usually random and can greatly affect how we see ourselves, often leading to attachment to certain identities.
</li><li><b>Moving beyond past behaviors and personal history</b>: We should refrain from clinging to past behaviors, successes, and failures as definitive of who we are. Instead, we should tap into our limitless potential, knowing that our lives can be steered in any direction we choose.
</li><li><b>Understanding 'identity' as a concept and a fiction</b>: Through mindfulness and introspection, we can realize that our identities are conceptualizations of reality and hence, like fictions. Our perceptions of who we are, which include our bodies, minds, past experiences, and egos, are elaborate fictions crafted by our brains.
</li><li><b>Existence of self as pure awareness</b>: Rather than an authentic self, what we truly are is pure awareness of life. This understanding is quite profound and can only be grasped through deep introspection.
</li><li><b>Benefit of dropping ego and selfish desires</b>: When we let go of our ego and selfish desires, we expand our connection with everything. This leads to less fear and limiting beliefs, ultimately enhancing our performance in life and achieving a state of flow.
</li><li><b>Shifting towards self-actualization without straining</b>: By letting go of our constructed identities, we naturally gravitate towards becoming our self-actualized, authentic selves without investing excessive effort. This journey towards enlightenment and higher consciousness is very fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Continuous growth and potential</b>: By continuously "wiping off the grime", we can allow new rays of light to shine through, symbolizing personal growth and the realization of our potential. Consistent effort in personal development makes us inspirational human beings, living life to its fullest potential. 
</li><li><b>Importance of sharing and spreading knowledge for growth</b>: Reiterating the importance of sharing this journey of understanding the authentic self for growth and inspiration. Encouraging others to sign up to his newsletter to foster their journey towards authentic self-discovery via continuous learning and sharing. 
</li><li><b>Ultimate realization of 'no self'</b>: Final destination of this journey is the realization of 'no self' - the most powerful understanding one can have in life. This realization transcends the notions of self, leading to the ultimate liberation and fulfillment.
