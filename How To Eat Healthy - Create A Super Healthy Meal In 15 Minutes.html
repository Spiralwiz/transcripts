hey guys how's it going this is Leo for actualised
org and in this video I thought I'd do something
a little bit different because some of you have been
asking about nutrition and I've posted a few videos up
there about proper nutrition and I've been criticizing a lot
of you for eating junk food so I thought that
I would show you something practical something that I like
to make and how I like to eat clean I've
really worked on my diet a lot over the last
few years especially just been cleaning it up through going
and cleaning up in phases basically trying different diets experiment
doing different stuff reading a lot of books on nutrition
and fitness and just trying to be healthier because I
actually want to value my health not saying that I
value my health but practically value my health and what
that means is what I'm going to show you guys
here so I'm going to show you what it really
means to eat something healthy now for many of you
this is probably going to blow your mind as simple
as it is it's going to shock you what I'm
going to show you because honestly it took me about
eight years because I used to be fat I used
to be sixty five pounds heavier than I am now
I was that way for my whole life and it
took me about eight years after I lost all that
weight even though I lost it I was still eating
a lot of junk food I was eating garbage just
horrible stuff that has been causing me all sorts of
problems and we'll have really destroyed my body down the
road if I continue that way so progressively what I
started doing is cleaning up my diet more and more
and more and now I'm at the point where I'm
eating really really healthy and this is something that's just
like a part of my lifestyle this is something I
love where before I had to really force myself to
do it now it's really something that I'm passionate about
and I continue to work on this so I'm still
not 100% clean I'm continuing right now I'm actually going
kind of through a vegetarian phase where I'm experimenting with
vegetarianism which is something I thought I would never try
but given the research that shows that it's so healthy
for you I am on board so let us show
you let me show you how to actually create something
healthy let's see what I'm going to do is basically
create a salad I feel like I'm Emeril Lagasse here
or Rachael Ray from the Food Network I've got all
this all this produce and all this stuff but really
very simple so here's what we got the bottom line
is that you need to be eating a lot of
vegetables in your diet and some people will lump fruits
and vegetables together no that's wrong fruits are okay you
can eat them in moderation but you should not be
relying on fruits you should be relying on vegetables the
bulk of your diet should be green leafy vegetables and
other vegetables that have all sorts of different pigments and
colors because the pigments and colors in the vegetables have
all sorts of natural nutrients that you can't get anywhere
else you can't get them in synthetic form you can't
get them in McDonald's cheeseburger so this is the stuff
that you really should be eating this is what your
ancestors were eating a hundred thousand years ago right they
were not eating giant genetically modified fruits and they were
not eating cheeseburgers and they were not eating wheat they
were not eating bread they were not eating pasta they
were not eating any of the nonsense garbage that you
guys are eating so look here's what we want we
want the maximum possible vegetables and we want them cooked
as little as possible so ideally raw Rose what you
want to be eating that's what your body burns the
best it burns it cleanest it makes you feel good
it makes you feel energetic and light it doesn't make
you drowsy and it's the healthiest it produces the least
toxins which ultimately are going to lead to all sorts
of nasty diseases down the road so here what I've
got is I've got some wild arugula from Trader Joe's
I'm going to pile that on I like to pile
on the greens I'm also going to take some just
some romaine lettuce also from Trader Joe's it's organic everything
that I'm using here is going to be organic so
I'm going to pile that on in large quantity then
what else we have I've just recently started trying these
these are sugar snappies also organic they look like a
little kind of green bean like a deal look and
you can just eat them raw they're really good so
I'm going to pile those on and then what I've
got here is uh I've got some organic red bell
peppers these guys I sliced up a few days ago
and I just kept them in my fridge so I
did some of the prep work here in reality this
is going to take you longer to do than what
I'm showing you because I've already I've already washed some
of this stuff I've already prepared it I'd sliced some
of it so that's prep work you're going to have
to do I've got some some radishes here a nice
red radish these guys are going to slice up so
basically what you got to start doing and what I've
been getting on to on board too is eating more
raw because I think that even when you read a
nutrition book and they tell you to eat more vegetables
you tend to start to think like okay more vegetables
what does that mean that means like I'll eat more
potatoes and I'll eat more like I'll eat more sauteed
vegetables or stir-fry vegetables or fry even fried vegetables and
you'll count that as a vegetable that's not really a
vegetable that's that is you kidding yourself a real vegetable
is either raw or in almost raw form so maybe
if you lightly steamed it like steamed broccoli or you
just very lightly lightly saute something otherwise don't delude yourself
into thinking that you're eating vegetables and potatoes do not
count as a vegetable neither this rice need of this
grain I'm talking about vegetables that your mom forced you
to eat when you were a kid that's basically what's
the healthiest for you and all these vegetables I get
organic who really knows if organic is better I haven't
really found conclusive evidence of that but if you care
about your health and you want to avoid potential problems
down the road you know why not I think it's
a good expense to have I mean organic vegetables they'll
cost you about twice as much a little bit less
than twice much than conventional but when it comes to
your health you don't want to be cheap all right
so we've got that what else do I want tomato
let's slice this guy up he's also organic and what
this is going to do is this is going to
create a salad and then I've also got some pasture-raised
eggs then I'm going to throw on top of it
that I've already I've already cooked up on a skillet
all right so you got Tomatoes BAM now here's a
trick that I just recently discovered which is I would
say a million dollar trick and that is get a
big plate if you're eating lots of vegetables you need
to eat a large quantity of them otherwise you're going
to be hungry just because there's more volume and less
calorie they're less calorie dense so this is not like
eating a candy bar Snickers bar which takes this much
volume but has a thousand calories in it right this
whole thing right here this whole plate look this this
is a massive plate of food this is something that
they would serve - probably a family of four right
but this is vegetable you can't get fat off this
if you eat this so you want large volume of
vegetables that means you have to buy more of them
really stock up on a lot of them and don't
be afraid to pile them on you're going to need
them otherwise you can feel hungry so this this meal
I'll actually burn through it pretty quick and I'll start
to feel hungry in a few hours just because they're
vegetables that's how it's supposed to be and the trick
is get a large plate a lot like look at
these are the plates I had that I've used previously
when I was not eating some adesh Tibbles and really
this plate is too small you can't fit enough vegetables
on this plate so this is something is like very
practical but if you don't have a large plate and
you don't get this idea then you're gonna be struggling
and you're not gonna be getting enough you're gonna feel
hungry and basically then you're going to drop off your
vegetarian diet or you're going to drop off some healthy
diet because you're simply not having enough vegetables you need
huge quantities of them don't be shy okay so this
is basically what I've got here and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to I'm gonna make a
dressing for my salad and what I've got here is
I've got organic extra virgin olive oil first cold-pressed this
is the best he can get so by that I'm
just going to pour that into my cup and with
it I'm going to mix half a lemon just going
to squeeze that in there lemons it's not important to
buy organic because really organic you want to buy if
you're going to be eating the outer part of the
vegetable or the fruit so any kind of fruit or
vegetable that your that you end up peeling it's not
so important because the pesticides and whatever chemicals they use
when they're spraying them with non-organic vegetables that stuff is
going to be discarded anyways you're not going to eat
the peel but for example stuff like tomatoes you're not
going to peel so you want those to be organic
and things like little baby carrots you know you're not
going to peel those and you're not going to of
course peel your leaves so your greens you want those
organic for sure all right so I've got that this
is lemon juice and olive oil the other thing I
do is I buy this organic brown mustard which is
made with apple cider vinegar and really the ingredients are
whole organic mustard seed organic apple cider vinegar water and
sea salt so this is good and healthy stuff I'm
going to take a scoop of that and just mix
it all in here and I eyeball all this so
I don't measure anything it just takes too long to
measure stuff so i eyeball it to get enough dressing
to cover as much salad as you want and just
pour it on like that okay and then I am
going to salt this guy so salt as far as
salt goes get rid of all your white table salt
that stuff is poison for you it's chemically processed and
stripped of all nutrients this what I have is I
have a pink Himalayan sea salt you can also get
other varieties of natural salt like Celtic sea salt and
first of all you find that they taste so much
better and you can you can just see that this
is natural like this is this is what you would
imagine them picking out of the sea or filtering it
from the ground or whatever however they obtain this stuff
but what's nice about this is that this kind of
salt this is actually good for you it's got nutrients
in it minerals in it that your white table salt
doesn't have so this I use in large quantities I'm
not afraid to salt stuff also in large quantities because
these vegetables otherwise are pretty pretty bland there's nothing too
exciting going on here but one of the things that
you notice is that once you start to wean yourself
off the junk food and you start to wean yourself
off the even even the more healthy food which is
still junky like if you're eating breads or if you're
eating if you're eating any kind of grains really once
you start to wean yourself off of that stuff you
sort of feel so much better and your tastes start
to change and the stuff that you thought you needed
like you needed that barbecue sauce and that ranch dressing
and at Mayo and you know all those all those
like bold titillating flavors you're going to notice that they're
not they're not that important and that you don't really
miss them and what you start to develop is you
start to develop this like higher value higher appreciation of
eating food for you that's actually healthy something that's actually
healthy like this like right now I bet if I
gave you this salad even though it like it looks
nice and everything if I gave this to you and
I said eat this for a week make one of
these everyday and just eat it for a week you
you're you're like your mind and your body and your
taste buds would just rebel against it because you're so
used to all the all the junk that you're eating
if you're eating a standard American right you're you're eating
all the sugars although all those lattes you're buying all
the milk products that you're eating the dairy the wheat
I like I'm not even talking about the worst of
the junk food even the stuff that you would get
in a decent restaurant it's still garbage it's really garbage
it's destroying you from the inside out it's causing cancer
it's causing Alzheimer's disease it's causing heart disease it's causing
diabetes of course its hat it's causing all your weight
gain all your fat if you're fat the only reason
that you're fat is because you eat a very poor
diet and you also don't exercise ever so that is
what's killing you there and that is going to have
a horrible horrible effect on your performance in life and
what you can really achieve so if I gave this
salad to you my point was is that you would
you would eat it but you wouldn't really even be
satisfied with it you would want that bold stimulating flavor
that that you get right now with whatever it is
that you're addicted to food wise so it takes your
you know takes some time to wean yourself off of
it and eventually when you do win yourself off you
feel so much better and what you what you discover
is that you start to actually get a sense of
appreciation for eating something healthy even though it doesn't taste
as good so this doesn't taste as good as a
Big Mac right it doesn't taste as good as a
steak smothered in barbecue sauce or ribs with barbecue sauce
or something like that but it feels good it feels
good to eat it because you know that you're burning
clean you're like you're putting clean fuel into your can
you know into your car but your car here is
your body your body is your car and it also
affects the performance of your mind so this stuff you
have to really you know have to train yourself to
like this but when you do you do actually like
it and you know now I enjoy this and I
enjoy it on different levels I enjoy it both on
the level of taste but also on the level of
the higher values that I'm after so the other thing
that I've got that I'm going to put on here
because there's not much protein here is eggs and most
of you probably have not even had a real egg
in your life and don't know what it really gives
what is a real egg a real egg is this
it's a pasture-raised egg this is simply organic this is
pasture-raised this means that the hen was let out to
pasture and was let out to roam around in the
Sun on a prairie and actually eat bugs and and
grass or whatever it is that hens eat they were
able to eat that stuff what they naturally eat and
they were able to be outdoors and then they were
able to lay these eggs and then you get these
eggs pasture-raised eggs I get these guys at Whole Foods
now this carton costs about $7 what is a standard
carton of eggs cost a standard carton of eggs costs
about $2 you could probably even get them for a
dollar 50 if you get larger than a dozen organic
eggs cost around 450 so this is twice almost twice
as expensive as an organic egg an organic egg is
almost twice as expensive as a standard egg so this
is about I would say 7 times maybe 6 7
times more expensive than a standard egg now you might
wonder well that's expensive I don't have that kind of
money to burn on stupid eggs well what you don't
realize is that you haven't really read some of the
shocking things about how eggs are produced and what they
feed those hens and what they feed traditional hands those
cheap white eggs that you buy at Walmart or wherever
what they feed them is they feed them corn and
soybeans and they basically disease them from the inside out
because they they feed them the lowest quality food that
can possibly be fed in order to keep that hand
literally barely breathing in laying eggs and then that that
hen pops out that egg and then that egg is
Carden and then you buy it at Walmart and what
happens is that then you're eating that egg but the
nutritional value of that egg is significantly lower than the
nutritional value of this egg and you can actually see
it when you start cracking these eggs I'll actually show
you another segment when you actually start cracking these eggs
you'll see that they crack different their shell it breaks
apart differently than a traditional egg and also the yolk
the yolk is a bright and not a bright but
a deep rich orange it's not a yellow color it's
not that pale yellow yolk these are real eggs and
when you actually buy this I encourage you just to
buy it once even if you're not going to be
making a habit of it buy it once and take
a look at the consistency in the quality of the
yolk and the whites and the shell and you're going
to see that there's there's something to this idea that
these are really different than what you're normally being fed
pasture-raised eggs they're expensive but this is the stuff that
you should be eating if you're going to be eating
any kind of animal protein at all it should be
pasture raised it should not be factory farmed so I've
already cooked up some eggs I made three of them
just kind of put them in a pan and fry
them up for five minutes so I'm just going to
toss these on top I already salted them and that
is it so that's my meal so this will last
me for pretty much half the day right now I'm
not eating that much I'm not working out at the
gym so much and not trying to put on too
much muscle I've actually been losing that and that means
I can get away with eating less like this but
if I was really working out a lot and I
need a lot of energy and I was burning through
a lot of calories then I'd probably have to eat
like three of these salads a day plus other stuff
that I eat I mean this is not all I
eat all the dark chocolate I'll eat wild Alaskan smoked
salmon what else do I eat I will eat these
desserts that I make from frozen berries organic frozen berries
which are really awesome and before I went on to
this vegetarian phase I really liked to eat a grass-fed
organic steak which you can get at Whole Foods and
other places like a higher quality markets so basically I
mean this is this is what I eat now you
got to ask yourself how close is your diet to
this are you eating this or what are you eating
how much of your diet is fried how much how
much of it is just totally overcooked how much of
it is seared and grilled and and charred how much
of it is like totally stood and sauteed so all
the nutrients are gone how much of it is coming
from high quality ingredients versus low quality ingredients what percentage
of your diet is vegetables and what percentage of you
diet is fruits and I mean real vegetables not potatoes
and other junk vegetables I mean real leafy either green
or red or orange vegetables so how much is your
diet like that versus the standard American diet I'm willing
to bet that what you're eating right now is a
hundred times worse that what I'm showing you guys and
the reason that is is because I know I know
how hard it is to make the switch it takes
it takes discipline it also takes an awareness it takes
a higher awareness and understanding of what the hell is
going on you have to read nutrition books you have
to really build a case for yourself to convince yourself
why you should be eating this way versus not because
to eat like this even though this was a simple
setup that I had here and I made this meal
in about 10 minutes this is not something you're going
to do this is not something that comes naturally and
easily in our culture in our culture what comes actually
and easily are the doughnuts and bagels at work it's
the McDonald's breakfast sandwich that you get on your way
to work when you're rushed it's the McDonald's you get
for your kids when you got to take them to
soccer practice and you don't have much time it's the
expensive restaurant that you go out to and that expensive
steak that you buy with your girlfriend or boyfriend you
go out and you do that couple times a week
or whenever a couple times a month well what do
you think you think that expensive steak do you think
that's an organic steak do you think that is a
pasture-raised steak grass-fed steak no that's the cheapest possible steak
that they could buy so that that restaurant could have
the highest profit margin so even if you're going to
a really expensive Steakhouse that's charging you $40 for a
New York Strip then York Strip they're serving you that's
the lowest possible cut the lowest possible quality of meat
that they could have found and sold you because they're
trying to keep their margins up and so even though
you're paying a lot for it maybe it comes with
some fancy side issues and some fancy service and a
fancy decor and white tablecloth but what you're actually feeding
your body is still garbage so I was saying this
is a tough transition to make and to start to
make this transition you have to you have to build
a case in your mind for why it's important you
have to start to notice the effects that all the
junk food that you're eating is having on your performance
at work on your performance with your family on your
performance in bed on your mood and ultimately on your
health because the reason that I bought into this is
because I want to live a long life and I
want to live a healthy life and I don't want
cancer I don't want Alzheimer's disease I don't want to
be fat I was that way and it's horrible it's
disgusting it's pathetic it hurts your self-esteem it hurts your
your ability to be in a successful relationship whether you
believe that or not it actually does a shallow that
may sound so all these are factors and for me
probably the most important factor is the fact that I
really value my purpose in life and I value the
work that I do I really want to have an
impact on people and to do that that means a
I need to live long enough to do that and
I want to live as long as I can because
in my later years what I'm going to be 60
and 70 and 80 hopefully I get to that point
that's when some of my best work can happen because
my work is intellectual so by that point I can
just imagine how much knowledge I've built up how much
wisdom I have and how well I can communicate that
to other people and so that's really when I'm gonna
be in my prime is what I'm going to be
much older not right now right now I'm just starting
up and so to to be at that older age
and to be able to have the kind of impact
that I want well I know that I need to
be healthy because if I'm going to be 60 years
old let's say and I'm going to have back problems
and I'm going to have cancer problems and I'm going
to have various diseases and I would be overweight I'm
not going to have energy I'm going to be impotent
I have all the if I have all those problems
then how am I going to be able to to
communicate how am I going to be able to go
out there with energy and give a speech how am
I going to be able to write something powerful how
am I going to be able to coach people how
am I going to be able to do whatever it
is I'm doing at that point and I'll probably have
many things that I can't even imagine on my plate
then that I don't have right now so how am
I going to have the energy and the health to
do that well this is it right here this is
how and this is not just for the future I
mean this is this is giving me health right now
this is giving me energy right now if I were
to replace this right now with a cheeseburger and fries
and a milkshake and that's what I was going to
eat then I would literally feel so bad that I
would not be able to continue to work after shooting
this video I'd have to go sit down and take
a breather for a couple hours just to recuperate right
I remember how that was feeling lethargic and sleepy and
just absolutely god-awful so this thing is serving me now
because I'm going to eat this and I'm going to
feel great I'm going to feel light and empty and
I'm going to be able to go and do whatever
I want to do I just came back from the
gym so I'm already feeling pumped and I want to
shoot this video for you guys because I knew you
guys were asking about nutrition and I wanted to show
you what it really looks like to eat healthy so
if you're taking one thing away from this it's eat
more green vegetables start cleaning up your diet because it's
really important to the performance and the quality of life
