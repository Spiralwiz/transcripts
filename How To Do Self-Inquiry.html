[Music] you happy holidays I'm excited to have my Christmas
hat out once again I almost wish that I could
wear this hat every single week but then I would
be freaking people out in July or something like that
maybe I should wear sometime for April Fool's but anyways
in this episode I thought we would do some more
work on self-inquiry how do you do self-inquiry this is
a technique that I talk about a lot along with
meditation and yoga and psychedelics and so forth this is
one of the core spiritual techniques towards awakening yourself but
even though the technique is simple it can be very
tricky to do it properly so let's actually demonstrate it
for you live right here and point out some of
the traps and pitfalls and various ways that it can
be done incorrectly it's very important that you understand with
these meditative techniques whether you're doing mindfulness meditation or self
inquiry or yoga that you need to be doing these
techniques precisely and properly because otherwise you will waste decades
doing these techniques and not seeing the full benefits that
are promised to you and then what will happen is
you'll get discouraged and you'll just start to think like
well all this enlightenment stuff must just be fantasies and
fairy tales because I'm not seeing it in my direct
experience well that's because you're not doing the techniques correctly
and it's sort of like you know if you were
launching a rocket ship to the moon you would double-check
triple-check quadruple-checked all of your parts of your rocket ship
to make sure that they all function before you actually
launch the thing because you have so much invested in
it so much riding on the line well it's the
same thing with your awakening you're gonna be doing this
yoga or this self-inquiry or this meditation for the next
five or ten years probably so you want to make
sure you're doing it correctly so let's dig into it
so what is self inquiry well basically we're trying to
discover what we are physic and even beyond that metaphysically
or existentially so the most important question that's driving us
is what are you you what is that thing that
we call you now the thing that makes self inquiry
so devilishly tricky is that there's really to use that
we're talking about here one is the you that you
know and love from your very birth the one that
you're very familiar with the one that everyone is familiar
with that is the false you the false self and
then there is the true self your ultimate existential nature
your spiritual self the thing which is responsible for all
of existence that thing you don't know what that is
that is the true self or otherwise in Buddhism called
the no self which is really just the same thing
as the true self so self inquiry is about looking
past the false self past the ego and discovering the
true self how do you do that that's the trick
so let me guide you through that here a little
bit so first what we need to do is we
need to establish a current frame of what you think
you are so what I'd like you to do right
now is to give me articulate for me is the
most accurate description of what you think you are don't
overthink this and I don't want to hear any fantasies
from you or any wishful spiritual beliefs about how you
are nothingness or how you are God or how you
are some some lofty spiritual thing that you've heard me
say or some other teachers say well that you've read
in a book none of that instead I want you
to actually now start to go inside of yourself and
feel what do you really identify with actually so when
I say you when I point my finger at you
and I want you to go in there and find
the most essential thing that is you that you think
you are what is that here it's very important that
you're brutally honest so if you believe that you are
the face then that's what you believe you are is
the face or if you believe that you're a body
then that's what you believe you are if you believe
that you're some sort of soul then that's what you
believe you are so what is that you could pause
this recording and try to figure that out right now
again don't overthink it I'm not asking you for scientific
theories about where you came from I'm not asking for
biological descriptions of anything you need to actually go inside
of yourself and ask yourself truly truly honestly like what
am i identified with such that like if I put
a gun to your head and I was about to
pull the trigger what is the thing that you think
is gonna die what is the thing that's gonna be
lost the most precious thing that's going to be lost
in that situation what is that is that really your
body maybe maybe that's what you're identified with for many
people that's what they're identified with and if that's you
that's fine just admit that let's start there let's start
in an honest place the problem is that you've listened
to all these spiritual videos of spiritual gurus telling you
all these fantastical things about the true self that you're
you're so preoccupied with that fantasy that you're not being
honest with yourself about what you are really identified with
maybe it's a sensation in your chest like your heart
maybe you feel like you're inside the skull back there
between your eyes so first articulate that and be clear
and notice that you're gonna struggle with this so you're
gonna go inside you're gonna kind of try to look
for what you think you are and maybe you have
some vague idea and notice that your ideas are gonna
be very vague you for example you might say the
body but then of course like what part of the
body specifically like try to be very specific about it
and you'll notice that it's gonna be difficult for you
because it's not quite right to say that like your
your your hand because obviously you could lose your hand
and you're not going to lose your sense of self
just by losing a hand so that means that the
hand wasn't really essentially what you are and in fact
you think that you have the hand the hand is
not you the hand is something you have it's something
you're looking at you know you're looking at your hand
so that already means that you're not really the hand
you're the one looking at the hand and you can
take this logic even further because if you say that
you're the head you might say okay I'm the head
or I'm my brain okay well are you really the
brain or is the brain something you have or is
the brain something you're looking at or something that you're
experiencing and so what you're going to notice is that
if you go through this exercise no matter what object
you tend to purport and put forward as yourself whether
it's a hand a foot your heart a feeling of
sensation and image of your face of your head of
your skull of your body of your soul or whatever
that is always going to be some kind of object
with properties concrete properties and that really you're not that
but rather you're the thing that is aware of that
and so the more you start to realize that the
less you start to identify with any kind of physical
attributes that you have and the more you're getting closer
and closer to your true self but you're still not
there yet so we still have some more work to
do so the whole trick with discovering your true self
is that the true self and all for you right
now has no properties whatsoever and we conventionally socially are
used to describing our world as the world of form
the world of phenomena the world of objects so for
us to say that a thing is real and that
it exists it has to have some kind of concrete
properties it has to be black or red or has
to be big or small or it has to be
fuzzy or sharp or tall or skinny or fat or
it has to be an object or even it has
to be something like an emotion you might say well
an emotion is not an object but still even an
emotion has a certain feel to it has certain characteristics
to it it even has a certain location within physical
space and in fact all the objects that we know
tend to have a location within physical space and so
now when we try to go looking for the true
self we tend to assume that well there is going
to be a physical object or something like an object
that I'm gonna find inside of myself that is my
true self sort of like if you were gonna look
you know turn your eyes inwards and look inside your
skull and maybe find some kind of object like a
tennis ball and then you know like find it one
day and like oh here it is the tennis ball
that's what I actually am is this thing called a
tennis ball and it's round it's got these properties to
it and this is what trips us up when we're
looking for the true self because the true self has
no properties whatsoever it's pure awareness it's what you are
is fundamentally just pure awareness or consciousness but it's difficult
for you to find that because when you go looking
for it you can't find it and that's right you
can't find it in a certain sense because it's just
empty so let's actually take this out of the realm
of theory and actually take this into your direct experience
right now so what I'd like you to do is
to get comfortable relax yourself a little bit relax your
body and relax your mind and just become conscious of
the fact that you're sitting here and that your existing
so crank up your awareness dial because we're gonna need
that for these exercises so now you should be a
little bit more conscious just be conscious of existence that
you're existing right now now I want you to go
inside of yourself and find your deepest sense of you
don't overthink it just go and find inside yourself and
find your most essential nature what is that try to
find it and here I want you to go deeper
than your body or any kind of bodily sensations so
maybe you're feeling your heart right now or maybe you're
kind of trying to like almost as though look inside
of your skull because it feels like you're somewhere in
the skull try to find that thing which owns your
body and owns your brain and owns your mind and
just put your awareness on that and ask your what
is that now here's where the trick happens the ego-mind
is very very tricky so what it will do especially
when you're new to self-inquiry is that it will not
allow you to really go to your true empty essential
nature instead what it'll do is it'll sort of allow
you to go there half way but what will happen
is then slots will come up because to do this
self-inquiry effectively you have to be able to do it
with a silent mind without a bunch of monkey mind
and theories and ideas and concepts and beliefs you have
to actually feel into it with your awareness and so
that thing whatever that thing is right now that you're
pinpointing as your true self that thing right there that
is actually the false self that's not the true self
because your mind is coming up now with images and
words and beliefs and concepts about what that thing is
and all of those are the false self so let's
be very explicit here because this is important your entire
life story of who you thought you were from your
birth up till today that is your false self if
that's what you're identifying with your identification with your body
is the false self that's the ego any thoughts you
have of you as a biological creature or as a
physical object those are all the ego so what does
that leave you with nothing everything that you've ever thought
about as being yourself since you were born up till
today all of that has been the false self all
of that has been ego and when I tell you
to go deep inside of yourself and find your essence
which you're probably gonna do is you're gonna start to
feel more into your body and there's gonna be body
sensations like in your chest you might feel your heart
or you might feel inside of your skull a little
bit or the back of your head and all of
those feelings are also the false self you see so
the reason that self inquiry is so sneaky is that
you're we're trying to get you to go really deep
inside and to find that emptiness within you but because
your mind is not trained to put its awareness on
pure emptiness and keep it there what it does instead
is kind of veers off to the side and gets
attached to some kind of phenomenal thing like a body
sensation or an image in the mind or an idea
or a word or a belief or a memory that
you might have from childhood or a feeling or any
of this and none of this is the true self
this is all the EO this is what the false
self is created out of these are like the building
blocks the individual building blocks that are creating this illusion
of the of the ego and so what we're trying
to do is we're trying to penetrate through that brick
wall to see what lies on the other side but
as we're trying to do that the mind latches onto
these various bricks that it gets stuck and it doesn't
allow itself to go through so it's important for you
to be very honest with yourself and to realize that
you actually don't know what you true self is and
that's a very good starting point you need to become
conscious try to become conscious right now that all of
the things that you have ever thought were you in
your entire life including your personal biographical story all of
your memories your beliefs about physics and science and chemistry
and neuroscience and brains and molecules and whatever ideas like
this you have that all of that was the false
self none of that is really you so of course
naturally you think well then what am i if I'm
not any of those things well first of all a
you're gonna think that's kind of crazy Leo that's crazy
crazy talk what do you support even smoking well you
gotta you gotta keep your skepticism in check here because
we're trying to do this inquiry we're trying to be
just open and we're trying to investigate I'm not trying
to get you to believe anything I'm trying to show
you a practice that you do and whatever you discover
there's like a scientific experiment right the scientist doesn't really
care what he discovers he just wants to discover whatever
is true so that's kind of like the attitude you
got to take care the problem though of course is
that you're so used to identifying with your memories and
your biographical story and your body sensations and your thoughts
and it's self image in the image of your face
you're so used to this that how do I convince
you that all of that is not really you when
you have spent your entire life thinking that's you and
your entire environment and culture and your parents and your
friends and your teachers have all been reinforcing that within
you you see what we're really doing here is we're
sort of trying to D brane Wash U D program
you but you have been so thoroughly brainwashed and programmed
from your very birth that you can see this very
difficult to do so you have to kind of like
start to suspect that yeah I've been I've been thoroughly
brainwashed so thoroughly brainwashed that I can't even distinguish anymore
between what's real and what's imaginary or what's possible and
what's impossible so make sure you keep a radically open
mind here as you're doing these exercises but well yeah
so see the problem is that you you're identifying with
all this stuff and what I'm trying to get you
to do is to go beyond all that to the
emptiness inside of you so let's try that right now
again go inside and find your true self what is
it that you believe you are in the most essential
way not your body not your brain not any thoughts
not any beliefs you have not any images of your
face or the back of your head or of your
body not even any feelings in your chest or in
your skull so what you should be doing you should
be kind of turning your awareness inwards like this inwards
back into your eyes into your skull and and trying
to get can you feel that sense of kind of
like emptiness that's there you have this sense that you
exist you have this sense of i am-ness that's there
but you can't quite pinpoint it you can't quite put
your finger on it you can't quite tell what it
is and in fact it's difficult for you to even
keep your mind on it because your mind veers off
to various others tangible sensations in your body so as
you're trying to kind of like look inside at that
emptiness that's there you might get an image of what
that emptiness looks like it might be like a fuzzy
cloud you might picture as a fuzzy cloud or you
might picture it as that the image of nothing or
you might feel some sort of Impala empty sensations inside
your skull or in your chest that's still the false
self go beyond that to the actual emptiness that's there
and now now that you're there keep your attention right
there don't let your mind wander keep it right there
and now wonder what is that what is that whatever
that is that is your ultimate true self but the
problem is you don't know what it is you're trying
to look for it as though you're looking for a
tennis ball somewhere inside of yourself like a physical object
you're trying to look for it and you believe that
you're gonna find it if like if only you look
deep enough in there you'll find this object whatever it
is and then you'll be able to say oh yeah
that's what I am I'm this tennis ball looking thing
or whatever resist that temptation stay with the emptiness don't
succumb to the minds temptation to come up with some
sort of conceptual or imaginary preview of what that true
self is we don't want a metaphor here we're not
looking for a preview we're not looking for a model
or a theory we're not looking for an image of
it we're not looking for a belief about it we're
not looking for a word that explains it we're just
trying to actually get in touch with the actuality of
what we are that emptiness so just try to keep
your attention right there in that emptiness and I know
that is difficult especially if you haven't done much practice
with meditation or with mindfulness or with yoga or with
psychedelics or any other kind of spiritual techniques it's going
to be very difficult for the average person to keep
his mind or her mind that emptiness because the mind
tends to wander and because these days you know we
watched so much internet videos so much YouTube so much
Facebook so much smartphone text messages and Instagram and all
this sort of stuff we're so distracted we're multitasking all
the time that we don't have the the focusing muscles
that are necessary to really be effective at self inquiry
and self inquiry is a rather advanced technique it's a
technique that's not very effective for many newbies precisely because
they lack the focusing ability and their mind is too
noisy too many thoughts are coming up which are separating
you from feeling into that emptiness so ultimately what is
self inquiry self inquiry is you going into that emptiness
like I've been showing you here so go back to
it right now feel that whatever that is and then
just sitting there and observing that with a silent mind
as silent as you can get your mind to be
now the trick though is that it's going to take
you a long time of patiently quietly observing that emptiness
whatever that is and for now I recommend that you
just think of that emptiness just like a question mark
it's a question mark you don't know what it is
it's something but you don't know what it is so
the purpose of self-inquiry is just to observe that question
mark hour after hour after hour day after day after
day for hundreds and thousands of hours if necessary until
one day all of a sudden you have a massive
epiphany and you realize oh that's what that thing is
and that is awakening that is enlightenment when that happens
but you must observe very patiently for a very long
time with lots of focus before that breakthrough or epiphany
will happen so really what you're doing is the following
it says though you take an object like your finger
and you're sitting here and you're just looking at this
finger so try this just look at your finger and
pretend as though you don't know what your finger really
is it's just like an unknown object you're just kind
of like looking at it and you're just wondering what
is this finger what is it and you're just kind
of like looking at it and looking at it and
looking at it and you're not thinking about it you're
not speculating you're not theorizing you're not doing philosophy you're
not even doing science it's not like you're sitting here
looking at this finger and thinking like well this finger
is man of molecules and you know I think that
this finger came about through evolution and I know that
this finger has bones inside of it you know I
could take an x-ray of it I could see the
bones and I know there's like blood in this finger
I know they're cells millions and billions of cells making
up this finger none of that is the same as
just observing the actuality of this finger as it is
right here so try to just observe your finger without
thinking about it that is exactly what you will be
doing with self-inquiry except the object will change rather than
your finger you're gonna be using that emptiness that is
inside of you and you're gonna have to train your
attention on it for many many hours with great focus
and then spontaneously there will be an epiphany or an
awakening spontaneously you will realize what that thing is this
will not be a verbal answer so a common mistake
that people make is they think that self inquiry will
lead to an answer in some kind of verbal form
that's false nor will it be a conceptual answer it
will not be a model or a theory or philosophy
or even a belief of any kind the answer will
take some kind of new form and you have to
just be open to whatever that form is you don't
know what it is it's just gonna be your true
nature but for that to happen you're just gonna have
to train your awareness on it for a very very
long time and the trick though is that the mind
gets tired of holding its attention on the emptiness and
it's gonna wander around and start to think and daydream
and come up with theories and speculations and ideas it's
gonna fears you're gonna come up worries are gonna come
up ideas for the future problems from the past old
memories are gonna come up your personal biography will come
up scientific theories will come up stuff that I told
you in videos advice that I've given you in the
past all of that will come up psychedelic experiences that
you might have had in the past memories of those
those will come up and the whole trick with self
inquiries they have to cut through all of that and
just stay with the emptiness and as you do that
minute after minute hour after hour you build this laser
focus like concentration on that emptiness and that eventually there
will be a breakthrough and you must trust that there
will be a breakthrough otherwise you will never hold your
attention there long enough in order to actually have the
breakthrough and if your mind wanders you got to bring
it back and train it back on the emptiness and
of course what's gonna happen is your minds gonna get
attached to various sensations and images in your mind it
can be even difficult for you to maintain awareness on
that emptiness for longer than 15 seconds without your mind
having to conjure up some image of the emptiness and
what you need to realize is that that image of
the emptiness is not emptiness itself that's the false self
a feeling in your chest is not emptiness it is
the false self and so you need to go beyond
that another way to frame it is like this go
inside of you and find the thing inside of you
which is the perceiver the thing which is aware of
your body your emotions your thoughts your mental imagery and
the entire world what is that thing whatever that thing
is that is the true self but that thing is
not your biological self you might say that thing is
inside of your biological self its residing somewhere inside your
skull maybe inside your chest you don't really know where
is residing yet but it feels like it's inside of
you that is your most essential nature that's what you
really identify with ultimately if you get very honest with
yourself you identify with being the perceiver the subject of
all the objects isn't that what you think you are
you're the subject you're the one who's hearing these words
you're the one who's seeing my face you're the one
who's feeling any kind of bodily sensations that are arising
in you you're the one who's hearing internal dialogue from
the monkey mind so what is that thing well that
thing is pure subjectivity everything else that we've been talking
about is an object colors sounds feelings thoughts ideas images
theories concepts all of those are objects in your awareness
but what is the subject of all those objects that's
the true self but notice you don't know what it
is you can feel it you have a kind of
a sense an intuition that it's there obviously that's how
you know that you exist the problem is that that
feeling of emptiness has been fused with all sorts of
bodily sensations and mental concepts and personal biography that you
have and so those two things have been confused and
so now that pure subjectivity and emptiness has been fused
with your physical body and your personal story and all
of your personal possessions and your personality so maybe you
think you're a good person a bad person a fearful
person a courageous person an arrogant person a tall person
a skinny person a fat person or whatever kind of
person you think you are all of that this is
all objects that have been that have been intermingled with
that pure subjectivity the emptiness and so now you have
this this mixture and so what we're trying to do
with self inquire is what we're trying to separate these
two apart this is the true self this is the
false self this is the thing that was born when
your mother and father conceived you and then your mother
gave birth to you this is the stuff that was
born your physical body your personality your all of your
attributes your genetics your brain all of that that's all
form that arose with your biological birth but that was
never the true you the true you was the emptiness
or the space or the awareness the pure awareness within
which all of that arose so when you were born
what happened was you weren't really born you were always
there that emptiness was always there but then the biological
form of you as the human being was born and
then that thing got fused with this thing and you've
confused it ever since and you're in this state of
confusion right now where these two things are are mixed
like this so what we're doing with self inquiry is
when you're in this mixed state we're trying to get
you to just focus on this part the emptiness part
and the longer you focus on it and you keep
your attention there these two are gonna separate more and
more and more and more and more until eventually when
the epiphany of awakening happens you will become perfectly clear
and aware of awareness itself the emptiness or the formlessness
and at that moment these two will split apart like
this and you will realize that all of this stuff
the external world including your body and your feelings and
emotions and thoughts and your personal biography all of this
that you've been attached to you're gonna realize that none
of that has been you what you were was this
emptiness the whole time this is pure subjectivity these are
objects here this is the subject the true self the
problem though with with becoming aware of this subject is
that the subject has no properties it's not big it's
not small it's not colorful it's not non colorful it's
not round it's not square it's not biological it's not
physical it's not anything it's just pure subjectivity it is
pure awareness so in a sense with self inquiry what
I'm asking you to do in this practice is to
put your awareness on your awareness so that's another good
pointing technique so right now try that right now without
overthinking this just follow this following instruction take your awareness
first put your awareness on your hand notice what that
feels like now take your awareness and put your awareness
on an object behind your hand like the wall or
the lamp something behind your hand put your awareness there
now bring your awareness back to your hand and now
finally put your awareness on awareness itself and keep it
there until enlightenment happens don't let your mind wander that's
it that is the of self-inquiry what makes it so
difficult is that your mind will wander a lot a
lot a lot which is why it's very helpful to
have some kind of meditative practice or some sort of
concentration practice in order to build your concentration abilities because
you're going to need to be able to keep your
attention and awareness on awareness itself what you are existentially
is awareness but even though I tell you that and
it seems like now you know the answer the real
question is what is awareness and the only way you're
going to answer that question is not by reading books
or asking me for the answer I can't give you
the answer you are the answer you have to go
inside and actually see what awareness is the only way
to find out what awareness is is by training your
awareness upon awareness itself for a very long time until
something pops an awareness will reveal itself to you and
you have to resist the temptation of trying to objectify
awareness because awareness is not an object like all the
other things that you have come to know in life
awareness is not like a tennis ball or a lamp
or a table or a tree or a human or
a hand or even an emotion or thought or even
an image or anything it's not like any of those
things it's a it's a soul thing so resist the
temptation to objectify it resist the temptation of creating analogies
and metaphors and images of this emptiness do not allow
your mind to say something like well emptiness is sort
of like this awareness is sort of like that it's
kind of like this and oh it might look like
that all of that is distraction avoid the temptation of
speculating about where this awareness came from and how it
could be and and how does it connect with science
and history and all the other stuff that you've learned
avoid that temptation that's also a distraction none of that
will get you an answer to what awareness is science
will not do it for you neuroscience whatever brain research
you've studied none of that will explain awareness you must
put your awareness upon awareness itself and what you will
ultimately discover is that it's pure emptiness there is nothing
there it's so empty that you can't even call it
empty it's so nothing it's so void that to call
it void is already too much it's so empty that
you can't say that it exists or that it doesn't
exist it's too empty for even those categorizations any quality
that you ascribe to it it is not that's what
makes us so tricky so you might wonder then Willy
oh this seems impossible how am I ever gonna figure
this out well that's the beauty of it you don't
need to figure it out you just need to put
your awareness on awareness itself and keep it there for
a very long steady period of time and it will
reveal itself to you automatically this is not something that
you're gonna forcefully do through exertion of willpower other than
that you will need to exert willpower to keep your
aware unawareness itself so in that sense you can use
your willpower to do that but you can't actually will
the answer or the revelation to come to you that
will happen spontaneously when it decides to happen how long
will it take that's going to depend on every person
individually we don't know could take hours could take months
could take years could take decades but actually if you
are very very focused it shouldn't take that long within
a couple of years of this practice if you do
it daily it should start to reveal itself to you
but you must do this practice precisely and not just
have your mind wandering around thinking and fantasizing and attaching
itself to various sensations in the body if you do
that it might take you five decades and you still
won't figure it out because you're looking in the wrong
place now here's a trick that a lot of spiritual
practitioners don't really understand about this process so remember I
said that when you start off before you do any
spiritual practice you have a fusion of the formed world
the objective world with the formless subjective true self they're
fused together like this this is where you start when
you're unenlightened like you are right now now you start
to do spiritual practice and these two things start to
separate more and more and more and here detachment happens
your dis identifying with bodies with sensations with emotions with
suffering with pain with all that your dis identifying with
it and you're becoming more and more conscious of the
true self the emptiness until finally you have a breakthrough
on awakening a Satori and you realize finally the thing
you've been looking for the whole time which is pure
emptiness and in that moment it seems like you've escaped
the material world and you've gone into the spiritual this
is the spiritual realm let's say this is spirit this
is physicality and at that point it seems like oh
I'm none of this stuff it's sort of like I've
exited the matrix and this can feel rather freeing it
can feel liberating but it can also feel like now
you're detached from all of this and actually what happens
here is that when you do that your spiritual journey
is not yet complete you have not reached full non-duality
yet because actually what you've done notice you've created a
new duality in a sense you were in non duality
when you started because the non duality you were in
was a non duality of the material world the only
thing the average person knows the unawakened person is the
material world because the spirit and the material is fused
together the form in the formless are fused together like
this so so tightly that that the spirit and the
awareness isn't even registered only the physical world is registered
the form is registered so as you break that now
identification switches to the formlessness but as you do that
actually you create a duality because now there's the formed
and the formless there's the material the physical and the
spiritual there's the false self and there's the true self
there's the unenlightened state and the enlightened state but this
is only half the journey the other very important epiphany
that you must have and this will probably require a
further enlightenment although it could also happen at the same
time is now you to bring the formlessness back in
together and fuse it with the form such that now
what happens is that by bringing these two together what
you realize is that there actually is no difference between
form and formlessness between the material and the spiritual between
the unawakened state and the awakened state and so now
these things are fused back together but now after the
student happens the reason it's different from the fusion that
was there when you began that now you've permeated the
material with the emptiness and the formlessness and the spirit
such that now you realize that oh all of that
form and materiality and physicality that I thought was just
the physical world all of that was actually spirit you
realize that there is no difference between the material and
spiritual and when you realize that what you've done is
you've brought spirits into and infused your entire experience with
spirit and at that point you are literally like you
feel yourself like you're inside of the mind of God
whereas before you thought you were in the physical universe
with physical objects now nothing has changed the colors des
cités the objects they still look the same you can
still see trees and tables and people you can still
see your body and feel your body all of that
but now you realize that all of that is just
like a hallucination inside the mind of God you realize
that all of that is spirit you realize the divinity
of the physical world you realize that there is no
distinction between the mundane and the divine and that is
the ultimate aim of non-duality now you're truly in non-duality
because you realize that there is no distinction and no
boundary between anything and at this point you realize that
nothingness and emptiness is not distinct and separate from form
but that they are actually identical not only are they
similar or have some kind of relationship but they're literally
identical such that you can stand in this room right
here and you can realize that this entire room is
nothing the entire world that I've ever experienced is absolutely
nothing it's as though it never even happened and yet
here it is as though it's happening because there's no
differ between happening and not happening but that's gonna take
you a lot of work to really be able to
to grasp at that's gonna require a lot of work
so right now I recommend you don't worry too much
about the second phase of this spiritual path which is
the bringing of the emptiness back into the form don't
worry about that yet for you at your stage when
you're just trying to learn self inquiry your job right
now is to try to separate the form from the
formless and the way you do that is just by
putting your attention on the formless and keeping it there
for a very very long time I have an episode
that I released earlier which I believe is called learning
equals observation where I talk about how the most important
component to learning anything is just pure observation and how
a lot of people don't know that most people don't
appreciate how much they could learn about anything whether it's
a person an animal a plant a situation a system
or themselves simply by sitting and observing it for a
very long period of time without any thoughts or any
theories or any philosophy or any science or anything just
literally sitting and observing it like do you want to
to learn for example about ants all you need to
do is go outside your house find a little ant
hill by the side of your house and sit there
and look at the ants for a very long time
but the mistake that people make is they think well
if I'm going to be sitting there looking at the
ants I must then start to theorize about the ants
I must start to think and I'm a certain research
and I must put together ideas about how the ants
work in all of this that's the mistake instead what
you got to do is just sit and look at
the ants for like a hundred hours and then by
the end of that you will walk away with so
many insights about how ants live what they do you
will actually learn to distinguish individual ants you will get
so good you will get so perceptive so sensitive that
you will literally be able to to like separate one
ant from another ant because you will be that perceptive
because that's the power of observation the problem those our
minds are always so busy that we rarely apply this
technique to anything in the world and that's why people
fundamentally don't understand much of the world at all because
they just love to think about the world they have
all sorts of beliefs about the world and theories about
the world and they will go and watch videos about
how the world is and that is just ideas and
more images but they never actually bothered to sit down
and look at the thing that they're trying to understand
like do you want to understand your child if you
have a child don't ask the child questions don't read
a book about children just watch your child playing in
the sandbox watch your child eating watch your child playing
with other friends watch your child learning at school or
reading a book watch your child doing her homework watch
your child opening a gift on Christmas just watch set
aside your opinions and judgments and ideas about what's right
what's wrong and what your child is doing that you
don't like and just watch can you see how that's
very difficult to do because our natural inclination is to
want to interact with the system we're not good at
just watching silently we want to express our opinions and
we think that this we want to manipulate it and
we want to control it and that's what every really
good scientist or artist learns how to do is they
become very good observers without injecting themselves into the equation
you must become an objective impartial observer so we're taking
this principle that learning equals observation and we're applying it
to the most ultimate thing that you could observe which
is the observation process itself see we're sort of going
meta on this technique because you can observe ants you
can observe people you can observe your child you can
observe a car you can observe how the government works
you can observe your own body but the ultimate thing
to observe is observation itself what is doing the observation
awareness observation is just another word for awareness or consciousness
but what is observation what is awareness what is consciousness
well you don't know because you haven't observed it you
see so another way to frame what self inquiry is
is that it is the observation of observation that's also
what meditation is for me personally I think my biggest
struggle when doing self inquiry is that my mind is
actually so curious about what awareness and consciousness are that
while I'm focusing on it while I'm trying to observe
my observation the mind gets so eager that it actually
starts coming up with all sorts of theories and speculations
and answers it basically it's wondering too loudly it's wondering
so loudly that it's actually interfering with the observation process
it's sort of like imagine like we were trying to
observe a beautiful object in the sky like a comet
this majestic comet is flying through the sky we have
this this telescope that we're looking through it at and
you know the telescope is very stable and clear it
needs to be stable and clear and focused in order
to see this comet but we look at it we
catch a glimpse of this comet the comet is so
amazing in magnificent it takes our breath away we're so
excited about we start to speculate and we start to
spin around we start to jump and yell and holler
and make noise and shake the the telescope and as
we do this we lose sight of the comet so
the whole trick with meditation and self inquiry and also
with psychedelic experiences is that you need to kind of
like calm yourself in the midst of the astonishment and
the the wonder of looking at the process of looking
so that you're not getting in your own way and
that requires calming the mind down it's a really good
analogy to think of it as calming the mind down
to self-inquiry is like removing the clouds in the sky
for a telescope you're not gonna see anything on a
cloudy day through a telescope and you're not gonna get
very far with self-inquiry when your mind is churning away
speculating theorizing imagining bringing up various teachings and things you've
read in books all of that is getting in the
way so if you can have a practice that helps
you to calm your mind down anything that helps you
to do that is going to be great and really
if you're beginning self inquiry then what I recommend is
that you you have two practices to make self inquiry
effective first you have sort of a pre self inquiry
practice which is a form of meditation or yoga or
concentration practice where you are training your concentration ability and
you can just practice by holding out your finger and
just staring at your finger for five minutes straight without
wavering without thoughts that would be like your pre self
inquiry practice and then as you're practicing that you can
follow that up with the actual self inquiry which now
the only difference is that you're you're changing the object
from the finger to awareness itself there's another important thing
that I forgot to mention when you're doing this of
acquiring so I speak of it as though like I'm
telling you to go inwards and you might wonder why
am I telling you to go inwards well because for
most people that's where you believe you live is inside
of your body that's how it feels like it feels
like you're you're well you're almost it almost feels like
you're a ghost who is looking out at the world
like this almost like you're a ghost inside of your
skull this ghost if you keep looking at it long
and long enough eventually you'll realize that it's just pure
emptiness but notice an interesting thing that happens if you
realize that the ghost is pure emptiness pure emptiness unlike
other physical objects formed objects does not have a position
in space or a location or a size and what
that means is that even though it feels like you're
inside the skull that you're this ghost inhabiting the body
and looking out at the world like this that's really
an illusion so the more you go inside and feel
into that emptiness you will realize wait a minute this
is a hole it is just pure emptiness there's nothing
there and if that's what I am is just pure
emptiness that emptiness does it have a shape a size
a position in space no which literally then gets you
to realize that there's no reason that the emptiness is
just inside of my body or inside of the skull
it's omnipresent it's literally everywhere and in fact the body
and this entire room and the entire universe is occurring
within the emptiness so when you begin self inquiry you
tend to believe that you're gonna find some kind of
object inside of you called the true self like a
tennis ball but the more you look at that tennis
ball you realize it wasn't a tennis ball at all
it was just a vacuum and a vacuum is a
type of object that doesn't have a position or a
location and so what's gonna happen is that that sense
of you being inside your head looking out at the
world on this side of your face that sense will
will die out and you will spill out into the
external world as you've called it you will spill out
into here so rather than finding some kind of point
or object inside of you that is the perceiver which
you're going to discover is that the perceiver is not
a point and it's not an object that is bounded
it's not small it's actually infinite in its dimensions it
stretches forever in every direction and that's what you are
and so awakening is realizing that you are larger than
the entire universe that's what it feels like so it's
okay if you are just beginning self inquiry if you
think that the emptiness is inside of you and it
might almost feel like you have to kind of go
inside before you're able to kind of like focus on
that emptiness but eventually what you should realize is that
there's really not even a need to go inside because
that emptiness is equally everywhere anywhere you look is that
emptiness so it doesn't work like a camera conventionally we
think of perception and awareness as though it's a camera
and in a camera we have this sort of conical
model of how perception works like there's a sensor in
the back of the camera then there's a lens then
there's the light that shines through in this sort of
conical fashion right and it's like it hits the sensor
so the analogy here is that what you are the
true self is the sensor except the trick is that
there actually is no thing like a sensor the sensor
is omnipresent and distributed throughout all of space and it
has no properties or qualities whatsoever that's what makes it
so tricky to understand so when you first begin self-inquiry
you think you're gonna find this sensor and that this
sensor is some kind of like limited little object inside
of you somewhere and then you realize oh [ __
] the sensor is all of space the sensor is
every dimension in every direction imagine if we built a
camera some crazy new sci-fi camera that will be built
a thousand years from now that will not have a
flat sensor in the back but the camera works through
a much more sophisticated technology which we can't even imagine
yet or what we've done is we've actually taken the
sensor we've made a three-dimensional and then we've expanded it
infinitely in all directions to include the entire universe and
then we took a snapshot I know that doesn't really
make much physical sense precisely because it's trans physical it's
metaphysical it's prior to physics so even though we couldn't
really do that in the physical world that actually is
how you are conscious of this room that you're sitting
in right now this entire room is occurring within an
empty vacuum which is your true self but don't think
of this vacuum as empty space because it's actually prior
to space if you're imagining space and you think that
what I am is space or a vacuum that's not
it that's the false self you are not that you
are the thing in which the vacuum is occurring you
are the thing in which space and time are occurring
see it's twisted it'll mind [ __ ] you for
sure make sure you understand that you're not gonna figure
this out intellectually you're not gonna be able to sit
there and kind of like go like this like a
scientist and say oh well okay so I'm I'm I'm
a vacuum but I'm even more of a vacuum than
a vacuum I'm the I'm the thing that the vacuum
is taking place in that's what I am no because
that's not actually emptiness all of that stuff that you've
been thinking and talking about that's all form all of
your metaphors and analogies and models and scientific theories all
of that is more form that's not emptiness you need
to get yourself to actual emptiness actual not an image
of the emptiness not an idea of the emptiness not
a belief of the evidence but the actual emptiness and
then of course what you'll discover is that emptiness is
not what you thought it was emptiness is not in
a black hole or an empty void the way that
you imagine emptiness is none other than fullness emptiness is
none other than all a form so emptiness is not
some state that you put yourself in through a lot
of meditation this moment right now that's happening right now
is emptiness this body the sound of these words all
of this is emptiness but for right now that's jumping
the gun you don't need to realize that yet right
now focus on separating the form from the formlessness then
you will emerge the two back together so I hope
that clears up self inquiry for you it really is
that simple the trick is not to overcomplicate it the
trick now of course is to actually do the practice
all of these things that I've said here they're just
ideas and words they will not awaken you at all
you must now actually turn off this recording sit down
in silence and do this practice and you must do
it not only once you must do it day after
day after day every day hour after hour after hour
with great focus and concentration probably for a few years
until something clicks in you and that of course explains
why so few people are awakened because how many people
are serious enough to actually sit down and do this
day after day after day most people give up a
week into it a month into it a year into
it or they do it very sloppily or they do
it for five minutes at a time here and there
and that just does cut it you need to be
much more serious about it now you might think well
leo but how do I know this is actually gonna
work how do I know I'm just gonna waste a
bunch of years doing this and get no results what
happens if I spend three years doing this and I
never get my awakening it's gonna be just a waste
of three years here's the good news no it won't
it won't be a waste because this whole process is
not just a binary on and off you're not enlightened
or you are enlightened you've succeeded or you failed don't
think of it this by narrowly it's um it's actually
a lot better than that the more you spend putting
your attention on your awareness and doing the self inquiry
your your consciousness will grow and expand and expand and
expand eventually then it'll hit a tipping point and there
will be a massive awakening or an epiphany but even
if you never get there you are still gonna benefit
enormously from the expanding of your consciousness you will be
more aware and more conscious in all of your activities
in life in business in relationships with your emotions and
that's very huge because what's gonna happen is you're gonna
you're gonna create a separation from like we were saying
the form and the formlessness even if you don't permanently
detach the tube which is what we would call enlightenment
eat if you get a little bit of separation that's
still gonna help you enormously because this separation means the
difference between being fully absorbed in your negative emotions and
suffering and not it means that you're fully absorbed in
your intimate relationships and your friendships and your career versus
not it means the difference between clinging and attachment versus
healthy detachment so when you get angry or depressed or
sad or frustrated or jealous or aroused or excited or
you get sort of you have a craving for food
or craving for sex or something like this or someone
dies in your family and there's great suffering and pain
or you have chronic pain in your back the way
I have been lately excruciating pain in your back or
pain in your feet or in your legs or something
like that in your stomach you're gonna be separated from
it there's gonna be a little bit of space of
detachment and the more detached you are the less you're
going to suffer from it because you're gonna realize that
that stuff is happening but it is not me and
the thing that suffers is the attached me so actually
another way to frame this and to explain what the
false self is is as follows think of a time
recently where you had a lot of suffering and pain
could be physical or emotional and you had some strong
negative emotions whether it's fear anger or literal physical pain
try to think of a time like that maybe even
right now you're having that and so now I ask
yourself who is the one that's experiencing that pain and
you're gonna say well me of course that me is
the false self and that's a really good rule of
thumb to remember if you can remember it whenever you're
suffering or in deep pain is to always remember that
the thing that's suffering is always the false self the
true self doesn't suffer and so if you want the
ultimate solution to life into all of life's problems and
suffering is completely detach yourself from the material world and
then you won't suffer but contrary to what many people
think of like like well leo but if i'm if
i detach myself from the world I'll detach myself from
my relationships for my children for my spouse from my
co-workers from the from the whole world I'll detach myself
I'll be off in some sort of spiritual realm and
I'll be just like a detached from reality I'll be
an airhead I will not be able to feel emotions
and beauty and joy anymore and love all of that
will be gone you're telling me to detach myself from
all the beauty of the world that's precisely wrong because
remember there's gonna be a second turning first there's gonna
be a detachment then there's gonna be a reintegration of
full non-duality when you're full non-duality what you're gonna have
is gonna have the best of both worlds you're gonna
have all the full sensitivity of all the emotions that
humans experience but you will also simultaneously be detached from
them all and they will not cause you suffering and
that right there is how you can live a good
life and in fact it's not possible to really live
a good life unless you have accomplished this detachment and
then this reintegration so now you know what to do
now you got to get to work self enquiry is
a great technique that you can use if you still
find that self inquiry is too direct if you find
that you don't have enough focus to do self inquiry
because you've got monkey mind that's not even letting you
put your awareness on awareness itself then you need to
do more preliminary practices like ordinary meditation watching the breath
or I highly recommend Kriya yoga psychedelics can also be
helpful for that to some extent but really you need
a daily practice that will help you to calm down
your mind whatever that is it might be listening to
binaural beats that can be helpful it might be listening
to some guided meditation track so you can find online
I even have a meditation video from the past you
can watch so you know whatever techniques you want to
use do that but then come back to self-inquiry because
meditation alone calming your mind alone is usually insufficient for
an awakening because what needs to happen is not only
does your mind to be calm you also need to
train your awareness on awareness itself or on your true
self and you have to wonder what am i what
is consciousness what is awareness and that is what ultimately
leads to the awakening yeah you can have it awakening
just spontaneously randomly through loss of meditation as well it
can't happen but often times it doesn't I know meditators
who have meditated for 10 20 years and are still
not awake in fact that's usually the case if you
go to a Vipassana retreat you'll find people there who
have been meditating for years and most of them are
not going to be awake because even though there may
be good meditators they haven't actually seriously inquired and wondered
and trained their awareness on what they are the true
self so there you go that's your strategy for awakening
now you got to actually do it remember that talking
about it and doing it are two very different things
and moreover there's sort of a middle category you can
just be talking about it or learning about it and
that's really not gonna awaken you then you can be
thinking about doing it you can be daydreaming and fantasizing
about doing it that's also not gonna awaken you then
you can actually sit down and start doing the practices
and that's a good step but as you're sitting there
you can still be spending a lot of time fantasizing
about how you're gonna awaken that's also getting in the
way that's not gonna get you either you have to
actually do the practices and stop all the fantasies about
awakening that will actually do it and you've got to
very patient with us so just stick with it keep
the faith remember that every day that's going by even
if you're not awake or awakening you are moving closer
and you are becoming more conscious and this is making
you a better human being and you will see the
benefits of it all throughout your life in every situation
so it really is worth your time and effort to
do this all right that's it I'm done here please
click the like button for me and come check out
actualize that org that's my website you'll find my blog
with various exclusive insights that I don't share in the
videos on youtube you will find a my book list
my life purpose course new courses that I'll be introducing
in the future hopefully and the forum where you can
come and ask questions and get advice and find new
resources there you go the last thing I'll say is
you need to actually start to do these practices otherwise
actualize that org will rot your mind and you will
actually start to become depressed and sick from inside from
the disparity between everything that you've been taught and that
you know that you should be doing and then your
actual life where you're not doing anything you're not implementing
any of the work and so the more videos you
watch the more action you have to take otherwise the
gap is gonna grow too big and then it could
really turn out nasty you can get depressed you can
even get suicidal because you're gonna know so much about
everything you can possibly accomplish and all the amazing life
you can create for yourself but then you'll have none
of it in the real world in the real world
you're having a little weak pathetic little life so just
bite the bullet and [ __ ] discipline yourself to
do this work to actually get excited about following up
and and implementing the theories that I talked about get
excited about that and as you're doing that keep reminding
yourself that this is the most worthwhile thing you can
be doing life and it's gonna all pay off but
especially when you first start for the first few years
of meditation of yoga of self-inquiry of even basic personal
development work you're just ramping up baby just ramping up
so you're not gonna see massive benefits when you first
start don't expect that the benefits will really start to
snowball three years down the road five years down the
road eight years down the road that's when it gets
really amazing that's when you start to see the the
revolutionary potential this can have on your life and the
whole reason that most people don't do this work is
because they're not able to get through those first few
years where it's really a slog you have to overcome
so many old habits and addictions and you have to
keep yourself motivated even though you're not maybe getting all
these mystical experiences that you've been hearing about you're not
really feeling it yet that's the cost of entry big
life changes require patience and a long time horizon and
a strong vision where you can maintain your vision in
your goal for a few years until it's actually actualized
and the way you actualize something is through action obviously
so you need to develop that capacity within you this
is crucial if you do not develop the capacity to
implement and to take action upon the things that you
are learning there's no chance you might as well just
stop learning period so the solution is just to bite
the bullet yeah it'll be difficult at first it'll be
a slog there will be days where it's it's like
you really don't want to do it you're you just
want to slack off you want to kind of like
go do some some stupid low consciousness thing you want
to go hang out with your friends or watch TV
or whatever just do it just reminding yourself it's worth
it it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it
on one day finally when you have your major breakthrough
an epiphany then you will realize how true it was
these words that I gave you that is worth it
happy holidays Merry Christmas and Happy New Year you
