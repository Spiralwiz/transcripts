[Music] welcome to the topic of not knowing this is
a very core topic as you can probably tell we're
talking about epistemology here we're going to get into some
deep stuff i've really been wanting to talk about this
topic now for years but it's a tricky topic and
it took me a long time to gather my thoughts
on this topic and to experiment with it a lot
and finally i feel ready to talk about it so
let's go not knowing there's a lot to say about
not knowing believe it or not the biggest obstacle to
spirituality is everything you think you know about reality self
and other notice something interesting something counterintuitive about life that
the most ignorant people think they know everything and the
wisest people are painfully aware of the limits of their
knowledge i have an episode that i released in the
past called what is wisdom where we compared and contrasted
wisdom versus foolishness and this is one of the ways
that you distinguish the wise from the foolish is how
aware are they of the limits of their knowledge most
people do not consider the limits of knowledge very seriously
and they take it for granted they take for granted
the very possibility of knowing itself as though knowing that
it's even possible is just a given that's just like
how the universe is constructed it's constructed in a way
where we can just look at objects think about life
and come to know it but that possibility itself must
be questioned which is what we're going to do today
i'd like you to consider the possibility that you actually
don't know what anything is it's so difficult to get
the mind to consider this because the mind thinks that
it actually knows what it knows you actually think that
you know things what they are but you don't and
so here's where you're gonna have to do some work
really think about this and if you do this correctly
it should start to disturb you seriously disturb you what
is anything at all for example what is a fork
here it is now your mind is going to tell
you that you know what this thing is it's a
fork i mean how how hard could it be but
what is a fork see that's the problem and notice
that your mind is going to start to come up
with stuff it's like oh well it's a an object
that you use to poke at stuff put it in
your mouth it's a food utensil it's a it's a
metal object or it's a wooden object it's got a
certain shape to it and all that but as soon
as you start to go deeper into that and you
start to analyze all of those you know sub definitions
because basically what you're doing is taking fork and then
you're subdividing fork and you're redefining fork in terms of
instrument or metal object or food utensil or you know
metal or wood or it's mad atoms whatever you think
it's it is you're gonna have to sort of like
break it down into more atomic elements and then you
start to have to of course ask yourself what are
those things right uh we're gonna get a lot deeper
into this this topic just like for now if you
can do this like take a fork sit there and
look at it and sort of do a compare and
contrast like put yourself into a knowing mode and into
a not knowing mode in the knowing mode that's your
normal mode it's like oh it's a fork okay that's
easy we all do that all the time every day
but then try to shift your mind into the not
knowing mode where you're sitting there with this fork and
you're looking at it so deeply and so from scratch
as it were that you actually stop knowing what it
is you see it it's before you but you you
lose connection to all the conceptual baggage of what your
mind tells you that it is and then just sit
there sort of in the unknowing of the fork we'll
practice this some more as we keep going but just
let's begin there so actually what i want to convince
you of is that you actually do not know what
a fork is and in fact there's not a single
scientist in the entire uni in the entire world that
knows what a fork is that can tell you what
a fork is that's pretty outrageous if you open your
mind to this possibility now one option is that you
don't open your mind of this possibility and you deny
it and you say well leo you're just being dumb
or you're just being overly philosophical here and that actually
we do know what a fork is you could take
that option or the second option is you can actually
realize that something profound is being pointed out here and
that maybe actually it is the case that no scientist
on this planet knows what a fork is now if
you open your mind to that possibility that's very interesting
because then you have to wonder like why is that
why is this so difficult fundamentally what is it about
a fork that makes it so difficult to know is
it is it a fork like am i saying that
nobody knows what a fork is but people know what
a knife or a spoon is is that the claim
you know obviously not so there's nothing special about a
fork that makes this so difficult to understand relative to
any other object so so this this raises some interesting
doubts in your mind about the very possibility of knowing
what anything is and then you have to wonder like
well do we not know what a fork is simply
because it's impossible to know what a fork is or
do we not know what a fork is because maybe
we haven't figured it out yet we got to try
hard like what do we got to do we have
to do more science on it do we have to
like look at it under a microscope to figure out
what it is is it possible to know what a
fork is you should wonder that maybe it is maybe
it's not see you yourself don't really know that yet
because you've never thought about it and then you got
to wonder if it is possible how is it possible
what what needs to be done to know what a
fork is and why hasn't it already been done why
is it so difficult to do or if it's not
possible then you've got to wonder why is it not
possible why can't such a simple thing as a fork
be known and then you got to wonder if that's
the case what does that mean for everything else that
i think i know about the world because there's a
lot of stuff more complex than a fork that you
have convinced yourself that you know so what would it
mean for you to realize that you don't actually know
those things that you think you know now of course
you don't know what a fork is you don't know
what matter is you don't know what energy is you
don't know what space is you don't know what time
is you don't know what an atom is you don't
know what red is you don't know what sound is
you don't know what a man or a woman is
you don't know what an orgasm is you don't know
what language is you don't know what life is you
don't know what death is you don't know what intelligence
is you don't know what consciousness is you don't know
what love is you don't know what meditation is you
don't know what truth is you don't know what society
is what beauty is what happiness is what science is
what spirituality is what good and bad is what light
is what mathematics is what sentience is what other is
what reality is what understanding is and you don't even
know what knowledge is in a interesting epistemic strange loop
you don't even know that much in fact trying to
figure out what knowledge is has been the core puzzle
that has wracked philosophers minds and led to many controversial
debates very complex advanced debates within western intellectual tradition since
the dawn of western philosophy back during you know the
time of socrates and plato and aristotle and all the
way through up till today you know through modernism post-modernism
and now post-post-modernism and still philosophers are disagreeing about what
knowledge is and how to define it so obviously if
you have an ounce of humility and wisdom you should
recognize that there's something very tricky going on here with
knowledge as a society and as a culture we treat
all the things i listed above as known like when
you start school nobody tells you that mankind doesn't know
what any of the above things are nobody tells you
like hey kid we don't know what space is we
don't know what time is we don't know what energy
is we don't know what matter is we don't even
know what a fork is that you're using your food
with so we treat these things as known and very
quickly as you're growing up you get introduced to this
social house of cards that we've constructed and then you
play in this house of cards and you start to
mistake this house of cards for reality and for objective
truth and this leads to all sorts of subtle problems
that you don't recognize because you're so enmeshed and engrossed
in this house of cards this conceptual house of cards
of knowing that uh you don't even know what you're
missing or what the alternative could be and you get
very attached to this house of cards and you start
to defend it too so here's the the core idea
of this episode most of your knowledge is constructed it's
a highly constructed highly biased highly partial conceptual illusion designed
to maintain your survival and sense of sanity and comfort
it's not really grounded in a deep truth survival sanity
comfort not truth those are easily confused by society you
are not aware of how relative and biased your knowledge
is and how quickly it can collapse under the right
questioning prodding altered states of consciousness and so on your
life is a conceptual fortress that is actually a house
of cards which is actually why you and others if
you haven't noticed yet act so defensively in debates arguments
on online forums on twitter in social media comments people
get very ideologically defensive politically religiously even within science even
within science even amongst mathematicians and logicians if you notice
even amongst the greatest intellectuals and academics and the greatest
philosophers they all disagree with each other and they all
get very defensive about their intellectual positions why is that
you should start to suspect that something sneaky and mischievous
is going on some sleight of hand why this defensiveness
you might wonder if you're so convinced of the truth
of your conceptual fortress why are you so defensive why
are you so easily triggered why do you feel the
need to lash out to criticize others to try to
debunk others undermine others threaten others why do you get
your fifis hurt so badly in intellectual disputes why even
have intellectual disputes if you are in possession of the
truth if you already know what you think you know
or maybe you suspect somewhere deep down in your subconscious
mind you suspect that actually you are living in a
conceptual fortress which is a house of cards which can
easily collapse and that is in fact why you have
to be so defensive about it because if you're not
defensive then the wind will just blow your fortress down
and then how are you going to survive how are
you going to maintain your sanity and how are you
going to maintain your comfort in life see notice that
these three are what you really want what most people
really want as opposed to truth and when there happens
to be a rift that opens up between survival sense
of sanity and comfort versus truth you're very you're going
to be very hard-pressed to stick with truth most people
are going to side with survival sanity and comfort so
what i'm trying to get you to understand is that
you're fooling yourself about how much you know you think
you know a lot but most stuff you know is
very partial very biased and downright wrong and from this
actually stem most of your problems in life the only
problem here is though is that this is such a
deep problem that when the actual problems in your life
manifest they don't manifest with a warning label that says
oh this problem like you know oh you got divorced
or oh your girlfriend cheated on you or it's like
oh you're having money problems or it's like oh you
can't maintain a job or it's like oh you're depressed
and suicidal see these issues when they come up in
your life like oh you're obese or um you can't
get your ass to the gym on a regular basis
like these sorts of problems they don't come with the
label of like your whole understanding of reality is wrong
they aren't disclosed that way so you think that the
problem is something usually you think the problem is something
external it's like oh it's somebody out there it's that
person you know she cheated on me it's her fault
that's why it's happening you know i'm depressed because those
politicians are you know destroying our country and you know
i'm i'm struggling with money because of the capitalist system
we're you know it's this kind of stuff usually you're
like you're blaming it on some sort of shallow external
force that is impinging upon you and your happiness uh
but really you got to like look deeper and you'll
see that it's actually because you're fooling yourself about the
stuff you think you know and it's very difficult to
get the mind to release its grip on the stuff
it thinks it knows but doesn't actually know or it
has a very partial twisted corrupted form of knowing of
as to see knowing something isn't just a binary like
you either know it or you don't know it there's
many degrees of knowing a thing and so one of
the tricks the mind uses like well i know i
know a little bit about the fork and then you
kind of just kind of like your mind says well
if i know a little bit about it it's as
though i know the whole thing it's like no you
don't know the whole thing maybe you know one percent
of it and even that one percent is very wrong
in many cases so what i want you to start
to notice is that the mind not just your mind
but anyone's mind puts up fake fronts of knowing beliefs
assumptions speculations theories hearsay deductions narratives ideology guesses intuitions but
all of these are highly fallible and also highly partial
also they are twisted to fit the needs of your
ego which is the thing that is looking at the
world right the ego is not looking at the world
objectively the ego has a very strong slant towards survival
and towards meeting its own needs and so it tends
to see the world in whichever way meets those needs
and so here sort of the fundamental question you have
to ask yourself as you're trying to figure out life
is do you care more about the truth or about
being right because see most people would rather be right
than go seeking the truth because to seek the truth
you have to admit that you're wrong why well because
nobody starts life with the truth why well because the
society that we're raised into we get programmed with social
conditioning immediately upon birth by parents siblings and then as
we go to kindergarten preschool high school all this kind
of stuff college right your first 20 years of your
life you're not even thinking about truth for the most
part you're just programmed you're programmed 24 7. and the
stuff you're being programmed with is of course the stuff
that works for the survival of the society again you
can't assume that that is going to be aligned with
truth so if you want to be a serious truth
seeker and you fancy yourself as such then you better
cultivate a habit of admitting the basic truth that you
don't know a thing when in fact you don't know
it this is just like very fundamental it's so fundamental
that you'd kind of like want to skip over this
step but that is the trick that is the trap
society creates an illusion of knowing religion science history school
professors books pundits experts leaders philosophers public intellectuals bosses businesses
politicians documentaries that you watch wikipedia that you search and
look through you know google searches all of this creates
what i've referred to in the past as the social
matrix go check out my episode the social matrix which
dovetails nicely with this one but all of this creates
an illusion like mankind knows more than we do the
depth of mankind's ignorance is never acknowledged by mankind this
is the fundamental epistemic folly of mankind and we have
no one to call us out on our [ __
] because there's no other like advanced species on this
planet that we can communicate with if there was or
if we encountered some aliens that we could talk to
in a sort of a wide manner i don't mean
some sort of secret aliens but i mean like you
know if there was real contact with an alien civilization
that was very advanced then they could kind of put
us in our place and show us our [ __
] although you know i suspect that what would actually
happen if that contact ever did occur is that mankind
would be very much in denial about our own [
__ ] and what we would do is we would
actually project it out onto the aliens such that we
would demonize the aliens because they would make us feel
so ignorant rather than accepting our own [ __ ]
and ignorance it's much easier for for us to just
to demonize the aliens and then go to war with
them of course realistically they'd probably be so advanced that
we couldn't really attack them but nevertheless you know we
could demonize them we could create conspiracy theories and ideologies
about them and all of that would just be a
defense mechanism from admitting our own [ __ ] our
own you know centuries and millennia of [ __ ]
religious [ __ ] scientific [ __ ] historical [
__ ] cultural political [ __ ] and so on
now you would think that science should champion not knowing
and that science in fact likes to admit that it
doesn't know it's like you know leo science is not
like religion it's like religion claims know everything but science
doesn't claim to know everything absolutely science is humble and
science admits that there's a lot of the universe that
we don't know in that sense science is a little
bit better than religion but still what many scientists and
scientist people don't understand is the degree to which science
only pays lip service to not knowing and even the
stuff never mind the stuff that science admits we don't
know okay you know that's good that's correct but but
the stuff that science says that we do know that
stuff itself i want to tell you we don't actually
know and science is grossly overestimating its understanding of even
the stuff that it thinks that we know and so
there's there's sort of a game that science plays where
it it plays this game of false humility and that
actually even though science says that it's humble science is
incredibly arrogant now that doesn't mean religion is correct religion
is also incredibly arrogant in many ways even worse than
science right there's there's degrees here it's not just a
binary of choosing between science and religion now if you
want to know more about the problems of the epistemology
of science go check out my three-part series called deconstructing
the myth of science where i go really in depth
on that don't have time to go into it here
again so i just want to point that out to
you though uh that society and culture pressures us to
make up [ __ ] when we actually don't know
and not knowing is treated as a weakness as if
knowing is trivial and easy and you should just blindly
accept the things that humanity already knows because it already
knows them it's treated as though not knowing isn't even
an option however not knowing is actually often the best
option is often an option that is rarely recognized and
utilized and the point of this episode is to help
you to see that and to make the counter-intuitive move
in your life to start to actually exercise this very
good option that most people refuse to exercise fundamentally people
are extremely conformist and are too lazy to question from
scratch so what people do is they just adopt whatever
ideas work for the purposes of their survival in the
time that they're living in the society and culture that
they're living in because most survival takes place collectively for
humans this is both a blessing and a curse because
we can kind of create our own conceptual castles and
allow ourselves to survive that way because you know if
you invent the fiction of money and i'm at the
fiction of money and we all invent the fiction of
money then it's as though money is real this is
a blessing and a curse because on the one hand
it's a blessing we can construct this abstraction called money
and use it to trade goods and services much more
easily than we otherwise would on the other hand it's
uh it opens pandora's box as far as self-deception and
various sorts of trickery and shenanigans goes because now we
can sort of manipulate this abstract concept of money we
can confuse it with something real and tangible in the
world the concept can get disconnected from real intangible things
then we can have all sorts of manipulations of stock
markets and currencies and um inflation and you know you
could you can make money as quickly as you can
lose money you can print more money magically with the
press of a keystroke some government entity can just create
money out of thin air how is that possible seems
like magic well it is that's the power of of
these kinds of abstractions but this this power goes in
both directions can be used for good and for evil
now the ancient skeptics the pyronians they try to tell
us that knowing was impossible but in the western intellectual
tradition we didn't take them seriously if you want to
know more about that go check out a book called
the outlines of piranism by sextus empiricus it's an old
book nearly 2 000 years old it outlines arguments made
by the ancient skeptics from greece but sexist empiricus was
a roman he was writing about uh the greeks and
also you know that that skeptical philosophy also carried over
into rome of course because there was a lot of
sort of cultural pollination cross-pollination between greece and rome um
but there are some brilliant arguments laid out there by
the pyronians as to why nothing can be known very
powerful arguments and yet what mankind did is just sort
of like skip over those arguments because you know the
arguments are like airtight but mankind couldn't help itself because
for mankind what we care about is not the truth
of some argument what we care about is what's practical
what works what's instrumental and so because knowledge was pragmatic
and instrumental we just carried forward building and building and
building upon our base of knowledge without seriously considering what
is the cost of this you can do that you
can use knowledge in a pragmatic and instrumental manner the
way that science does for example the way that business
does but with a deep cost what is that cost
most people who are knowing about anything they don't consider
this cost well the cost of knowing is closed-mindedness getting
stuck in one's simplistic narratives ideology self-deception i have a
three-part series on self-deception so this connects with that go
check that out another episode called assumption is the mother
of all fuck-ups go check that one out this connects
with that very well as well another cost is confusing
the map for the territory i'm going to have an
episode about the map versus the territory in the future
as well it'll connect with this episode here another cost
is a distorted perception of reality becoming lost in fantasy
that's fundamentally what's happened to mankind into individually and also
collectively were lost in fantasy even science even mathematicians and
logicians they're lost in fantasy science is a conceptual fantasy
no different than religion it just has the flavor of
something objective and tangible and material like science but it's
a conceptual fantasy as is logic and mathematics and we
forget that and the ultimate cost of pursuing this pragmatic
instrumental knowledge is a disconnection from being consciousness and spirit
and of course love truth because those are all identical
the ego mind hates uncertainty it would rather have a
false certainty than stand in a place of i don't
know this is the the fundamental sort of driver of
why mankind invents these conceptual fantasies whether they be religious
ones or scientific ones or whatever logical ones is that
the mind just doesn't like sitting in uncertainty the ego
mind creates narratives to ground itself in reality and to
help itself to survive if it didn't do this survival
would be much harder and the ego might itself would
have difficulty forming into a coherent identity a coherent self
so this is very fundamental it goes to the core
of who you think you are and what you think
others are and what you think reality is these are
not just philosophical metaphysical concerns that are just like you
know so abstract that they're just purely academic like no
no no no this goes to the very core of
how you came into existence how you were born this
goes all the way to the heart of your birth
and also your death this gets very existential so your
mind oversimplifies reality in order to be able to know
it and the reason has to do this is because
reality is infinite your mind is finite so there has
to be a simplification process now if you're asking me
well leo how do you know it's infinite maybe it's
not infinite well i can't explain that here you have
to take my word for it trust me that reality
is infinite so a simplification has to take place and
then these simplifications become their own realities you know like
science is a simplification of reality you know like newtonian
mechanics that's just over simplification of a more complex physical
material reality even general relativity is an oversimplification of how
physics actually works quantum mechanical models and so forth those
are also simplifications scientific models it's all simplifications the complexity
goes infinitely deep our knowledge makes reality feel more solid
and objective than it actually is this is especially the
case with science and here comes in one of my
favorite quotes which is the better the model the bigger
the problem i've talked about this before in the past
the better the model the bigger the problem this is
where science gets stuck knowledge has a constructive element to
it that is taken for granted by most scientifically-minded people
and logically-minded people you aren't just coming to know a
static objective world the way that you think when you're
in elementary school and honestly the way that most adults
think of it what's actually happening is that your mind
is playing a constructive co-creative process as it's coming to
know the world it's also co-creating the world at the
same time you're inventing as you come to know the
world and so the world is actually entangled with your
mind and your mind is entangled with the world we've
talked this about this in the past um especially i've
talked about it there's this concept called construct awareness that
i mentioned in my episode called the nine stages of
ego development part three especially i talk about one of
the higher stages of ego development is reaching the construct
aware stage there's multiple stages of construct awareness but as
you become more concert aware you become more aware of
how your mind is inventing reality as you're trying to
come to know it so like when you're looking at
a fork it's not just that there is a fork
floating out in space then you you come along and
look at it it's like oh fork of course it
was always a fork and now i see it and
it's still a fork and whether i see it or
don't it's always been a fork and always will be
a fork see this is just kind of like a
simplistic materialistic scientific way of trying to understand reality but
then as you become more sophisticated you realize that no
there wasn't just a fork floating around an empty space
and then i came along one day and found it
and just gave it a name it's not that simple
this fork is actually entangled with my mind in fact
this fork it is your mind this is your mind
i'm rotating your mind right now you see there's a
lot that can be said about construct awareness and maybe
i'll have some episodes about that in the future specifically
but we have to move on so um that concept
comes into play here i want you to notice that
so this makes knowing a lot more difficult because if
your mind is playing a role in constructing and inventing
reality as you're looking at stuff and analyzing stuff dissecting
stuff doing science on it how do you distinguish like
what's there before the mind or is there even such
a concept is that even a valid concept is there
something here before my mind gets to it it's an
open question so whatever enables your survival gets rationalized as
true knowledge and how reality is that's simply because it
works but the problem with that is that there's a
lot of stuff that could work which is not actually
true to how reality is which is why lying is
so common and for example you know if you want
a quick example of this look at newtonian mechanics we
know that newtonian mechanics is not technically how reality works
and yet it's still useful if you want to calculate
the trajectory of a projectile to shoot a neighboring city
you know shoot some artillery shells into your neighboring city
that you hate because you're at war it works for
that but that doesn't mean that's how reality actually is
but there's an even deeper issue here which is that
the mind has a primordial need to know itself there's
a deep curiosity that runs throughout mankind as a whole
throughout our intellectual traditions throughout our culture we want to
know ourselves we want to figure ourselves out this is
what mankind has been doing since the dawn of civilization
we've been figuring ourselves out we've been figuring out the
world we've been figuring out reality and of course reality
is us and we are reality and you as an
individual you have a curiosity to know too you know
little children have a innate curiosity you know they ask
kind of stupid questions like why is the sky blue
and then if you tell them well it's blue because
you know there's certain chemicals in the in the atmosphere
and the sun bounces off at a certain angle and
makes it blue and then they ask you well but
why why are those chemicals there and then why why
why a lot of the y's never stop it's that's
what i'm talking about by that primordial desire to know
itself mind has a primordial desire to know itself individually
and collectively but most people don't understand what this primordial
desire is we kind of think of it as something
kind of frivolous like oh well we're just kind of
curious a little kid is just kind of curious about
the colors of the sky it's like oh well is
there anything deep there going on it's like most people
say i know they're just kind of like you know
they're just being kids or even if you're like a
a fancy scientist in a university you might say well
no you like leo i have a deep primordial desire
to understand the universe okay well my question to you
is why why and you might say well it's because
of you know natural selection you know because i evolved
from a series of apes and other ancestors of ours
and then you know knowledge was was very helpful for
survival and those creatures and those tribes who understood reality
better and deeper they got a survival advantage and therefore
they out evolved and out competed and out survived all
the other tribes and so here we are today and
that's still going on and science is just a continuation
of that that's a cool story but that's not really
why you have this desire the reason you truly have
this desire is because god or reality wants to know
itself and you are god i'm not going to get
in too deep into that i've talked about that elsewhere
i'm just throwing that little nugget out there for those
of you who are in the know you are god
you are reality you're trying to know it's yourself um
but you don't understand this yet and so you're struggling
you know you're struggling to figure stuff out you're curious
you don't even know why you're curious you just know
you're curious you might wonder like well what's the big
deal like why would reality want to know itself you
know first the first problem here is that most people
in fact most scientists materialist rationalist atheists and so forth
they would deny that reality can even know itself they
would say no leo humans want to know themselves and
want to know reality reality itself doesn't doesn't care and
doesn't want to know it it can't know anything how
can reality know itself it's just a dumb material system
it can't know itself well you're wrong there um you
don't the problem is you don't really know what reality
is you don't know reality it's a deep extent that
you don't even know yet that reality can know itself
because you're not recognizing that you actually are reality reality
is not something other than you it's you so if
you want to know yourself if you have curiosity that
means reality has curiosity that's not a trivial point that's
a very deep very deep point but to get that
to get the depth of it you're gonna get some
awakenings and some god realizations in there um so reality
wants to know itself you might wonder why would reality
want to know itself what's so important about that well
reality is a infinite mind fyi that's news to you
reality is an infinite mind and what else is there
for an infinite mind to do but come to know
itself ever more deeply that's the only business that god
is in that consciousness is in the business of consciousness
is self understanding self knowing self realization awakening to itself
that's the motive force behind all of consciousness is that
it's trying trying trying its damnedess it's struggling with itself
to awaken and so your curiosity that primordial desire to
know stuff you know you hear a noise in your
basement and you're curious like what's that noise well guess
what that's a little a little bit like a little
a little tip of the iceberg like the reason you're
curious about that noise it's not just to save your
ass from some predator or some serial killer who could
be hiding in your basement it is that to some
degree you can use that knowledge to help you survive
but something more primordial and fundamental is going on at
the existential level and at the existential level the reason
you're curious about these things is because you're god and
you want to ultimately understand yourself and to awaken to
the fact that you're god even though you don't realize
that yet and that curiosity is how you're going to
do it that curiosity is sort of the tether it's
the thing that tethers you to god it's the thing
that keeps you from being lost from god forever because
you can use that thread of curiosity to awaken yourself
if you follow it long enough the problem is that
most people don't really appreciate what that curiosity can do
for them and they don't follow it long enough deep
enough to realize you know that thread will lead you
back to god if you're curious enough about reality long
enough deep enough seriously enough with enough commitment and passion
you will eventually reach god by following that breadcrumb trail
it's just that most people don't do it and also
it's so counter-intuitive and it's so tangled and it's so
convoluted that it's very easy to get lost and it's
very easy to to fall into all sorts of traps
and deceptions along the way and you'll get brainwashed by
other people and knocked off track so you'll very easily
lose track of the breadcrumb trail and so my job
is to help lay out that breadcrumb trail for you
make the breadcrumbs a little bit more visible than they
normally are motivate you to go on the journey of
following this breadcrumb trail and seeing where it leads you
and where it will lead you to is infinity so
reality's trying to know itself but reality doesn't recognize itself
as infinite and keeps trying to grasp itself with finite
concepts and it keeps failing and failing and failing and
his curiosity is never fully satisfied so what i mean
here the best example of this is with science right
so science is trying to understand the universe supposedly and
so every year science is doing more lab studies sending
out new probes to different planets to the edge of
space our solar system and we're exploring new planets and
asteroids and we're looking through telescopes you know billions of
light years into the future or into the past um
to see you know what to you know what was
going on in the early universe and so forth and
we're constructing models and we're writing textbooks and we're creating
these grand narratives of like we came from this big
bang and then that exploded and then matter you know
precipitated and then there were stars and there were explosions
and supernovas and black holes and then there were planets
and earth came along and then four billion years pass
and then there were apes and mammals and and monkeys
and humans and this like right so we construct these
narratives and stories and and all the while we think
as scientists that okay like we're getting close we're getting
close to figuring this whole thing out but what we're
not realizing is that we're nowhere near close to figuring
it out because all these are finite concepts and what
we're trying to figure out is infinity itself and it's
not clicking in our minds that you can't get to
infinity through finite any series of finite concepts no matter
how long you keep doing that and we keep hoping
that no mate leo maybe you know if we give
science on 100 years they'll figure it out it's like
no it won't work yeah but leo how can you
be so sure you can't know that see this is
where it gets tricky because you might say well leo
you're contradicting yourself because you're you're telling us that you
can't know anything you know not knowing not knowing you're
stressing not knowing and here you are trying to like
act like you know everything you you you say you
know god and you say you know infinity and you
say you know science can never figure it out and
all this blah blah how do you know these things
aren't you supposed to not know yeah it's a paradox
um i'll grant you that before i answer i'll answer
that later in this episode but before that we have
to we have to do some work um so here's
the key point reality is too profound to be knowable
i'll say that again reality is too profound to be
knowable if you think reality can be knowable you're deeply
underestimating what reality is this is the fundamental error of
science it's the fundamental error of logical people who think
they can logic their way out of this problem you
can't logic your way out of this you can however
awaken to the profundity of what reality is and that
is a step beyond knowing that's something deeper that's something
more primordial we'll talk about that as we keep going
uh so the bottom line is that the counter-intuitive move
here remember i talked about counter-intuitive moves go see my
episode called uh the counter-intuitive nature of life we're bringing
a lot of stuff together here huh uh i'm kind
of delivering on my promise to interconnect everything so we're
connecting a lot of dots here in this episode uh
in that episode i talked about various counter-intuitive aspects of
life and moves you could make and you know how
to make your way into a good profound life through
counterintuitive moves well here's one counterintuitive move that will transform
your whole life is stand in i don't know stand
in it bask in it see where it leads you
it'll lead you to places you could not have even
anticipated i promise you that much but it's difficult to
stand in i don't know because it's counterintuitive because the
ego wants to know it takes a lot of humility
honesty wisdom and seriousness to admit i don't know not
knowing is scary and threatening and notice this the more
you know the more you have to lose by admitting
i don't know so this is an especially big trap
for religious people but even more so perhaps for scientific
people for mathematicians for logicians for computer nerds because these
types of people public intellectuals authors academics these type of
people have built their whole lives and careers on priding
themselves on knowing more than everybody else i know because
i've done that i'm somewhat of a public intellectual you
know i've been interested in philosophy my whole life i've
been very academic i've prided myself a lot on knowing
more than others uh so i'm intimately familiar with with
with the arrogance the sort of intellectual arrogance and pride
that comes with that and maybe you're familiar with some
of my my own intellectual arrogance and pride that came
from that uh but i'm very well aware of that
you have to understand um a lot of intellectuals are
not and hey i'm not saying i'm perfect i also
fall into those traps as an intellectual so the trick
here is you have to muster the courage to not
know and the way to muster that courage is to
just recognize within your own self that's like it's better
for me to admit that i've been wrong once than
to forever spend my my the rest of my life
uh pretending that i'm right and playing that game you
know like for me personally it's much easier just to
admit that i was wrong because i only got to
do that one time it's just like a one day's
worth of pain but living repressing and suppressing the truth
that i was wrong for my whole life and acting
as though my past beliefs and past worldview are right
even though i suspect that they're not that's that's a
recipe for pain for the rest of my life so
for me it's pretty easy to to to admit being
wrong um when you kind of frame it that way
because this really the scales tip very much in favor
of admitting you're wrong but you have to kind of
like think think long term right most people aren't thinking
long term so for them they just want to kind
of save themselves from the sort of short-term embarrassment of
admitting they've been wrong like here's an example that was
kind of abstract let me make it specific like let's
say you're a mormon it's a lot easier to just
admit that mormonism is a basically a cult and that
is deeply wrong it's a lot easier to admit that
bite that bullet you know suffer through a few months
of withdrawal and whatever else than it is to go
on living your whole life within this mormon cult doing
years and decades of mental gymnastics trying to you know
square in your own mind why mormonism is right because
you know that's a full-time job because mormonism is so
wrong you're gonna spend the rest of your life justifying
it to yourself just to maintain that belief system and
hey i'm not picking just on mormonism here this will
apply to islam this will apply to christianity and many
other things but hey you know a lot of people
would rather just dig their head in the sand and
just pretend as though you know their belief system their
worldview is right and ignore all the counter evidence and
not think very deeply about it the nice thing about
not knowing is that it sobers you out of fantasy
and that's what mormonism is it's a fantasy that's what
christianity is that's what islam is they're fantasies buddhism is
a fantasy science material science is a fantasy physics is
a fantasy these are fantasies not knowing is a powerful
antidote to self-deception remember my series three-part series on self-deception
if you don't go re-watch it very powerful series and
i give you a list of various self-deception mechanisms i
don't even remember having watched that in a few years
i remember did i give you anecdotes in that series
how to deal with self-deception well if i did if
i did not then here's your antidote not knowing very
powerful and that's not the only antidote to self-deception that's
a very powerful one remember also i have an old
episode called how paradigms work where i talk about this
concept called paradigm lock where you get locked into a
paradigm well what's the antidote to paradigm lock guess what
not knowing that's one powerful antidote not the only one
not knowing breaks you out of closed-mindedness go check out
my episode how open mindedness works and also another one
called radical open-mindedness i stress open-mindedness a lot in my
work what do you do if you're close-minded well practice
not knowing and then your mind will open but a
close-minded person precisely does not want to practice not knowing
so how do you get a closed-minded person to agree
to practice not knowing well you can't force them only
if they want to and most of them won't so
i'd like you to start to become sensitive and brutally
honest with yourself about when you really don't know a
thing this requires introspection go see my episode called developing
introspection you can develop an introspection with kind of a
two-minute you kind of focus in words as i talked
about in the episode you focus inwards and you kind
of feel around in there when some topic comes up
like let's say how old is planet earth you could
just immediately parrot out some number that you heard some
scientists tell you in some textbook like it's 4.3 billion
years old you could say that or you could go
wait a minute wait a minute do i really know
how old the earth is you can introspect on that
point you can realize okay i got i got some
ideas from some book that i read that's one thing
but truly i don't know you can feel into the
i don't the truth of i don't know is deeper
than the truth of what you read in some book
that you know you instinctively want to pare it out
as the good little scientist that you fancy yourself to
be so that that's a practice you practice that for
the rest of your life that's what i'm suggesting with
this episode if you're wondering like leo this is so
abstract what do i do with this you practice that
you actually do that you introspect you stop yourself from
just parroting stuff you've heard from other apes and you
actually go into the i don't know now with i
don't know it's very tricky because not knowing you can
you can hold it as a theory or you can
actually be in a state of not knowing these are
two different things what you've gotten so far from me
in this episode is just theory it's the theory of
not knowing and you can sit there and you say
yeah well yeah i don't know this i don't know
that yeah leo i kind of i can kind of
accept the idea that maybe i don't know as much
as i thought i knew or that maybe some of
the things i know are kind of wrong or self-biased
or whatever um yeah i can agree with that leo
okay what do i do with that that's theory that's
the theory of not knowing that theory is not the
same thing as actually being in a state of not
knowing so you have to distinguish those two and so
now the real goal of this episode is getting yourself
into a state of actual not knowing not just the
theory that i'm talking about here so towards that end
let's do this exercise i want to take you through
an exercise that will put you into a genuine state
of not knowing if you're open to that so let's
try that so i'm gonna have you close your eyes
only do this if you're in a safe place sitting
down you're not driving or in a place where you
can hurt yourself so you're gonna close your eyes sit
back relax this will just be a short exercise here
short little kind of visual guided visualization so there you
are comfortable sitting relaxed now we're going to try to
create a state of not knowing i want you to
erase from your mind the notion of a past or
history anything in the past including all the wars you
learned about in school all the events of human civilization
mankind world war one world war ii ancient rome ancient
people that lived in the past julius caesar and hitler
and all this kind of stuff just erase all that
from your mind instead of all that backstory we're going
to call that backstory erase all that backstory and just
leave a blank space of mystery and not knowing likewise
let's do the same with the future notice that you
have ideas about the future what's going to happen next
year next week where you're going to be in 50
years what the world is going to be like mankind
evolving in the future new technology flying cars and electric
technology and we're going to be you know mankind is
going to be on the planet mars and across the
solar system you know in hundreds of years you probably
anticipate something like that all of that future story just
like the backstory the future story kind of try to
grab it all at once in your mind and just
dissolve that dissolve that out of your mind until it
dissolves into just an empty space of not knowing and
mystery where in that not knowing anything is possible the
future is not pinned down in any way and also
notice the difference of how this feels in your body
when you just a minute ago you sort of had
a back story and a future story that were kind
of tangible and now you dissolve those away and now
you're in in a state of not knowing relative to
those notice how different that feels when you truly don't
know the past and you truly don't know the future
that just leaves you with right now with your experiences
right now now right now you're sitting there with your
eyes closed it's kind of dark probably you can feel
your body you can see this blackness but notice you
have a knowingness of the room or the space that
you're sitting in you're probably sitting in your house or
apartment somewhere but if your eyes are closed you don't
actually see the room you don't see your house you
don't see the roof of your house you don't see
your car you don't see maybe some other family member
in the room adjacent to you don't see any of
that you don't experience any of that let's say so
erase all those from your mind so that you're very
in the present moment i want you to also even
erase knowledge of your own body because with your eyes
closed you have a self-image you have a sort of
an image of the back of your head and your
your whole torso and body the way that you would
look in a photograph you probably have remnant images of
memories from the past even though you're supposed to erase
the past you probably have personal memories from the past
that define who you are in the present childhood memories
stuff that happened to you yesterday what you had for
lunch this morning this sort of stuff erase all of
that and replace it with just a state of not
knowing also check if you have any ideas or sort
of a a backdrop of scientific or religious metaphysical worldview
by which i mean you know you think that you're
sitting there made out of atoms that would be the
scientific backdrop or you're made of cells your body's made
out of bones and tissues and you have a brain
that kind of stuff that you were born that you're
an animal that you evolved through evolution over billions of
years you know that's the scientific backstory or maybe you
have a religious backstory of like you were created by
god and this god you know maybe it's the christian
god and you have an idea of jesus and mary
and joseph and this kind of stuff you know all
the bible stories like erase all of that maybe you're
a buddhist and you have an idea of like all
the buddhas of the past who became enlightened and who
worked hard for mankind to teach you about buddhism erase
that and so eventually you get to a if you
do all this and you erase basically everything all you're
left with is just the raw experience of the present
moment and now i want you to deeply feel into
the truth and now this is truth here this is
not just some idea this is recognize that this is
truth you don't actually know what any of the raw
experience that you're having right now is you're hearing some
sounds you're feeling perhaps your ass on the chair if
you're sitting down maybe you're feeling some pressure on your
feet if you're standing up maybe you're feeling some cold
or some warmth just from the ambient temperature of the
room maybe you're hearing some buzzing noises from the air
conditioning or whatever get in touch with the fact that
you don't know what any of this is and enter
a profound state of complete not knowing imagine that you're
like a little baby just born that you were just
born this minute and you don't know what anything is
you don't have any concept or words for anything you
don't know yourself and you don't know any of the
objects or the environment or the sensations and even if
you're having some kind of emotion whether it's happiness sadness
anger confusion you don't know what any of those are
either so complete state of not knowing try to enter
that try to create that and if you're saying yourself
well leo i don't know how to create that just
try it just do it just have the intention to
create it will it into being try that and now
contrast this current state of not knowing if you were
able to do this contrast it with your usual state
of knowing and also contrast it with the theory of
not knowing remember i was talking about the theory of
not knowing versus actual not knowing as a state so
right now you're in an actual state of not knowing
contrast that with just the theory we're talking about earlier
and your usual mode of being where you think you
know where you are and what you're doing let's say
you're sitting in your house right now doing this exercise
and you've entered what you would think is a state
of not knowing actual genuine state of not knowing here's
the litmus test if you still think you're in your
house you're not an actually genuine state of not knowing
because how would you know you're in your house how
would you know what a house is right so take
this as deep as you can go to the point
where open your eyes now open your eyes and remain
try to maintain your sense of not knowing and look
around the room look around your house let's say look
around your apartment but still in not knowing and the
not knowing is so deep that you don't even know
that you're in a house because how do you know
this is a house you can't see the roof you
can't see what's on the outer walls also you have
to remove the idea that you're on planet earth how
would you know you're on planet earth you can't know
that from being inside of some room when you can
get to that state that would be as close to
what i mean by a state of genuine not knowing
and in fact you can go even deeper than this
but let's just cut it off here because we've got
to move on to other points so you got that
that's very practical right that's not a theory what just
happened that was a shift in your state that wasn't
a theory and so make that distinction between a shift
in your state versus talking about not knowing because you
can talk about not knowing until you're blue in the
face but you're not necessarily going to get a shift
in your state into not knowing right again like look
let's say you're a christian if you're a christian there's
actually a profound difference between just as a christian you
know we might have a logical debate about christianity versus
science and i might even be able to convince you
that you know you know how do you know christianity
is really true maybe the bible was just written by
some you know some fraud how do you know jesus
really existed and you might you might hear all those
things you might even agree with me and eventually and
say yeah you know leo i don't even know if
christianity is really true maybe it's not true that's the
level of theory right there's difference between that just admitting
that there might be problems with christianity versus actually entering
a state where you have no idea whether christianity is
true now for you scientists it's going to be even
harder though because see that same logic applies to youth
scientists and materialists and atheists because you've convinced yourself that
you're not doing the same thing that christian is doing
you don't have anything to let go of as a
scientist because your worldview is just as reality is right
atheism is just as reality is i'm leo i'm not
adding anything as an atheist as a scientist as a
physicist i'm not adding anything like the christian is so
i have nothing to let go no you're very wrong
about that you have all of science to let go
so for you scientific types there's a very big difference
between sitting there and just for example listening to my
three-part series where i talk about the myth of you
know deconstructing the myth of science many of you guys
have have listened to that and have even left me
positive comments like oh my god this is very profound
yes yes yes it's all profound and very good and
you understand it all and you could recite it back
to me that's all great but that's not the same
thing as being in a state right now of complete
not knowing to the point where you don't even know
that you're sitting on planet earth do you see the
difference or rather i should say do you feel the
difference because this is something you should be feeling more
than seeing like as i'm sitting here right now i
can i can wipe away from my mind the idea
that earth exists so like normally it just kind of
exists in the background of my worldview but i can
wipe that away such that when i'm sitting here i'm
conscious that there is no earth that's true uh try
to do that notice you're gonna have like resistance the
ego mind's gonna come up and say oh no but
leo what are you talking about the earth's not there
like that's just some sort of fantasy of course the
earth is there where else would it you know where
else would i be sitting where else my house be
located if not on earth that's how deep your story
and fantasy goes so you have to work work on
that like this is something that could take you years
of work if you understand i've done years of work
on myself to get to the point where i can
remove earth from my worldview most people can't do that
that doesn't just happen by by luck you have to
work on that so keep practicing this and working on
it but we have to move on to other things
so anyways really get comfortable with not knowing putting yourself
in this state tell yourself that it's okay not to
know periodically what i should do is wipe the slate
clean there's this notion that i'm inventing called wiping the
slate clean which i mean i didn't invent that phrase
but what i mean by that phrase is when you
wipe the slight clean it's like you take your whole
world to you and you just you just wipe it
all away it's not you're not just like tinkering at
the edges of your world just like oh well yeah
i can adjust this little piece of my world view
and this little piece like this is what scientists do
it's like yeah they got a massive worldview and then
what they do is they tinker around the edges you
know adjusting little things here and there but fundamentally nothing
has changed they still believe they're sitting on planet earth
they still believe that a big bang happened they still
believe that there's space and time they still believe that
humans evolved like that their body's mad of atoms all
that [ __ ] is still there and they're just
tinkering around the edges i mean wipe the whole thing
away and don't replace it with anything see you're gonna
be like well leo if i if i wipe that
away i gotta replace it with something no leave it
blank that's what's counterintuitive here leave it blank for as
long as you can the problem with knowing too much
is that it prevents insights understanding and awakening from happening
so this wiping the slate this not knowing state will
create space you're emptying your cup creating space for new
insights and understandings to come and for a potential awakening
to spark that's why we're doing this there's this practical
point all right now i've got one more exercise for
you this one's going to be a little easier it's
not going to be a visualization exercise i like you
to get a piece of paper and i'd like you
to admit of 10 things that you claim to know
but that you actually do not know so at the
top of the paper write down what are 10 things
that i claim to know that i've claimed my whole
life to know but that i actually don't know and
never knew so for example is the earth 4 billion
years old most people would claim yes if they're scientifically
minded and now i want you to admit that you
don't actually know that that's the truth see there's an
additional point here a little kind of nuance a wrinkle
when we're creating this not knowing it's not just that
we're trying to like create a fantasy of not knowing
we're actually trying to get to the truth of what
you know in these situations and the truth is that
you actually don't know like if you really like ask
yourself what is the truth of what i know about
the age of the earth the answer the truest answer
you can muster is i don't know another example many
of you guys may be like me take fish oil
supplements right maybe you've been taking fish oil supplements for
years now i want you to admit you don't actually
know if fish oil is any good for you is
it actually improving your health or is it actually harming
you now you have a story in your mind if
you take fish oil supplements that of course they're helping
me but do you really know that is that really
in your direct experience here's where you have to be
very honest with yourself so again introspect and really dig
deep and be extra honest and just admit to yourself
finally that i have no [ __ ] idea if
this fish oil is doing anything good for me in
fact maybe it's causing cancer i just i don't know
i have no idea and as you do that also
notice that that's not a fantasy that's the truth that's
the raw truth another example did jesus really exist again
go inside really introspect be very honest with yourself and
look for the truth of the matter and what you'll
discover is that you you don't know here's another example
a little bit more radical a little bit more scary
do other people have consciousness can you handle that go
inside ask yourself do other people have consciousness what is
what is the rawest truth i have about this what
do i ultimately know about this the consciousness of others
and what you should notice is that the deepest truth
you have about that is that you don't know another
example is god real go inside really get honest with
yourself what do you know about god now for some
of you who've been doing this work this won't apply
but for most of you who've never had a direct
conscience of god and are not conscious of it right
now for you the answer is you don't know and
if you're an atheist guess what the truth is you
don't know and if you're a christian the truth is
you don't know notice that now these are just examples
that i threw out there but i want you to
come up with a list of 10 of your own
examples where you do this as you do this you
have to get very honest with yourself more honest than
you usually are you're gonna have to notice when you're
bullshitting yourself and you know you're going to notice in
certain cases you know you ask a question of yourself
like about the fish oil it's like it's kind of
like ah but i don't want to admit you know
i don't want to admit that i've been taking spending
all this money on fish oil for the last 10
years and that actually the truth is i have no
idea what it might be even harming me like that
that's difficult to admit and that's just fish oil never
mind you know maybe you ask yourself a question like
do i love my own family and you might like
usually you say yeah of course but you but if
you really go deep down inside like get to the
truth of do i really love my own family you
might discover that you don't or you might discover that
you don't really you're not sure if you love them
that's that's see that's scary that's hard to admit it's
hard to admit to yourself let alone to admit it
to others this is a good exercise in practicing honesty
go check out my video series called um the avoidance
of truth which goes into that right so the the
problem here with with really not knowing is that really
it's sort of a defense mechanism against avoidance of truth
and you're going to have to admit as you're doing
this exercise you're going to write down these 10 things
and then i want you to look over these same
things and i want you to admit that you were
posturing to yourself you were posturing that you knew these
things you're you're you were putting up a facade of
knowing when in fact you didn't know and i want
you to kind of like call yourself out on that
it's like i've been posturing that jesus is real but
all along i didn't know and now i finally caught
myself posture i've been posturing for 20 years and finally
i've admitted that i've been posturing that's a huge breakthrough
right there likewise you know i've been posturing that fish
oil is good for you but i never knew and
i've spent thousands of dollars on it and i've just
been posturing all this time that's a huge admission so
do that and then very importantly is i want you
to forgive yourself for this posturing because you're going to
want to feel bad you're going to guilt yourself and
judge yourself for being stupid or foolish or ignorant or
whatever for getting you know for tricking yourself or deceiving
yourself but now you have to forgive yourself for posturing
and for self-deception because hey the mind is very tricky
and in the end your mind was just trying to
help you to survive you were being a bit selfish
and unconscious and now you're becoming more aware and you
can forgive yourself you can understand how you were you
know you're ignorant you're in denial and you can forgive
yourself for being in denial and for posturing so do
that exercise pause this if you need to and do
that and the conclusion from this exercise is you need
to get good at recognizing when something you think you
know you don't actually know and start holding yourself to
this higher standard ask yourself do i really know or
am i just pretending like i know and a lot
of times you'll be shocked to realize that i'm just
pretending belief and hearsay is not real knowing direct experience
is king you have to ground yourself in direct experience
your mind has been filled with a lot of belief
and hearsay and now it's time to admit that belief
in hearsay while it might be correct a lot of
times it isn't correct a lot of times it's wrong
but it's ultimately you don't know whether the belief or
the hearsay is true like you have a belief that
the earth is 4 billion years old but you haven't
verified that yourself it could be wrong science could discover
something new tomorrow that would you know say that the
earth is actually 5 billion years old or 2 billion
years old you don't know that's the truth because you
don't have any direct experience of the earth's age in
fact you don't even have a direct experience of the
earth if you're really honest at least not as this
blue ball spinning in space the way that you conceive
of it you're you have some direct experience of of
the earth but it's very different than you know this
round conception of this ball that you've seen on pictures
so let's move on to the next point which is
rather deep and important and which is that all knowledge
is fundamentally second order what do i mean by second
order all knowledge is about something it's about being being
is first order knowing about being a second order right
so the raw sensations of this fork are the being
that's first order and then your knowledge of the fork
including the fact that it is a fork and whatever
fork is used for and what you think a fork
is made out of where it came from where it's
going and etc and the fact that it's called a
fork and all the associated concepts that come with fork
all of that is second order i want you to
notice that you couldn't have all those associations and ideas
about what to do with it how it works what
it's for what it's made out of you couldn't have
any of that if you didn't have the thing there
to begin with i mean that's pretty obvious right this
is not rocket science it's pretty obvious now here's the
trick is that your knowledge of the fork makes you
feel like you know the being of the fork which
you don't you know what the fork can be used
for you know how much it costs you know what
will happen if you melt it down uh you know
where it came from and so on but none of
that tells you what it is you see that so
you have to make a distinction between your knowledge of
what you can do with things how you can use
them versus what a thing is and so a lot
of times that's confused and since us as humans like
usually it doesn't really matter to us what the fork
is what matters to us is what we can use
it for so as long as we know what we
can use it for as long as you can manipulate
it you know with some skill and use it to
get the things you want your ego wants then it's
like well then i know the fork because hey i
can use it i can use this to survive and
that's all i care about and then the question of
what is the being of this fork who even gives
a [ __ ] that's not even a valid question
anymore see it gets so bad that then some scientists
will tell you that leo that's not even a valid
question that's just some sort of metaphysical question like you
know how many angels can dance on the head of
a pin kind of question but it's not that kind
of question because the being of the fork is the
thing that allows for everything else that you know about
it you forgot that the being is first order see
what you do is you get so focused on the
second order and then what you can use it for
that you just forget that there even was a first
order the first order is irrelevant and then the second
order by default becomes the first order because when you
don't have the first order you only have the second
order that is like the you know there's only one
order at that point and you re label that as
the first order and then you pretend like everything's fine
you go on with your life because it seems to
work so what i want you to recognize is that
conceptual knowledge is a way of avoiding direct confrontation with
the mystery of the first order the being another word
for being is consciousness so here's one solution for you
scientists to the problem of consciousness like you scientists are
trying to figure out what consciousness is uh well you're
trying to figure out what consciousness is at the second
order but consciousness is first order so you're never going
to figure out what consciousness is at the second order
because it's at the first order this is consciousness so
if you care about consciousness then you should care about
the first order and notice if you stop caring about
the first order you've stopped caring about reality because reality
is nothing but first order this is the problem with
pragmatism that i've talked about in my three-part series called
deconstruction deconstructing the myth of science i believe i talked
about it mostly in part two but maybe part three
as well i forget notice something interesting notice that your
being in your existence is prior to your knowledge of
it you exist you are before you know about it
because before you can know something about yourself you have
to first exist this is not rocket science again but
often overlooked you exist but you don't know what existence
is or what exactly you are or how you came
to exist you are alive prior to your knowing what
life is the problem with symbolic second order conceptual knowledge
is that it's so partial perspectival relativistic and finite and
prone to recontextualization that it's very shaky ground it's not
secure and it gets changed a lot what do i
mean by prone to recontextualization see my episode called understanding
recontextualization where we talk about that so this fork if
you really do this work deeply eventually this fork will
get recontextual i see right now you think this fork
is a material metal object man of atoms eventually when
you awaken you'll you'll this fork will get recontextualized as
your own mind or as as god as consciousness as
it'll also get recontextualized as infinity right now you see
this fork as a finite object it'll it'll turn into
an infinite object if you become sufficiently woke fundamentally knowing
infinity is not possible why because knowing is second order
you are infinity but infinity cannot fully know itself because
knowing is a subset of that infinity which means knowing
is is infinity the is-ness is so direct it's prior
to being able to self-reflect or to grab around and
grasp itself for the same reason that a hand cannot
grasp itself reality or infinity cannot grasp itself because it
is itself all knowing is explicit finite and a subset
of infinity uh to get a deeper understanding and appreciation
of this point go see my episode called explicit versus
implicit understanding where we go into a lot of depth
about that distinction being is inherently irreducibly mystical mysterious that's
ultimately what mystical means see people have the wrong kind
of connotation about mystical mystical can kind of mean like
oh it's kind of like airy fairy or fantastical that's
not really what mystical means truly what mystical means is
that it's so it's something that's so fundamental that it's
too profound to be known like i said earlier it's
too profound to be known so not knowing is mystery
and that's where mysticism comes from because it's mysterious and
what does mysterious mean what does mystery mean mystery just
means that it's infinite it's first order therefore you can't
grasp it with a second order that's mystery this is
why mysticism is correct because you can't grasp infinity with
a second order or another way to put it is
that you can but it's also good but the grasping
of it will always be partial and finite and biased
and therefore you will forever miss the infinitude its full
infinitude this is why scientists cannot find god you can't
find god because god is the totality of everything and
the totality of everything cannot be grasped by a subset
of that totality see a subset is not the superset
that's what it boils down to the belief or assumption
that reality can be explicitly explained that needs to be
dropped that's the fundament fundamental error of science there is
a fundamental entanglement between knowing and world mind and world
and self and world i've also talked about this in
my three-part series deconstructing the myth of science at root
knowledge itself is being even though i tend to speak
of a first order and a second order like there's
the fork the being of the fork and then there's
all our knowledge of it and it seems like our
knowledge of it is not first order but that knowledge
itself as it's happening in my skull or in my
field of awareness that knowledge itself is is at the
same level you know it's also an experience it's also
got being my knowledge of the fork has its own
being you see that so ultimately knowledge is being but
it's one being pointing to another being so the being
of the fork the being of the sensations thoughts in
my mind are grasping and pointing at the fork that
would be the knowledge of the fork but then if
i want to know my own thoughts about the fork
you see this presents another problem because how do i
how do i grasp that i'd need to invent new
knowledge about the knowledge i had about the fork this
creates an extra layer see so we're creating layers and
layers and layers like reality is unconscious kind of stepping
back from itself back from itself back from itself to
observe itself this is um this is the the problem
we talked about in that episode called um what it
means to go meta this is the going meta problem
infinity is infinitely meta so in order to be able
to see or observe something you have to step back
from it and this stepping back from process is an
infinite regress into infinity that's what infinity is it's an
infinite stepping back process so ultimately the distinction itself between
metaphysics and epistemology will collapse as you enter into not
knowing what you'll realize is that at the deepest level
all knowing is being and the only way you can
know anything is through contact with being and the deepest
form of knowing is a knowing so profound we don't
even call it knowing anymore we call it being now
see in the end you know a thing by being
it by experiencing it so for example how do you
know that you exist by existing by being sure you
can sit there and think about your existence but that's
second order you see before you can think about your
existence you have to first exist and if you want
to understand what you are at the deepest level you
can't get there through knowing you got to get there
through being that's what meditation does for you that's what
self-inquiry does for you that's what psychedelics do for you
so a state of genuine not knowing that we were
practicing earlier in that exercise the first exercise this brings
you closer to truth consciousness and god because god infinity
self consciousness these are endlessly mysterious because they're they're endless
they're infinite and so you can't grasp them through knowing
now awakening itself when you have one comes with a
profound not knowing because your knowing is replaced with being
it's as though all the sense data in your sensory
field becomes your way of knowing so you're not just
knowing using your intellect or your mind you're not just
knowing using language or words or english or concepts like
for example when you when you wake up when you
have an awakening you're not just going to know this
fork by thinking about it the way you normally do
it's like oh fork oh here it is okay cool
it's an object that's not how you're gonna you're gonna
know the fork much more intimately you're gonna know the
fork by becoming the fork as as woo and zen
is that sound it's like it's like i'm that guy
it's like i'm uh what's his name chevy chase from
caddyshack you know be the ball be the be the
fork but that that is literally what's gonna happen when
you awaken you'll become the fork and then you'll truly
know what a fork is when you become it and
then you'll really appreciate the difference between knowing the fork
by being a fork versus knowing the fork by just
thinking about a fork see ordinarily when we know things
like within academia for example it's like if if an
academic or a scientist told you to write a description
of what a fork is um unwittingly what is being
asked there of you is that you you know let's
say some scientist says okay write me a five page
analysis of of what a fork is and you sit
down and you write it but what you're doing there
is like you're looking at the fork and you're you're
thinking about it and you're dissecting it with your mind
conceptually it's like it's got four prongs on it it's
maybe you know seven centimeters tall and one centimeter wide
and it weighs so many ounces and blah blah blah
right you can go on forever describing this fork you
can do all that um but there's infinitely more detail
that you're actually missing that's not going to be in
your paper about the fork and your five-page paper report
about the fork has no resemblance to the actual fork
right the words on the page the sounds in your
mind that those are not forks and even all your
descriptions the mental imagery those are still not forks imagine
imagine an intelligence so great that when this intelligence thought
about a fork the way it did so was not
like a human intelligence which you know comes up with
words and mental images but literally there was a fork
in your [ __ ] head imagine thinking in forks
imagine like a alien super intelligence or a ai super
intelligence where it became so intelligent so conscious that it
thought in forks that means that it doesn't need to
talk about like oh it's a fork it doesn't need
th it doesn't need that four letter word it doesn't
need a description of the fork because you see how
all those are inferior if you could lit if i
could take this fork and stick it in your [
__ ] skull so that you could fully experience the
fork i would no longer need to call it a
fork anymore i would no longer need to give any
descriptions of it i would no longer need to describe
its weight and length and all this sort of scientific
stuff to you you just have a fork in your
head and there it is bam you got a fork
in your head like you understand what a fork is
now see and now imagine doing that for everything around
you not just a fork it would be a direct
one-to-one right there would no you see how if we're
using language there's like stuff is getting lost in translation
because there's an interpretive process there's a second order we're
talking about something and that's like inferior right like i
could explain to a blind person what a sunset is
and maybe he could get a little idea of it
it's better than nothing at all but if i really
want to show if i really want to get a
blind person understand a sunset i would have to give
him vision and then his eyes would open he would
no longer be blind let's say we do some sort
of like narrow operation on his mind on his brain
i mean and then he opens his eyes for the
first time he sees the sun whoa that's a sunset
that's totally different than what you were telling me it's
like well but what i was telling you you know
a lot i can only tell you so much a
lot was getting lost in translation so the only way
to know what a sunset is is to experience a
sunset and the only way to know what a fork
is to experience a fork see and imagine that you
were so conscious and intelligent that you were doing that
with everything and if you were doing that with everything
you would be living at the first order you wouldn't
need a second order you wouldn't need language you would
need to give labels to things you could but you
wouldn't need it and so i want you to imagine
like a a really sophisticated ai or let's say humans
meet some aliens who have like heads that are 20
times bigger than ours let's say we meet such an
alien race um 500 years into the future we meet
such an alien race you might wonder like how much
smarter would those aliens be and how would they communicate
how would their minds work well here's an idea imagine
that if two aliens with heads that are 20 times
bigger than humans were talking to each other about forks
they wouldn't be making noises about forks literally one alien
would create a fork a physical fork in his head
and the other alien would also create a physical fork
in his head they would be identical forks and that's
how they would communicate what a fork is i would
literally be able to just pass the fork from my
head into your head directly and in this way i
would communicate to you what a fork is perfectly without
any anything lost in translation because there is no translation
that's pretty awesome right now you say leo that that's
crazy that's like science fiction you can't do that oh
really what do you think this is this is your
mind this fork is your mind you're doing it right
now you're just disconnected from it if you were awake
you would already understand that this fork is your own
mind anyways moving on i've talked about this notion of
omniscience in the past omniscience people get confused about what
omniscience is see people think when i say omniscience people
say oh leo well you're just full of [ __
] because if you were truly omniscient why can't you
tell me the lottery numbers for tomorrow or something like
that but that's not what omniscience is omniscience is happening
not at the fir at the second order conceptual level
of thinking omniscience happens at the level of being at
the first order so like um usually when people think
of omniscience it's like oh if i'm going to be
omniscient that means i'm going to know everything conceptually that
i could possibly want to know like leo i want
to know um you know how many kangaroos there are
in australia and omniscient should tell me that no that's
not what omniscience is um true omniscience is you realizing
that the kangaroos in australia how many there are whatever
that that's an image in your own mind that's what
true omniscience tells you it doesn't give you an answer
to how many kangaroos there are it tells you that
the kangaroos in your mind including australia are imaginary that's
real omniscience right this fork right here this is omniscience
the being of this fork is omniscience that doesn't mean
that you'll be able to know how many atoms there
are in this fork because omniscience will tell you that
the number of atoms in this fork is something you're
imagining so if you want to access omniscience you can't
do it at the second order level you got to
do it at the first order level so maybe that's
important for you you might be wondering like leo why
is this fortune order important why should i care about
it well do you want omniscience it's like yeah leo
i want to know how many kangaroos are on australia
no that you're not going to get that that's not
omniscience well then leah why would i want it well
maybe some things you can't know if you want until
you try them like how do you know you want
some pizza unless you try some pizza first see that
catch 22 there i can't prove to you that you
will want pizza you just got to try some pizza
and kind of just like trust me that the pizza
is good but if you're so skeptical that you're like
no leo i'm not gonna i'm not gonna try pizza
until you prove to me that i should that the
pizza is gonna be enjoyable to me well i can't
do that if you're that skeptical then you're you're stuck
your mind is closed ultimately when you awaken you will
know nothing other than that you are god infinity and
consciousness it's crucial that you reach a point in your
development and your consciousness of total not knowing right so
it's not that awakening will give you a bunch of
conceptual knowing it'll do the opposite it'll remove all conceptual
knowing it'll leave you completely in mystery endless infinite mystery
you will know nothing but you will literally be omniscient
you'll know everything that is worth knowing like you'll become
this fork and that's all that's all you'll care about
at that point you're not going to care about all
the second order [ __ ] about a fork that's
so inferior to actually be a being a fork that's
what you've got to realize so if you have not
reached a state of complete not knowing that's something you're
missing in your development that's that's going to be a
significant uh life-changing inflection point in your journey and that's
a rather late stage development it might take you decades
to reach that point but it's very worthwhile reaching that
point and when you reach that point you're still not
done there's there's a lot more you could do from
that point but it's a good point to to reach
at that point you're going to face the futility of
trying to know infinity via the second order see most
scientists and just people in general who are just curious
about life and you know study a lot intellectual type
of people if you're an intellectual you don't even realize
how much energy you are wasting trying to grasp infinity
using the second order in fact you could be wasting
so much life energy doing this that it could be
physically making you sick it could give you chronic diseases
it could be giving you cancer it could be giving
you depression and you won't even know it because it's
just your you know your whole way of life is
just like like honestly lately i felt like for the
last 20 years of my life i've just been trying
to figure out what reality is and like it's taken
a [ __ ] toll on me it's stressful it's
stressful conceptually figuring out reality trying to put all the
puzzle pieces together piece by piece like what is god
and what is christianity and what is buddhism is what
is science what is this and what is that how
does it all connect and what am i like i
mean that's stressful that's stressful and as an intellectual you
don't even appreciate the stress and you might justify to
yourself as just like oh well that's just that just
comes with the territory being intellectual yeah but that stress
is slowly killing you inside because like you think that
you're you're making progress but really you're just like treading
water you're staying in place you think you're getting ahead
but you're just you're staying in place you have a
deep thirst for a fun to you have a fundamental
curiosity that primordial curiosity to know yourself as god and
that's not being quenched that thirst is not being quenched
by these little bits of nuggets that you get from
science or even from religion or even from some buddhist
you know douchebag uh guru sitting there you know posturing
us some buddhist wearing a rope those little bits of
insights they're not like satisfying you it's almost like you're
a person who has never had sex in your whole
life and you're so sexually frustrated but you don't even
like know what sexual frustration is because you've never you've
never experienced the release of a proper orgasm from proper
sex all you've done is you've gotten a little bit
of like someone's tickle tickled your genitals for a few
seconds here and there in life that's what science is
doing that's what many of these youtube videos are doing
even many spiritual videos spiritual teachers all the new age
stuff what they're doing they're just tickling your genitals for
a few seconds here and there you're not getting the
full thing like you're not getting your brains [ __
] out when it comes to understanding what reality is
and you're never going to get that through those methods
what you need is a full-blown awakening and then you'll
realize like oh my god that's what all of my
curiosity was driving me towards like i needed my brains
[ __ ] out my whole life and i didn't
know it and i've been suffering for that and finally
it's happened and now i see what i've been missing
and now finally there's that like relief is like oh
my god it's like this giant weight has been lifted
off my shoulders like i can [ __ ] relax
now for a few minutes there's a piece that comes
with that a deep satisfaction traditional religion philosophy and signs
fail because they try to reach the ultimate via knowing
which is not possible not realizing that all knowing is
relative but the ultimate is absolute so this brings us
to the issue of relative versus absolute truth i've talked
about this many times i have a specific episode on
it called believe it's called relative versus absolute truth so
go check that out relative knowing is knowing something relative
to something else like you know what a fork is
relative to what a knife or a spoon is you
know what a fork is relative to a non-fork you
know dualistically you know what you can do with a
fork and what you can't do with a fork you
know this fork is small and then there's other objects
that are big like the earth is big relative to
a fork this is all relative knowledge but then there's
a way of knowing the fork which is absolutely you
can have absolute knowledge of the fork but what is
that well for that awakening would be required and also
you couldn't talk about it you'd have to become the
fork so remember to make a distinction between knowledge of
how a thing works and what you can do with
it versus the thing itself very different now psychedelics produce
very powerful states of not knowing in fact such deep
not knowing is virtually impossible i would say otherwise you
don't even know what a state of not knowing is
until you've done some psychedelics a lot of psychedelics honestly
psychedelics will take you into deeper and deeper states of
not knowing which is why i consider them one of
the most powerful tools in this work and i advocate
for them so passionately because honestly you know i've been
wrestling with this issue of not knowing for a long
time i've known about it i've thought about it i've
practiced it but like it's only when i got deep
into psychedelics that i really started to appreciate what is
meant by not knowing the utility of psychedelics is that
they show you how fragile and relative your knowledge is
they also show you the alternative to relative knowledge which
is absolute knowledge most intellectuals of course are terrified of
psychedelics and rightly so science history religion politicians business people
are terrified of psychedelics because all those industries and endeavors
are built upon these kind of like houses of cars
of second order conceptual knowledge relative knowledge biased knowledge highly
partial knowledge and psychedelics will obliterate and undermine all that
deconstruct all that speaking of deconstruction deconstruction leads to not
knowing and vice versa not knowing helps with deconstruction and
deconstruction this is a concept i've talked about in the
past quite a bit if you're not familiar with that
go check out my episode called what is actualized.org where
i i believe i go pretty deep into kind of
like framing up what deconstruction is and why we're kind
of like deconstructing the mind and what we're trying to
accomplish with that by the way i need to give
special thanks and credit here to peter ralston who's been
um crucial for inspiring this whole topic of not knowing
he has a book called the book of not knowing
i'm a big fan of so check out his work
he deserves credit for this topic um he's the first
who kind of planted the seed of the importance of
not knowing into my mind and then that seed has
been slowly growing like an like an acorn like an
acorn slowly growing into an oak tree in my own
mind and just only recently like in in the last
um in the last year have i really um started
to appreciate the importance of not knowing and i'm getting
better at working from not knowing and for me this
has been challenging and you know a big trap because
like i said i am very intellectual and so a
lot of the work that i've done with actualize.org for
the first you know eight years of of running this
this channel in business is you know i had to
put out a lot of like knowledge a lot of
content and i still do put a lot of content
um but now i'm getting kind of like more mature
in my understanding of how to put out content and
um well there's sort of a paradox that needs to
be reconciled between like how is it possible that i
put out so much content that seems to be so
knowledgeable but at the same time now i'm talking about
not knowing and i'm practicing not knowing well there is
this paradox here that i want to point out to
you this is the paradox of not knowing is that
the mature minds the mature mind admits of not knowing
more but ends up knowing things which the immature mind
thinks are impossible to know so see the immature mind
thinks it's impossible to know what reality is it's impossible
to know what absolute truth is what god is what
consciousness is what love is what infinity is it's impossible
to know the paranormal and things like this right it's
impossible to know these things it's impossible to know whether
other people exist or not impossible it is when you
know a lot of stuff about materialism and also religious
dogma and stuff like that yeah then it's impossible because
your mind is locked down within that paradigm but as
you let that go and you you truly reach deep
states of not knowing and you have and then you
your mind opens up to mystical experiences and awakenings and
so forth and maybe you start working with psychedelics and
so forth then the paradox is that you're going to
be knowing less and less but actually some of the
most impossible to know things will suddenly become revealed to
you in a very absolute direct manner and you will
actually know absolute truth god conscious love infinity paranormal stuff
you'll know it and you'll know it absolutely not just
relatively and yet at the same time there's still going
to be much you don't know and it's like well
how is that possible yeah it's hard to explain how
that's possible it's it's very mysterious it's kind of magical
it's unexpected it's counterintuitive here's an important point not knowing
doesn't mean you have to give up all knowing forever
you can still use knowing in practical ways you have
to be careful not to get lost in epistemic nihilism
skepticism and cynicism to the point where you become inactive
and passive you can kind of misuse this idea of
not knowing in this way of like you know this
sort of like false skepticism i have an episode called
false versus true skepticism kind of an old one but
an important one you know a lot of people misuse
skepticism a lot of science folks do and you can
say like well but leo nothing can be known that's
what not knowing means or it's like leo everything is
just subjective that's what not knowing means or it's like
not knowing means that the absolute truth doesn't exist or
not knowing means that you can't know god you have
to be agnostic that's not what not knowing means that's
a misuse of not knowing that's sort of a epistemic
nihilism and notice that to claim that nothing can be
known that's actually a definitive absolute statement of knowledge or
to say that everything is subjective and that there is
no absolute that's a definitive statement of knowledge you don't
actually know that you don't actually know for example that
truth doesn't exist you don't know that so it's tricky
be very careful about how this can get misused also
remember that you still have to consider survival and you're
kind of like everyday happiness survival and everyday happiness in
life requires activity and not knowing can be disruptive of
activity so be careful that with adopting this state of
not knowing that you don't use that to kind of
like derail your whole life it's like well leo i
was working on my life purpose you know i knew
that my life purpose i wanted to become a musician
and i knew that i wanted a family i wanted
to get you know i wanted a hot girl and
i wanted to have a couple of kids with her
and i wanted to you know a nice house in
the suburbs with a white picket fence and i wanted
you know a nice uh you know mercedes-benz couple of
mercedes-benz in the driveway that's what i knew i wanted
and i knew i wanted to travel to the bahamas
and you know have a nice vacation and i knew
i wanted to play some video games that are coming
up you know i'm looking forward to some new you
know star field or something right uh it's like i
knew i wanted these things and now leo you told
me about not knowing and now i believed you and
now i don't know anything and now i don't even
know if i want the mercedes i don't know if
i want that hot girl i don't know if i
want my kids i don't know if i want my
house i don't know if i want to go to
bahamas i don't want i don't know if i want
starfield well that's actually that's good for you be careful
of starfield um but uh it's like and now and
now it's like and leo and now i can't even
get out of bed in the morning i don't even
know if i want to get out of bed in
the morning and now i'm depressed and leo you've made
me depressed you see what the ego mind will do
with this not knowing so this is very dangerous if
it's misused so you're going to have to kind of
like walk and chew gum at the same time here
you're gonna have to enter deep states of not knowing
and yet at the same time you're gonna have to
keep executing in your life on the practical [ __
] on the those principles those very fundamental core survival
principles you know those things i teach about like your
life purpose uh maintaining a work ethic uh eating good
you know good food uh exercising going out talking to
girls socializing um going to school getting good grades doing
your meditation practice or your psychedelic practice if you do
that or you know going to retreats doing doing some
hardcore retreats you know reading books spending time with your
kids not being an [ __ ] to your friends
and your family uh working on your intimate relationship making
sure that's going well communicating consciously and so forth um
you know if you have employees you know being a
good boss if you're if you're a co-worker you know
being nice to your co-workers working on the stuff that
needs to be working like all that [ __ ]
those core principles you got to maintain all that for
the most part and then still enter into states of
deep not knowing and you might say believe isn't that
a contradiction if i'm totally in state of not knowing
then shouldn't i not know for example like what my
life purpose is maybe now i don't know if i
want to be a musician or an artist or a
filmmaker or a professor or a spiritual teacher i don't
know now i don't know there is a time to
question even those principles and even your life purpose but
you have to do that like consciously and you don't
want to let your mind run wild with that to
the point of like derailing you uh you should have
a deep passion for what you're doing like if you
want to be a musician or filmmaker you should have
a deep passion for that that passion should run deeper
than any sort of like conceptual knowledge or ideas and
that passion should survive any states of not knowing like
that's love right what you love your passion basically comes
from what you love what you love whether it's your
children your family whatever you know some of those things
can be inauthentic maybe you don't love maybe you you
realize you know you don't want to be a musician
okay fine that's actually good now that's kind of kind
of tragic maybe you have to give up that part
of your life but then you move on and find
something that you really do love so you can use
not knowing to question all these things just like be
careful not to like paint with too broad of a
brush where like now you don't know anything and now
you're just like demotivated um you can't get out of
bed in the morning and you're feeling depressed and now
you're eating junk food right it's like see what happens
is like leo i don't even know if you know
drinking celery juice um and um you know eating healthy
i don't even know if that's good for me because
you know just like the fish oil you know i
don't know what if what if pizza is good for
me leo what if heroin is good for me i
don't know so now i'm just gonna you know use
that as an excuse to eat pizza smoke weed do
heroin and sit at home watch cartoons all day and
just like get into a funk of deeper and deeper
depression and nihilism to the point where now you become
suicidal well you see obviously that's a trap obviously that's
not what i'm telling you to do again in this
work as you're exploring the truth and pursuing the truth
your survival is always at stake it's always an issue
yeah pursuing the truth questioning reality uh deconstructing aspects of
your worldview this is gonna conflict with your survival of
course if it didn't it what would even be the
point because part of the reason that we're doing this
is to enhance your survival to kind of purify your
survival because the way that most people are surviving is
is rather miserable and shallow so you want to sort
of like kind of like inch your way up or
bootstrap yourself in a way where you're using not knowing
to question stuff but you're still motivated and doing the
stuff the healthy stuff reasonably healthy stuff right you don't
need 100 certainty about everything that's another trap here it's
like well it sounds like leah was saying that unless
i know something absolutely i shouldn't be doing it i
know um if you're 95 sure you want to be
a musician and you're passionate about it that's enough you
don't need 100 absolute certainty you know you don't need
god to appear to you in the clouds and tell
you and write a stone tablet to you um with
a with a 100 guarantee that your life purpose is
correct you don't need that you're just going to be
when it comes to survival most your survival is kind
of probabilistic you're picking out of you know a lot
of times you're picking out of like you have imperfect
information and you're just kind of going with the best
thing you know like for example maybe you have three
ideas i want to be a musician or i could
be a filmmaker or i could be an accountant which
of those seems like i have more passion for it's
like well definitely not an accountant and maybe a filmmaker
but really i love music it's like well am i
100 sure i like music and i'm going to be
a great musician not 100 sure but like maybe 90
sure okay and then how sure are you that you
want to be an accountant it's like well 10 okay
so that's pretty bad and it's like well what about
being a filmmaker maybe like 50 okay but so your
best bet is to go for a musician right because
like you got to act survival and happiness requires activity
action and when it comes to survival very rarely do
you act on something with 100 certainty but you still
want to act decisively towards something what you don't want
to do is kind of like half-ass things where it's
like well i'm only 90 sure that i want a
musician so i'm just going to kind of like half-ass
it i'm just going to like practice with half enthusiasm
put half the energy into it's like no then you're
all you've already failed you still have to be decisive
i'll have an episode about how to be decisive so
stay tuned for that that's a tricky topic so not
knowing can be weaponized this false skepticism that i talked
about you can start to use not knowing to say
that oh well god cannot be known or you can't
know what happens after death nobody can know that right
leo surely you can't tell me that you know what
death is or you can misuse it like well then
you can't know what consciousness is nobody knows what consciousness
is or you can say that x would you know
fill in the blank x x cannot be known whatever
it is x cannot be known these are all misuses
of not knowing you can also misuse it within the
political sphere you could say oh well leo talks about
not knowing so leo you know you you've been an
advocate for vaccines these coveted vaccines leo but but isn't
it aren't you a hypocrite leo because you don't really
know if these covet vaccines are safe how do you
know but you're conflating uh absolute and relative considerations here
right like when it comes to survival issues when it
comes to you know a deadly virus that's moving through
the population rapidly you don't have time to gather all
the data you're not going to have you're never going
to have absolute perfect knowledge of some new virus and
yet you still have to act you still have to
protect people otherwise millions of people could die so given
the imperfect information all else being equal you know balancing
all the probabilities and all that you come down you
make a decision that you know you're going to go
get a vaccine because it seems reasonably safe even though
you don't know that's right because again if you act
with strict adherence to not knowing you're actually going to
die very quickly that's why humans are so addicted to
knowledge because knowledge serves survival even though a lot of
times it isn't true also this not knowing can be
abused by others it can be weaponized against you for
example you might enter a state of not knowing in
the realm of politics and then you know somebody like
steve bannon comes along and his strategy is flood the
zone with [ __ ] literal quote from him flood
the zone with [ __ ] so when you have
bad actors coming into the epistemic ecosystem information ecology and
start to pollute it with just ridiculous conspiracy theories and
misinformation and just pure [ __ ] and then you're
just sitting there and you're just kind of equivocating you're
like well who's right the democrats are right or the
republicans are i don't know it's all it's all up
for grabs like it's all equal they're all equally full
of [ __ ] no they're not all equally full
of [ __ ] there are some bad actors who
are deliberately pumping out [ __ ] and then there's
others who are being fairly honest and truthful you know
within the limits of a politician um and so a
great mistake would be to use this idea of not
knowing to put foolishness and wisdom on the same footing
it's like leo why should i even listen to your
you know principles of wisdom you know what's wrong with
being a fool after all leo do i know whether
it's better to be wise or to be a fool
what if being a fool is better than being you
know you can kind of like take it to this
extreme and when you do this is the definition of
foolishness you will become a fool and then you will
quickly discover um you know life will quickly teach you
survival will very quickly teach you by punishing you mercilessly
for being a fool so do not put foolishness on
the same footing as wisdom do not put inexperience on
the same footing as experience it's like leo you know
i don't know you know we we've got this giant
country to run it's a giant bureaucracy and you know
i don't know should we hire someone should we elect
someone who's very experienced with managing complex systems and has
a lot of experience with government all that or should
we just get someone who's completely inexperienced just like a
shot in the dark you know just roll the [
__ ] dice and someone completely who has no experience
whatsoever i don't know i don't know so i'm just
gonna go vote for you know the inexperienced one what
does it matter this is idiocy so make sure that
you don't turn not knowing into idiocy not knowing does
not mean that you have to abide [ __ ]
foolishness ideology propaganda false equivalency conspiracy theories and various kinds
of bad actors who are gaslighting you remember this is
all in the domain of survival and in the domain
of survival there are jackals and wolves who will [
__ ] rape you so please don't go practicing not
knowing when you're like you know you're walking down a
dark alley where you could get raped and your intuition
tells you you know i shouldn't be walking alone in
this dark alley i might get raped and then you're
like oh but leo told me that i don't know
so you know i don't know so yeah hey walking
down this dark alley might be just peachy might be
peachy so i'll just do it and then you get
raped and then you blame leo so you know don't
be an idiot right um start with practicing your not
knowing in more safer locations and in more safer contexts
and then you can broaden it out and if as
you get the handle for it you can try it
in a more dangerous context but remember i mean your
ass is always on the line so keep one eye
on god and one eye or one eye on god
one eye on truth and why one on one eye
on survival um don't take all your eyes off of
survival because you'll get [ __ ] um also not
knowing does not mean you don't pursue education reading books
going to school contemplation journaling insight wisdom consuming high quality
podcasts and videos you should still do those things because
see the ego might be like oh well not knowing
that means hey great i don't got to read a
book ever again in my life right because books are
full of knowing and leo told me to do not
knowing and so instead of reading a high quality book
what do you do instead it's not like you're just
going to sit there and meditate no what you're going
to do is you're going to go on [ __
] tick tock and watch stupid dancing videos or even
worse you're gonna log into facebook and read some stupid
me political memes that are gonna brainwash you with steve
bannon's you know flood the zone with [ __ ]
or russian propaganda like remember when you're not taking action
by default society is programming you with its [ __
] your friends your family all of that you know
when when you decide to not go work towards your
career of becoming a great musician what's gonna happen are
you just gonna sit there doing nothing no you're gonna
get bored and you are gonna turn on netflix and
you're gonna go to the porn and you're gonna get
addicted to jerking off and then you're gonna go hang
out with your friends and then they're gonna give you
some cocaine and then you're gonna start snorting [ __
] cocaine because again you're bored and you've got no
purpose you've got nothing to do and you're feeling suicidal
so you know what why not right that's the only
thing that's gonna motivate you to get out of bed
in the morning at some point is just the cocaine
or the alcohol that's why you got to maintain your
healthy habits and when you're not maintaining your healthy food
habits what are you going to be eating you're going
to be eating [ __ ] your friends are gonna
order a pizza and then you're gonna pig out on
it why because you got nothing you got nothing no
reason to do anything else so don't let this derail
your whole life and your whole self-actualization life purpose hero's
journey the hero's journey don't don't doubt that too much
right recognize that there are parts of your life where
you can apply skepticism and not knowing and deconstruction more
than other parts some parts deserve a lot more deconstructing
than other parts before you go deconstructing something like your
life purpose or your family or your career or your
you know your lover or your healthy eating habits first
how about you deconstruct all the [ __ ] in
your life all the bad stuff that's obviously bad not
knowing isn't an option when you're in a survival situation
survival holds a gun to your head and it says
act or die and so there's an intense pressure to
know when there's a gun to your head and it's
this pressure it's only when you really experience this pressure
kind of you start to appreciate it that you realize
like oh now i understand why mankind is so addicted
to knowing and why not knowing is so unpopular and
so kind of like taboo and little practiced it's because
most people are walking around every day they're waking up
with a gun to their head that's most people's lives
they're waking up with a metaphorical gun to their head
they gotta like you know get the kids to the
doctor get the kids to school quickly get to work
please their boss pay the electric bill pay their car
bill pay the mortgage pay the taxes do this and
then do that every day and there's a gun to
your head and as soon as you don't do it
click it goes off and see they don't even have
the space or the luxury to practice some not knowing
that's the tragedy of this another paradox here is that
even though you don't know what anything is you can
still get very good at predicting reality through massive exposure
to repetitive experience you can still develop very technical knowledge
you can still become very intuitive and wise despite the
fact that you don't know what a fork is like
you don't need to know what a fork is to
be able to use the fork and so don't let
the not knowing of what a fork is at the
first order level interfere with your masterful use of the
fork you know to eat the healthy food you got
to eat because you could be like well leo i
don't know what a fork is and you're so lost
in that that you forget to actually use the fork
to you know put like some healthy food into your
mouth and instead you just shovel fistfuls of pizza and
pretzels and you know beer into your mouth that would
be a mistake you might ask the question but leo
if not knowing is the case how come you seem
to know so much well um it's a very good
question i i wrestle with that myself um i'll have
an episode in the future about the evolution of my
teachings coming soon where i'll get a little bit more
into that for now i'll just say that the deeper
i go into not knowing the more i question things
i've taught in the past and it's not that those
things are wrong per se it's just that i see
the partiality of them i s i become highly construct
aware i become very aware of how the things i
know are are uh are constructed by my own mind
that they're partial they're relative uh only valid within certain
contexts and i'll be talking more about relativity as well
in the future so i just noticed so many constraints
and limitations like everything that i say you know if
i had the time and you had the time to
listen you know i would over qualify every statement that
i made but a lot of times i don't have
the time to do that it's exhausting to do that
all the time um and so you know honestly um
and again a lot of the things that i try
to teach i try to make practical and so a
lot of times i'm teaching something just kind of on
a practical level not on a metaphysical level and in
that sense it just works you know if i'm giving
you dating advice for example when i give dating advice
i don't get all metaphysical and kind of spiritual about
it it's like my dating advice you could even say
it's like very crude um yeah because at within the
domain of dating you don't need to get too fancy
for most people i mean you can if you want
to get like very sophisticated but the most people they
need is just like very basic like advice you know
you don't need to get all fancy to talk to
a girl you know you got to do some basic
stuff like approach say see say a few you know
things don't say certain other things and you'll get decent
results um you don't need to get all philosophical with
it um so a lot of my advice is just
like that um a lot of my my knowledge is
just kind of like it's practical wisdom um and you
can have all sorts of insights minor insights about reality
which is useful and practical but still you know only
operative within a certain context still relative still partial still
perspectival and so forth um and honestly you know i'm
getting to the point where one day i'm just like
i'm literally like i'm way i'm sort of like refactoring
and wiping the slate clean a lot of my own
with with a lot of my own models and world
views like i'm i'm trying to like deconstruct a lot
of stuff in my own mind um and it's challenging
to do that while simultaneously doing something constructive intellectually you
know through this work so i'm trying to like balance
balance that out um um yeah but ultimately if you
if you really press me and back me into a
corner like ultimately like what do i really know ultimately
like what i know is that reality is infinity that's
what i ultimately know is infinity and then everything else
is like the details of infinity how does infinity unfold
there you know i can be fallible you know as
far as the details of infinity those are endless and
you can easily get those wrong and that's kind of
where science comes in um and science is often wrong
but like the one thing i know is infinity and
that's what not knowing will take you towards is infinity
and then everything else will be contingent knowledge and self-deception
is still going to be operative all that stuff i've
talked about in the past uh the next question you
might be wondering is like but leo how can i
act and create a good life while not knowing how
will i know which are the right choices and moves
it's a good question there's something very powerful about intuition
and listening to your heart following your heart and it's
not at that point so much about knowing as it
is about almost feeling we can put it like this
that your spirit or your soul has a love for
various aspects of infinity and really your job is to
honor that and to follow it like a almost like
a metal detector you know those guys at the beach
walking around sweeping with metal detectors like beep beep beep
when they get closer to a piece of metal some
treasure buried in the sand it beeps real fast so
you kind of have this kind of compass in your
heart uh your spirit is attracted to certain things in
life um you also have you know what they classically
call a conscience like you cut you can kind of
just kind of like through gut feel you can distinguish
between you know what's right and wrong like you know
it's wrong to kill people you know it's wrong to
steal from people you know it's wrong to you know
to kick a puppy or to stab a baby you
know you you got that um you know hopefully if
you're not like a psychopath most people have that kind
of intuition and conscience and um it's like it's you
know the spirit's got a spiritual quality to it so
gina you follow your heart you follow your kind of
like gut instincts you get good at that at building
up your intuition i have an episode called developing your
intuition go check that out and then again your intuition
is not perfect you can still deceive yourself with your
intuition it's not always right you'll still make mistakes but
you know it's it's basically the best tool you got
and so you just kind of follow that and follow
that um and uh trust it now you might say
well how do i know i can trust it leo
i don't know if i can trust it well in
that case you're stuck okay fine so then sit there
and not know anything and then just die do nothing
don't even eat because you don't even know whether you
should eat don't even [ __ ] because you don't
even know if you should [ __ ] don't do
anything and just don't even breathe because you don't even
know if you should breathe and then just die okay
fine if you want to that's if you want to
gamble on that option then do that i mean it's
your life live however you want you're going to be
half you're going to have to life is going to
force you to make imperfect choices you're going to have
to make guesses trial and error try stuff out and
see what doesn't work and in the end suffering will
quickly teach you what's not working so how do you
create a good life you know if you think smoking
a bunch of weed every day watching 10 hours of
netflix and then playing a bunch of video games and
jerking off and eating pizza and drinking beer and doing
cocaine if you think that that's gonna create a good
life and you're like well leo that in my mind
you know i don't know that might be as good
as like working hard and meditating and drinking celery i
don't know so i'm just gonna go with that okay
go with it and let's see how you feel in
a few months your feelings will quickly tell you that
it's not a good life and you might say well
leo how do i know i can trust my feelings
well okay fine then then you won't mind when you're
depressed and suicidal and in in pain and in torture
and and all that then you won't mind right because
hey how do leah i mean how do you know
that you're you know your feelings of depression all that
how do you know that's a problem how do you
know your suffering is a problem why not just suffer
suffer your whole life you see where this goes this
kind of nihilism so in the end you have to
make some choices and uh you'll quickly learn that the
the principles that i talk about and the wisdom that
i talk about that these are the principles that create
for a good life generally speaking there's some exceptions around
the edges all right so let's talk about how to
apply all this how to apply not knowing first of
all contemplate a lot the limits of knowing think about
what knowing is how it's possible where it comes from
how do you know anything at all what do you
know what don't you know contemplate these things this is
epistemology 101. and by the way i have a lot
of epistemology episodes you can go check out uh number
two question everything that is known like really question deeply
get good at questioning in fact i have an episode
called um i have multiple episodes about contemplation how to
contemplate how to ask questions how to ask powerful questions
another episode it's a really good one you should revisit
uh question question question everything number three notice that you
don't know the being of anything the being keep reminding
yourself of that like over and over and over again
number four work towards entering deep states of not knowing
like we did in that first exercise keep doing that
it's not enough to do it once or twice do
that hundreds of times next make use of psychedelics to
enter profound states of not knowing this is going to
change your whole life if you do this huge but
if you're going to be using psychedelics make sure you
use them carefully and responsibly make sure you're not too
young or too immature make sure you don't have mental
illness and you're not on medications and so forth so
follow all my guidelines for safe tripping procedures i have
whole episodes on that next don't let others and society
pressure you into having to know lot of times you
might be at work you know your boss might be
pressuring you like to predict what the next ad campaign
is going to be you know what the results are
going to be how what the profits are going to
be and people will be pressuring you to deliver the
facts the knowledge but the truth is that you don't
know and nobody else knows so just like you have
to admit have the backbone to say you know what
guys i don't know you know your boss might ask
you is this going to work and usually you'd be
kind of like you just kind of lie and say
yeah and here you just say i don't know that's
the truth i don't know if it's going to work
i don't know if it's going to be successful that
takes courage to say that because they'll push back on
you and say well you should know you know how
dare you say you don't know that's unacceptable society will
treat though treat your not knowing as though it's unacceptable
to not know because they need you to know but
just because they need you to know doesn't mean that's
the right thing to do so build up that backbone
to say i don't know you know even in school
you know your teacher asks you some question that you're
supposed to know the answer to and the teacher will
kind of judge you for like not knowing like you
know what year did you know world war two start
in and the teacher you know needs a specific date
and you're like well i don't know so so what
i don't know so what will you kill me i
don't know so just bite that bullet get more comfortable
not knowing and basking in mystery appreciate the mystery until
that mystery turns into a mystical experience also just literally
practice saying i don't know a lot practice saying it
you know people around you your friends or family and
co-workers they'll ask you about your opinion about this and
about politics and about abortion and about the economy and
about what happened there and about history and about the
future and this and it's like there's this temptation to
start to gossip or to invent theories or to speculate
to do armchair philosophy when really the truth is like
i don't know who's gonna be president in 2020 or
2024 i don't know is joe biden still going to
be alive in 2024 i don't know like is trump
gonna be alive i don't know is he gonna be
president i don't know i mean that's the truth right
rather than inventing like stupid stories and then justifying them
it's like well i think it's gonna be trump because
of this and it's like yeah but you don't know
that you're just making [ __ ] up all right
save the time save the drama and just admit you
don't know you can end a lot of debates and
silly stupid discussions online just by saying i don't know
and by the way i'll be doing that more as
well that's something i got to work on for myself
also contemplate what do i know for sure also remember
to distinguish between belief and speculation on the one hand
versus direct experience on the other hand distinguish between these
things if it's just belief in speculation then call that
i don't know if it's direct experience then maybe you
can claim you know that periodically wipe the slate clean
with your worldview just like one day just try to
take your whole worldview and just like throw it all
in the trash and just try to build a new
one from scratch for example or better yet just leave
it blank the other way you practice all this is
remember to balance out the not knowing with action still
take action be active in your life and carry on
with your not knowing and lastly operate with deep intuition
and implicit understanding enter the not knowing mode try entering
it that exercise we did at the beginning try entering
that mode before you begin meditation before you begin a
serious bout of contemplation before you take a psychedelic before
you do a brainstorming session or you're getting all creative
with your art before entering a discussion or communicating with
another person when listening to something controversial first enter a
state of not knowing and then come from that place
you'll see you'll get much better results in all these
domains and experiment with other domains you could apply it
in you know like let's say you're having a conflict
with your spouse you two are arguing about something you
know she's accusing you of something you're accusing her of
something rather than just doing it the way that it's
usually done um try this first take a few minutes
and enter a state of deep not knowing and then
listen to her and you'll notice things go very differently
because to truly have a communication and not just sort
of a back and forth accusation um where each side
is trying to play the bigger victim instead of that
like actually sit there with not knowing and listen to
the to her grievances and her criticisms really not know
and don't be like when you don't know then you're
not going to be defensive so much because it's like
well maybe i did do something wrong right you're gonna
be more open you're gonna be open to the idea
that you did do something wrong and then a communication
could actually happen and then if you train her to
also with you get into this state and you both
of you two get into a state of not knowing
that's when you can really have a high quality communication
we'll be talking more about conscious communication later in a
separate episode if you're listening to something like like a
controversial perspective that's different than yours which i hope you're
doing like for example if you're a progressive and you're
listening to some conservative talk show or something when you
listen before you listen to it first enter a state
of complete not knowing and then listen and vice versa
if you're a conservative and you're going to be listening
to some progressive which i hope you're doing just to
challenge yourself um listen to it with from a state
of not knowing you'll see that you listen in a
very different way if you're listening to some intellectual speaking
and let's say you don't fully agree with this intellectual
like let's say you're listening to jordan peterson or sam
harris or somebody like that listen to them with a
state of not knowing but also remember that doesn't mean
you're just going to be some gullible idiot that accepts
everything that is said from this state of not knowing
you know just because they say something doesn't mean you
have to then latch onto it like a pit bull
and turn it into a dogma you can carry on
with your not knowing while considering their perspective and hell
you can do that with me too you can also
apply not knowing it at a very mundane level so
like let's say in your business you're going to be
running some ad campaign on facebook usually you would like
have all these expectations and ideas about how it's going
to go and what's going to happen it's like you
can just say wait a minute what's the truth here
i don't know and then run your ad campaign from
a place of i don't know let's say for example
you're setting up a date with a girl you're texting
her just you know to show up on sunday night
at this place and it's like you don't like does
she like me um is she gonna show up are
we gonna have sex together what shirt should i wear
what what's she going to wear is she going to
drive eye candy like all this kind of all this
like back and forth and then you're like you're over
planning and over projecting and worrying and all this sort
of stuff uh where you could instead just like come
at it from a place of i don't know like
is she gonna show up i don't know are we
gonna have sex i don't know are we gonna get
along i don't know am i gonna end up burying
this girl i don't know let's just see let's see
where it goes for example with investing a lot of
times you get yourself into trouble with investing because with
investing usually when you invest in something you build up
a fantasy about how how much money it's going to
earn you and a lot of times those fantasies end
up just being [ __ ] and bubbles of various
kinds so you know before you invest in something like
crypto or whatever really ask yourself do i know is
is bitcoin gonna be a hundred thousand dollars per coin
do i know oh i don't know oh well yeah
of course i don't know is is bitcoin going to
go to zero i don't know maybe it will well
okay now that kind of like modulates and moderates your
kind of crazy expectations with investing maybe you're having a
confrontation with somebody at work and usually you would you
would kind of like project negative intentions to that person
like you say oh well that person she's just jealous
of me because i'm doing a better job than her
and she's probably scheming with that guy over there to
maybe demote me at my work and they're gonna conspire
they're gonna go tattle to the manager and say some
bad thing about me because they're the like it's like
that right but then you can ask yourself like do
i really know that person's intentions their motivations are they
really out to get me or maybe they're just having
a bad life you know uh like personal life maybe
they just got divorced or something and then you you
go into not knowing and you realize like oh i
don't know i don't know is this person is it
personal against me is it something is she offer medications
is is there problems at work is there maybe something
i could say that would fix this issue maybe we
can have a communication um you know the not knowing
opens up more possibilities or for example you might wonder
will be there and act will there actually will there
be an actualized.org video next week and the answer is
i don't know we'll see see and as you do
this you become more comfortable not knowing so part of
this is just like accustoming yourself to living from uncertainty
remember your mind is addicted to to certainty but the
truth is that reality in life is very uncertain it's
chaotic random things happen all the time we don't know
what the economy is going to do next year we
don't know what the stock market is going to do
we don't know what the housing market is going to
do we don't know what's going to happen in politics
we don't know the direction of the country we don't
know what kind of viruses will arise you know new
viruses we don't know if there's going to be an
oil shortage or you know all sorts of stuff like
so just like that's okay you that's just the reality
of life it's no use coming up with all sorts
of like stories to just soothe yourself it's like well
you know the market's probably going to be okay and
this thing will do this and this will do that
and i expect this here and it's like but these
are fantasies why why like why do you need this
become strong enough that you can countenance this uncertainty so
as you practice this not knowing it will create a
profound respect within you for the problem of knowing reality
this is an existential problem it's really a metaphysical problem
not just an epistemic one your commitment here shouldn't be
to knowing it should be the truth and then if
you can get some knowing alongside the truth fine and
if you can't if the truth is that you can't
know then that's what's true go with that don't forget
that in most cases the truth is that you simply
don't know so really your default fallback position if somebody
asks you something is i don't know and then only
if you're really certain about something and you got a
lot of experience with it should you say maybe i
know something but otherwise you should mostly just say i
don't know fall back on that it's counterintuitive that you
can actually operate better from a place of not knowing
because you have less fantasies in the way [Music] less
expectations less assumptions by acknowledging not knowing you put yourself
in the now and it primes you with a sort
of improvisational attitude like you know especially if you're having
a conversation with me like if you're gonna like if
you're a guy chatting up a girl at a bar
or a club you would think like the best thing
is for me to pre-plan a script of everything i'm
gonna say then everything she's gonna say and everything i'm
gonna reply with and if i just memorize that whole
script that i'm gonna you know that's gonna be my
best chance to ace that conversation but that's actually not
true because the conversation is so free-flowing chaotic and complex
and has so many different branching paths that are possible
that you can't possibly memorize all that and do it
authentically and smoothly so actually your best bet when you're
walking up to like talk to a girl at a
loud nightclub is don't plan anything at all literally like
if i was doing that i would just shut off
my mind completely because my mind is usually on if
i'm walking up to a girl i just shut off
my mind completely walk up and just start talking like
just start yapping and let let like this is improvisation
it's an improvisational attitude and at first it's very awkward
and you don't know what to say but as you
practice it more you get more comfortable with it and
you're able to kind of like dance and tango you
know poetically speaking not physically i mean you're able to
kind of like tango conversationally with another person without planning
anything and your conversations go a lot better than if
you were to script them all out because you're actually
more true to the situation in that situation neither party
knows what they're going to say anything could be said
and so you got to just be prepared for that
and now extrapolate that to the larger domain of life
it's um you're gonna be most effective in life when
you're operating from consciousness presence and a responsiveness in real
time i know i've struggled with this a lot in
my life is like a lot of the ways in
my life that i try to make myself feel secure
which is also what the ego is always creating for
is security i would make myself feel secure by like
pre-planning everything in my life so that i had like
contingencies and backup plans and if they did this i
do this and if this happened i would do this
and this and it's like this and it's just like
it's a very heavy-handed way to live it's stressful and
it it takes the joy out of life because like
really the joy is being in the present moment flowing
being responsive that's the kind of attitude you want to
develop and start practicing that it it's going to take
you some years to transition away from your old kind
of scripted ways of managing life and being secure in
life to get to the ultimate level where the ultimate
level is you're so conscious and awake and uh experienced
enough to be improvisational you're also very intuitive and kind
of like wise you're operating on certain very abstract principles
that they allow you to deal with a lot of
chaos and complexity in a graceful manner even though you
hadn't pre-planned any of it and then life becomes really
fun and then you're in the flow and not knowing
can help you with that all right that's it i'm
done here uh please check out my website check out
my blog check out the actualize clips channel check out
my book reviews list check out my life purpose course
contribute on patreon if you would and the last thing
i'll say is this to admit to yourself when you're
listening to these advanced teachings of mine and some of
the radical claims that i make about god or whatever
else spirituality love etc that you don't know that these
things i teach are true this is a safety mechanism
from having these turn into dogma right all the stuff
i talk about you have to test out for yourself
to see how true it is for you and some
of the stuff i say may not be true for
you because we're different people we have different personalities different
genetics different life circumstances different contexts you know we're different
ages so i might say something is true and it
won't be true for you until you reach age 30
and right now you're age 20. you know that kind
of stuff um i might say something that's true for
a man but it's not true for a woman i
might say something that's true for somebody in america but
it's not true for somebody in africa you know these
kinds of things like it's hard for me to consider
all the contingencies all the contexts for all the people
that are living all around the world at all the
different ages and have all the different mental conditions and
disorders you know there's a variety of different mental disorders
people have different genetics it's it's a lot you know
it's really hard to put out a set of teachings
that applies to everybody at all times in their life
for all genders in all countries in all circumstances there's
very few things that could be said that would be
useful for that are just so broad and so universal
there are some things that could be said but generally
advice is most helpful when it's very specific but the
more specific it is the more context limited it is
right it only applies to certain people in certain contexts
like it's very narrow and then the more you universalize
it the more the advice just becomes like a platitude
like you know like i could tell you something like
you know the golden rule of like treat others the
way you would want to be treated you know something
so generic that would apply to probably everybody on earth
for the most part but it's like does that really
help you not so much so the bottom line is
the most advanced things that i teach you don't know
for example is solipsism true for most of you the
answer is you don't know and that's the truth for
you right now so go with that so rather than
sitting in your room alone it's like oh my god
leo was talking about solipsism sometime and ago and then
and you know oh it must be true and that
means like oh my parents are imaginary and leo's imagining
all this is imaginary and it's like oh my god
now i'm depressed but yeah but but it's not your
truth you see something that's my truth is not your
truth until you directly become conscious of it so be
very careful with that go with your truth but also
be open to the possibility that your truth is just
like a partial limited truth and there's higher truths that
i might be talking about they haven't reached yet and
so you'll be aiming towards those but don't live as
though you've already got that as a truth right don't
go living as though like for example i might say
that death isn't real i've said that before death is
imaginary okay that's my truth i'm conscious of that most
of you are not conscious of that so don't go
living as though that's true for you because the reality
is like you might be terrified of death or you
might have no idea how's it possible that death can
be mad what that sounds ridiculous well if it sounds
ridiculous to you then obviously it's not your truth but
also be open to the possibility that even though it
sounds ridiculous to you right now there might be something
you're overlooking something you're missing something will get recontextualized as
you do the work and then it will become your
truth so stay open but also stay true to what's
true for you and stick around for more you
