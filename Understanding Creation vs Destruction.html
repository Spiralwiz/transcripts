[Music] happy holidays this year santa is bringing to you
the gift of philosophical insight about the profound nature of
creation and destruction so usually we tend to think of
creation destruction as two opposite things and we also don't
see the relativity of destruction we don't think that destruction
is just destruction for everybody without realizing that it's actually
a matter of perspective so we're going to bring together
some previous concepts from previous episodes that i've talked about
we're going to talk about concepts from the episode understanding
bias very profound episode go check that out we're going
to be talking about relativity check out my episode called
understanding relativism part one i'm also gonna have a part
two and a part three in the future so stick
around for that uh we're gonna be talking about differences
of perspective we're gonna be talking about dualities check out
my three-part series called understanding duality part one part two
part three that's going to play a big role here
so let's really look at this duality of creation versus
destruction a lot of times when i'm speaking about god
or people in general spiritual people talk about god we
tend to say god is the creator or the creator
uh creator with a capital c and then if you're
trying to be a smart ass you might say well
why don't we call god the destroyer isn't god also
the destroyer after all in hindu religion there's shiva and
the the shiva rendition of god is god as the
destroyer and what's more fundamental creation or destruction you might
wonder well we're going to make sense of all this
here now of course as you should probably already be
aware if you're into non-duality is that this is a
duality that all dualities ultimately collapse that's a principle i've
talked about in the past so of course these are
all going to collapse into each other and there's really
no difference between creation destruction but let's explore this with
some examples and really take a look at how this
works so look humans are very selfish creatures we're very
biased and our mind tends to have a a fixed
rigid sort of objective standard for what is destruction what
is creation and we tend to ascribe negative qualities to
destruction and positive qualities to creation but that's a function
of how we're defining creation relative to ourselves and destruction
relative to ourselves so uh we don't see the profound
interconnectedness between creation and destruction so basically the ego mind
because it's so selfish if something is harming the ego
mind then the ego mind tends to label that thing
as destructive and bad or negative and then if something
is helping the ego mind to flourish and to survive
then the ego mind tends to label that thing as
constructive or creation it's promoting the construction literally the construction
of the self or the finite ego and and then
we just kind of go about our lives like this
and we don't really question it so let's question this
though so for example there's this popular notion of you
know the term weapons of mass destruction you've heard of
this term weapons of mass destruction but let's look at
this so like let's say a nuclear weapon would be
considered a weapon of mass destruction so you detonate a
nuclear weapon like during world war ii in uh hiroshima
and nagasaki and you would think well clearly that's a
destructive act you might even say why would god allow
for such a destructive act to occur you know the
wiping out of these two cities but notice that to
wipe out these two cities you actually need to create
the nuclear weapon so the nuclear weapons creation itself to
have that weapon to detonate that was a creative act
first of all notice that so there's that link between
creation and destruction every tool that exists that can be
used to destroy whether it's a gun a bomb a
virus or whatever else it had to be created that's
sort of the irony in the paradox here and there's
a deep reason for that right in a sense that
like if you want to erase something from a piece
of paper you need an eraser and an eraser is
an actual existing thing and in fact when you're erasing
something you're erasing some pencil marks on a piece of
paper you are literally erasing the eraser as it is
wiping off the graphite or the ink from the paper
and eventually the eraser itself gets erased in the process
likewise when you detonate a nuclear weapon the nuclear weapon
itself gets destroyed in the process isn't that interesting but
first it had to be created of course the cities
that are being destroyed also had to be first created
for them to be destroyed otherwise what do you have
to destroy but this is still the superficial layer there's
an even deeper connection between creation destruction notice that actually
when you're detonating a nuclear weapon normally we think of
it as destruction but notice that's a bias we have
because we're looking at it from sort of a human-centric
point of view and a selfish point of view actually
the detonation of a nuclear weapon is an act of
creation notice this how so well you're creating energy you're
creating heat you're creating light you're creating fire you're creating
a mushroom cloud that's all creation even furthermore we could
say that actually you're creating piles of rubble from all
the buildings that are destroyed so really what's happening here
is not any objective notion of destruction you see i
want you to notice the relativity and the subjectivity of
what you're calling destruction and creation because it's not so
simple it's not so obvious from the universe's point of
view from god's point of view we might say the
universe can't really tell the difference between creation and destruction
because they're literally the same activity it says humans who
are projecting our own subjective biases and sort of skewing
the way we're using these labels the way we're thinking
about what's really going on in the universe in the
universe what's going on is you have a field of
consciousness that's all that exists an infinite field of consciousness
and this field of consciousness is imagining and holding different
forms a building a cat a tree a dog a
human a city a mushroom cloud whatever think of it
like a tv screen this tv screen can render different
forms and images but the problem is that these images
and forms they conflict with each other this is the
finite nature of finite forms it has to be this
way or that way it can't be both ways you
either have a cat or a dog but you can't
have a cat and a dog in the same place
at the same time otherwise you don't have a cat
or a dog you have something else maybe a hybrid
between the two but that's not the same thing as
a cat and a dog so so really what i
want you to i want you to start to think
of creation destruction more as a process of transformation that's
how you sort of unify the two into a single
force what's really happening is that consciousness is transforming itself
all the time see my episode called understanding impermanence that's
one of the principles of buddhism um that you should
study and contemplate and start to notice all around you
right consciousness is is constantly fluid and it's impermanent it's
changing forms it's shape-shifting remember in my episode about aztec
non-duality called aztec non-duality i talk about toyota or god
as being an infinite shape shifter so that's really what
god as creator is it's a shape shifter but for
it to shift shapes it has to let go of
old shapes and adopt new shapes and that's the process
of life and death or creation and destruction so even
when you detonate that that nuclear weapon and you destroy
a whole city you are actually creating that's a creative
act you're creating rubble you're creating death you're creating blood
you're creating guts you're creating radiation you're creating disease and
sickness and these are all in a sense things that
need to be created now of course from the human
point of view this might seem nasty ugly brutish evil
whatever but these are just our subjective judgments after all
who's to say what is creation what is destruction you
might go even a level further you might say actually
the detonation of those nuclear weapons created peace where before
there was war so the destruction of those cities led
to a new level of stability and peace in the
world ending world war ii now you can argue about
whether it was necessary whether it was an excessive use
of force you can of course you can argue all
those things i'm not i'm not interested in debating that
here you could make a good case that you didn't
need to drop these nuclear weapons on japan and you
could still have created peace by other means sure okay
fine those are just little minutia matters of minutia um
but i just want you to see that a lot
of the violence that happens in the world is actually
part of a larger creative process i want you to
start to see that because otherwise it's difficult for your
mind to make sense of violence war genocide other sorts
of quote-unquote evil and selfish acts that happen all the
time in the news and throughout human history for example
you might think that and by the way don't get
me wrong i'm not saying this to justify any kind
of activity so what i'm saying here is completely neutral
in terms of uh like morals or normativity in terms
of like what you should do i'm not making any
prescriptions i'm not making any rationalizations for why something was
good or bad that's a complete misunderstanding of what i'm
saying here so i'm not saying that the dropping of
these nuclear weapons was a good thing or a bad
thing we're not interested in that here this is a
discussion about the deeper metaphysics of what we actually mean
by creation destruction right so i'm going to be giving
some more uh disturbing and um radical examples here that
might be a little distasteful and offensive and i don't
want you to get the idea that i'm somehow trying
to justify this activity um i'm not i'm just trying
to get you to question to see things from different
perspectives so for example notice that like you might say
well the holocaust was a purely destructive act it wasn't
an act of creation but is that actually true take
a look at what the holocaust was in an objective
sense not from your human biases see um you might
say well oh you know on the surface of it
it looks like you know you're killing millions of jews
and gas chambers that seems like a very destructive act
what are you creating there nothing is being created nothing
positive has been created in that process it's just uh
shameless destruction but look at it from the point of
view of the people who initiated the holocaust let's say
hitler and his henchmen what were they trying to do
were they doing it purely from a destructive point of
view no they were to them it was actually a
means towards a creative end what was their creative end
what was their creative vision their creative vision was to
create like a pure germanic um you know uh race
to cleanse their society of what they perceive to be
parasites and of what they perceive to be impurities and
evil so in their minds and i'm not saying this
is right or wrong i'm just saying in their minds
the way they framed it is that the holocaust was
a means of creating that ideal society that they wanted
as twisted as that might seem to us today um
you see so for them it was actually a creative
act and so what i'm trying to just show you
with these examples is that the line between what is
creation destruction is very relativistic and very subjective and it's
not so clear for example let's take a look at
the um american revolution the founding of america as a
country now if you're american and you're like an american
patriot you tend to see the revolutionary war as an
act of creation america was literally forged in the waging
of the war you know with george washington and the
founding fathers you know rising up against the uh britain
and against the king and the monarchy and all this
and you know constructing a constitution very very creative but
that's how americans frame it from the american point of
view which is biased you know like if you look
at it from the british point of view the creation
of america was the destruction or the loss of a
british colony so which one was it was it an
act of creation or an act of destruction is the
glass half full or is the glass half empty and
what's the difference you might even say that in a
certain sense the creation of america was the ultimate destruction
of the british empire it was like one of the
first dominoes that fell in the british empire which over
the next 100 years or so collapsed one domino at
a time um how about 9 11 you might say
well obviously 911 is an act of destruction that's from
the american point of view but from the point of
view of the people who were perpetrating 911 bin laden
let's say and his henchmen and allies um from them
for them it was an act of creation in the
sense that in their minds they were initiating an attack
on an aggressor that was subjugating them in their own
home countries in the middle east and not allowing them
to create the kind of countries and the kind of
organizations and governments that they felt they were entitled to
in their own countries you know they wanted an islamic
state that was very theocratic and religious and very medieval
in a certain sense and and america was destroying that
and by attacking america you were creating space to be
able to create that kind of thing for yourself in
the middle east now whether that actually panned out or
not you know that's a matter of debate um but
that's how it was framed in their mind furthermore notice
that the destruction the actual physical destruction of the world
trade center that led to the creation of piles of
rubble and debris um of smoke a fire now you
might say well leo but these things are worthless they're
not as important as the the buildings that were there
but again do you notice that that's your bias the
universe doesn't share that bias to the universe the difference
between the world trade center standing in its full glory
versus laying there as a pile of rubble and you
know twisted concrete and a fireball and and cloud and
smoke of of debris like it from the universe's point
of view one is not more preferable than the other
see and which one is more preferable to you depends
on your point of view if your office is in
that building then you very much don't want it to
be a pile of rubble on the other hand if
you perceive that the people in that building are doing
something wrong then for you maybe it's a good idea
that the building was destroyed you see and so this
explains a lot of the violence that happens in the
world a lot of the violence that happens in the
world is actually people who are trying to do something
creative but they need to destroy something to create space
for the creative thing that they want to create because
a lot of times there's an obstacle and there's a
trade-off between having one thing existing versus another thing existing
furthermore notice that the destruction of the world trade center
led to the creation the space was opened up for
creating the new building the freedom tower i think it's
called whatever it's called now there's a new building in
that spot that new building couldn't exist there unless the
old building was destroyed now i'm not saying it was
good or bad the old building was destroyed i'm just
saying that it's just like a physical or even a
metaphysical fact that you had to destroy the first building
to create the second one because you couldn't create them
both at the same place at the same time so
really if you want to integrate creation instruction you can
kind of zoom out and see it in a bigger
picture context you can see that really what happens is
a transformation occurred reality is a never-ending process of transformation
self-transformation so um the world trade center that used to
be there was transformed into the freedom tower that's standing
there now and then in 100 years that freedom tower
may maybe demolished and turned into some new third building
and so this is going to keep happening and this
is how reality works so everything is transformation the problem
is that our minds because we ourselves are forms we're
attached to being finite forms within this constantly churning ever
transforming field of consciousness that we have a bias of
our own to maintain our form and so because of
this we tend to label those things that threaten the
perpetuation of our forms as as being negative destructive or
evil but actually notice that with the death of your
body it's not just that your body is going to
be destroyed it's really that your body is going to
be transformed your human physical body is going to rot
and decay let's say if you get buried underground it'll
rot and decay which will lead to the creation of
maggots and worms and flies and bacteria viruses and plants
and grass and trees the roots of the trees under
which you are buried will suck up your nutrients and
will use the nutrients from your body to literally grow
and blossom flowers and bear fruits which then birds will
eat those fruits or you know hummingbird will come by
and suck the nectars from that flower that has blossomed
from your corpse and then that your literally the atoms
and energy in your body and corpse will feed that
hummingbird through the nectar and then that hummingbird will lay
an egg and then from that egg will hatch a
new hummingbird and then that hummingbird will be eaten by
some other bird when it dies and so the cycle
of life will just continue and all of that will
literally be the transformation of your body into all these
other forms you see but you don't care about any
of that because all you you're selfish all you care
about is just preserving your body you don't care about
how by preserving your body look what you're doing you're
denying the nutrients to the trees you're denying food to
worms and to maggots and flies and you're denying the
birth of new hummingbirds see so it's a very selfish
act of youth just staying alive and preserving your form
because while you're preserving your form you're literally taking up
some portion of the atoms and molecules and energy in
the universe you're you're locking that energy into this particular
shape which denies it the opportunity of turning into some
other form or shape so because you exist as a
human and because mankind exists as 8 billion humans on
this planet there are as a result of that that
energy and matter cannot be utilized to create more kangaroos
more hummingbirds more trees more rats more flies and whatever
else might be possible with all that matter and energy
you see so who's to say what's really good and
what's really bad here i want you to notice how
subjective your idea of good and bad are when you're
claiming to some form if you are that form or
if that form helps you to survive as the form
that you identify yourself to be notice you're gonna have
a bias towards wanting to maintain that you're gonna rationalize
in all sorts of ways for example if you're working
for a corporation let's say you're working for a for
a military defense contractor like lockheed martin and you are
manufacturing missiles that are used in the middle east to
bomb whatever either civilians or terrorists whatever probably a combination
of both um you see because for your body to
survive and for the bodies of your children to survive
and to maintain their form you have to go to
work to the you know to lockheed martin and you
have to be creative to create missiles for them let's
say as an engineer so you create these missiles these
missiles are of course created weapons of destruction that will
destroy stuff but the stuff you're destroying there it's helping
you to feed your children and to feed yourself and
to maintain your family and and so therefore now you're
attached to maintaining the form of lockheed martin because if
lockheed martin has a corporation loses its shape and form
and devolves or dissolves goes bankrupt or whatever then you're
going to lose your livelihood you can't now be creating
missiles anymore and now your family's going to starve and
perhaps your children will die because you can't get the
medical care or whatever in the most extreme example right
um so you're very much attached to creating missiles you're
very much attached to voting in a certain way that
helps you to maintain lockheed martin as a company to
get your contracts subsidies maybe war is helpful for your
company to flourish maybe if the war in the middle
east ends then you're going to lose your job because
they don't need to manufacture so many new missiles anymore
and they don't need your services anymore and then how
are you going to feed your children you see so
when you look this person when this person is working
at lockheed martin is that person being creative or destructive
again the glass is simultaneously half full and half empty
of course the person is being creative when he's engineering
these missiles but at the same time these missiles are
being used to to create destruction in the world but
furthermore this additional layer is that the destruction that's created
in the middle east you could you could argue that
that destruction in the middle east helps to create the
american empire right so you're not just fighting for the
defense of lockheed martin you're also fighting for the larger
collective of the american empire which also serves you as
a citizen as part of the american empire it helps
you because it lowers gas prices for you it lowers
the the costs of goods and services of food and
other things like that it gives you more military power
more geopolitical power around the world this is why american
empire is maintained through military force and so you're a
beneficiary of that and hey so am i as an
american citizen we're beneficiaries of that but at what cost
right see we have to destroy in order to create
think about it very primitively from the point of view
of predator prey relationships in nature you have a wolf
and a rabbit from the wolf's point of view hunting
rabbits is a creative activity because he's creating a meal
for himself when he hunts the rabbit and then that
allows him to procreate and to feed his wolf pups
pups and that's creative from the wolf's point of view
but from the rabbit's point of view it's very destructive
so which is it is it creation destruction because you
see if the wolf doesn't destroy the rabbit then the
wolf will destroy itself it'll go hungry it's pups will
go hungry and they will end up just destroyed um
and from the from the rabbit's point of view sort
of the inverse of that by running away from the
wolf successfully the rabbit is doing a creative act because
this helps the rabbit to then procreate and to be
creative um but then that that hurts the wolf and
look at what's happening when the wolf eats the rabbit
the wolf is actually transforming that rabbit energy into wolf
energy and if the rabbit runs away from the wolf
the wolf is going to die from hunger that wolf's
corpse is going to lay on the ground it's going
to feed the grass and the trees and the plants
and the rabbit is going to feast off of the
grass that is fertilized by the wolf's corpse so the
rabbit by running away from the wolf is actually transforming
in a more indirect way is transforming wolf energy into
rapid energy it's not a perfect transformation there's also going
to be grass energy and tree energy and fly enter
maggot energy worm energy all sorts of other things are
going to be trans the wolf is going to transform
into we see it's very profound how all this works
when you look at it from a sort of objective
non-biased point of view isn't it very interesting so creation
destruction is a duality which is really just two sides
of the same coin and you can't have a coin
with just one side this is the nature of reality
so it's important to see how relativistic this is how
subjective this is because this this this puts various kinds
of things into into proper context you start to see
reality more from god's point of view and then you
can start to remove the judgment and the evil from
reality you no longer see particular acts as being evil
because you're not looking at it from a selfish lens
anymore you're seeing it in a in a fuller more
absolute context which integrates creation and destruction really fundamentally what
i want you to see is that the creation of
anything requires destruction at exactly the same place and time
so the best way to see this is just imagine
a blank piece of paper or canvas no matter what
shape i decide to draw on this canvas let's say
i just decided to just draw a circle it's like
a solid circle solid sphere so i'm drawing that as
i'm taking my paint brush and i'm drawing that solid
sphere and filling it in i am simultaneously let's say
i'm filling it in with a color like blue i'm
simultaneously destroying the white canvas that was there you see
how that works and it's like this with anything that's
being created there's always a trade-off when you're creating something
you're destroying at the very minimum you're destroying the emptiness
that was there you're also destroying the potential for something
else to be there so when i'm drawing this thing
solid blue i'm destroying the possibility of it being red
or yellow or any other color or any other shape
see that this is a very fundamental aspect of all
finite forms what do i mean by a finite form
a finite form means it's definite and specific in some
way so for example a red circle is a finite
form a blue triangle is a finite form a black
square is a finite form why is it finite well
because it has a specific shape and color and characteristics
to it which is not the totality of everything could
possibly be it's just a small subset of what it
could be right and so because it's just one possibility
out of many possibilities that it's finite and the nature
of every finite thing is that it occupies space and
time and certain dimensions and characteristics it has which are
precisely not some of its opposite characteristics if i draw
a small circle then it's not a large circle if
i draw a square then it's not a circle if
i draw a green triangle then it's not a red
triangle if i draw a cat then i'm not drawing
a dog and so on and so this trade-off exists
with every finite form and so does it matter whether
we call god creator or destroyer well both are happening
at the same time in a certain sense but if
we take the duality between lowercase c creation and lowercase
d destruction and we sort of unify that duality as
i've done and explained in my series my three-part series
understanding duality part one two three what we have is
we have we can we can unify the two together
transcend them into a higher absolute and that absolute would
be creation with a capital c so creation with a
capital c includes both lowercase secretion and destruction together and
it unifies them together because truly what you become conscious
of when you become conscious of the absolute is you
become conscious that the only thing that exists in reality
is an infinite field of consciousness this is it right
here you're experiencing this infinite field of consciousness right now
this field of consciousness itself cannot be destroyed it can't
not exist because existence is an absolute so consciousness is
absolutely existing that can't be changed but what can change
is that consciousness can take different forms it can take
different shapes or it can just be empty but when
it's empty it's like a blank canvas it still exists
it exists as emptiness and so you might say well
isn't that destruction if if we just eliminate all the
shapes and all the colors and all the sounds and
all the phenomena then we it seems like we've destroyed
the universe you haven't really destroyed it you've just made
it empty it's just a blank canvas it still exists
as a blank canvas see now you might wonder well
can't i also destroy the blank canvas itself too and
here's where it gets tricky no you can't because when
it comes to like if we're talking about a painting
the canvas that the painting is painted on is still
a thing it's still a shape or a form and
that of course you can destroy like if you're thinking
of a white blank piece of paper you can destroy
that whiteness that whiteness is not emptiness or even if
you think about the the vacuum of of outer space
you might say well that's emptiness it's just pitch black
emptiness actually that's not emptiness the emptiness that i'm talking
about is so empty that it's absolutely empty it's so
empty that you couldn't empty it anymore there's nothing there
for you to destroy you see um this absolute emptiness
you can't get underneath that you can't destroy that it
just is emptiness so what do you do with this
what do you do with this knowledge well admittedly it's
a bit abstract here in philosophical and you probably don't
have an immediate idea of how to apply this in
your life to make a bunch of money or whatever
that's not the point though the point is to start
to see reality see the structure of reality for how
it actually is how it works and to appreciate just
the structure just the appreciation of the structure changes your
relationship to reality makes you appreciate reality more it's not
about using this knowledge to do something with it although
you could find ways to use it but um that's
not the point the point is just to start to
see reality clearly for what it is and also to
distance yourself from your own biases and from your own
selfishness and from your own limited perspectival ways relativistic ways
of you know seeing events in the world so when
you see a mass shooting on television ordinarily you think
of it as just like oh it's just a a
shameless act of destruction but this is a mistake and
if you start to see reality in this way especially
when you're watching the news you see a lot of
destructive stuff in the news you're not putting into the
proper context and you're not seeing how it's part of
a larger process of creation and so in this way
you actually get disconnected from the larger absolute flow of
creation that is constantly ongoing in the world whether you're
watching the news or you see a car wreck on
the side of the road it's all an act of
creation it's all an act of creation with a capital
c it's all an act of transformation and so it's
important to detach yourself from needing creation to be in
in some specific finite way that suits you detach yourself
and appreciate just the larger absolute flow of creation take
yourself out of the picture and just appreciate the beauty
of creation appreciate its brutality there are brutal aspects to
creation sometimes you're gonna lose things that you really were
attached to and that you really wish would have stuck
around for longer whether it's your loved ones your pets
your family your friends your spouse your children or even
material objects like your car your fancy car that you
just bought or whatever else or your own body it's
all going to deteriorate and it's all going to be
impermanent it's all going to change and shape you know
shape shift and so uh ultimately the whole goal of
spirituality is to detach yourself so much from this ever
flowing shape-shifting process of creation such that you disidentify with
any particular way creation ought to be ought to unfold
or what shape it ought to take and to just
enjoy whatever shapes it takes and to trust that whatever
process it's going through that is the highest good and
to just trust that and to be at peace with
that and to surrender to that rather than trying to
hold on and micromanage the whole process of needing to
have it flow in whichever way you need it whichever
way i need it because that's a losing game you're
always going to lose that game and it's going to
create a lot of suffering and frustration for you whereas
if you are more wise you're going to realize that
you your ego can't control this this process of creation
is way too immense it's way too profound it's way
too intelligent to be subject to the whims of your
particular selfish needs and desires and so the only proper
answer to this is to to surrender your own needs
and desires to step aside and to to see that
there's something much more profound and larger at work here
that is way just beyond you and your personal human
needs and the more you do that the more detached
you become this is what spiritual detachment is about then
um the more happy you can be independent of what's
happening in the world and then even all that destructive
evil violent stuff that is happening you see it in
a proper context and it doesn't bug you as much
and you're not judging it as much as normal people
do and therefore it's not triggering you as much therefore
you can maintain your peace and your happiness more than
ordinary people do see how this works so it's a
little bit abstract but at the same time uh really
where it gets practical is in terms of how you
relate to the activities and events of the world you
can either get triggered and butt hurt by them or
you can see them as something of a larger game
that's being played and um and you can start to
see the beauty even in the quote-unquote ugly and evil
aspects of reality which means that you're integrating them which
means that now this is in a certain sense an
aspect of shadow work you're basically integrating your shadow and
you're expanding your sense of self to include all of
the richness and complexity of the shape of reality and
you're adopting the entire flow of reality as your own
identity as what you are and that is you moving
closer towards the perspective of god the more you do
that the more god-like you become until eventually you realize
that you are the creator of this entire flow god
is an infinite process of self-creation it's a dream that
keeps creating itself over and over and over again that
never ends and so your job spiritually speaking is to
fall in love with yourself and this dreaming process fall
in love with it more and more and more accept
it more and more and more and more rather than
trying to limit it or constrain it or cling to
it it's the clinging and the constraining of it which
is really the problem and so the wisest of us
let go of that and that's difficult to do it's
very difficult to do in certain situations but you try
to you know you work on it you let go
more and more and more until eventually you you just
fall in love with the entire process itself very holistically
you look at it very holistically and you fall in
love with the entire process and this is the equivalent
of falling in love with yourself or the equivalent of
discovering that god is love or the equivalent of discovering
infinite love the equivalent of discovering yourself as love which
is really the whole point of of life and of
reality is to discover deeper and deeper aspects of consciousness
as love but of course that requires you surrendering all
of the finite aspects of yourself and all your attachments
and all the stuff that you cling to and it's
also scary it takes courage it takes fearless fearlessness to
do this and it takes selflessness to do this and
so this is a lifelong process that you commit to
and work on every single day you
