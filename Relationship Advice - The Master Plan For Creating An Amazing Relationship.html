hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we are going to talk relationship advice all right
so let's talk a little bit about relationships and what
I want to do in this video is give you
some deep insights some deep advice about relationships how do
you create a situation in your life where you have
a deep fulfilling successful relationship and what I'm gonna do
in this video is going to give you some deep
wisdom some stuff you might not want to hear alright
this is how it actually has to happen and I'm
going to go to some of the problems and some
of the reasons why people go about this completely the
wrong way if you've been struggling to create a good
happy relationship then it's going to be coming immediately obvious
to you why this is we're going to touch on
the root deep root causes alright so when I when
I started to really study sexuality and dating and relationships
the way started to do that was by getting involved
with the pickup community now people hear this and they
say oh pickup community pickup that's weird what are you
doing you're a player this is stupid how can you
be doing this stuff alright so I'm going to cover
that in other videos I'm not going to get into
that that's a very very deep topic but what I
want to say is that the reason that I actually
got into pickup was because of this problem that I
saw there is a problem in society alright this is
a problem that applies to you no matter who you
are what gender what race what country you're in what
age anything if you want a successful intimate relationship then
you're going to have to deal with the harsh reality
that we have a forty percent divorce rate at a
minimum forty percent divorce rate not only that but the
people that still stay married 60 to the 60 percent
that do stay married a large majority of them are
married but miserable and the people that get divorced or
are just not even in a mare Ridge but are
simply in long-term relationships or any kind of relationship a
lot of those are dysfunctional as well so when you
see that when I see that I tell myself Wow
okay so clearly something is amiss here something is awry
and the way that people are dealing with relationships the
way they're managing their relationships the way they're approaching them
is fundamentally flawed can we agree on that that it's
fundamentally flawed if the overwhelming majority of everyone in the
world is struggling with this issue and is in a
dysfunctional relationship or does a relationship that has to end
and end in some sort of bitter divorce can we
assume that well this is why I got into pickup
because ultimately I didn't get into pickup for sex that's
why most people get it to pickup it's like a
guy he's young he wants to have some sex he
wants to bang a bunch of hot girls so he
gets to pick up that's not really why I got
into pickup I wanted to pick up for personal development
reasons and I got into pickup because I saw that
what I wanted is a goal for myself you know
I go for myself I said what I really want
is I want a really amazing girlfriend I want someone
that I can be really compatible with and I want
to be able to manage that in an excellent way
I want to have a relationship that's extraordinary and that's
not the kind of relationship that I see other people
having I didn't see my parents having it I didn't
see any of my friends parents having it I didn't
see it happening in the movies I didn't see it
happening in popular cultures I didn't see celebrities having it
so anywhere you look you see examples of massive failure
ways not to do it so what I said to
myself is okay wait a minute so if I really
want to have a successful relationship then I have to
start addressing some of these problems because clearly if I
just do what other people do I'm going to get
the kind of results that they've gotten and I'm not
satisfied at all with that kind of life so for
me I said okay I got to do something different
so I turned to pick up I started to explore
a lot of stuff eventually found pickup got into that
learned so so much but ultimately where that was coming
from was to understand and I knew that to really
master this relationship situation to create an amazing relationship to
have a nice girlfriend to maybe get married at one
point and actually keep it happy and long-lasting the only
way I could do that is if I applied massive
massive intellect to the process massive amounts of consciousness and
practice and experience that's the only way it can happen
and that's my relationship advice to you is if you
want a really excellent relationship you have to start to
take it very seriously all right I find most people
take relationships very casually in the sense that they like
they don't study they don't try to learn about how
to actually create a successful relationship they just assume that
they're a master at it already they just assume that
they know how to love they know what love is
they know they know what sex is they know how
to have sex they know how to communicate they know
how to manage emotions they know everything they soon they're
an expert when in fact they know nothing and so
this ignorance keeps them totally in the dark and it
keeps that cycle of dysfunctional and broken relationship happening again
and again and again you know it's an interesting statistic
that of the people that do get divorced those same
people if they remarry their chances of divorce actually increase
and that's called second divorces so second divorces are actually
more likely to happen if you've already been divorced and
actually what happens that if you need to get divorced
twice the chance that you get married again and get
divorced is even higher so basically people are getting divorced
and they're becoming stupider and stupider in the process so
it's not that they're getting more successful they're getting even
less successful it's a crazy crazy world crazy statistic so
with that being the case you know you have to
really teach yourself don't assume that you know what a
good relationship is don't assume you know anything about relationships
because honestly you don't you're not born knowing how to
create good relationships that's not how it is right and
just because you've been with a high-school sweetheart or you
dated a few people does not make you a relationship
expert chances are that unless you've heavily studied relationships and
sexuality then you know very very little about the psychology
of the opposite sex you know very little about female
psychology and you know very little about male psychology if
you're if you're the opposite sex they're guys know very
little about girls and girls very little about guys and
because we don't understand each other it's very difficult to
have a successful relationship so the solution here is to
study it right if you wanted to become an excellent
golfer what would you do if you want to become
a professional golfer someone that could rival Tiger Woods what
would you do would you just pick up a club
and start swinging away and expect to become Tiger Woods
or would you start like cracking books and going and
finding coaches and tutors to help you understand how the
game works and practicing your ass off and really dedicating
yourself to it right you would do that right you
would commit to a path of mastery now if you
wanted to become an engineer how would you become an
engineer would you become an engineer by by simply sitting
at home and building little things on your you know
in your little workshop or would you start cracking open
books and you would spend years learning physics and chemistry
and mathematics and advanced calculus and then going and getting
a degree in engineering and then maybe getting a master's
degree in engineering and then going and doing an internship
at an engineering company and learning the whole process of
how engineering works and then actually getting a job as
a as a certified engineer right which one of those
is a better path towards mastering engineering right it's the
second it's the mastery process right the path of mastery
you're not going to get good by just assuming you're
already good engineer or good golfer and likewise with the
relationship if you want to be good in a relationship
you have to study you have to study sexuality if
to study the opposite sexes psychology you have to study
your own psychology you have to study the problems that
are common in relationships all the common pitfalls you have
to work deeply on yourself to start to fix all
the potential hang-ups that could sabotage your relationship and this
is ultimately my advice for you is start to look
at your relationship as something that's very serious something that
you're going to master someone something you're going to really
study apply a lot of conscious conscious effort to and
ultimately the way that you're going to fix your relationship
is by fixing yourself you cannot control the other person
this is one of the things are going to learn
when you start to study the psychology other people is
that you're going to learn that controlling other people is
a huge waste of time and it's not going to
work the only thing you can control is yourself the
only thing you can change is your own psychology and
if you keep getting into dysfunctional relationships and they keep
failing it's not because other people are bad it's because
your psychology is sabotaging you so you have to commit
to personal development that's what I did that's why I
got it - pick up pick up actually if you
start to do pick up correctly there's a lot of
methods of doing pick up that is incorrect and I
don't have a cake but if you start doing it
correctly what you're going to do is you're gonna do
a lot of deep inner personal development work because you
have to which you realize if you go out and
you try a couple of pickup lines little gimmicks is
you realize that actually women don't respond to that and
you're not going to get laid from that the only
way they're going to get laid and then get a
relationship and potentially a marriage the only way that's going
to happen is if you start to work on yourself
so if you're coming from place where you're very deficient
like I was with women and with dating you'll understand
anything and you can't get a date to save your
life then you have to admit to yourself well dammit
I don't really know enough I'm not confident I'm not
I'm not doing things correctly I'm screwing something up in
the process and when you realize that they say oh
okay so there's something wrong with me I have to
go and start to fix and start to improve my
understanding and so that's what I did is I went
through a long grueling two-year process and I'm still going
through it of increasing my understanding and direct experience with
the opposite sex and all that ultimately came back to
me it was about improving me to get into a
better relationship to get a better quality girl to get
a better quality man the way that you do that
is by working on yourself personal develop that Sall you
need you don't need anything else you need knowledge and
understanding of relationships and then you need to work on
yourself here's what you should work on you should work
on the following things number one is you should work
on your sexual abundance you have to be abundant you
cannot be in scarcity mode and being a successful relationship
so that means that if you're super needy and you
have no options with the opposite sex at all and
you just happen to get lucky one day and one
day some guy or some girl comes up to you
and you strike up a conversation you fall madly in
love that might seem like oh you got saved actually
you didn't get saved at all because your neediness the
lack of abundance that you have is going to manifest
and it's going to creep into that relationship and it's
going to totally destroy it no chance in hell at
all that's stuff that you see in movies those romantic
comedies or just two people bump into each other and
maybe you have some like desperate girl or some desperate
guy and they bump into each other and they're there
their life is just this beautiful romance never ever going
to happen in real life in real life what happens
is that when you've got a desperate guy or Dutch
girl they come together what happens that desperation it seeks
in there and it talks af-- eyes the relationship and
it basically completely destroys it that's why you need to
have abundance you need to have options you cannot be
in scarcity you can't be in a successful relationship all
the while fearing that if that person leaves you then
you're or not find as the case may be you
cannot maintain a successful rationally it's too much pressure that
pressure will kill you it will destroy the relationship so
you have to create abundance work on yourself to create
that abundance you can do that by going out and
socializing more building a bigger social circle doing pick up
going bars and clubs you know whatever there's a million
different ways I'm not going to get into all that
here the next thing is finances get your finances in
order get your career in order to get your business
in order I think the number two reason I was
looking at the statistics the number two reason that people
get divorced is because of financial difficulties financial problems finance
creates a lot of tension in a relationship if you
are strapped for money or the other person strapped for
money or you cannot handle your money or you waste
it to frivolously or you're too stingy with it and
the other person is too deal-breaker the relationship is going
to end it's going to be very very miserable so
you want to make sure that you have a good
understanding of money good grasp of your financial situation you
can handle your money well so that you're not dysfunctional
in that area of your life many ways to do
that that I won't cover here next is your health
you need to take care of your health that means
nutrition and and fitness nutrition and gym right whether you're
a guy or girl this applies to you if you
have bad health it's going to it's going to start
to sabotage your relationship as well in all sorts of
ways if you're a woman it's going to become problematic
because guys are very visually oriented and if you start
to let your health slide then guy just might simply
leave you if you're a guy and you start to
let your health deteriorate well I mean there's there's all
sorts of different problems or to come up with that
you sort of get low energy all of a sudden
you can't do exciting stuff anymore oh with your with
your girl and then what happens is that you you
you basically start to distance from each other and she
loses attraction for you or some sort of other tensions
are created because of health lack of fitness and the
lack of nutrition so that's a one you have to
look out for and the other stuff is the the
psychology you have to start to work on your psychology
you have to really take a look at any kind
of limiting beliefs or any kind of serious psychological hang-ups
that you have because those are going to get amplified
in a relationship tenfold it's going to totally blow up
the relationship if for example you have anxiety if you
have anger problems if you have childhood issues if you
have severe irrational you know paranoia obsessive-compulsive disorder - any
kind of neurotic behavior basically when you're with somebody and
you're with them for a long time that neurotic behavior
starts to manifest itself in so many nasty ways that
it it toxify that relationship makes it impossible to have
one so so those are some of the areas in
your life and they're probably more I'm not going to
cover all of them here these are some of the
pillars that you got to cover to maintain a healthy
relationship so this is ultimately my advice to you do
personal development take relationships very seriously and put the burden
of responsibility on yourself it's not luck that's going to
create a good relationship there are no lucky good relationships
it's not going to happen by luck it's not just
going to magically happen and you're not an expert unless
you study this stuff and you really analyze all this
stuff and done a lot of introspection and even if
you have done all that and you yourself have no
personal self control if you're anxious if you're prone to
anger childhood issues you're bad with your finances you have
no other options you're neurotic in all sorts of different
ways man it's it's impossible the best person in the
world Jesus Christ himself if he was resurrected and was
in a relationship with you he could not make it
work all right so you have to realize that realize
that it's so important so this is the the core
fundamental of relationship advice right it's not a little trick
it's not some little technique it's not something you read
in Cosmo magazine this is it this is the deep
wisdom now this also means you have to do a
lot of work right the amount of work that I've
put into understanding the opposite sex is obscene it would
literally disgust you to know everything that I've done to
do it I literally bled for it I've literally invested
hundreds of hours studying I've invested thousands of hours in
the field practicing this stuff doing it and I'm still
not at the level that I feel I need to
be at to maintain a successful relationship so it takes
a lot but you know what if relationships are important
to you if you really value that in your life
if you think that you need love and companionship and
you want that to work out well then then this
is what you got to do then it's worth it
right you're not going to get something of true value
for nothing the things that are really worthwhile in life
you have to put a little bit of effort into
you have to put a little bit of consciousness into
you have to commit to some sort of mastery process
and that's what I'm encouraging you to do with your
relationships all right this is Leo signing off this what
