hey this is Leo for actualised org and right now
in this video we're gonna cover a really important topic
really important topic to living a self actualized charge kind
of life and that is how to live with authentic
self expression to me the more I study personal development
the more I look into what it really takes to
live an exciting amazing huge life the kind of life
that I want for you the kind of life that
I picture for myself is to be getting more and
more into the frame of being able to express your
thoughts self authentically and when you do that the kind
of joy that you get from that but also the
kind of amazing performance that you get and the kind
of creative output that you can have when you're able
to unleash your full creative expression and unblock yourself insightful
yourself stop worrying about what people think of you and
just go out there and unleash and create and the
reason I started actually thinking about this is because I've
been thinking about the this concept of style lately you
know having a certain sense of style and the reason
I was thinking about that is because well I'm shooting
these videos and one of the things I'm doing is
as I'm practicing my public speaking and as I'm practicing
my writing and as I'm as I'm looking at other
people out there other self-help gurus looking at them and
saying you know what are like the best guys in
the industry doing like what is Tony Robbins doing what
does Evan pagon doing what are some of these other
people that I really look up to what are they
doing and how did they do it and one thing
that I noticed as public speakers everyone has a unique
style everyone's a little bit different some people are very
laid-back and casual in their approach and the way they
speak and they speak in short phrases other people are
very long-winded and they can be more more Stern having
a more Stern kind of gravitas so their presence and
they'll speak very slowly they can speak slower I think
I speak pretty fast that's my natural pace of speech
when I get excited and I'm saying something with energy
and I'm engaged with it so I'm looking at all
and I'm looking at different word usage pauses vocal variety
talking loud talking low just even mannerisms things that people
do with their hands how they hold themselves how they
carry themselves how they look around the way they hold
eye contact when I look at all this I can
see the stink styles that each speaker has and each
one of them as I'm looking at them on Oh
mmm I really like the way he does that I
really love style I want to copy down I want
to be like that or then I see no way
where wait there's this other guy who's even better look
at his style his style is like all serious and
people are listening to him he's got a lot of
a lot of power in the way he's communicating or
wait wait wait look at that guy he's all humorous
and light-hearted and people will really resonate with that if
I'm gonna be humorous and light-hearted just like that and
so it's easy to get caught up in that and
the reason I'm using this example is because this example
easily generalizes to life in any domain at work in
your relationship whatever follow along here and pay really close
attention because here's what's happening is that I'm looking at
stuff and I'm seeing something that I appreciate something something
with him within me it's like resonating with that with
that energy that's in that person but on the same
hand what I'm doing is I'm kind of sacrificing my
own values and I'm sacrificing my own my own vision
and I'm subordinating it to this other person in a
sense by idolizing him or by trying to be him
trying to emulate him and putting him on a pedestal
saying look he's got it down just the way I
want and now when you do that when you do
that kind of process all of a sudden what did
you just do you put him up here and you
put yourself down here and they have to climb your
way up and you have to like work to get
to perfection you have to work up and basically become
that person and of course when you're comparing yourself to
the to that person like that what chance do you
really have of being being him you don't the best
that you can be is to be your authentic self
and that's a little bit of a loaded loaded term
to say because some people might interpret that as saying
well my authentic self means that I don't really work
on myself I'm perfect the way I am I just
sit back relax and I'm cool that's not quite what
that means you still have to work on yourself and
if in fact do a lot of work to get
to your authentic self because right now who you are
is not your hood yourself who you are is blocked
up and obscured by all this grime limiting beliefs stuff
from the media people you're idolizing and trying to be
like pressures from the outside imposed on you and basically
what you need to be is you need to be
a force that imposes itself on the world rather than
the other way around so in this case I was
looking at these different figures these are for people and
admiring them and then I caught myself and I said
you know what to be really successful as a speaker
I'm gonna have to grow into my own style and
sure I should be studying these people by no means
am i saying that it's wrong to be studying into
looking at other sources for inspiration or even downright just
copying things from people you know that old adage of
the best artists know how to steal and hide their
sources that's kind of the same thing here it's okay
to take things that are appropriate for you but you
got to make sure that they're appropriate for you and
you're not taking them just because you like them in
that person you know if someone has a style of
speaking that's very humorous and light-hearted and I'm trying and
I'm not humorous and light-hearted but now I all the
sudden envy him and I try to live into that
what I'm doing there maybe that's the right move but
what I could be doing there also is I could
be sacrificing some of my own strengths and so my
own uniqueness of my own mannerisms my own voice my
own natural pace of talking my own sense of humor
that I might have I'm sacrificing and subordinating those and
saying you know what those aren't important those aren't as
cool as those over there and it's literally the same
effect that you get when you're when you're in school
right and you look up to if you're like a
freshman you look up to the seniors because I think
the seniors are cooler and so it's not so important
what you think it's like important what the seniors think
and now you want to like fit in with that
and when you do that you don't end up looking
cool you end up looking stupid and that's in fact
what makes the seniors cool is that they don't care
and they're doing their own thing where you care too
much and you're trying to be like them so you
got to flip that little thing around and you got
to reframe it and understand that you have some authentic
strengths and some authentic way of expressing that you need
to go out there and you need to find you
need to discover it and that's still something that I'm
trying to discover right now I'm trying to discover what
my voice is as a as a speaker and that's
gonna probably take me a year or two to get
that down because I just need to experiment and see
what's working and I can already see a lot of
progress but I need to study more people but at
the same time as I'm doing that I don't need
to be giving away and selling away some of the
strengths that I might have I need to be true
to those so it's a delicate process there's no clear-cut
way to say how this is done the other point
that I want to make here about style is that
really style is an advanced level thing and I carry
this through from from pickup that I've been involved with
for a few years now and there what you what
I learned from pickup is that there are different people
who have different styles of flirting and different ways of
dating different ways of interacting with women and as I
was looking at guys interacting with women in different ways
I was saying that wait hold on like this guy
has a really interesting way of a piano girl in
the club he does it this way and wait a
minute this guy has a totally different way and he
does it in this other way and I interacted with
so many people so many of the best people just
like exceptional people some of the best pickup artists in
the world and I interacted with them and I talked
to them I picked their brains I looked at what
they were doing and I just noticed such a variety
of styles and then I'm kind of like looking at
myself and I'm like well I'm nowhere near any of
their levels and like what's my style should I be
like the cool James Bond type should I be like
the funny flirty dancing clown monkey type should I be
like should I be very sexual and aggressive or should
I be very social and friendly like there's all sorts
of different styles and ways that you can go about
it and what's crazy is that like each one of
those can be very successful if you implement it correctly
but on the other hand you also have to be
kind of true to yourself and to your own personality
and it's tricky to figure that out because when you're
when you're starting off and you're not good at flirting
you're not good at socializing and loud Club environments then
you don't really know how that stuff works and you
don't know what your style should be and that's something
that you also have to go through you have to
kind of go on a journey of figuring that out
that takes a while and what I learned from that
is that style is also an advanced thing when you're
just starting off when you're new and by new I
mean a couple of years in into anything whenever you're
trying to master something so maybe like taking example maybe
you're trying to get good at your career and there's
someone in your career that may be at your office
or someone in the industry that you're in who you're
trying to like kind of emulate copy he's maybe like
a mentor of yours and you really admire him and
you're trying to live up to that image well that's
great that's a great thing to do but you also
have to understand that the style that he has that
you admire right now you are not meant to have
that that's something you develop when you're five years in
ten years and 20 years in that's what's cool is
that people that become masters end up having a style
because they have like quirks of theirs in their personality
that just come through through their mannerisms the subtle ways
that they do things little ways that they adopt the
techniques to their own style and that style comes out
after a very long process where they've done it so
many different ways and they've interacted with so many peoples
they seen and tried on so many different things that
finally they settled into a groove and it's natural for
them they don't feel like they have to impress anybody
anymore because after 20 years who else who do you
have to impress you have no one to impress so
you don't have that you just love doing what you're
doing you're so immersed in it you're in the flow
that really it becomes unconscious and they do it unconsciously
so when a speaker is up there and he's talking
and he's a really good speaker he has all those
mannerisms but those are not forced maybe they were a
long long time ago but now they become completely unconscious
he's totally mastered them and they really dovetail completely with
his personality and so now he has a style that
styles on a four style it's kind of like just
like a natural style that emanates from what he's doing
it's very organic and actually that is what's very magnetic
and attractive about that is when you have a very
organic fluid natural style that seems to mesh with your
with your real personality whether it's in public speaking or
in any kind of other thing that you're mastering whether
relationships or dating or the way that you do your
fitness routine or the way that you're doing things at
work right if you're looking for a style right now
I want you to ask yourself how far in are
you into the mastery process if you're still in the
early phases then don't worry too much about the style
the style will develop itself more or less spontaneously as
you go out there and develop more mastery develop more
proficiency in fact what I would say is go out
there and soak in all the different variety of styles
that are there so hang out with one type of
person at your job then hang out with the totally
opposite of that type of person at your job if
you can find that and see how their Styles compare
try them on for size see what you like about
one style what you might not like about the other
style so there might be pros and cons someone who
speaks very fast as a public speaker there might be
some cons to that because people are not able to
follow on the message but maybe there's also some pros
to that maybe he's delivering the message with a certain
energy so you have to go out there and kind
of see what works for you what works for your
life what works for your psychology what works for your
audience what works for whatever field you're working in and
that's what's really cool and actually really rewarding about the
mastery process and about committing yourself to some sort of
aim and purpose in life is that once you're able
to master something then you are able to express very
authentically very naturally without being self-conscious about it because when
you're in the new early phases of whatever it is
you're trying to learn it's going to be a little
bit forced right so if you're learning a new musical
instrument then maybe you're copying someone you don't have a
flow you don't have a rhythm yet you'll get that
when you become a master that instrument or even for
example with with singing like one thing that I'll do
is I'll be driving in my car and I'll be
I'll be looking and listening to the radio stations and
I'll be hearing a great song and then I'll be
kind of thinking like you know if I was a
musician I wonder what my voice would sound like what
my songs would be like and it's hard for me
to imagine that because I listen to a song and
I'm like oh that's a really awesome song I love
the way that he's singing there I love the like
the way that she's vocalizing that like I don't see
myself having that same kind of voice so how would
I sing that song it would probably not work out
very well and then I start thinking well like could
I get myself to be like that voice could I
get myself to be like that kind of band with
that kind of style and then what I realized is
that it's the wrong way to think about it when
you're a really talented musician or singer you're not really
copying someone directly like that if you are then you're
probably like a B or a C or a d-list
musician you're not like a a rock star because the
rock star has a genuine voice at some point he
had to figure that out but eventually he developed a
genuine self expressive voice and he owns it now even
like the imperfections in it even the quirks sometimes you'll
hear someone sing and their singing is kind of flat
and maybe boring but the fact is that they own
it and that's like the style of the music this
is style of the band they actually make the music
to match that voice and so when you match the
music to the voice you should come out with something
that's unique original authentic and that's really the important thing
that's what makes it interesting that's what makes it attractive
that's what makes it sellable that's what makes it appealing
on a mass scale is that it is something unique
it was something that someone just like poured their soul
into and wasn't looking around to see how they would
be interpreted and that's what we're a lot of times
artists will trip up is that sometimes when an artist
is not secure in where they're coming from then what
they'll do is they'll look around and they'll try to
see you know what's the like what's the hot trend
what's the cool thing how how are you know how
are people singing right now that's that's selling the most
records and maybe I should go and do that but
if you try to do it that way you usually
end up having bad results not only do you have
bad results but you also don't feel the way that
a real rock star feels because a real rock star
besides having all the kind of cliche perks and being
a rock star I think the real benefit and I
mean the real fulfillment in being a rock star is
that you get to go out on stage and just
like express your soul express yourself and just like create
the kind of music that you want to create and
that feels amazing when you're coming from that position so
I want that from you I want that kind of
self-expression from you so figure out what you need to
do to do that start thinking about where you might
be emulating too much and also maybe give yourself some
some some time to develop that style and remember that
style is an advanced level thing and then it will
come naturally if you just explore and are just really
passionate let yourself be passionate and kind of follow your
passions and tastes and own them to a certain extent
don't be totally rigid with them but also don't totally
deny them you got to find you got to find
that balance now that balance cannot be found through a
book through a video you have to go out there
in the real world experiment trial and error and find
it but what I'm trying to tell you here is
that you need to go out there and find it
or give yourself the time and get immersed into something
until you're able to develop it because the fulfillment that
you get from that is going to be amazing and
I think that you have some imagination of what that
feels like because there are been moments in your life
where you were able to solve express whether it's in
a joke that you told or being authentic on a
date that you went on or you know just chatting
with friends wearing something you created at work that just
like really showcased your your vision your values your creative
expression and how good that felt especially when other people
then recognized you for it and say like you know
that's really cool I really liked what you did that's
a really awesome piece of work that you did and
it's like yeah you know I did do that awesome
piece of work and it didn't come from copying someone
else it from like somewhere deep within me that is
an awesome feeling that's what I want for you I
think that's what a charged life is like is when
you have a lot of that feeling very consistently so
take this concept and run with it go and apply
it all right I'm gonna be signing off go ahead
post me some comments I'd like to hear what you
think on this topic as always and then please like
