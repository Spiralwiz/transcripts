            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ojC0HlclnW0' target='_blank'>Using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs To Self-Actualize</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Stunted society due to unfulfilled hierarchy of needs</b>: Leo Gura explains that many people in society don't get beyond the lower levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. As a result, they struggle with gaps in their basic physiological and safety needs. These gaps, which include areas such as employment, resources, relationships, confidence, and esteem, prevent them from ascending higher on the pyramid towards self-actualization and contributing significantly to society. 
</li><li><b>The importance of solidifying the foundation of needs</b>: He underscores the importance of getting the lower levels of the pyramid handled urgently as it lays the foundation for reaching the levels of self-actualization and self-transcendence, providing a richer and more fulfilling life experience. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming challenges in finding a dream career and life purpose</b>: Gura identifies the difficulty that many people have in finding fulfilling employment. He emphasizes the significance of not only securing a job but engaging in a career aligned with one's purpose and passion. Achieving this is critical for a person's ascent up the pyramid.
</li><li><b>Self-transcendence and improving society through success</b> The final point that Gura makes is about the goal of achieving self-transcendence, which is about genuine spiritual enlightenment. He encourages the act of transcending the traditional, ego-centric pursuit for money, security, or success and aiming for real spiritual growth. This crucial step not only ensures a more fulfilled life but also contributes significantly towards nurturing an evolved society.
</li><li><b>Importance of Identifying Personal Gifts and Talents</b>: In the society, many people remain unfulfilled because they haven't discovered their personal gifts and talents, failing to live a passionate life. Consequently, they tend to end up in mediocre jobs, lacking motivation to achieve something substantial.
</li><li><b>Negative Impacts of Not Living a Passionate Life</b>: People just living to avoid discomfort and enjoy luxury aren't able to make valuable contributions or become successful, especially when they're not passionate about their work or haven't mastered any field. Such individuals often struggle to make ends meet and fail to elevate their levels of awareness.
</li><li><b>Low Awareness Levels and Society's Problems</b>: People stuck at lower levels of the hierarchy view the concept of raising one's awareness as lofty and abstract. Less than 1% of population is concerned with this, thereby missing out on highest levels of contribution and fulfillment that are achievable in life, contributing to societal issues.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose and Its Influence</b>: The lack of a life purpose and of living one's passion leads to a mediocre existence. Leo Gura uses an analogy that illustrates the importance of taking care of survival needs before being able to focus on higher aspirations, essentially representing Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
</li><li><b>Redefining Success</b>: Success should be defined as growth and expansion, instead of a cushioned life. High levels of fulfillment come from self-actualization and self-transcendence, achieved through success. It is necessary not just for personal growth but contributes to societal advancement as well, leading to higher levels of self-awareness. People with higher levels of self-awareness contribute to fixing many societal issues.
</li><li><b>Importance of Addressing Hierarchy Deficiencies</b>: Leo emphasizes that in this pivotal moment in human history, it's essential to address areas where one may be stuck on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Whether that is basic survival needs or elements like lack of meaningful relationships or purpose, these deficiencies should be acknowledged and systematically eliminated.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Development</b>: He advises focusing intently on uncovering one's life purpose as a significant step towards self-actualization. This might be the key missing piece in many people's lives and mending it can pave the way for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Utilizing Questions to Identify Problem Areas</b>: Leo proposes two critical questions to help identify and address these obstacles: "Where am I stuck on the hierarchy?" and "What must I do to get myself unstuck once and for all?" This involves generating a list and putting in efforts systematically to work on the largest issue for the next six to twelve months.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Self-Transcendence</b>: The ultimate goal is self-transcendence, going beyond the selfish pursuits and self-created reality. This allows for true fulfillment in life. Self-transcendence should not be ignored or underrated as it provides a purposeful and meaningful existence.
</li><li><b>Suggested Life Prototype</b>: He suggests a prototype for a successful life where one uses their early years to structure and secure the foundational needs and then dedicate the rest of their life to self-transcendence. This method has been advocated for centuries and promises the greatest levels of happiness and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Role of Success</b>: Leo reiterates that material success should be a stepping stone towards self-transcendence rather than the end goal. Material success should not obscure the journey towards self-exploration and self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Course</b>: Leo mentions his life purpose course, designed to help people discover their purpose, understand their talents, and create their dream careers. He encourages the audience to explore the course as it may fill a significant gap in their journey towards self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Resourceful Website</b>: His website, Actualized.org, functions as a resource hub for personal growth strategies, life purpose courses, and staying committed to the journey of self-actualization and self-transcendence. It aims to help people stay motivated and focused on their path towards higher levels of self-awareness and fulfillment. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding Potential Regrets</b>: He warns that most people die without significantly moving up the hierarchy, leading to regret and a sense of unfulfillment. His goal is to help people elevate to the pinnacle of life by aiding in their journey towards self-actualization and self-transcendence.
