hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the benefits of enlightenment
I've released quite a few episodes about enlightenment and I
intend to release more in the future a lot more
because this is a topic that needs to be talked
about in a lot of depth but some people still
don't really understand and they ask me questions like well
hey Leo why you're talking about lightning so much this
stuff seems so abstract and philosophical what practical uses this
have for me in my life and so what I
want to do because I do talk about this topic
a lot is I want to help bring some of
you aboard onto the enlightenment bandwagon and to do that
I need to discuss the benefits of enlightened what I
want to do is I want to give you a
whole list of benefits so that your ego can get
on board and then I'm also going to talk about
how you can use this as a as a master
strategy in your life I'll talk about that at the
end but let's begin at the beginning which is a
little bit of a recap about what enlightenment really is
so that we understand what we're talking about here enlightenment
simply speaking is the realization of your existential nature what
you actually physically or you might say metaphysically what you
actually are now most people assume that they know who
they actually metaphysically are or physically are you're the physical
body or you're the brain or you're the mind or
your neuron activity happening in your head that you live
here inside the skull that when I point at you
and my finger is pointing between your eyes somewhere deep
down in the skull there that I'm pointing at you
and I'm talking to you and that you is the
center of your existence and that you is the one
that's sensing and perceiving everything is conscious of everything is
aware of things and that this you is also deciding
things in your life and it has certain things that
likes and dislikes and then I'm talking to it right
now right now I'm pointing at you I'm speaking to
you you're conscious of my words you understand me it's
your life we're talking about so that thing right there
which you believe is actually you enlightenment tells us is
not you so that's the mistake in your map of
reality your map of reality tells you that that thing
is you when in fact it's no more you than
anything else in your experience this is a very difficult
belief it's a belief that you have it's a very
difficult belief to unwire and if you ever do successfully
unwire it then you experience enlightenment which is a state
of union with all of reality because really what you
are is you're not a human body sitting there listening
to me what you are is you're a field an
empty field of pure awareness which is not localized in
space and is outside of time this field is omnipresent
and it has no physical qualities or dimensions it has
no color or sound or feeling in it which is
why it's very difficult to become cognizant of it because
your mind is the dicta to being cognizant only of
physical phenomena and it's completely identified with the body so
unwire enlightenment now the process of becoming enlightened is a
pretty arduous and involved process I've discussed it in other
episodes I have my spiritual enlightenment intro episode and then
other episodes that tell you how to get enlightened and
other aspects of this journey it's a pretty long journey
and take years to accomplish this so given all the
work that goes into it what are the benefits what's
in it for you so let me talk about some
of the benefits very practically these are things you can
expect and the reason that most people get on the
journey of enlightenment firstly is a massive reduction in your
levels of suffering and I mean suffering here on the
large scale but also on the micro small scale so
we all are sensitive to suffering on a large scale
right if something happens to your family or you lose
your job you're going to suffer if something happens to
your health you're going to suffer if you can't afford
to pay your mortgage you're going to suffer so these
are large scale catastrophes that create a lot of emotional
distress in our lives well the suffering from these things
is completely unnecessary you can eliminate all that suffering that's
the big scale suffering now the small scale suffering is
all the stuff that you're probably not even conscious of
yet this is stuff like even right now as you're
sitting here listening to me you're probably suffering how so
well you're annoyed you're frustrated maybe you don't like a
word I used maybe you don't like some bad language
that I spoke maybe you don't like how I look
maybe you're bored maybe you expected me to say something
else maybe you want me to talk faster or you
want me to talk slower or whatever but you have
a low-level amount of suffering going on and this is
happening not just listening to me but after you're done
listening to me you're gonna go do your thing you're
going to go have lunch you're gonna go take a
shower you're gonna go to work whatever you're gonna do
even go play with your kids and as you're doing
all those things you tell yourself that generally you are
enjoying all those things but actually while you might be
enjoying them on the surface beneath the surface you're actually
suffering through these things have you started to notice this
how much suffering is there in your life this micro-level
suffering what happens is that this micro-level suffering it all
adds up and over the years it toxify is your
psyche and this is what makes people become depressed and
become neurotic and become suicidal even and have serious relationship
problems become abusive become angry become bitter at the world
it's all this kind of stuff so all this adds
up well with enlightenment you can eliminate all this suffering
that normally we would think is impossible to eliminate that
normally we would think is just something that comes with
life it's likely oh isn't all this suffering just a
part of life and the answer is no it's not
it's only a part of the delusion of identifying with
your body in your mind so one benefit is eliminating
all that stuff another benefit is freedom from things like
worry fear and anxiety think about how much energy and
time you spend in worry or in fear or anxiety
about anything in life whether it's your family your relationships
or your business or your health or anything else this
can be eliminated also another benefit is freedom from the
fear of death a lot of people tell me it's
funny to me that they don't fear death this is
completely absurd in fact everything you're doing in your life
is motivated by a fear of death in many cases
so in fact you really do fear death and when
you start getting a little bit older and closer to
death man that fear is going to become very prominent
in your mind and there could be a lot of
regrets and doubts and worry and anxiety and depression that
will come along with it this can be eliminated because
as it turns out if you're not the body or
the mind and what you are is you're this omnipresent
field of awareness then death is a concept that really
no longer makes any sense it literally is just a
story or a belief in your mind as hard as
it is to believe that that's what it is death
is just a belief death only makes sense when you
identify with your body so this can be avoided you
can get freedom from this fear this is a pretty
amazing thing also you can get as another benefit a
permanent end to overthinking think about how much time you
spend over analyzing and overthinking every situation it really robs
you of your ability to be present and just to
enjoy whatever enjoyable thing is happening your overactive mind your
monkey mind is driving you crazy and it's robbing you
of a lot of your energy so you can put
a permanent end to overthinking you can still think when
you need to but when you don't need to which
is most of the time what will happen after enlightenment
is that you'll just sit and be able to enjoy
without thinking any thoughts at all in complete mental silence
how cool is that another benefit you can get is
immunity to heavy emotions so think about some of the
heaviest emotions you've experienced in your life like deep anguish
or deep anger or deep sense of depression or a
deep sense of loneliness these kinds of really heavy emotions
which usually you're completely a slave to and which make
you do all sorts of stupid things in your life
you can become immune to these not in the sense
that you'll never feel any sadness or anger or frustration
after enlightenment you can still feel those things but they
will no longer affect you in the same way that
they do today another benefit is the end of addictive
behaviors and compulsive behaviors so think about all the stuff
you're addicted to both your heart addictions and your soft
emotional addictions those can all be elated all your compulsive
behaviors that you don't know how to stop all the
self sabotaging behaviors and so on all the compulsive behaviors
and relationships with the people all of these can be
eliminated within light another benefit is you can stop worrying
you can put an end to worrying about what people
think of you so think about how much time you
spend obsessing over your self-image you look good are you
nice enough are you friendly enough are you polite enough
all of that that can be eliminated once and for
all you can also put a permanent end to your
striving in life so all the striving which you probably
tell yourself is healthy and good actually which is neurotic
you can put an end to this so I'm talking
about stuff like worrying about do I have enough love
in my life how do I get more love or
I don't have enough money in my life how do
I get more money or I don't have enough power
in my life how do I get more power or
more status and so you spend a lot of your
time obsessing about how to acquire these things or how
to acquire a better self-image how to look better how
to groom your appearance or worrying about your gender role
am i masculine enough of my alpha enough as a
guy or am i feminine enough as a girl all
of these things that you worry about day and night
that keep you awake at night these you can put
an end to permanently you can also eliminate loneliness and
neediness loneliness interesting because loan is a complete hoax complete
illusion of your mind this idea of loneliness and feeling
lonely and a lot of people are so afraid of
being lonely of being left by themselves of being ditched
by their partner or their spouse and then they have
this neediness this neatness for approval for love for whatever
it is that you feel like you need in your
life for compliments or for for status or for respect
from certain people around you or from your family all
of this can be completely eliminated you can be completely
free of any of these kinds of attachments and in
fact to such a degree that these things will look
like a like a joke to you loneliness will look
like a joke neediness will look like a joke because
these things only have power over the ego which is
the thing that you will eliminate with enlightenment you can
also eliminate neuroses so neuroses are all those dysfunctional psychic
patterns that you have like depression anxiety negative thoughts compulsive
thoughts all this kind of stuff I have a whole
episode that talks about a list of over 40 different
neuroses that are very common for people you can eliminate
every single one of those you can also eliminate much
stress from your life think about how much time you
spend stressing over your family situation your relationship over your
business and your career over money and over health and
also over your appearance that's stress over time builds up
and it eats away at you and then as you
get into your 30s and your 40s and your 50s
and your 60s as you're getting older that stress just
wears your psyche down and even wears your body down
to the point where you can actually shave decades off
your life from over stress that can be eliminated imagine
doing all the things that you love to do or
that you presently do but you do them with stress
you can do them now with no stress at all
after enlightenment another benefit is a less need for sleep
and much more physical energy what most people don't recognize
is how much energy our thought processes consume and all
these neurotic patterns that we have most of them are
going on inside our mind we're thinking about it we're
thinking about our depression we're thinking about our anxiety we're
thinking about our lack of money or thinking about our
poor self-image or we're worrying about whether we're masculine or
not masculine enough and this robs us of energy because
the body is actually burning calories doing this kind of
stuff is stressing you out and this stress is not
just mental but then it also connects physic Klee to
your body this is the the mind-body link don't think
that your mind is isolated from your body it's a
connected complicated system so when you remove the stress a
lot of free energy gets released which you can use
for productive work or you can just use to enjoy
your day or you can use to have more hours
in the day because you're not going to need to
sleep as much the reason you're sleeping nine eight hours
a day and you're still not waking up restful is
because you spend most of your time in bed and
outside of bed stressed and worried and that can be
eliminated to the point where an enlightened person might only
need five hours of sleep six hours of sleep four
hours of sleep because they just don't waste that much
energy on all the different inefficient uses that the average
person does the other thing I really love about enlightenment
is that it's really the foundation for real self-actualization work
you haven't even begun to tap into self-actualization until you've
started to question yourself existentially who and what you are
until you discover who and what you are your ability
to do personal development is very very limited most of
your efforts at personal development are very surface level and
shallow most of the things you hear for me you're
not able to implement you're not really able to to
really realize the power of it and you're not even
able to hear some of the more advanced techniques and
concepts that I share with you or that you read
in books or you hear from other people who are
very advanced teachers you can't even begin to comprehend that
stuff until you've had a couple of enlightenment experiences so
for me one of the things that really gets me
excited is that enlightenment is not the end of self-actualization
it's really the beginning enlightenment is whole path it's a
whole journey and it's something that really you get on
and you stay on for the rest of your life
it's not just a one-time event that happens then everything
is perfect and everything is fine it's not that simple
and I'll actually shoot some episodes soon about the different
stages of spiritual awakening because there are stages on this
journey and I'll talk about that and I'll talk about
how it connects with self-actualization work but the the nutshell
of it is here that this is just the beginning
this totally opens you up to transform your life in
whatever ways you want to change your personality in whatever
ways you want to do whatever you want to do
with your career or your relationships it it frees you
up in all these areas or before you were completely
closed down because your identity fundamentally was limiting what you
thought was possible in life your biggest limit is your
identity who you think you are determines what you will
and won't do in your life and enlightenment fundamentally is
the dissolving of that identity another benefit is that you're
going to have a way to deal with chronic pain
now if you're young you probably don't have much chronic
pain so this is a non-issue for you but as
you start to get older into your 30s and 40s
and 50s and 60s chronic pain will start to become
a real nuisance and it can really SAP a lot
of the joy from your life with enlightenment you have
a tool which you can use to deal with chronic
pain and to eliminate a lot of the chronic pain
in your life or the suffering it causes also it
gives you a way to deal with disasters this is
something people don't really think about very much until they
experience a few serious catastrophes in their life but you
know think of a spouse or a loved one dying
or something disastrous happening in your family to your children
maybe think about something disasters happening to your health like
cancer think about something disasters happening to your business like
maybe your business goes bankrupt or the economy uh tanks
and so does your job maybe you get fired so
all these kinds of like major life disasters most of
these disasters usually what they do is they they send
us into a nosedive of depression and anxiety and stress
and it's a real it's a really bad thing with
enlightenment you can learn how to coast through these depression
uh through these disasters a very a very effortlessly and
basically come out unaffected by them and also deal with
them in a much more resourceful way so this is
a huge huge huge thing because if you think you're
just going to coast through life from now until you're
dead with no catastrophes or disasters man you're kidding yourself
you're going to have at least a couple probably half
a dozen if not more in the coming decades and
wouldn't it be great to have a tool that you
can use to deal with those another benefit is that
enlightenment puts you in touch with your body a lot
of us these days are very out of touch with
our body because we live in our heads or very
logical left brain thinkers that's how we're taught in school
and in college and then what this is this puts
us out of touch with our body we can't use
our body naturally anymore our body is tense it's stressed
out it's not being taken care of it develops all
sorts of ailments and you're just not able to experience
the kind of joy that you had in your body
when you were a kid anymore the life the physical
vitality from your body is lost and enlightenment can put
you back in touch with that another benefit is that
you're going to have a longer life and better health
and this is something that I think they've done quite
a lot of studies on nowadays with meditation studies is
that by studying advanced meditators you can see that these
people have a longer life expectancy and they have generally
better health and of course the reason that is because
their mental environment is so much more healthier than the
average neurotic environment the average person has that of course
this through the mind-body link of course this will impact
the the longevity of your body it definitely will and
if you look at very enlightened people you look at
Zen masters some of these people live to be a
hundred years old this is not an accident it's because
what you do with your mind does affect the energy
that goes through your body and the health of your
body another benefit of enlightenment is that enables deep self-acceptance
and deep self-love in levels that would not be possible
unless you unwired your ego so I recently released an
episode called the power of self-acceptance it was a guided
visualization that helped you get in touch with yourself to
love and accept yourself and a lot of people who
did that exercise were really moved by they said that
that was one of the best episodes that they've watched
for me and the reason that is is because self-acceptance
and self-love is such an important thing and most people
really really struggle with it they beat themselves up all
the time they feel guilty they feel ashamed they just
can't accept themselves as they are or whatever happened in
their past well with enlightenment this becomes a non-issue you
can have unconditional complete self-acceptance and self-love if you did
that exercise in that other episode think of how powerful
it would be if you lived your whole life from
that state that's possible another benefit of enlightenment is that
enables true love true unconditional love this is a very
deep topic this love top because deep I'll talk more
about it in future episodes but in a nutshell what
you think of is love right now what you call
love is not love at all you're incapable of true
love so long as you believe that you're a separate
individual entity living in your body so if you can
rid yourself that illusion what happens that you can have
actually unconditional love for all of reality not a needy
love not necessarily a romantic love but a almost like
a divine religious love kind of love that religious people
talk about mystics sages talk about then the reason they
talk about is because that comes from enlightenment that's what
enlightenment gives you it gives you this ability to have
this extraordinary love for everything every being every person you're
including yourself including people you've otherwise would hate and the
environment and any situation that's happening to you in the
present moment you love all of it because the reality
is the only reason you don't love that stuff right
now is because your ego is is crimping the flow
of that love and once that restriction is released then
love just pours out of you in a non needy
in a very powerful way that's even hard to describe
to you also the benefit of enlightenment is that it
enables powerful and authentic relationships you think that what you
have right now is you have relationships with people no
you don't you don't even have a clue what a
real authentic relationship is when you can authentically relate to
another human being and I don't just mean romantically and
sexually although that is included of course as well but
platonically as well friendships family relationships children the way you
relate to your children the weight you relate to your
customers or your boss all of these different human relationships
that we have that our lives are composed of man
if if you want to take your relationships to a
whole new level of depth and of beauty and of
health of healthy functioning because most the relationship you have
are completely dysfunctional in neurotic if you want to make
all those relationships healthy they have to be authentic relationships
and to learn how to authentically relate to another human
being you have to first realize who you are essentially
then you have to realize what the other person is
existentially then you can have an authentic relationship a relationship
that's not based on neediness or manipulation or self agenda
or petty personal concerns or ego or neuroses right without
any of those you can have a real direct authentic
relationship and most people haven't even experienced one of these
and they never will in their whole life because their
ego is preventing that from being possible another benefit is
that you become immune to existential crises midlife crises are
popular nowadays people are having them in their 20s and
their 30s and their 40s and their 50s chances are
you'll probably have multiple midlife crises in your life and
you'll get to this point where you start to wonder
you know what is the point of life and what
does it all mean and is so pointless and you'll
you'll get to this state right this is an existential
crisis and these can be quite quite depressing so you
can get immunity to all this because this exercise will
crisis the only reason it's happening is because the ego
is sensing its own falsehood its own fakeness but once
you dissolve the ego and you see through the thickness
of the ego then no longer are you susceptible to
these kinds of bouts of self-doubt another benefit is that
you will get the deepest possible understanding of reality or
existence or truth that a human being can get so
me personally my whole life have really been driven by
the search for truth and I've tried to search in
books and in college and I've you know I've I've
gone through lots and lots of different theories and philosophies
and Sciences and and everything under the Sun that you
can read and you can study all the knowledge that
there is to find truth but the reality is the
truth is not accessible through knowledge or through logic so
if you really are a lover of truth the way
that I am then you're going to be really excited
by the potential of enlightenment of revealing the truth to
you in a way that's so much more powerful than
reading some theorem in a book or doing some armchair
philosophy about what the meaning of life is you want
to know what the meaning of life is you want
to discover what existence is these things are accessible to
you but only through enlightenment only through direct awareness of
them not through intellectualizing and not through rationalism so that's
a doorway that opens up for you another benefit is
death without regrets so one thing that I'm very conscious
of and you know maybe most people don't think this
far but I do is that I really want to
die in my life with no regrets and I can
already see that I'm regretting decisions that I made in
ways that I've wasted time in my life as you
get older are going to have more and more these
regrets come up even long before you die I'm only
30 I'm already experiencing this so you're going to experience
in your 30s and your 40s in your 50s and
60s all the way up to your deathbed how do
you die with no regrets enlightenment when you're going to
be on your deathbed I guarantee you what's going to
happen is this is it you're no wish you spent
more time being connected to reality itself for a lot
of people the way this gets a translated is just
through being out of nature more just sitting and being
rather than running around like a squirrel on crack doing
stuff that you don't even know why you're doing it
you're doing it for some reason for somebody else because
of some peer pressure or whatever you're not really authentically
living up to your own values and if you were
then what you would realize that you would just be
more instead of doing more and enlightenment exactly gets you
that which is why with enlightenment you can die with
no regrets because you can spend a lot of time
being so much time being that you'll be satisfied with
how much you've been being versus what most people do
is they spend their whole life doing and then on
their deathbed they realize oh my god doing was a
huge mistake I should have been being more another huge
benefit of enlightenment is that it gets you a much
better healthier attitude towards the world society and humanity the
average person's relationship to the world to society humanity is
very dysfunctional and it's uh it's not healthy and in
fact makes the world a worse place and in fact
right now in the 21st century we're facing kind of
a crisis politically and socially environmentally a lot of damage
is being done by unconscious egotistical individuals who are creating
unconscious egotistical companies and government organizations which are ruining the
world so you can turn that around by changing your
own ego another benefit is you're going to be much
more honest and ethical in your dealings with people and
of course this helps to improve the world which i
think is a really important benefit of enlightenment is that
it greatly improves the world you want a way to
really change the world for the better get enlightened that's
the best give you gift you can give to the
world is your own personal enlightenment if every person did
just that the world would be just fine we would
have a lot less problems most of the problems in
the world stem from egos that have run amok and
are unconscious and don't know what they're doing and so
they're ruining their own lives and at the same time
they're ruining the lives of thousands or millions of people
around them and the way we stop that is not
through new laws or a new president or a new
Congress but by you taking control of your own ego
in fact this is important because the world were at
this kind of point in human history where we really
could face a species wide annihilation the way the technology
is developing technology developing much faster than our egos are
able to keep up with and our emotional and psychological
development is so much behind our technological development of species
that it might lead to uh to a complete catastrophe
in the future and if we want to prevent that
then there is no better way no more direct way
than through enlightenment another benefit of enlightenment is that life
can become satisfying for you again think of how life
was for you when you were a child it felt
a lot more alive didn't it you were a lot
more present everything was much more effortless it was easy
it didn't have the kind of grind to it that
it has nowadays everything wasn't so difficult you'd have to
think about everything it just flowed life was a flow
and you were like a leaf flowing in the river
of life and everything was great even when things weren't
that good they were still great even if your family
wasn't rich life was still great and even if you
had some health problem life was still pretty good how
cool would it be to get back to that place
permanently and to live your whole life from that place
that place of being in the zone all the time
that's ultimately what you get with enlightenment is the ability
to be so present that you're always in the zone
no matter what and nothing can unroot that presence this
is what leads to unconditional happiness and unconditional peace of
mind and this is the only way that you can
get it you cannot get this through any material acquisition
or any other form of personal development it will not
work it will not work so long as there is
a sense of separate ego inside of you so those
are some of the benefits quite a long list now
you might say well leo these are awesome benefits in
fact they seem too good to be true what's the
catch there's no way that this is true because I
don't know any people who have achieved any of this
so it sounds like a utopian fantasy here's the reality
is that there actually are people who have achieved all
of this and I'm not just talking about people in
the past like Jesus or Buddha I'm talking about people
right now I've met dozens of people who have realized
all this enlightened people people are very very enlightened people
who spend a lot of time enlightening themselves so what's
the catch well there is a cost and these people
they were wise enough to accept this cost now the
question is will you be wise enough to accept this
cost what's the cost in a sense you could say
it's the greatest cost that there is the cost is
you and your entire way of life so if you
want all of these benefits of enlightenment and most these
benefits you can only get through enlightenment and through new
no other means can you get them what you have
to do is you have to give up your identity
your ego your self so this thing right now that
I'm speaking to that thinks that it's listening to me
that thinks that it's alive this thing this human being
right there you have to give that up I'm not
talking about giving up some part of you some piece
of you I'm talking about giving up all of you
so not just the bad parts of you not just
the parts of you that are unethical and despicable and
kind of prideful and arrogant not just those parts I'm
talking about every part of you even the parts you
like about yourself especially the parts you like about yourself
especially all your precious beliefs about life all the things
you think you hold as true all your favorite lifestyle
choices all the things you love your love for your
family and your career and your business and your love
for money and your love for success all of this
you have to give up and you have to give
up most fundamentally this metaphysical idea that you have that
you are a physical human body and that you live
and are localized as a consciousness inside your skull you
have to give that up that's the cost it's a
pretty big cost for most people what enlightenment will reveal
to you is the following it will grant you all
these benefits but at the same time it will destroy
your identity it will reveal that life is meaningless that
everything you think you know about how the world works
is false that there is no such thing as good
or bad that good and evil are fictions that every
judgement you have about people and situations and yourself is
a fiction it's a lie that there is no value
in anything that there is no one who benefits from
self-improvement work and in fact there isn't a self or
an ego that's going to be improved by all this
work you're doing on improving yourself that this is a
fiction this is like you chasing your tail and alignment
will reveal to you that you don't have control over
life in any capacity whatsoever zero control because there is
no you to have control over anything it's an absolute
surrender a complete surrender to life so those are the
costs in a sense it's dangerous to be talking about
the benefits of enlightenment because there really are no benefits
you see when I talk about the benefits of enlightened
people asked me like well leo you talk about alignment
why should I care about enlightenment what's good what's in
it for me what's in it for me that's to
get the whole thing confused see to ask what's in
it for me is the problem and when I talk
about enlightenment and its benefits and since I'm feeding your
ego because I'm deceiving you into believing that firstly there
are benefits that exist in the real world which of
course there are not and that there is value in
the real world and of course there isn't these things
don't exist these are fictions of your mind and then
even worse secondly is I'm deceiving you into thinking that
there is a you who will be benefited by any
of this stuff there isn't you will not be benefited
by enlightenment but you will be benefited by enlightenment can
you understand that can you read between the lines of
what's being pointed out here the reason I talk about
benefits is because on a practical level it is useful
to talk about these benefits because the fact is that
you've got this ego and this ego is running your
life it's running amok in your life and we need
some way to get leverage on this ego and the
only way to do that is to talk its language
and the ego only understands egoic language and egoic language
is all about me me me me me what can
I get what's in it for me that's all the
ego cares about and understands so to trick the ego
into killing itself we need to tell it what's in
it for it now the ego is going to be
kind of stupid it's not really going to understand the
full scope of what I'm talking about it's going to
think like Oh just kind of kidding Leo just kind
of kidding I'm gonna kill myself I'm not really gonna
kill myself Leo is just kidding and so the ego
will get on board and it'll like all these benefits
and then you know spend a couple of years chasing
after these benefits until it finally realizes that oh he
wasn't kidding but then it'll be too late because the
ego is already going to be past the point of
no return so that's kind of practically how it works
by the way killing the ego you're not actually killing
the ego because the ego doesn't exist it's a fiction
so when we talk about killing the uses and metaphors
is not literally just so you know these benefits that
I told you you could think of them as pseudo
benefits they're not full-fledged benefits because full-fledged benefits implies there's
an ego who will be benefited so hold it more
like a pseudo benefit your life will be extraordinary post
enlightenment but it won't be your life anymore in a
sense but it won't be a problem anymore because there
won't be an ego who will care about this issue
of whether it's your life or it's not your life
you see this goes real deep this goes as deep
as things go now the paradox of all this is
that even though there are these kind of bleak seeming
almost negative nihilistic seeming elements to enlightenment like life is
meaningless and there's no value and there's known to be
benefited and you might say well Leo will then screw
this you know I'll just go and do my ordinary
thing but see nevertheless enlightenment is still the greatest thing
that there is it's the greatest thing you can shoot
for in life because your life only really begins after
you give up yourself life begins after enlightenment what you're
living right now is not life you're living in a
hollow dream a facsimile of life a poor facsimile of
life and you don't even comprehend yet what true life
entails you can't even pretend the beauty of it the
majesty of it the the mystery of it the joy
and the power of it you can't know these things
until you've had a few enlightenment experiences you can't even
imagine it yet so that's the paradox I've met dozens
of enlightened people in my life very very light people
not a single one of them has told me that
they regret becoming enlightened what it's like is imagine that
right now the life that you have whether you think
it's great or you think it's not so great or
you think it's terrible imagine that this life you have
right now that actually what it is is it's it's
a hell you're living in hell and that by waking
up from this you can wake up into heaven and
that what enlightenment is like is this like waking up
from hell you will never ever want to go back
after you've woken up the problem is is that the
ego is so used to living in hell and it's
made Hell its home that it thinks that there's nothing
beyond it and so it never wants to water outside
of Hell to look for anything better and that's the
tragedy of this whole thing is that there's something so
much better right outside the gates of hell but the
gates of hell are guarded by the Guardian which is
your ego and all this me me me me me
what's in it for me talk that is the Guardian
you see the real problem here is that you're too
stupid to understand any of this and I mean this
very seriously you are too stupid to understand this because
there are either is wisdom in you or there's not
and if there's wisdom in you then you see what
I'm talking about something in you the wisdom function in
you into it's that what I'm saying is right and
it will go and take action towards it but see
you're not doing that what you're doing is you're listening
to me and maybe you're liking it if you're not
liking it doesn't matter but the fact is you're you're
stupid because you're not taking any action on this even
if you like what I'm saying and you're on board
and you're nodding your head and you're saying yeah tomorrow
I'm going to go and meditate and I'm going to
go read some books and all this now see this
is um this is still stupidity because the fact is
that you're not actually sitting down to discover your existential
nature you're jerking yourself around and ultimately what's going to
happen is that you're going to forget about all this
and you're going to fall back into your old routines
and nothing's going to happen and the reason I know
about this because if this is a struggle that I
fought now for for years and I'm still in the
midst of of this struggle it's a really serious struggle
and it's simply fueled by stupidity is what it is
it's very poor life strategy about strategic thinking skills recently
in one of my episodes the very foundational episode and
that's very important here because if you're wise if you're
not stupid then what you are realizing right here right
now is that I just gave you the ultimate strategic
intent enlightenment is the ultimate strategic intent this is what
your whole life strategy should be about your entire life
should be this not just a hobby interest a little
activity not just twenty minutes of meditation your entire life
should be this if you're a smart strategist are you
though most people aren't most people are stupid strategist a
stupid strategist thinks that he can just get more by
doing more it's like more success will get me somewhere
that works fine until you really start to study the
psyche and you start to realize that all your success
counts for nothing in the quality of your life department
the quality of your life does not improve with success
that's the lie of materialism is to believe that it
will but this is so counterintuitive and so threatening because
I'm asking you to give up your entire way of
life and your entire way of doing and to substitute
it with a new way of being which is so
foreign and alien to you that the wisdom function is
not able to get any traction in your mind so
the stupidity function is all that's that's really getting traction
so what will happen is that this these will all
just be words just empty words and beliefs and ideas
and some you know you get a little bit of
motivation for I'm telling you here but you're not really
gonna do this are you cuz you're not wise enough
see you just don't have enough wisdom if you had
a little bit more wisdom you could start to do
it but you just don't have enough wisdom like the
stupidity is so strong in you that it completely overshadows
any ounce of wisdom that you have right now as
you're listening to me that's the reality of it the
reality is pretty bleak and this is why the state
of the world is as it is and we're in
sort of a bleak place in life Society is headed
God knows where technology is headed God knows where the
human psyche is headed God knows where and you're on
that journey to hell along with everybody else because that's
the default state of what will happen if you want
something else then you need to kick into high gear
your wisdom function and overpower your stupidity function and to
become really really strategic about what you want out of
your life all right that's it I'm Leo I'm signing
