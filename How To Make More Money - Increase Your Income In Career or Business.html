hey this is Leo for actualised org and I'm doing
another quick self-help segment we're in about ten minutes I'm
going to tell you how to make more money so
this is a fascinating topic to me because I personally
like money who doesn't and I like to make more
of it I'd like to look for strategies for how
to make more money and here I can't cover this
topic deeply enough because this is is a really deep
topic and I have some really advanced level strategies some
long-term strategies that you can put into place but that
requires building up some structures so here I'm going to
give you more more practical more quick to implement type
of ideas I think the biggest idea that you need
to understand to make more money is you need to
start to learn marketing and you need to understand the
principles behind marketing because marketing is all about how to
sell something or convince something of the value of what
you have to offer whether and Martin marketing is much
broader than we initially think it is because marketing will
tell you how to sell yourself to a company how
to sell yourself to an employer how to sell yourself
to a client how to attract more business how to
even you know build up a charity and get attention
to your charity even if it's a non-profit how to
how to attract the opposite sex because that also involves
a prince using the principles of marketing so marketing is
very important and what marketing is going to teach you
if you start learning it is it's going to teach
you that you need to provide value you need to
understand what the other person wants and what is valuable
to the other person because then you can tailor a
proposition that will appeal to them if you're only thinking
about yourself and you're thinking about how to leech value
from your employer and you're thinking about how to leech
the most value from your clients and your customers or
a relationship I hope you're not doing that in a
relationship then what's going to happen is that it's going
to come back to bite you in the ass so
naively it seems like well let's try to leech as
much value and we're going to get the most money
right it doesn't work that way what I find works
much much better and what all the self-help gurus out
there all the people that have come before me who
have studied this stuff I have really made big success
of their lives all come to the consensus that you
need to be providing value what does that mean that
means for example if you're working in a company and
right now you're kind of a mid-level position and like
your salesmen or you're working as an engineer you're working
as an accountant whatever and you want to make more
money than and you want to stay within that same
organization I'm assuming then what you got to do is
you got to provide more value to the company and
you want to provide it in a way where it's
obvious to them so and you want to pride it
in a in a kind of in a context that
they actually want and they need so for example you
might go to your boss you might ask them so
what do you guys like working on next what's the
next big thing and how can I contribute the most
like let's say I really wanted to develop myself and
I wanted to build the skills and I could give
you guys the most value what would that look like
for you guys and if I actually went and made
all those changes would that be worth to you guys
would you be willing to give me a promotion would
what would you be able to give me a pay
bump you know would I get a extra bonus oh
what can I get could I can I get like
a can I get some perks go get some more
vacation time so this is how you do it and
you got to look at where the opportunities are right
within your company like what do they do next what
is going to earn them more money because whatever earns
them more money they can then justify paying you more
because if you can earn your company an extra hundred
thousand dollars a year with what you're doing either the
program that you're writing or the sales that you're making
or the customers you're attracting or the advertising you're putting
out there if that's giving them a hundred thousand dollars
cash and they can see that clearly and they can
link that to your efforts then they can understand that
it's justifiable to pay you some percentage that they can
justify paying you probably as much as half of that
but more likely you're going to get that are going
to give you like ten percent of that or twenty
percent of that it all depends on your situation so
look for value if you're running your own business and
you want to make more money well that's almost easier
what you got to do is you got to go
and ask your clients into your clients and get a
deep understanding of what your clients want what are their
real needs not what do you think they want but
what do they say they really want and then tailor
your services to really provide that to them provide what
they want more of and they're going to pay you
for it appropriately right so go ahead and ask them
most most entrepreneurs and business leaders actually don't have a
very crystal clear understanding of exactly what it is the
clients and their customers want because they never sat down
and went through that process of finding out that can
be a process that requires some work if you do
that then you're going to increase the amount of compensation
you're getting you can increase the amount of money you're
charging other ways to make more money well simply ask
for it that's a simple one have you tried that
how many people have actually asked for more money a
lot of times we have hesitations we feel like we
don't deserve it where we feel like if we ask
something bad is going to happen and we're going to
get rejected or we're gonna get fired or the clients
going to leave us well in a lot of cases
you're under charging for your services or your products whether
you're working on a company or you're running a business
and selling your own services and products you can usually
charge more some a lot of times you can charge
double more and you'll be surprised to find that clients
and customers and employers will pay for it it all
depends kind of on what your positioning is but you
should at least try you know do you go in
and ask for a yearly salary bump you at least
try to do that maybe ask for 10% raise every
year make it make it a habit of doing that
maybe ask for 20% raise the more you ask the
more you you try for it the more likely you
are to get it if you never ask for raises
no one's going to come to you and just hand
you a raise and the same thing with your clients
you know see if you can charge the more raise
your prices by 10% raise your prices by 20% see
what happens you might be surprised at just how much
free money right now you're losing because you're too hesitant
and you're limiting yourself in your mind basically as to
how much you can charge because if your clients are
getting a lot of value from what your offer and
they don't have a lot of other options to go
to and you're not in a super like commodity competitive
business then you can probably charge more for what you're
doing which leads me to the last point which I
think I'll talk about here which is a more fundamental
principle about how to earn more money and whatever it
is that you're doing and that is to position yourself
into a place where you're providing something unique that other
people are not providing the problem with with selling a
commodity like if you're selling gasoline or if you're selling
wheat or if you're selling something like bubblegum is that
this stuff is these markets are so competitive that the
prices are pretty much set and you can't really charge
much more for bubblegum than it costs you can't really
charge much more for gasoline or for wheat than the
market the market price is set it's just like there's
there's an industry price but if you're providing some sort
of unique product it's a pretty unique service something you
have patented some something that you're doing for a company
that nobody else can do then you have some leverage
now all the sudden you could charge more so it
is about creating more leverage in either your business or
in your career in your career the way you create
leverage and B is becoming very very good at it
becoming so good that nobody else is as good as
you and nobody can deliver the same kind of results
and value as you so for example if you're working
for a company as their ad guy advertising guy their
marketing guy then the better you can market the more
tricks and techniques you know the more connections you have
built with other other marketers in the industry and the
more you can leverage them then the more value you're
able to provide because again it's a simple math calculation
if you could provide a million dollars worth of value
to somebody then they're going to be willing to pay
you at least 10% of that it's a your at
least worth 10 percent so if you can provide a
million dollar worth of value they'll give you at least
a hundred thousand maybe more depending on how good you
are negotiating and the same thing with your business right
what are you providing that's unique about your business how
are you setting up your business that you're offering a
unique selling proposition right that old that old hurm unique
selling proposition how is your product so unique that even
if you charge a little bit more for it customers
would still want it that usually means building up a
brand that usually means building up some unique points some
unique features that will keep customers coming to you even
though there are other people out there so maybe your
product quality is exceptionally high maybe your service quality is
exceptionally high whatever that is maybe you're just kind of
amazing branding and you've got you're like the top of
the industry you're like the industry leader in your niche
that will allow you to charge for more money and
any kind of actions that you can use to build
up and elevate any one of those pillars that I
just mentioned will allow you to charge for more money
I think the ultimate strategy here is to make yourself
unique and to do that that means putting in the
hard work and the time that it takes to build
it up so it doesn't matter if you're building up
a brand for your company and you're investing time and
money into building up that brand over let's say a
span of a decade you're building up that brand or
you're doing that with your career and you're building up
yourself as a brand as someone who is an expert
in your own industry whatever industry that is I mean
if you if you're like a florist make yourself a
world-class florist if you're an athlete make yourself a really
world-class athlete if if you're an engineer become a really
talented accomplished engineer with like patents behind you something like
that will make you much more marketable and the final
thing that I'll probably end on is I already mentioned
a little bit of this building up your expertise but
I think building up your expertise but also building up
your renown in your industry so getting a little bit
of Fame and I don't mean like celebrity fame although
that can be lucrative in and of itself but for
most of us it's not about fame it's about building
up a certain Authority and expertise so like I said
within your industry are you well-known do you have articles
published under your name in your industry as an expert
you don't why not are you going to all the
conventions and the industry events are you in touch with
the leaders in your industry are you friends with them
are you acquaintances with them are you in a mastermind
group with them all of those things will raise your
value first you'll learn so much more second of all
you'll have more options you'll have connections it's really powerful
to have connections and it's really powerful to have your
name out there because once you have a little bit
of a reputation even if it's just within your narrow
little niche then what happens is that you're your market
value skyrockets and it doesn't skyrocket proportional to the value
give it skyrockets much more because when people recognize you
think about that if you go into a job interview
and you go in and there's you who has ten
articles published and who has maybe a blog that the
people in this industry follow and then there's the other
guy who's just has a normal vanilla resume and maybe
has 10 or even 20 years of experience but he
doesn't have any sort of any sort of image out
there no no personal brand built up who do you
think they're going to hire and who do you think
they're going to pay more you buy a big big
big margin so go ahead and start building that up
for yourself create a strategy for how you're going to
do this do that for your business do that for
the brand of your business and if you're just a
career a career professional do it for your career super
super important and with career it usually means building up
connections and training getting lots and lots of training lots
lots of practice until you're really really good alright that's
it those are some really excellent ways to build up
your monies or not get rich quick schemes this is
how you can actually get more money in a sustainable
way that is proven to work these are timeless principles
that are guaranteed to work for you if you just
work them so they're a little bit abstract you have
to go out and personalise them to what you're doing
in your life but I think that you're smart enough
