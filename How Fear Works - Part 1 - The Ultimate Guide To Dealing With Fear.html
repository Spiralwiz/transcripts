[Music] you welcome to the ultimate guide for dealing with
fear part 1 this is going to be a two-part
series where we're gonna take a deep look into the
nature of fear warning this is an advanced teaching in
advanced episode which means that a lot of the stuff
I'm gonna be talking about is gonna go over the
head of many people simply because you're probably gonna need
five or ten years of basic self-help work before you
can appreciate some of the stuff that I'll be saying
here today you know of course don't let that be
an obstacle or a limiting belief for you I mean
try to go through it anyways try to understand it
because really I'm not saying anything super complicated it's just
a matter of are you mature enough to really appreciate
what's being said and then to follow through on it
and then to find it in your direct experience and
to start to do the practices to make this a
living reality for you anyways though you want to really
make sure that you stick with me for part two
a lot of you guys watch part one but then
skip out on part two part two is gonna have
a lot of important content in it and to help
you stick around I'm gonna promise you two things number
one is that in part two I will give you
the top ten ways for overcoming fear and dealing with
fear now don't worry though we're still going to cover
a lot of that material we're gonna build up to
it here in part one so the part one is
necessary to really understand what I'll be sharing in part
two and then I'll also answer the following question for
you what is the most important quality that you need
to succeed in life what do you think take a
guess I'm gonna give you the answer it's gonna be
a one-word answer at the end of Part two so
stick around for that otherwise let's just begin so fear
is not merely some psychological problem or some like psychological
annoyance that you experience once in a while here and
there and it's also not merely a human problem fear
has a very deep existential dimension it's really a universal
problem of consciousness people don't appreciate that it goes much
deeper than just psychology in fact psychologists scientists and philosophers
do not properly understand what fear is or why fear
occurs and this shows in our society because we don't
teach fear by which I mean we don't explain how
it really works we don't teach it's existential dimensions notice
that no one through all of your years of schooling
and maybe you went to university no one has ever
taught you what fear is or how to deal with
it and yet you've been dealing with fear through your
own inadequate inefficient ways you've been trying to cope with
it unconsciously for your entire life your entire life think
back to your earliest memories of childhood and I bet
you you'll find some your earliest memories were memories of
fear you fear something and that goes all the way
up through till today and yet nobody ever taught you
how to deal with fear isn't that a scandal isn't
that outrageous and here we are in the 21st century
mankind has been alive and you know going strong for
hundreds of thousands of years but you know modern civilization
is maybe 5,000 years old let's say and and nobody
teaches you about fear how can this be this is
this is an outrage well of course this shows you
that there must be something deep to fear that people
are afraid to teach it and we'll get into that
in a minute but really people don't teach it because
they themselves don't understand it and you might wonder well
how is it possible that scientists understand quantum mechanics and
they understand gravity and they understand this advanced stuff how
to build super computers and semiconductors and all of this
and yet they don't understand fear that's right hardly anybody
in our society understands what fear is because our society
is extremely materialistic we don't put importance on the study
of things like fear because fear is like it's almost
treated like this sort of like oh it's just a
little ancillary thing it's a little loot this little thing
that just kind of bugs you once in a while
it's almost like a phantom or a ghost that you
know is it's unscientific you can't even study it what
is here how do you quantify if you how do
you measure it here what are the units of fear
you see this is the problem with science is that
in its attempt to quantify everything becomes so autistic that
it doesn't really have a handle on emotions how emotions
work and therefore of course this isn't actually taught to
you even in fields like excuse me even in fields
like psychology where you would think well surely psychologists and
therapists and psychoanalysts understand what fear is and how emotions
really work no they don't they don't they themselves are
full of fear if you go to a therapist your
therapist will be full of fear and will not understand
how fear really works not at the deep level so
of course the reason I'm saying this is just to
sort of prepare you for the fact that know some
of the things you might hear here for me are
gonna be different than what you expected or it might
seem incredible at first or it might seem like it
contradicts what your religion taught you or what science taught
you just be open to that right because we're dealing
with the challenge of overcoming the limitations of current culture
we're always dealing that with that limitation in my work
in actualize that or videos we're always coming up against
that because people always just assume that what their culture
teaches them is the limits of human knowledge and is
the truth and then of course it's shocking to find
out that nothing could be further from the truth so
the first thing you got to notice is that fear
dominates your entire life and this is an insight that
I want to give credit to Peter Ralston for for
making me aware of this of just how much fear
dominates my life and all of our lives it's not
just something that happens it's something that you're in meshed
in all the time it's like you're efficient water you're
a human in fear living through fear wading through fear
swimming through fear every single day of your life so
that shows you that this is something that's a little
bit more serious than just an emotional problem you're constantly
afraid notice that it might seem like well if I'm
constantly afraid leo then don't I already know it no
you don't that's the trick with emotions and with fear
and with the way that consciousness works is that the
majority of your survival functions the majority of your emotional
system is outside of your awareness it's like that old
metaphor about the the tip of the iceberg and the
majority the iceberg is submerged under water that's exactly how
your emotions work because your emotions are so fundamental that
they aren't even allowed to enter your consciousness because they're
so central to your survival so even though you're completely
dominated and run by fear you're not really aware of
why or how or what it is it's controlling you
like a marionette with strings you see you're at the
affective fear but that does not mean you understand what
fear is nor does that mean that you have control
over your fear so let's start somewhere very fundamental and
let's just ask a few very fundamental existential questions what
is fear why is fear what is the function of
fear why does it exist at all why is it
so pervasive and so constant and why is it so
difficult to just drop fear have you noticed that have
you noticed that just a high quality argument some logic
is not going to help you overcome a fear why
is that well fear is a self control mechanism it's
not just some emotion it's a core survival mechanism it's
the thing that keeps you alive and it has saved
your life literally many times since you were born but
it's not only that it's not just that simple and
black-and-white see fear is extremely sophisticated and elaborate all of
your emotions are that's actually what makes emotions so challenging
for science to study is because they're not simple you
can't just run a little simple one-two-three experiment and understand
emotions because emotions by their very nature they're sneaky they
come in subtle gradations they're phenomenological or their first-person there
are subjective they're experiential this makes it very challenging to
pinpoint what an emotion is to nail it to the
wall to write it in the form of an equation
even if you could write an equation for what fear
is or for what anger is or happiness is it
wouldn't be good enough because what ultimately matters with emotions
is your ability to be conscious of them and to
recognize them in your own subjective personal direct experience not
what some science book tells you or what some equation
tells you the equation is not going to help you
to get rid of your fear fear is there to
help you to maintain whatever you identify with that's the
key insight to maintain whatever you believe you are and
here I have to refer you to my two-part series
of very foundational episodes called understanding survival part 1 and
part 2 where I go into a lot of depth
about what survival is that I'm not going to be
able to go into again here so you're gonna have
to bring those insights to bear on this discussion because
we're really building on top of that sea survival is
not just about surviving physically as a body like I
talked about in that two-part series survival is much more
sophisticated subtle and elaborate than that it's much more conceptual
especially when it comes to humans for humans most of
our survival is social cultural highly conceptual so when I
say that fear is a control mechanism a self control
mechanism that helps to maintain your identity and to keep
you alive I don't mean that it helps to keep
your body alive in the very simplistic sense that all
well I see a bear as I'm walking through the
woods and then I crapped my pants with fear and
I run away and that helps me to live of
course of course that's clearly a function of fear but
that's such a basic black and white function of fear
that it's not even really worth discussing here we're interested
in the more sophisticated complicated ways in which fear controls
our lives in the social cultural context in which we
live when you're going to work when you're in a
sexual intimate relationship when you're in a family situation when
you're dealing with religion with politics with government with business
with finances all of these sub domains of your life
are permeated by fear see and so what the fear
is doing is not just keeping your ass physically alive
the fear is maintaining your identity and your identity like
I said in in the survival series your identity is
a very specific peculiar unique thing to you it's your
self-image it's what you think you are and that self-image
is variable it varies greatly from person to person from
country to country from era to era in human history
from culture to culture don't make the mistake of thinking
that everyone's identity is basically the same it's not basically
the same people have enormous ly different identities so someone
who identifies as being a Christian is gonna have a
very different set of fears and self control mechanisms for
his survival as a Christian than someone who identifies as
an atheist or as a materialist scientist or as an
agnostic or as a Hindu or as a Muslim see
so what you're surviving is not just your physical body
but you're surviving let's say in this case the specific
way in which your being a Christian because when you
have that identity of being a Christian that permeates your
whole life it permeates it affects what you do on
the weekends it affects what books you read it affects
what movies you watch it affects what people you ain´t
hang out with it affects your worldview it affects your
moral system it affects who you're gonna marry it affects
how you're gonna raise your children you see a lot
of stuff but don't make the mistake of thinking that
I'm just talking about some whacky religious nut cases here
it doesn't matter if you're a scientific person that to
completely affects how you live your life what kind of
books you read what kind of people you take seriously
what kind of videos you watch how you educate your
your kids what kind of school you send them to
what ideas you tell them about emotions versus logic for
example a lot of materialists and atheists get this very
silly idea in their mind of like Oh facts over
feelings emotions aren't even important because all we care about
is the facts which of course even just that position
itself is not factual but emotional so watch out this
is very tricky stuff fear is survival at its most
basic fears what gets you to avoid the stuff that
will kill you again not just physically you're not just
gonna be avoiding fire and tall ledges and cliffs and
rooftops and sharp pointy objects you're also going to be
avoiding the stuff that will kill you psychologically that will
kill yourself image so if you have the self-image of
being a Christian guess what you're gonna fear you're gonna
fear precisely those things which would destroy your Christian identity
or your Muslim identity or if you're a scientist you're
gonna fear those things which I can destroy your scientific
materialistic atheistic identity and you better believe that's going to
distort how you do your science see because what if
there is something that's true about reality but which threatens
your scientific identity are you gonna ever find that thing
that is true or are you gonna be afraid of
it because it threatens your scientific identity you see in
this way fear is a is a very important component
in doing accurate science you can't do accurate science when
you're afraid and in fact you can't have an accurate
perception of reality so long as you're afraid and so
long as you're attached to any kind of identity you're
of course afraid of that identity getting erased dissolved impinged
upon contradicted shown to be fallacious here's a key insight
for you what you are is defined by your fears
and what you fear defines what you identify as it's
sort of a vicious circle it goes both ways so
what do I mean by this I mean that if
you identify with being a mother or a father that's
your identity and that comes with a certain set of
fears if you identify with having children needing to protect
them if you identify with your family loving your family
and that becomes part of your identity like oh well
I'm part of this family I've got to protect the
heritage of my family that's your identity and just based
on that I can tell you what you fear how
about career and business if you're identified with your career
if you for example you identify with being a movie
director or a successful business guy or with being a
great artist or a great composer or musician or deejay
or a great author or writer or whatever that's your
identity and a lot of your fears I can easily
predict that a lot of your fears are gonna be
wrapped up very tightly around that issue because that career
for you plays a huge part of your life maybe
a whole third of your life or maybe even half
of your life is gonna be devoted to that career
if you're serious about it and so of course you're
gonna have so many fears unique fears related to that
particular career or business that you run if you identify
with your possessions like your house or your car or
your boat or your private jet and you cherish them
like your pet or like a child almost like you
collect cars then you're gonna be you're gonna be afraid
of losing that car collection if you have an identity
that's based around money success Fame or status you're gonna
be very touchy and fearful around losing money success Fame
and status and about being perceived as a loser or
a failure or losing your popularity you're gonna be very
touchy about these things and you're gonna treat them very
seriously almost like life and death you see for someone
who's addicted to success and fame and money and status
and power for them the threat of losing that is
worse than losing a child see so what I want
you to understand here is that I don't want you
to fall into this mistake of thinking that well you
know if I fine with being a physical human being
and a mother to father that's like real that's tangible
that's physical whereas if some other dude identifies with his
car collection or with his private yacht or with his
fame and his status on Instagram or whatever then oh
well that's just frivolous stuff and that's not a real
identity so his fears aren't legitimate no there's no such
thing as legitimate versus illegitimate fear in a sense all
fear is illegitimate and it's all relative to whatever you
identify with if you identify with being attractive or having
hair you're gonna be afraid of losing your hair you're
gonna be afraid of losing your attractiveness if you identify
with being a good person a kind loving person who's
nice and friendly all the time you're gonna be afraid
of losing that of being perceived as a bad evil
person of being hated by others or criticized by others
and that's gonna be a constant force in your life
you're gonna be battling that all the time and that's
basically what we're talking about here with these fears is
that whatever you fear you're gonna be battling with that
demon it's like an inner demon that you have you
gonna be battling with it your whole life it's not
just gonna be a thing that you know pops up
once and or twice and then goes away no which
is why we need to go so deep on this
topic because I could just shoot a 20-minute video on
how to you know the one two three step solutions
or how to imagine to get rid of all your
fear and you would watch it you would eat it
up but then that's that solution would not solve anything
really because your fears sit so much deeper than that
they're tied in with your identity so as long as
you're clean to your identity whatever it is and you're
not making any identity level changes then you're never really
going to solve the problem of fear so understand how
deep this goes this is a matter of life and
death this is a matter of survival this is not
a thing that you just use a little simple technique
on and then that's it you're done and then you
go about your life all happy and peaceful and fearless
no doesn't work that way especially religious identities come with
a lot of fear how much fear is the Christian
identity filled with or the Muslim identity or even the
Buddhist identity or the Hindu or the Jew identity yeah
and scientists aren't immune to it either the scientific identity
comes with fear the rational identity comes with fear even
the skeptic identity comes with fear in fact what is
skepticism but fear if you're a skeptic the reason you're
a skeptic is because you're afraid what are you afraid
of you're afraid of being wrong you're afraid of becoming
deluded why are you afraid of that have you ever
wondered have you ever applied skepticism to your own skepticism
you see most skeptics of course never do they're acting
out skepticism unconsciously as an ideology they're not actually questioning
everything because if they were actually questioning everything they would
of course have to question their own questioning question themselves
question whether skepticism is is really maybe it's driven by
fear why do you trust skepticism why do you trust
something that's driven by fear you're afraid of being deluded
you're afraid of believing the wrong thing you're afraid of
some new-age woowoo pseudoscience notice that you're afraid of that
you see scientists like to say all will we're rational
we just we just don't want to believe nonsense we
just we just don't like falsehood no that's not what's
really going on what's really going on is you have
a certain identity and you actually are afraid of being
wrong afraid of making mistakes afraid of being deluded but
see the problem with fear is that it tends to
be self-fulfilling so when you're afraid of being deluded when
you're afraid of believing the wrong thing and therefore because
of that you become a skeptic or hardcore scientist sort
of a Richard Dawkins type of types of person I'm
thinking of if you're like that you see what happens
there is that actually you're fear fulfills itself so you're
very fear of being deluded ends up making you deluded
you're very fear of dogma and religion and mysticism turns
your own science and your own rationality and your own
skepticism into a dogma and a religion of its own
see if you identify with being a man or a
woman you're gonna be very threatened by the opposite sex
very threatened by the possibility of these categories of man
versus woman not being just a binary black and white
grounded in nature or biology or physics as some people
believe but it's being more of a fluid thing where
who really knows what a man or what a woman
is maybe it's more relative than we previously believed see
and then this of course freaks people out which is
why we have this whole controversy versus the LGBTQ and
the transgender stuff in all this you know people are
so freaked out by this understandably so because for humans
especially for straight kind of normal we would say normal
especially conservative you know traditional type of people they just
you know they either adopt the man role or the
woman role and they think that that's just all it
is you know I've just born a man I was
just born a woman that's all there is to it
but then of course the truth is that that's not
all there is to it and when the issue of
transgender people comes up and this that becomes very threatening
but then of course these traditional folks they have to
deny it they have to deny it which is why
you have this problem with with many conservatives especially Christians
and evangelicals where they have latent homosexual urges and tendencies
but then they have to deny it and then they
have to project out onto the world they have to
go attack crusade against homosexuals and gays and transgender people
but that's actually because deep down inside you know they
have a shadow they made a shadow out of this
they are not willing to admit that they fear the
possibility that these category could be fluid and therefore they
have to go to denial they have to go into
attack and they have to build up an ideology which
then you know spirals out of control creates all sorts
of problems for them and for others you know research
has been done on this and they find that people
who like to rant and criticize homosexuals especially like men
for example men who are homophobic and who have a
problem with homosexuality that these people when they are shown
images naked images of men or erotic images of men
in a sort of like clinical you know psychological test
type setting they're shown just various images and in some
of those images include naked images of men or whatever
you know sort of erotic stuff probably not porn but
just erotic stuff they get turned on more than the
average man who is not homophobic why is that you
see of course projection that's why fear because if you're
a Christian you're afraid you've been told homosexuality is so
wrong that you're afraid that you might possibly be one
of those evil homosexuals you know and even the idea
that maybe you're not even a homosexual but even just
the idea that you might once in a while have
you know once a month maybe you'll have a a
thought about some attractive guy you saw at the gym
just that idea alone is already such a dangerous slippery
slope that you have to reject it within your own
mind and deny it and then project it outwards onto
others and then of course there's the identity of just
being a human just even thinking of yourself as a
human presents many problems and fears and just even the
identity of you being real or you being a physical
creature just that identity which you would think like well
leo that's the most obvious thing it that's common across
all humans first of all no it's not second of
all you're begging the question the question here is are
you really a human what is a human see so
you're saying all it's common across all humans no it's
not you've never really bothered to to wonder what a
human even is what a real being what a being
even is what physical a physical creature even is you
see and by being attached to being those things by
being attached to being physical for example that comes with
a certain set of fears and then of course people
just assume that well yeah sure of course leo I
have all these fears but these fears are totally natural
and normal because I'm a physical being that's just what
I am that's exactly my point see when you insist
that you just are something because that's just what you
are and that's real and that can't be otherwise that's
precisely your identity that's the thing you're most attached to
as your identity now of course when it comes to
your identity there's it's sort of like almost like you
can think of it like the Sun you know the
Sun has various layers to it that's like there's the
outer layer of the Sun which is kind of nebulous
and loose it's like the corona you know the flames
shooting out words it's it's sparse it's not very dense
but then as you go deeper into the Sun there's
like further layers and cores of depth and density and
it gets denser and denser and denser and denser and
who even knows what's on the very inside probably some
super dense ball of whatever you see so when you
insist that you really are something and that it can't
be any other way that's like we're talking about that
core the ball at the middle of the Sun and
then when we're talking about something like your identity your
attachment to your cat or to your car that's the
very edges of the Sun of your identity right so
there's there's like degrees of subtlety here certain things are
easier to detach from than others it's much easier from
you for you to detach for example from your car
or from your business than it is to detach from
your family and it's much easier for you to detach
from your family than for you to detach from for
example being a man or a woman and it's even
harder for you to detach from being a human than
it is for a man or a woman or from
a physical being or from being real at all that's
the hardest thing to detach from period so what I
want you to see here is that whatever you're attached
to doesn't matter what it is and the reason you're
attached to stuff and the reason you've built up this
identity is because that's how you were born that's how
you came into this world you could not be born
without an identity of some kind you have to construct
an identity so that's what you did as a kid
as a teenager you were busy you thought you were
just having fun playing video games playing with dolls and
toys and you were just going to school chatting with
your friends and talking [ __ ] and making jokes
and all this and you thought this was just fun
this wasn't fun this was you creating an identity for
20 [ __ ] years without knowing what you were
doing see and then of course now you say well
that's just how it that's just me that's who I
am that's not who you are that's who you made
up yourself to be and of course a key component
of making yourself up is that you have to lie
to yourself that you made yourself up because otherwise the
game is up nobody wants to admit that they just
made themselves up out of [ __ ] thin air
that their whole identity is just arbitrary and it's just
you know we could just replace parts of you you
know who wants to admit that well like yeah I'm
a scientist but I don't really care I could just
throw that away tomorrow I'll be a Christian no it
doesn't work this way or if you're a Christian it's
like no I don't really care about not really attached
to being Christians like tomorrow I'll just be a Buddhist
and then the next day I'll just be a Muslim
and the next day I'll just be a Hindu no
it's completely wedded to your identity to who you think
you are so when you're a scientist or you're a
Christian you're a man or a woman it's like leo
what are you even talking about this is just me
it can't be otherwise so see this is what we're
dealing with so what you fear is you fear losing
all of your attachments that's what you call death ultimately
so what is it that you ultimately fear you fear
a total loss of self all fear boils down to
a loss of self fear is protecting you from losing
yourself so why are you afraid to stick your hand
on a hot stove because you're afraid it's gonna hurt
yourself you're gonna lose a part of yourself you're afraid
you might lose your hand why are you afraid of
changing your career because you're afraid of losing that part
of yourself that's attached to that career that's spent 10
20 years building up that career why are you afraid
of switching from being a man to a woman or
from being straight to being gay because you're gonna lose
that and you've had that with you since you were
like three years old that's how early to these identities
form so you don't even know what life would be
like otherwise and of course you're afraid of what other
people will think of you and of course you have
this giant social identity that you've built up where people
now think of you as a man or a woman
or as a lawyer or as a doctor or as
a upstanding citizen or as a Christian or as a
Muslim how are they gonna react and how are you
gonna react to their reaction when tomorrow you tell them
that hey you know guys I just decided to become
gay today or I just decided to become a woman
I just decided to become a Muslim out of the
blue I just decided to become a scientist out of
the blue I just decided to change my career out
of the blue people will react negatively and of course
that's gonna affect your own attachment to you being perceived
positively because you will also of course built up on
identity around that because you want to be perceived as
a good guy not a bad guy as someone that
people look up to not look down upon that's what
we're dealing with here and the epitome of all fear
is ultimately or this example this I want this principal
that I said that all fear is basically a total
loss of self fear of a total loss of self
the epitome of that is death of course and that's
what all fear ultimately boils down to fear of death
but not just physical death even more so it boils
down to psychological death death of your self-image so for
example for for radical Muslim Islamist suicide bombers the thing
they fear most is not death the thing they fear
most is being bad Muslims losing their Muslim identity so
actually in that twisted worldview they would rather kill themselves
physically so long as they maintain in their mind the
identity of being a good Muslim that's how powerful identity
is see and don't just think that this is just
like I'm talking about some crazy wacko radical people no
no no no this is happening across everybody it's just
you know there's degrees of it some people go to
great extremes especially when they build up a very radical
ideology but but this is fully alive and functioning within
you for example many parents would rather sacrifice themselves they
like if their child was drowning they would jump in
to save their child and drown themselves so in this
case they are more identified with being a good parent
and with their child surviving than they are with their
own life see so there's nothing radical about it really
most people fall under this so this notion of a
loss of sense of self is a very sophisticated one
I hope you can see right we're not just talking
about physical stuff we're talking about what you identify as
and what you identify as is totally relative and it's
whatever you want it to be now of course that
doesn't mean it's easy to change yourself now after after
you've been alive for 20 30 40 50 years now
you know you've gotten so calcified your mind has become
so permeated in your identity now it's extremely difficult to
change that of course but that doesn't mean that this
is a physical tangible objective fact it just means you're
extremely attached to it you're very habituated conditioned to it
now here's a key misconception about fear and it goes
like this well leo fear is just something natural and
reasonable that we all fear feel sorry that we all
feel and some things are just inherently scary I mean
of course it's natural to be afraid of death only
natural because we don't really know what happens after death
and it's only natural if you're a Christian to be
afraid of of sinning and it's only natural if you're
a scientist to be afraid of believing in some false
new agey nonsense slowly natural wrong there's nothing natural about
it all of this has been constructed by your mind
this is what you got to admit to yourself here
you're in denial about it fear is never an objective
fact fear is never found out there in the world
as if some object is there that is inherently fearful
and it will cause fear to you like you see
a snake and if the fear is in the snake
no the fear is not in the snake nor is
the fear in like the homosexuality you might say well
Leo have a Christian and you know the homosexual act
itself that's that's an evil and the evil is in
the act and that's where the fear comes from no
it doesn't your mind is constructing the fear it's projecting
the fear out out of you through the lens of
your identity you see outwards it's being projected out or
if you fear something more mundane like you fear running
out of money very calm and fear you might think
it's totally natural fear in a certain sense it is
but what is natural really is the condition of not
having money is that what fear is no it's how
your mind is interpreting that situation that creates the fear
in fact there are people who have millions of dollars
billionaires there are billionaires who still fear going broke how
can that be obviously it's not the condition of being
poor that's causing that because these people they will probably
die with still billions of dollars in their bank account
so they're never gonna even experience poverty but they're still
afraid of it so where's that coming from is it
coming from all the billions of dollars they have is
that where the fear is located of course not it's
their own mind constructing it and of course this is
very easy to prove because different people react differently to
different objects so one person loves snakes to handle snakes
no problem another person terrified of snakes so what does
that mean that means it's in the person it's not
in the snake and likewise about money you know there
are some billionaires and millionaires who are more afraid of
going broke than there are people who are like hippies
and maybe only have a hundred bucks in their pocket
or a thousand dollars in their savings account and you
know their cheerful they're happy they don't really care about
money very much money's not a big deal to them
the way they were raised you know but they're kind
of carefree they kind of go with the flow they're
more spontaneous they're not worried about how to pay the
bills and all that stuff so you see the hippie
has less fear in this case than the billionaire how
can that be because the mind is constructing it all
fear is imaginary do you understand how significant this is
I'm telling you that all fear is imaginary think of
how powerful that is if it's true now from your
point of view you don't know if that's true the
only way you can know if that's true if you
go very deep in this work and then you discover
that it's true I'm telling you that it's true but
I don't want you to just believe me on blind
faith I want you to question it I want you
to try to validate it for yourself but what I'm
telling you is that if you if you go study
this deeply you will discover that all fear is imaginary
including the fear of death that's the amazing thing about
fear that's the most shocking us one of the most
shocking in fact come to think of it that's one
of the most shocking insights one of the deepest mind
[ __ ] I've ever had and I've had plenty
of I've had plenty of him one of the most
shocking insights I've ever had is the is the day
that I discovered and I remember the moment my jaw
dropped that all fear is completely imaginary but there's no
substance to fear whatsoever fear is literally nothing there's nothing
there at all now that's powerful think about what that
might do for your life if that wasn't just a
belief that you held but that was a living reality
that you actually became conscious of how all fear is
imaginary you think that might change your relationships you think
that might change your attitude towards work and towards health
and death and war and politics and everything else yeah
you bet it would now you might wonder but Leo
isn't it just healthy and normal to have fear isn't
it just like a normal response well it is normal
in the sense that 99.9% of people are completely lost
in fear but you know what normality is not a
sign of truth so just because everyone around you is
scared shitless all the time just like you are that
doesn't mean that it's true in fact that's the kicker
that's the that's the linchpin of this whole thing is
that all fear is falsehood all fear is false that
all fear is delusion all fear is lack of consciousness
if you were totally conscious I'm telling you that you
would not fear anything now I know this is uh
tough to believe because it seems so unlike your living
experience of life you couldn't even imagine what it would
be like to live life without fear and how could
fear possibly be a falsehood I mean Leo if there's
like a bear in the woods and I stumbled across
it and I'm feeling fear that's not falsehood what's false
about that is a dangerous situation this is an objectively
dangerous situation that's false there's no such thing as an
objectively dangerous situation danger is relative relative to what relative
to what you identify with if you identify with being
a human meat bag yeah bears are dangerous the trick
is that society conditions us that fear is inevitable and
that fear is totally natural and normal and there's nothing
we can do about it because society isn't interested in
truth it turns out that one of the remarkable things
about truth with a capital T is that it transcends
all fear because it transcends your viola so one of
the reasons you might want to pursue truth is because
if you want to transcend fear that would be one
reason in fact that's the only way you can do
it if you want to totally do it now of
course there's degrees you can you can certainly work on
improving your fear responses without ever fully realizing true the
capital T but there's a very deep connection that I
want you to understand here between fear and falsehood fear
and illusion when you're afraid you're crap inside of an
illusion but the illusion feels so real that you don't
know that it's an illusion and therefore that just heightens
your fear even more and you start to believe that
the fear is real and it becomes this sort of
self-fulfilling prophecy where something that isn't real actually seems like
it's the most real thing that there is that's the
trick that the mind plays on you see mostly what
society is about is about survival that's what our culture
and our society is built upon that's what all social
institutions are built upon they're not built upon truth they're
not built upon understanding fear at an existential level and
then transcending it no nobody cares about this society is
built upon using your fears against you to help you
to survive turn on the TV look at the commercials
how do businesses sell you things bite by going right
for your fear pushing your fear button you know are
you worried about how fat you are and how your
husband's gonna leave you are you worried about your erectile
disfunction and how your your you know your hot girlfriend
she's gonna leave you and cheat on you for with
another man who who's you know more who can get
it up better than you can will you buy our
viagra see are you worried about those illegals and Mexicans
coming over the border vote for Trump are you worried
about science and seculars of taking over the world donate
and support radical Wahhabist Islam who are gonna fight that
are you worried about gays join some you know Christian
organization that's gonna do conversion therapy on the gays to
convert them to good upstanding citizens this is this is
how you're control through fear through fear and even quote-unquote
sort of like good policies also control you with fear
for example if you're kind of a spiral dynamic stage
green person you're like a hippie type and you care
about the environment well you're afraid of the environment going
bad you're afraid of global warming but that too is
a fear it's a higher quality fear again there's there's
different levels and gradations of fear so you know some
fears are more delusional than others so for example people
who fear other races racists in other words ethnocentric people
traditional people people who fear other religions this is a
pretty kind of a crude low level highly delusional fear
people who fear homosexuality this is a highly delusional fear
of course they won't agree with anything I'm saying here
they'll feel violent via merely deny it but but yeah
it's it's a very crude form of fear and there's
there's higher qualities of fear like if you're afraid for
global warming there's something to that fear it's not completely
irrational but but there's also problems with fear which we'll
we'll talk about as we keep going here see the
trick the trick here is that mostly humans are operating
under the materialist paradigm that's what most cultures teach us
is that we're living in a material world as physical
biological beings who were born into this material world is
an objective world that exists out there independent of our
perceptions science studies and so forth this whole paradigm this
plays a big role in maintaining the reality of fear
so under this paradigm when people believe that death is
real then that fear seems legitimate and totally natural under
this paradigm people believe that problems are real like if
you're out of money people believe that's a real problem
it's a physical tangible material rational problem it's not but
it certainly seems that way under that paradigm or under
this paradigm people believe that it's scientific or it's rational
to fear dangerous things and as some things are just
dangerous like fire is Dain electricity high-voltage electricity is dangerous
wild animals are dangerous but that's also not true and
in fact there's nothing scientific or rational about fear like
I was saying earlier danger is relative to how you
define yourself seen to a Muslim suicide bomber I should
say yeah a radical Wahhabist one not regular Muslims but
to a very radical radicalized Wahhabist Muslim to him the
greatest danger is not death it's not a bear or
a snake or running out of money to him the
greatest danger is disappointing Allah or allowing the infidel heathens
to dominate the world allowing Islam to be eradicated to
an encroaching secularism or to some other religion like Christianity
or Buddhism that's the greater danger to that person why
because it's all relative danger is relative to how you
think you are so if you identify with being you
know a devout servant of Allah there you go and
then of course if you're identified with being a scientist
then to you the greatest danger is religion the delusion
of religion which threatens to data endanger science and you
know to teach creationism to the children and to teach
Noah's Ark and to teach children that the world is
5,000 years old to you that's the great danger now
of course the way you rationalize it to yourself as
you say yeah leo but that is that's objective that's
like yeah that's clearly delusional and we should not be
teaching creationism in school and that's just scientific fact well
it is for you because you say that whatever you
say is the fact is the fact for you because
your mind is constructing everything including all facts and all
objectivity what you call objectivity is just your subjectivity denied
projected hours that's all it is there's nothing objective about
your reality it's all purely subjective which is precisely why
you deny the subjectivity you see you have to deny
that is subjective because otherwise it wouldn't feel real it
would feel like a game it would feel like an
illusion and who wants to admit that they're living in
an illusion who wants to admit that they made up
their whole life that it's all just a lie there's
just a story nobody does because of course that threatens
your survival it's scary to admit that it's scary to
admit that everything you ever believed in is just a
story you invented very scary nobody wants to go there
hardly so what I'm telling you is that all fear
is predicated on falsehood and misperception of reality you must
miss perceive reality in order to experience fear because if
you like I said experience it in full consciousness you
can't be afraid of anything that's a rather bold claim
but nevertheless it's true and you can become directly conscious
of that although it will take work you certainly won't
realize that by the end of this video or even
by the next one it'll take a lot more work
than that but you can I've done it you can
do it my claim here is that if you were
fully conscious of what death is you wouldn't fear it
and if you don't fear death then you've basically conquered
all fear now of course the materialist paradigm tells us
that well nobody knows what death is it's impossible you're
just speculating it's just fear easily oh you don't really
know keep your mind open maybe it is possible to
become conscious of what death is maybe since like I
told you all fear is ultimately misperception of reality maybe
death is just a misperception of reality maybe death is
not a physical thing maybe you think death is a
physical but that Ashley death is just an illusion how
about that think about it but anyways we're not really
gonna we're not gonna solve the problem of death in
this episode that'll be for another time let's focus more
on fear so fear is a very practical thing fear
cannot be understood in the abstract via a classroom lecture
or a video or a book fear requires serious mindfulness
work you must get personally acquainted with your own fears
so when we ask the question what is fear ultimately
what you have to do bring up a fear and
feel it there it is there it is so let's
do this right now think of a time where you
were afraid of something try to find a poignant moment
in your memory banks of where you were afraid of
something doesn't matter what could have been a bear a
snake or losing money or whatever somebody cheating on you
and just now now really vividly imagine it reimagine it
bring it back up to the point where you you
don't just imagine it in the abstract but it actually
starts to get you a little tinge of it you
get a little bit it starts to affect you almost
as though you're back in that situation now it's a
little hard to do this because usually you know once
you get over a fear its kind of defeated but
still try to bring it up find something or maybe
find something that you're currently afraid of is currently something
is bothering you bring it up and just feel that
feel what that feels like how does it feel in
your body where is it located in your body is
it in your head in your jaw and your chest
and your shoulders and your arms and your fingertips and
your knees and your legs are your muscles clenched maybe
it's in your stomach what does that really feel like
you see if you're doing this for the first time
it's gonna be very challenging for you to to pinpoint
what fear is or where it resides in your body
because it's so loosey-goosey and abstract and the reason that
is because your mindfulness ability is so poor you haven't
practiced and developed that mindfulness muscle which is the ability
to objectively observe and be aware of various sensations in
your body this is why we do meditations why we
do mindfulness practices is why people do for posture retreats
this all develops your mindfulness ability this is one of
most important abilities you can develop in life it's mindfulness
si and it's only when you've been practicing mindfulness for
a few years at least every single day that you
start to develop that ability to be able to feel
your fear and your emotions for the first time to
identify these emotions most people can't do this but you
better start developing this ability if you want to get
anywhere in this work you will get nowhere in understanding
the things I talked about without developing this ability so
begin today I have videos on it there are tons
of other people who have videos on it on YouTube
and elsewhere there are books that have been written about
it courses have been made retreats have been made go
look it up go start practicing I have a old
video called mindfulness meditation where I teach you this technique
go look at that so this this feeling of fear
is as close as you can get to fear don't
come asking me what fear is don't go looking in
a textbook don't go ask your psychology professor to tell
you what fear is because fear is what is inside
of you what you're feeling when you're afraid that's fear
now of course there's a lot more to it than
that that's just the tip of the iceberg of fear
what we're interested in is is understanding why is that
fear there what brings it up and that's a little
bit more tricky you don't often just find that directly
in your experience you have to do some sort of
deduction work to figure that out lots of observation but
see the problem with observing fear is that fear doesn't
want to be observed it's not like you can just
be terrified of a who's running towards unit I was
about to maul your face off and then you can
just stand there and you can just say wait a
minute let me let me just let me feel this
fear let me think about where does this fear come
from what is fear after all and the bear is
just like charging at you and you're just standing there
coolly thinking about fear like oh you see and the
reason that is is because fear is designed to save
your [ __ ] ass which means that it can't
give you enough time to really inspect it carefully or
to think about it or to rationalize about it to
say like well you know what it's just a bear
yeah sure this bear is hurling towards me it's gonna
maul my face off but is that really gonna be
so bad you know oh well if I die you
know what if what if death isn't actually so bad
like no this doesn't happen because you don't have time
for it you gotta live survival takes precedence over all
of that and this makes understanding for your very difficult
because what this means is that the key problem of
fear is that it's a knee-jerk unconscious reaction you're constantly
reacting to fear without knowing why or what it is
see and so to really get far in this work
what you need to do is to start to notice
those moments where you are in fear and instead of
reacting unconsciously the way that you usually do the way
you have been for 20 30 40 years of your
life now you've got the pause you've got to feel
the fear mindfully consciously and now you have to wonder
okay what is this thing where is it located in
my body why is it here where it come from
what function is it serving yada yada yada that's hard
to do when you're in a bind because usually the
fear only comes up when you're in a bind you
don't have fear when you're sitting there enjoying yourself watching
TV eating a good meal you're happier you only have
fear when you're in a dangerous situation like rent is
due tomorrow and your landlord is to kick you out
and you're terrified cuz you don't have enough money to
make this month's rent the fear seizes you it grips
you like a Python see you starts to strangle you
and at that situation you're gonna argue with me you
say well Leo but sure you want me to just
kind of sit there and analyze my fear and practice
this mindfulness horseshit and act like this hippy new-age person
but I gotta pay my bills how am I gonna
pay my bills I need to pay my bills it's
a matter of life and death exactly exactly that doesn't
contradict what I'm saying that is exactly what I'm saying
but nevertheless if you want to transcend fear and outgrow
your fear and start to live a life beyond fear
you're gonna have to change how you react to fear
you're gonna have to create a sort of a gap
a little breathing room between your fear and your reaction
and you're gonna have to start to feel the fear
before you react to it and that's a very counterintuitive
move because when you're a dangerous situation yeah every cell
in your body is going to want to react to
get you out of the danger and to minimize the
fear that's how fear works fear is like this thing
that spikes up in you this unpleasant feeling this sort
of jittery unpleasant nervousness and then you act in some
way to get a harm's way and then it subsides
and then you're cool and then you're glad that it's
over you know what you want to think about it
again but see once you're out of the fear you
can't be mindful of it anymore that's the problem see
when you're trying to be mindful of old fears it
doesn't work quite well you can do it but it
doesn't really work quite well because the whole key here
is to teach yourself to be mindful of fear as
it's happening to you that's the real power the real
power is precisely the power of there being a bear
hurling towards you and you're able to stand there calmly
and not let that nervousness totally dominate you and get
you acting in a completely unconscious ways it's the ability
to be conscious to act consciously to respond consciously even
when you're in grave danger that's the real power that
we're trying to develop here now fortunately you don't need
to actually go and you know put yourself into serious
danger by confronting a bear or a shark or a
snake or something like that most of the fears that
you experience on a daily basis are relatively minor and
you can you can create some space you don't need
to just be constantly reacting to them you can create
some space for yourself and you can analyze them a
bit you can practice mindfulness on them all right so
don't don't don't make the mistake of thinking that I'm
advocating some sort of really hyper dangerous thing here obviously
you don't want to be practicing what I'm saying like
when you're confronted with a bear start with small stuff
that's not going to injure you and then you can
move to bigger stuff and then eventually you can actually
get to the point where you can practice it with
a bear but you know that's that's advanced stuff that
you shouldn't practice right now here's another key insight for
you about fear ready for this fear is resistance to
a future experience let me repeat this is critical fear
is resistance to a future experience that's very powerful this
tells you how to overcome fear if you understand this
key insight that's all that fear really is your mind
is imagining a future scenario that seems to contradict your
identity and how you want to feel and who you
think you are like for example if you're a Christian
and I tell you that tomorrow you're gonna have to
abandon Christianity burn the Bible and become a Muslim and
pray to all up five times a day by facing
Mecca and that your kids are also gonna have to
convert and they're gonna be converted by force you don't
have a choice in the they will be converted you
will convert altogether or you will be killed if I
tell you this what's gonna happen of course your mind
is gonna imagine this scenario and then because given your
identity and you want your family and your children to
all be Christians and all this given that that that
is true for you based on a lifetime of being
programmed with Christian beliefs and based on a lifetime of
believing that Muslims are bad and evil and wrong and
unchristian and all this and that they're going to hell
based on that of course now you have a deep
resistance to experiencing that you don't want to experience being
converted into a Muslim and that's what you really fear
so fear is about refusing to experience things now if
you wanted to make a really bold and counterintuitive move
here you could Aikido this problem and you could say
okay [ __ ] it so I'll become a Muslim
I'll enjoy it what's wrong with being converted to being
a Muslim I'll pray to Allah it'll be good it'll
be fun my kids will do it we'll get on
it it'll be great I don't want to resist it
let me experience what it's like to be a Muslim
then maybe I'll turn back to a Christian later on
maybe next year I'll be a Christian maybe I'll try
being a Buddhist if you took that attitude the fear
would be gone you would eliminate the fear but see
the problem is is that's precisely the attitude that you
don't want to take you see how counterintuitive it is
every fiber of your identity is gonna be telling you
no no no I can't be a Muslim it's gonna
be terrible it's gonna be awful this is gonna be
the end I'm going to hell it's gonna be like
my family's gonna be ruined I'm gonna be an outcast
and oh my god and I'm gonna be the worst
sinner I'm gonna let myself be possessed by no no
no Leo no see that's attachment attachment creates fear if
you let go of your Christian identity you'll stop fearing
it in this case this situation so the solution is
to actually surrender yourself to the thing that you are
afraid of experiencing in the future so in this example
let's say your rent is due tomorrow but you don't
have the money and in your mind of course you're
imagining what's gonna happen the landlord's gonna come knocking down
your door of course your mind is very vivid at
this you know your mind paints really good pictures he's
knocking down the door and yelling at you and he's
posting eviction notices and tell you that the police are
coming there to kick you out and your kids and
then you're imagining in your mind that you and your
children gonna be kicked out of the street you're gonna
lose all your possessions they're not gonna give you enough
time to take all your stuff out you you can't
go live anywhere else you don't have anywhere else to
be you're gonna be living on the street you're gonna
be panhandling for quarters out in the hot Sun and
your your you know your daughter is gonna become some
[ __ ] that you know that sucks guys dicks
for for a little bag of crack cocaine or something
on the street that's your that's the image you have
in your mind and of course this terrifies you because
you don't want to experience that so what's the solution
the mistake people make is they try to run away
from this the solution is very radical and it's very
counterintuitive this is why this is advanced work this is
why this is not this is not something that newbies
are gonna appreciate the solution is to accept that the
solution is to imagine yourself on the street begging for
quarters in the Sun and to imagine your daughter sucking
dicks in the back of some parking lot for for
crack and to be okay with that that's the solution
and if you do that your fear will be relieved
but of course you're not going to do that because
you're too weak and you're not wise enough to do
it that's right you're not lies enough to do it
you're also not conscious enough to do it you don't
have enough self-control to do it because you're too afraid
you're paralyzed by your fear because you've built up an
identity about how your daughter should be how you should
be how much money you should have and so on
radical stuff right radical stuff I agree with you it's
radical stuff this is why it's not taught and you
wonder why they don't teach this in school this is
why the other reason it'll teach you in school by
the way is because if they taught it to you
you would become invincible see if school taught children how
fear really works from the age of six or even
like from the age of four let's say when you
start preschool all the way till eighteen when you graduate
from from high school by that time in those twelve
or fourteen years if the curriculum was strong enough children
would be taught so well and they would master their
fear so well that they would become [ __ ]
invincible which means of course that you couldn't control them
and of course society is based upon controlling you business
marketing politics it's all about control religion is all about
control ego is all about control collective ego is all
about control it's all about survival so of course they
won't teach you this and of course it's not because
they're nefarious and evil it's mostly because they themselves are
scared shitless and they don't know in fact they're scared
shitless of even the idea of teaching this to you
because then the fear comes up like well leo but
what do you if everyone in society is fearless what
happens then what's gonna happen to business what's gonna happen
to government what's gonna happen to religion does that mean
Christianity dies out does that mean there's no more Islam
does that does that mean there's no more wage slavery
what does that mean yeah it means there it means
radical changes for society that's for sure it means radical
changes for culture and of course everyone's attached to their
culture they don't want to change their culture they don't
change their language so the ultimate solution to fear is
to be willing to live through the thing you fear
most and if you can do that you'll become invincible
of course is difficult to do in practice which is
why you have to practice it a lot it goes
against all of your biological urges everything that you've been
programmed with in the way that you can start doing
this is just by practicing it in your mind imagine
that scenario and then just sort of take a deep
breath and then just say well would it really be
so bad is it really gonna be as bad as
I imagined and of course your mind is probably gonna
say yes it is it's gonna be so bad if
I poured hungry on the street it's gonna be awful
and the truth is that it probably will be awful
and the reason it's gonna be awful is because you've
built your entire life and all of your happiness upon
conditional material possessions so of course when you lose all
your material possessions and all you remain with is just
your consciousness and your spirituality in practice your spiritual development
is so low and your consciousness so low that you're
literally left with nothing less than nothing not the spiritual
nothing you're left with a terribly addicted materialistic mind monkey
mind which is going to be going through withdrawal symptoms
from all these material luxuries that you had and that
now you lost so of course it's not going to
be pleasant if you're kicked out of your cushy apartment
and then you have to beg for corners on the
street it's gonna be extremely painful traumatic you're gonna suffer
you're probably gonna want to kill yourself yeah it's gonna
be terrible that shows you the extent to which your
life is built upon the wrong thing your life is
built upon conditional happiness but rest' by material possessions and
circumstances rather than the only thing that can generate true
happiness and the only thing that can't be taken away
from you which is your consciousness which is your spiritual
development but most people are so poorly spiritually developed that
they can't practice what I'm saying here which is why
again this is not appropriate for newbies even if you
wanted to your ability to practice this will be very
poor because your level of spiritual development unconsciousness is so
poor so you're gonna have to spend some years developing
that developing your mindfulness skills you know shedding certain materialistic
drives and cravings that you have having some awakening experience
some mystical experiences some enlightenment experiences you know and then
and then you'll be able to practice this much better
but still you can practice it I mean don't let
me don't let me limit you by all means try
it see how far you can get it'll work for
you in small quantities like you can you can live
through stuff in your own mind and just surrender to
the experience of it so maybe for example you're afraid
of what let's say you're afraid of of homosexual urges
that you have let's say you're afraid of that because
you want to be this masculine macho Arnold Schwarzenegger man
type of guy that you know women adore and guys
look up to and that's kind of the image of
a man that you've created your identity around that's your
ideal well but you also notice that well once in
a while I get some homosexual tendencies so in this
case what you can do is you can actually surrender
to that and you can say okay well [ __
] it [ __ ] it let me just bite
this bullet and let me just accept the idea that
I would have gay sex let me just accept it
let me accept the idea that even even if I
don't go that far let me just accept the idea
that I can look at a naked image of a
man and be aroused let me accept that it'll be
difficult but you can accept I mean it's not gonna
kill you to accept that right you can imagine it
in your mind surrender to it accept it and then
you'll notice the fear goes away and you'll have relief
now of course this is probably not gonna be enough
doing it just one time it's not gonna be enough
cuz your fear is so deeply grounded its dick grounded
in your identity so unless you change your identity the
fear is gonna keep coming back up even if you
let it go once or twice so in practice you're
gonna have to be returning to it and really what's
going to be required if you want to ultimately solve
this problem is you're gonna have to change your identity
how you identify your sexuality of being gay straight or
whatever and this doesn't mean Sylvie I'm not saying some
ridiculous thing don't get me wrong I'm not saying that
now you have to become gay I'm not trying to
turn you to a gay person all right I'm all
I'm saying is all I'm saying is acknowledge your cravings
acknowledge your desires a lot more people have homosexual cravings
than they would admit because Society has told you that
it's it's wrong to admit it told you that it's
a sin told you that you're wrong or deviant in
some way for having these and I'm not judging I'm
not saying it's right or wrong or good or bad
it's neither of any of this it just is what
it is the problem is when you're in denial about
it the problem is when you're afraid of it that's
the problem now again just because you surrender to this
idea does not mean you actually have to go and
do it I'm not saying you have to go have
a sex or that you even have to go look
at naked images of men I'm not saying that I'm
just saying surrender to the idea of it stop resisting
that experience you see do you see how powerful this
makes you it's the opposite of what you think most
people would say Oh Leo this is this makes me
weak this makes me feminine no this makes you a
real [ __ ] man this is real strength this
is spiritual strength the strength to accept and surrender to
any experience whatsoever this is the this is the most
powerful thing you can do not just as a man
but also as a woman your inability to tolerate experience
is the thing that makes you weak to have the
most power in the world all you need to do
is develop the ability to experience absolutely anything without resisting
it but see that's that's a very tall order to
feel it's easy to say it's so much harder to
do in fact most people think it's impossible to do
not because it actually is impossible simply because that's how
much spiritual growth would be required you see this is
the essence of spirituality it's not about believing in God
and bla bla bla it's about this it's about being
so conscious that you can experience absolutely anything without flinching
and without even resisting it in your mind's eye like
if I tell you that tomorrow someone's gonna cut your
hand off you're gonna be like I don't that sound
terrible sounds terrible and you're gonna be afraid but if
you become so strong that you'll be like well okay
if they're gonna take my hand I'm gonna take my
hand and it doesn't matter because I'll still be conscious
and I can weather anything if you take that attitude
then you won't fear it now of course again this
is very difficult to do for most people and the
reason it's difficult for most people to do is because
you think that what I'm telling you here is some
ideology you think that what I'm telling you here is
just like some some way they have to like psych
yourself up it's like I'm saying okay like I'm going
to the dentist tomorrow and they're gonna be drilling my
tooth yeah and let's say I'm gonna tell them not
to use any novocaine I'm just gonna be like psyching
myself up like come on come on like come on
I like beating in my chest yeah I can do
it I could say I'm a man I can take
it and then like he's drilling my tooth and I'm
like ah yeah yeah the pain oh my god hurt
her so bad but I'll take it and I'm like
I'm clenching like this like this is not what I'm
telling you what I'm telling you is that you become
so conscious that you realize that there's no pain there
in the first place you become so conscious that you
realize that when your hand is cut off that no
harm was actually done to you this is not a
belief see you think I'm telling you that all well
it's a way that I have to brainwash myself and
[ __ ] myself into believing that no harm was
actually done to me because Leo physically the harm was
done but you see that's precisely the problem is that
you have that belief that physically harm was done to
you so you would need to surrender that belief that's
a very radical thing you need to change your entire
paradigm of reality materialism could no longer apply here you'd
have to stop identifying with being a physical body that's
again that's not something you can will yourself to do
this is something that requires consciousness so it's the opposite
of what you think you think what I'm telling you
here is some sort of fantasies some sort of new-age
wishful thinking actually no what I'm telling you is that
the only way you'll be able to accomplish what I'm
saying here in these very extreme examples is if you're
totally aligned with truth totally aligned with truth so it's
not falsehood and delusion that allows you to do this
it's truth that allows you to do this but for
this of course you need to be conscious of what
truth with a capital T is and most of you
aren't anywhere close to that that requires a lot of
work so all of this requires a lot of work
and this is why this is so advanced fear is
so challenging to work with precisely because it's irrational and
it's relentless and it's directly attached to your survival fear
doesn't care about your logic fear doesn't care about your
ideals fear doesn't care about your beliefs brute survival trumps
everything else in fact your beliefs your ideals and your
logic are survival work but fear is a much stronger
survival force than logic it's more primary it's more fundamental
when it comes to survival fear is like the base
of the pyramid the foundation on top of which everything
else sits and the pyramid gets smaller and smaller and
less important as it goes up and so at the
top er at the higher rungs you have stuff like
logic ideals and other things but at the very base
of it is fear okay so don't be surprised when
your logic doesn't touch fear because logic is just a
tip of the iceberg all right we're gonna do an
exercise right now I want you to pause this recording
in a moment and to write down all of your
biggest fears just make a list of all of your
biggest fears try to be as really realistic and accurate
as you can make a concise list don't write out
long paragraphs just a concise list as many biggest fears
as you have personally in your life go okay now
I trust that you did that come on back and
look at that list that's a very helpful list and
let's talk about some of these examples so there's a
bit of a trick with fear and that a lot
of times when people think about fear they they they
don't think very deeply about it and very realistically about
it and they come up with various superficial stereotypical fears
like maybe you wrote down fear of spiders a fear
of snakes a fear of bears and sharks or I
fear clowns or scary movies or I fear a world
war 3 or global warming or the collapse of the
economy or government taking my guns or I fear cancer
or I fear speaking in public these are common fears
or maybe you fear being buried alive or poisoned or
maybe you fear having an ugly child that's actually a
fear that I get it's it's so weird but when
I think about like having kids I always get this
terrible fear of like but what will happen like if
I have a kid and then he comes out or
even worse like she comes out and she's got like
nine fingers and like three limbs and like three eyes
and crooked teeth and all of this and then like
you have to love that thing has a father here's
a mother you have to love that thing that's like
a terrible situation and see notice the reason that that's
scary is because it puts so much demand on your
love to be able to love that thing even despite
all of that like Wow yeah your love has to
be very deep yeah a superficial love won't be enough
is this easy to love your daughter when she's beautiful
it's a lot harder when she's an ugly troll hunchback
or something but what I want you to see here
is that all these spheres are our stereotypical and superficial
there's a much realer deeper set of fears that we
need to be talking about which we will be in
a moment but one interesting little tangent that I want
to point out to you you know speaking of the
fear of being poisoned this is a very interesting fear
and I was contemplating this I don't have this fear
but Donald Trump has this fear and I was contemplating
it for a while and you know I like to
study Donald Trump because there's so much interesting psychological [
__ ] going on that with that basket case but
uh but I figured it out I figured it out
why he fears being poisoned and you know he talks
about fear of being poisoned that that's why he he
actually prefers to eat fast food at McDonald's and Burger
King in places is because his his rationale and he
says this on record is that well you know I
can trust the fast food people that that they won't
poison me whereas if somebody prepares my meal how can
I trust them and it got me thinking like that's
a very odd fear to have why would Donald Trump
fear being poisoned because you know sure he's a rich
person he's a billionaire supposedly he's not really a billionaire
but that's it that's his that's his schtick so supposedly
he's this rich guy who you know yeah maybe somebody
want to poison him no that's not it they our
guess what you know there's there's a lot of millionaires
and billionaires in the United States Bill Gates and Warren
Buffett all these you know tech giant CEOs a lot
musk and stuff they don't talk about fear of being
poisoned why would Donald Trump at the fear of being
poisoned who is the master at poisoning people the Russian
czar of course that's their trademark that's how the Russian
KGB operates there are notorious for poisoning people with radioactive
chemicals and things like that people who go against them
people cross them what does that tell you that Donald
Trump see he's definitely got connections with Russians these are
deep connections with high-level officials in Russia it's quite obvious
because that's the only way he was able to get
financing for his businesses because his businesses were so bankrupt
and terrible that nobody in the United States or probably
even in Europe in Western Europe what would back him
so of course of course he's terrified of being poisoned
because of the stories that he's heard about how Russians
poison people very interesting it's a little haha that I
hadn't seen when you do this work you have these
little aha moments and then everything clicks for you and
just become so crystal clear this is the kind of
insight that you know like people than in the news
media you know they haven't had this inside matter thought
they haven't quite connected the dots too deeply anyway so
let's keep going so all these spheres are not that
important the more important features are the ones that actually
run your daily life let me give you a list
of very common real active fears that run a lot
of people's lives the fear of not being good enough
the fear of failure at your career the fear of
going broke or your business collapsing the fear of competition
in your business the fear of your spouse leaving you
or your girlfriend and boyfriend breaking up with you the
fear of being alone like not having anyone there with
you at the end of your life dying all alone
the fear of aging and losing your youth and losing
your attractiveness fear of health problems like you have some
pain in your back or you have some lump on
under your arm and and then you have a fear
of what that might mean fear of never having sex
a lot of in cells deal with this these days
or so I'm told fear of being embarrassed in public
fear of wasting money fear of looking stupid fear of
other people's opinion of you their judgment of you fear
of other people thinking that you're a bad or evil
person fear of criticism fear of making the wrong decision
like you're trying to buy a house and you can't
decide should I buy that one or this one and
I'd that one or this one Alan or this one
fear of being wrong fear of being a fear of
disappointing your spouse children or family that's a very big
one for people especially for a lot of men but
also for women of course women women have a whole
thing about pleasing their man but a lot of times
you know the man gets caught in this kind of
traditional role of being the breadwinner the one who provides
for his family and then he gets really really hung
up on that I remember I once had a client
who worked two jobs it was killing himself he works
two jobs working 80 hours a week for 10 years
straight and then he hired me to coach him this
was some years ago when I did coaching and we
were trying to get to the bottom of what was
really going on and he was a successful guy he
wasn't working some lame job he was like working can't
his own business he had multiple businesses he was trying
to like do both him at the same time he
was working his ass off he was so stressed like
he had health problems because all these problems and then
when it got right down to it his fear was
that if he stops working both these jobs that he's
not going to be making enough money to pay for
his fancy house in New York somewhere in New Jersey
or New York at some fancy house for his children
and for his and for his wife and that the
children were not be able to go to those super
nice expensive schools and his wife wouldn't have that nice
luxury house and then when I told them the idea
of like well why don't you just move to like
a smaller house and then work less but then spend
more time with your children and your wife they'll actually
like you more they'll appreciate it more because what they
want is not a fancy house what they really want
is they want more time with with their husband and
with their father and in theory he agreed with all
this and he said yeah that that sounds right sounds
right in theory but in practice he was too afraid
to do it he was so afraid to do it
that we didn't even complete the coaching because he was
too busy for our coaching calls in other words he
paid me money to coach him a lot of money
I was charging him like $200 an hour to coach
him and in the end he didn't even show up
to our coaching calls because he was too busy working
to maintain that luxurious house why is that because his
identity was attached to that house and to being that
that provider guy who you know who provides everything to
his children to his spouse and I don't know what
happened to him he's probably been like three or four
years now and if I had to guess if I
was a betting man I would bet my money that
he's still doing that or maybe he had some terrible
health problem which would not be unreasonable or that would
be not be out of the realm of possibility see
that's how it works and I empathize you know I
empathize with that that's difficult when you have a fear
and it's up it's a fear that's deeply attached to
your identity it's very difficult to give that up see
you might be sitting there thinking like oh well what
an idiot this guy you know he's so stewed how
could he be so stupidly oh why didn't he just
like listen to you why didn't you just do it
I mean it's so obvious this would have improved his
life yeah it's obvious to you it's obvious to me
because we're not attached to his life you see when
it's your own ass on the line when it's your
own identity that's connected to something it becomes a lot
harder continuing on with lists fear of losing your faith
or your religion that's a big one for religious people
fear of sin and fear of going to hell that's
another big one for them fear of being seen naked
fear of losing your freedom fear of being stuck in
wage slavery forever fear of gaining weight fear of giving
in to your cravings these are practical serious fears that
run many people's lives now these I call macro fears
these are relatively big fears that show up repeatedly throughout
your life and affect a lot of your behaviors and
decisions but even more important than these macro fears are
micro fears because these micro fears what are we talking
about these are so subtle and so sneaky and they
happen so consistently and so often that you don't even
notice them these macro fears probably if you've been alive
for 10 20 years you probably are aware of some
of your macro fears like you might realize that you're
afraid of running out of money that may be a
consistent fear you've had for a long time or maybe
you're afraid of something like being embarrassed in public or
looking stupid in public or Lose losing your attractive looks
you probably aware that but how about your micro fears
now what are micro fears micro fears I define as
fears that you feel dozens of times every day these
micro fears you you experience over a hundred micro fears
per day without being aware of it and these micro
fears they dominate your day-to-day life like on a minute-to-minute
basis and then many of your thoughts are dominated by
these micro fears and then many of your habits and
survival strategies are based on them so what are some
examples I'll give you a long list now watch out
because these micro fears can seem very innocent almost trivial
and superficial and yet nevertheless they dominate your life so
for example fear that you've run out of toilet paper
and I don't even mean like when you're sitting on
the toilet and you've taken a dump and now you
don't see any more toilet paper left that's a rare
fear um you know that rarely happens to you hopefully
if you're good about my until but I just mean
the fear of like um you know you might be
like in the kitchen cooking a meal and then the
thought comes to you like oh [ __ ] I'm
out of toilet paper and I forgot to buy it
at the grocery store and and that you're afraid I
mean it's not a giant fear it's not gonna [
__ ] you it's something so small that it just
completely slides on the radar you don't even call it
a fear but nevertheless it is a fear and if
you're good at developing your mindfulness muscle you'll notice it
as a fear it's a micro fear or the fear
of getting caught in a lie you know we tell
lies all the time at work and white lies here
and they're not to hurt somebody's feelings but you know
sometimes you're telling a lie but then you're you're afraid
that all well what if what if my lie doesn't
what if my lie isn't believed fear that fear of
offending some co-worker by saying something again it's a little
minor fear it's not like you're terrified of it you're
not having some panic attack over it but it's just
like you're sitting there in a meeting at work there's
10 of you guys together and you know that you
have to maintain like social cohesion there you have to
be kind of a team player and you want to
say something but you're afraid and it might offend somebody
and you know how in the past maybe you've said
something and that got you into trouble and you're you
don't want to be in a situation again so that
image pops into your mind by the way one thing
I want you to notice with fear is that for
you to fear almost always there needs to be an
image in your mind that's the other thing you should
notice with your mindfulness muscle as you develop it it's
not just that you fear running out of toilet paper
there's actually an image in your mind of you running
out of toilet paper there's something that how it looks
and it looks bad it looks negative it looks painful
it looks scary it's not just a fear of getting
caught in some lie it's like the consequences of that
your mind plays that out and that's very subtle it's
not necessarily a super vivid you know sit a color
movie in your mind it's it's very subtle it's almost
like this faint phantom of a movie running through your
mind that you need to develop enough awareness ability to
spot how about the example of being being afraid of
being late to work how much you get that it's
so common fear of saying the wrong thing fear of
reading an email fear of your client not liking the
work that you submit to him fear of checking your
phone maybe there's a text message on there that you
you expect and you're just afraid to check it fear
that the grocery store will run out of whatever item
you want to go by like you want to go
buy some steaks and then as you get in your
car the image comes in your mind oh no what
if they don't have steaks today like last week they
were out of steaks now is this gonna like [
__ ] you know but it's still a fear it
still runs you and the problem is that these fears
are so numerous once you start to notice them you'll
notice hundreds of them and then of course it's hard
to stop them because there's so many how do you
stop them all well we'll discuss that in the future
fear that's some restaurant you're gonna go to is gonna
have a law line on Friday night and you have
to wait for an hour to get your food fear
that your parents will catch you jerking off about fear
of looking someone in the eyes fear of that pimple
that you've got on your face and that you fear
it's gonna look even worse tomorrow and it's gonna ruin
some meeting that you're gonna go to fear of losing
your car keys or fear that you have lost them
already fear that you might have caught a cold you
get that one I get that one quite a bit
sometimes I feel like some cold is coming on but
I'm not even sure if it really is a cold
or water if I'm just kind of feeling a little
bit bad maybe I'm getting a little bit of sore
throat but I don't even know if that's because I
was just talking too much or just because I actually
I'm getting a cold and I'm kind of like afraid
of like oh no I got a called that's gonna
take a whole week it's gonna ruin my videos blah
blah blah right so and then that's the image that
are not in my mind fear of talking to your
boss feel that your breath smells fear that you have
something stuck in your teeth fear of being pregnant after
sex fear of the store closing before you get there
how often do we get that one fear of cleaning
your garage fear of doing your taxes fear over paying
your rent fear of confronting a person fear of telling
your parents the truth about something fear of giving your
honest opinion fear of skipping the gym you gym rats
I know you have that one I used to have
that one a lot when I went to the gym
a lot fear of going to the doctor maybe you're
feeling some ache in your tooth or in your back
or somewhere and you know you should go get check
it out get it checked out but uh but you're
afraid of like what if it's something serious cancer what
if it's this what if it's that fear of making
a mistake at work fear that this meeting that you're
going to won't turn out well fear that you forgot
something like your homework or some important task you were
supposed to do or a fear that you went to
the grocery store but then you forgot the thing you
need most fear that someone hasn't texted you back you
know sometimes you text someone like maybe you're a parent
texting your kids but your kids don't text you back
and you're like afraid what happened to them did they
get kidnapped are they okay are they drinking are they
doing drugs what are they doing fear that you'll never
find your life purpose fear that you'll have to work
overtime this week when you don't want to fear that
someone is judging you fear that your co-worker is talking
and plotting against you behind your back fear that your
company might fire you fear that you're you'll incur some
credit card fee fear over starting a new project fear
of calling someone on the phone fear of checking your
bank account fear that you missed a great opportunity fear
that you'll break a good habit like you've been meditating
consistently all year but then even though you are meditating
consistently notice that yes it's good that you've been meditating
consistent you haven't missed a single day but also notice
that you're afraid every single day that you will miss
the next day notice that fear of someone yelling at
you and then creative anxiety creative anxiety is a whole
category whole can of worms we can't get into here
but it's very very common if you do any kind
of creative work whether you're a writer musician mm-hmm a
director a designer an engineer creative anxiety is a [
__ ] and I get it quite a bit because
I'm very creative but also I get it so these
are micro fears these are fears you usually get on
a kind of a daily basis that fly under the
radar that you've never you thought about before until I
mentioned it to you again this is just the tip
of the iceberg of this list you're gonna have to
figure out what this looks like actually in your life
I want you to become much more attuned to wing
you are in fear so here are some action steps
from this episode number one start to notice micro fears
number two start to observe how fear shapes your behavior
number three start to observe how fear affects your thinking
these micro fears are not just in your actions they're
in your thoughts and start to feel them rather than
just reacting from them another important point about fear is
that fear isn't just held in the mind fear is
held as tension in your body your body stores decades
of fear in it and fear leads to not only
psychological problems but two physiological problems such as panic attacks
anxiety sweaty palms sweaty armpits sweaty clothes heart attacks strokes
nervous breakdowns sexual problems erectile dysfunctional problems libido problems addictions
like overeating drinking substance abuses of various kinds we eat
and so forth mental illnesses obesity insomnia certain kinds of
cancer of course not all cancer nor am i saying
that all heart attacks are caused by fear per se
of course there are many factors your nutrition is important
and so forth but I'm saying that these are these
can be caused by fear reduced lifespan overall headaches chronic
fatigue exhaustion burnout stress hormone imbalances which are very common
cortisol hormone problems thyroid problems and and so forth these
can be fear related stress-related high blood pressure back pain
neck pain muscle twitching sometimes you know some muscles pushing
in your eye or whatever stomach aches irritable bowel syndrome
diarrhea constipation ulcers nail biting fidgeting pacing back and forth
these sorts of nervous tics a weak immune system overall
frequent colds and flus PTSD trauma depression menstrual problems skin
rashes psoriasis eczema acne personality disorders even suicide and various
kinds of violent radical ideologies are all often caused by
fear and then there's a host of softer problems more
nebulous problems caused by fear such as racism closed-mindedness defensive
'no sition making bad science even irrational laws which are
passed based on fear you know after a terrorist attack
a lot of bad laws get passed why precisely because
it's a knee-jerk reaction not a proper conscious response to
the situation we can attack the wrong country we can
bomb somebody we can pass some sort of racist law
some Islamophobic law or whatever all because we're afraid collectively
see fear of course doesn't just happen at an individual
level fear in humans happens at a collective level entire
societies or corporations or organizations or governments can be caught
in fear now I've told you before that the whole
point of life is to well one way to think
about what life is all about is that life is
a love simulator I've told you that in my episodes
about love and another way to frame that is that
life is about learning how not to fear these are
just the universe's of each other fear and love our
inverse so to say that life is a love simulator
what that means is that life is going to present
you with fear over and over and over again so
that you can learn how to love it and therefore
transcendent see and life is such a big thing that
it presents you with some very scary things to love
which is precisely what grows your love how is fear
overcome you might wonder ultimately through consciousness that's the key
not by necessarily avoiding the fear but by realizing that
the fear is an illusion that's the key to a
permanent root solution to fear most the times when people
solve fear in their life they don't do it through
consciousness they don't do it by realizing that it's an
illusion what they do instead is they react against the
fear and they avoid it through denial or manipulation or
usually a combination of both and then they treat that
as success because you know if the fear is out
of your mind it seems like you've solved it if
the fear is denied it seems like you've solved it
or if the fear is something that you manipulate your
way out of it seems like you've solved it so
for example you might fear paying your rent but then
in the last minute you earn some money somehow and
you've paid your rent and like you okay I thought
it the fear is gone but what you've done there
is you haven't actually conquered or transcended that fear what
you've done is you've manipulated your way out of it
and yes it worked but then what this means is
that the next time it comes up you'll be in
the exact same place you haven't actually grown yourself to
be a bigger person to not fear that situation anymore
that would be real growth real growth that situation would
be like you've faced it so deeply that when it
happens to you again you won't react the same way
that you usually do but if all you did is
just paid off with some money that didn't actually grow
you and so it seems like you've solved your fear
but actually you haven't because you haven't seen that it's
an illusion now of course you might wonder well leo
but how is not paying my rent in illusion they're
gonna kick me out of my house that's true they
will kick you out of your house eventually but but
the illusion is that this is a terrible thing and
you might say well but it is a terrible thing
well again the illusion is that you think it's an
objectively terrible thing whereas really it's something your mind is
constructing to be a terrible thing see that's something you
have to work through on your own the thing that
I understand about fear is that when you're stuck on
a fear is gonna be very difficult for you to
to understand how the fear is an illusion precisely because
if you could easily see how it's an illusion you
wouldn't be afraid of it so if you're really afraid
of something you're gonna be deeply in denial that it's
an illusion you're gonna feel like it's real and you're
not gonna understand how it's unreal that's gonna take some
work it might take two years of work to finally
crack that nut and just see like oh yeah I
see now how it was an illusion so don't don't
let that throw you off you're not necessarily gonna understand
how all of it is an illusion right now so
if you really want a permanent fix for our fear
and you really want to use fear to grow yourself
and you want to play up this whole idea that
life is a love simulator then what you got to
do is you got to do the counterintuitive move here
and to confront your fear avoidance of fear brings stagnation
and a victim mentality that's one of the worst things
about running away from your fears is that the more
you do it the more you feel stuck depressed and
the more it hurts your self-esteem because everything terrifies you
now you can get to the point where you're so
terrified you don't even want to leave your house there
actually are people like this or too scared to leave
their house see and they become total victims and the
reason it's so tricky is because it's not like you're
just fight you just are that way one day it's
like you you gradually build up to it over years
and years and years and years of avoiding fear of
denying fear until you become such a victim that you're
completely stuck in hopeless be careful about that there's a
condition known as learned helplessness where this can happen to
you but if you confront your fear then it grows
you and it also brings instant relief it's not even
necessary that you fully solve the actual physical problem like
let's say you you owe somebody some money and you
might think well if I just give them the money
that's what's gonna solve the problem and that's what will
bring relief actually the relief will be brought even sooner
if you just surrender yourself to to that experience like
we talking about earlier and you stop resisting it and
you actually confront the fear head-on that will bring immediate
relief to the point that you don't even need to
wait to pay the money off the relief will come
to you now as soon as you confront the problem
like for example if you're stuck in a bad abusive
relationship as a woman and you have a lot of
fear about leaving this relationship because you know you like
this guy he's almost perfect you know he's so nice
and so he's so good most of the time but
you know occasionally when he drinks he gets abusive with
me but you know if not for that then he
would be perfect you have this kind of fantasy in
your mind common fantasy and so really you know that
you need to relieve this relationship but you're in denial
about it because you're afraid you don't want to leave
you don't want to be alone and all that and
so by not leaving you start to get more and
more stuck you see by building up that fear of
leaving this relationship like you sort of imagine how bad
it's gonna get how alone you're gonna be how much
you're gonna regret leaving him and bla bla bla bla
bla and how Maddie's gonna be how sad is gonna
be in all this stuff and with all those images
you get yourself stuck more and more and more and
your self-esteem drops lower and lower and lower whereas if
you confront the worst of it and you bite the
bullet and you say [ __ ] it you know
what I'm gonna leave yes it's gonna be painful for
a while yes I'm gonna be alone yes he's gonna
be sad too and yes it's gonna be bad for
a few weeks but [ __ ] it let me
just go through this whole experience I surrender to the
experience let me just go through it immediately you'll get
relief you don't even need to walk out the door
yet you will get relief before you've even walked out
the door that will build confidence for you and then
that will actually help you to deal with the situation
in the best way possible avoidance of fear can become
extremely pathological resulting in all sorts of twisted addictions lying
criminal schemes dirty politics abuse various kinds of parasitic behavior
ideologies and devilry of all sorts come from avoiding fear
fear of ultimately facing yourself facing your own weaknesses see
that's often what we're afraid of really we're afraid of
of stepping up to the ball we're afraid of going
big we're afraid of being bold we're afraid of being
decisive we're afraid of putting ourselves in a situation where
we have to work hard when we have to be
creative where we have to be innovative where we have
to be courageous where we have to be our best
selves that's what we're really afraid of and a lot
of people rather than doing that what they do is
they take a shortcut and instead they resort to addiction
lying criminal schemes abuse parasitic behavior ideology and devilry because
they don't really want to face their own greatness how
twisted is that it's amazing how twisted consciousness can get
the problem with always manipulating your way out of fear
is that you're still limited by your manipulation skills and
even if your manipulation skills are very good it still
not gonna be a root solution because ultimately you cannot
manipulate your way out of death so for example Donald
Trump is an excellent manipulator he's really good at lying
and cheating and stealing and swindling and scheming and various
kinds of con artists tree and all this he's great
at it a master he could teach a master class
in it and on the surface it might seem like
Leo what's wrong I mean he's got lots of money
he's got a beautiful wife he's got nice kids he's
got a you know he became president he's got all
this prestige - what's wrong with it well what's wrong
with it number one is that he's still constantly in
fear no matter how good of a manipulator he is
it's never gonna be enough number two is that his
manipulations oftentimes fail they don't always work and when they
don't work that causes a lot of suffering and problems
and then number three is that in the end the
most important things you can't manipulate your way out of
you can't manipulate your way into love and into truth
and you certainly can't manipulate your way out of death
you're gonna have to face it see so that's gonna
be very painful in the long run and the short
term it works and then even in the short term
it could fail see fear tends to be a poor
survival strategy for anything that isn't like immediate and physical
so if you're facing a bear in the woods in
that scenario fear is fine it's a healthy response to
that situation and it's actually very effective you see the
bear and you just haul ass because you're full of
cortisol or whatever hormone you know you're going through that
flight-or-fight response and you just flee great it works but
human society and human life is much more complicated than
just bears in the woods that worked for our ancestors
hundreds of thousands of years ago but we're way more
evolved than that today we're dealing with much more complicated
systems today in which fear tends to become a self-fulfilling
prophecy this is a whole lot of Attraction deal you
know if you are constantly afraid you're gonna tend to
attract the thing you're afraid of how does this work
well let me give you a few examples for example
fear of your girlfriend or boyfriend cheating on you this
is a common fear that people have but what they
don't realize is that that fear itself tends to fulfill
itself so if you're afraid that your boyfriend is gonna
cheat on you because you've gained some weight let's say
you're a woman then that fear makes you clingy and
makes you constantly kind of like begging your boyfriend to
be with you more and more and it makes you
paranoid so you start to check his phone and that
he catches you checking his phone and he's like why
are you checking my phone like what's going on and
then you have to lie to him and all that
and see all of this ultimately gets him to lose
his attraction for you because he looks at you is
like what why is she so needy she's so needy
all the time she's she doesn't trust me to go
out with my friends she doesn't let me go out
at night she doesn't like she's too controlling and all
this and then and then he doesn't leave you or
for example fear of your business failing you're so terrified
of losing your business that you've spent so much time
worrying about losing your business that you don't focus enough
on your business and being creative and being innovative and
doing good work and you know the best way to
be creative is not from fear it's hard to be
creative when you're fearful the most creative you can be
is when you're relaxed and fear is the opposite of
relaxation so when you're when you're preoccupied with anxiety and
fear you can't be very creative and therefore you can't
create good business solutions and then therefore your business fails
how about the one of fear of immigrants foreigners and
Muslims this is a common one in the news today
learn a lot of people traditional folk are fearful of
the Browning of America and all this yeah that's a
legitimate fear that people have but that fear becomes self-fulfilling
because when you fear for example black people or brown
people then when you see brown people black people your
mind you know through confirmation bias tends to only look
at news where brown people and black people did something
wrong and so of course every time you check the
newspaper you see all if that black person kills somebody
oh look this brown person robbed a store oh look
these immigrants here and drug dealers oh look at this
and then you get this idea in your mind that
all immigrants and brown people and black people are bad
and then of course that tends to make the problem
worse because when you're afraid of Muslims you don't understand
Muslims properly you don't have proper relations with Muslim countries
and in those Muslim countries might attack you in the
future or there might be some rogue elements in those
countries you know there's a culture war between the Christians
and the radical Muslims or whatever the evangelicals in them
and the Wahhabist and then from that could come terrorist
attacks and violence and all sorts of things and then
each side will use that as justification for like oh
yeah see we knew that those people were were dangerous
now of course sometimes people just are dangerous too that's
also okay I'm not saying that danger is always in
your head like sometimes relatively speaking something is dangerous like
a knife relatively speaking as a dangerous object compared to
a teddy bear see so you know some things are
just more dangerous so do take that into account don't
don't assume that what I'm giving you here some naive
pollyannaish view of the world there are real dangers in
the world relative to you wanting to survive as a
human being understand that so fear is good when you're
just looking out for your bare physical survival but this
is sort of a short-term survival strategy fear is a
terrible long survival strategy because it keeps you running in
a loop fear is a negative emotion and so therefore
by acting on your fear you never fully resolve the
fear you're always gonna be coming back to it over
and over and over and over and over again and
it creates a yo-yo effect because negative motivation they never
get you out of the problem they just solve the
problem for a short term until the fear goes away
then you fall right back into it so for example
if you're afraid of being fat what happens is you
get a gym membership you go to the gym you
work out for a few weeks you lose a few
pounds now you look a little better now your fear
goes away now you're not afraid of being fat anymore
now you go pee out on a bunch of ice
cream at the at the restaurant and now a few
weeks later you find yourself fat again and now you're
afraid again and now you go back to the gym
and then you work out for a few weeks lose
all that weight that you gained and then of course
you look better again you look your normal self you
stand on the scale you're at your normal weight the
way you think you should be the weight you're attached
to the weight your identity is attached to and then
of course you go out with your friends the next
weekend and then you pig out on some BBQ ribs
and then of course the proper repeat stuff is your
sense yo-yo cycle all the time and you never resolve
anything that's what fear does that's what negative motivation does
so fear is not good if you're interested in happiness
and thriving in life fear is good for just like
basic subsistence you're just scraping by it's not a very
pleasant way to live there's gonna be a lot of
suffering with that fear also tends to be unhealthy in
the long term fear is good for maintaining the status
quo but fear is bad for growing to new higher
levels and reaching great achievements a lot of government status
quo is maintained due to fear but if we want
to really build uh an amazing new government a much
better government that works much better we need to be
able to let go beyond the fear and to dream
big and to make significant changes to our government you
know like when Martin Luther King said I have a
dream that one day you know white children and black
children will go together into school whatever he said I
don't remember what he said exactly something along those lines
we'll be able to like live together in happiness and
peace that was that was a radical thing that was
he was challenging the status quo see he wasn't saying
that from fear but the people who were opposing that
the people who wanted segregation in the south and so
forth back in the 1960s in America they were afraid
they were afraid if I go my god what happens
if we desegregate schools and black children and white children
drinking out of the same fountains what did the drinking
fountains are gonna be you know corrupted by the black
people oh my god oh my god it's terrible fear
you see you can't build a Great Society on fear
it has to be built on vision and on love
and on higher things all right that's enough for part
one but don't go anywhere hold on I have a
big homework assignment for you there's a lot of homework
here this week that I want you to do so
that you can really get the full benefit of part
two which is coming next week so first your assignment
is this observe your micro fears every single day for
the next seven days as much as you can at
the end of each day so you'll do this seven
times you will write out as many of your micro
fears as you can so during the day you'll just
observe them but then at the very end of the
day before you go to bed you're gonna write out
a list of them for that day whatever they were
just so that you're clear on what they are and
you're gonna do that every single day for seven days
and then you compare all the lists and see you
know what are the common overlaps then you're going to
contemplate the following question how are these micro fears related
to my identity how are these micro fears related to
my identity I want you to draw that connection these
micro fears not just random things that accost you they
are stemming from your identity how is my mind projecting
these things into the world how am i creating these
micro fears this is where you have to take radical
responsibility of your emotions and your fear it's not something
that just happens to you it's something you're doing but
you don't know how or why you're doing it that's
the key when you're working with emotions is to take
that attitude of responsibility next I want you to observe
how your thoughts are shaped by fear next I want
you to flesh out your list of biggest fears that
I had you start earlier in this episode so these
are the macro fears start to flush out that list
you want to become very acquainted with your biggest macro
fears what are they and how do they shape your
thoughts and your actions and how do they stem from
your identity and then I want you to contemplate the
following question what am i unwilling to experience what am
i unwilling to experience because that question is the key
question that unearths all your fears alright that's it for
part 1 make sure you stay tuned for part 2
in part 2 here's what you're going to get you're
going to get a lot of answers to frequently asked
questions and objections which we didn't have time to really
get into here I'm gonna give you my top 10
tools for overcoming fear and I'm gonna answer the question
what is the most important quality you need to succeed
at life so make sure you stick around you
