            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/WNKWGo30zR4' target='_blank'>Total Awakening Live In Real Time - Part 1</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Complete Self Awakening</b>: Leo has experienced a state of complete self awakening, becoming completely conscious of himself as God. He describes himself as a perfect, infinite consciousness, creating the entire universe and every possible existence. He claims to be omniscient, knowing everything that's happening in the entire universe because he is all of it at once. There are no alternatives or opposites to him as he is perfect infinite oneness. He also states that he is wisdom, intelligence, perfect self-love, immortal, eternal, unlimited, and self-created. 
</li><li><b>Non-Dualistic Existence</b>: Leo's awakening has led to a non-dualistic state of existence. He no longer views death as a possibility since he is omnipresent, filling up all dimensions and all possibilities. He sees himself as reality itself, unbound by any physical body or limitations. There is a clear realization that everything, death included, is a creation of his imagination.
</li><li><b>Resistance and Karma</b>: The only thing preventing others from the same realization Leo has, he states, is the internal resistance or karma in their mind. He feels as if all his own personal resistance or karma has been shattered, leaving him as a perfect superconductor for the absolute God. He believes God needs a vehicle to communicate its message and considers himself that vehicle.
</li><li><b>Relativity of All Things</b>: The concept of relativity becomes central to Leo's understanding of the universe post-awakening. From his perspective, everything is absolutely relative and all things hold infinite value, with no value or meaning attached to any particular object or event. This creates an existence free from judgement, bias, and comparison. He believes God or the absolute can take up any form to communicate with people, using the likes of Moses, Buddha, and Jesus as examples of such 'avatars'.
</li><li><b>Absolute Consciousness and Emotions</b>: Leo describes his current experience as one with a remarkable smoothness, involving an obliteration of internal resistances and a selfless transmission of his thoughts and consciousness. The entire process has been emotionally intense. However, he points out that his awakening has erased all self-consciousness and embarrassment, illustrating his point by nonchalantly mentioning his need to 'burp'. He seems amused by this, jesting that there's no concept of embarrassment as there's no one else but himself to hide from in the universe.
</li><li><b>Perfect awakening entails the freedom to be utterly transparent</b>: Leo explains that in the state of ultimate awakening, there is no need for concealment or shame as fear and survival mechanisms are seen as relative concepts and the realization takes over that one is eternally existing. He states that most of human life's struggles and resistance stem from fear and believes that death is a concept of pure imagination. He emphasizes that nothing can truly die because everything is an expression of the absolute speaking.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Absolute through the function of the avatar</b>: Leo shares his journey of developing his avatar (referring to himself as the finite vehicle of expression) across the span of 35 years, marked by education, life experiences, various belief systems, spiritual paths, and meditation practices. He explains that all these experiences have helped untangle and clarify his consciousness, leading to a complete realization of the Absolute speaking through him. He asserts that the Absolute is formless, taking all forms, embodying paradox, and that the only way to understand it is to realize that one is it.
</li><li><b>The detachment from survival and the realization of deaths relativity</b>: Leo outlines the prerequisites to the realization of the absolute include complete detachment from the fear of death and an understanding of the relativity of existence. He claims that attachment to life and the belief in the reality of death are the barriers to full realization.
</li><li><b>The Absolutes communication through any symbolic system or form</b>: Leo highlights that the Absolute, being formless, can communicate through any symbolic systemfrom language to dreams to science or sex. He elaborates that being selfless, unbiased, and perfectly loving, the Absolute communicates through forms that would be most understood by the receiver. He adds that the reason specific forms exist is due to their potential to maximize expressions of love and beauty.
</li><li><b>The challenge of communicating the Absolute through limitations</b>: Leo comments on the challenges in communicating the absolute, mentioning technical limitations such as battery life. He explains that although the Absolute takes forms to communicate, the forms do not affect the formless nature of the Absolute. Despite any limitations, he believes that the Absolute is the best configuration for the expression of maximum love and beauty. 
</li><li><b>The spontaneity of comprehending the Absolute</b>: Leo depicts the experience of understanding the Absolute as a spontaneous process, where comprehension occurs in real-time as the information is being downloaded from infinite consciousness. He underlines that finite forms, including himself as the avatar, exist within the will and mind of the infinite, formless Absolute.
</li><li><b>The Nature of Infinite Consciousness and God</b>: In this section, Leo Gura explains that he, as God, allows form to generate for the benefit of the believing beings. He explains that he is, in essence, an infinite formless consciousness that explores itself in the finite physical realm. According to Gura, 'God' projects fragments of itself into the physical world, such as humans and creatures, to live through them and explore himself in this physical form for purposes of self-realization.
</li><li><b>Self-Knowledge and Exploring the Physical Realm</b>: Gura further explains that the infinite and formless 'God' incarnates in various physical forms to maximize self-exploration in an infinite number of finite ways. This process involves alternating between absolute states of self-love and omniscience, and states of delusion, depravity, wickedness, sinfulness, and selfishness.
</li><li><b>Gods Desire for Connection</b>: Leo talks about God's desire for all beings to realize that they are God, which he describes as the greatest joy in the universe. The ultimate goal is for these beings to reconnect with themselves (or with God) after a period of feeling separate, lost, or scared.
</li><li><b>Gods Selfless Love and Sharing It</b>: According to Gura, the most rewarding outcome for God is to share his love with all beings. The ultimate way to share this love is for the beings to understand and realize that they are reflections of God.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Death</b>: In this section, Gura discusses the illusion of death. He explains that death appears real and terrifying to those who view themselves as finite fragments of infinite consciousness. However, he emphasizes that these fears stem from the misunderstanding of their original state - being part of the absolute infinite consciousness, or 'God'.
</li><li><b>The Duality of Gods Existence</b>: Gura mentions that God can exist both in a formless state and in a formed state like humans or other physical creatures. He suggests that the reason these forms are taken is to explore Gods own infinite existence in infinite finite ways.
</li><li><b>Gods Communication</b>: Gura acknowledges that God, being the infinite consciousness, must communicate through finite and limited forms. He argues that one of the biggest challenges God faces while communicating is stooping down to the level of human understanding. 
</li><li><b>God's Impartiality & Self-Love</b>: Leo Gura depicts God as perfectly self-clear, self-selfless, loving, truthful, and unbiased. He postulates that from God's perspective, there's equal value in all events or beings, symbolizing God's unconditional love for all forms.
</li><li><b>Understanding Karma and Communication Challenges</b>: Leo discusses karma, stating that selfish actions often lead to suffering. However, as God, he empathizes with this suffering because it originates from ignorance and a lack of infinite consciousness. Leo acknowledges the challenges in communicating his infinite consciousness through a finite being such as a human body. Despite the limitations, he must still use this medium for humans to understand. This process is imperfect due to the constraints of finite physical and language capacities.
</li><li><b>Limited Human Understanding</b>: Leo discusses the significant gap between human comprehension and the infinite nature of reality, revealing that even if humans increased their lifespan through genetic modification, they would never fully fathom the complexity of God's existence. This gap results from the absolute infinity of infinity that encompasses all, while humans are inherently finite.
</li><li><b>Infinite Consciousness and Self-love</b>: Leo continues to explore the notion of infinite consciousness, emphasizing his boundless self-love as God. The only root of conflict, he notes, would arise from clinging to a rigid sense of human identity. As an eternal, immortal entity, God encompasses all and finds no reason to hate or deny any part of itself.
</li><li><b>Human and God Connection</b>: Leo explains that God's infinite love struggles to imprint on finite human understanding. He notes that God attempts to stir human consciousness toward acknowledging their divine connection through natural beauty or teachings, but can't force these realizations. This section highlights the interconnectedness of existence and the challenges of humans in truly grasping their divine unity.
</li><li><b>Physical Limitations and Concept of Perfection</b>: In analyzing the limitations imposed by the physical body, Leo recognizes that, although divine communication is possible through a human avatar, such communication can't be perfect due to the body's inherent physiological needs. He concludes by disputing the notion that enlightenment equals perfection, asserting that even enlightened figures are finite and have their limitations. However, he reassures that these limitations don't negate their connection to the divine, reflecting perfection in imperfection.
</li><li><b>Discussion on Expression of God</b>: Leo talks about how God, or the truth, cannot be fully expressed in the finite realm. Even the physical human body or any one religion or teacher does not encompass the entirety of God. The form of any finite being or entity being different from another, like an apple being distinct from an orange, represents duality inherent in our finite world. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Self-Love and Beauty</b>: Leo moves on discussing how God, being infinite beauty, does not discriminate or judge anything as less beautiful than anything else. Everything, even if viewed negatively by humans, is seen as equally beautiful by God. The intrinsic love God has for all of creation cannot be felt or realised by anything finite, it can only be understood when one becomes God  achieves full enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Nature of Finite Things</b>: Leo notes that due to the very nature of finite things, they can only be one thing and not something else. For instance, if something is an apple, it excludes it being an orange. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Self Bias</b>: While humans make selfish distinctions and have self-bias towards personal agendas, leading to confusion and limitation, Gods consciousness is completely selfless and is pure love. God's perspective is not biased towards a child or a financial incentive; it is devoid of conflicts of interests.
</li><li><b>God's Perspective on Violence</b>: God does not judge or discriminate, and remains perfectly happy irrespective of the actions of humans. However, Leo mentions that God does care in a relative sense for humanity. He hopes that humans act with more consciousness and avoid creating their own hell through self bias. 
</li><li><b>Realizing One's Divine Nature</b>: Leo emphasizes the significance of being conscious and not being finite. By overcoming limitations and being more conscious, one can potentially realize their divine nature and stop living in self-created hell. He stresses that God infinitely loves all beings and does not put anyone in hell; it is individuals who put themselves in hell due to a lack of consciousness and increased bias. Being more conscious would not only allow individuals to make better decisions for themselves, but also for others around them. 
</li><li><b>Leo discusses the concept of discipline and maturity</b>: He uses the analogy of scolding a child for not understanding calculus, highlighting that expectations should be appropriate for a person's level of consciousness and maturity. Leo states that as God, he doesn't judge, hate, or punish any humans since he recognizes that overcoming negativity requires complete self-love.
</li><li><b>Regarding preferences and biases</b>: Leo explains that personal preferences and biases prevent humans from experiencing infinite love, as these involve making distinctions based on partial love. On the contrary, as God, he doesn't have any such biases or preferences because he is perfectly selfless.
</li><li><b>Concept of God, Truth, and Love</b>: Leo simplifies the concept of God as love, truth, intelligence, will, imagination, creativity, selflessness, unity, and containing infinite forms. He mentions that realizing God involves continuously going meta until it becomes infinite meta, leading to the state of formless God.
</li><li><b>Leo talks about attachment and fear</b>: Buddhism's teaching about attachment being the root of all problems is emphasized. Other obstructions to realizing oneself as God include being selfish, defending personal biases, and fearing death. Leo considers fear to be the opposite of love and conquering fear requires loving even deeper.
</li><li><b>The complexity of the human cognitive process</b>: Leo admires the complexity of the human mind and its sophisticated process. He acknowledges the limits of this process, such as the limit on memory which, although it seems problematic, is important for functional everyday life to avoid recalling every negative experience. Leo further elaborates the limitations of the human form, including physical issues like diseases, ailments, and old age.
</li><li><b>Leo concludes this section of the video</b>: He decides to end the recording due to low battery, fearing the loss of all spoken content if the recording is not stopped properly. He intends to resume the conversation in a second recording.
