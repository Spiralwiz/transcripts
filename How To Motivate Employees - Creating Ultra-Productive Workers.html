hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment in about ten minutes I'm going to
show you and give you some tips about how to
better motivate employees all right so what is the the
bottom-line core of motivate employees and this is somewhat deep
concept I mean their food books written about this how
to be a better leader how to be a better
manager so this is a sub component of being a
good manager being a good leader so I'm not going
to cover it in the depth that I would like
here but I'm going to give you some practical tips
and some key insights that you can take away with
you and implement right now if you're a manager if
you're a leader okay so motivating employees the biggest point
here that needs to be made and where people go
wrong where managers go wrong is that they try to
incentivize their employees with the simple old psychological model of
carrots and sticks so they give employees carrots for doing
the things that they want them to do and they
give them sticks or penalties for not doing the things
that are required to them to do and sometimes there's
some discussion there's like should I be using negative motivation
or positive motivation should I give them a carrot or
a stick that whole bottle is wrong that's not going
to get you good performance optimal performance from your employees
to really motivate an employee what you want is you
want the employee to be autonomous you don't want them
to be just a robot chasing a carrot or avoiding
a stick that's going to make a robot employee what
you want is you want a creative autonomous employee who
is going to be internally motivated so this is about
intrinsic motivation and in fact studies have shown that when
people are intrinsically motivated naturally motivated to do something and
you go in there and you give them even a
positive incentive on top of that like let's say this
is the situation they have actually done experiments where you
could have a child playing with some crayons and just
drawing just for the fun of it they have playtime
right for 30 minutes and they do that you split
that group in half and you give one group the
control just time to play for 30 minutes and draw
with crayons and you give the other group the same
exact times exact crayons everything's the same except you tell
them that you're going to pay them now let's say
twenty dollars each to sit there and draw something for
for those thirty minutes then what actually happens counter-intuitively is
that group that you incentivize extrinsically with the money even
though it's a positive motivation because it's an extrinsic motivator
it actually diminishes their enjoyment of that activity and it
reduces their performance and actually you get better drawing more
of that more creativity out of the group that's just
doing it because they like to rather than because they
have they to get it sent avise to so this
example shows you two carrots just giving employees carrots is
not always the best strategy telling your employee that he's
going to get a bonus for doing something creative and
doing something bold on the job sometimes that can be
a benefit sometimes it can a be it actually be
a detriment because if you wanted to do it anyways
you incentivizing him with money kind of cheapens the deal
right it's almost like think about it if I just
did something kind to you on the street and then
you're like wait let me let me pull out my
wallet and let me give you a hundred dollars because
you just did something kind like you opened a new
held open a door for me while I was carrying
a stack of books it kind of cheapens the like
the humanity of that act like I was just giving
you something I was just opening the door out of
the kindness of my heart I felt like that was
kind of a nice thing to do and I don't
expect any compensation for it yet here you are you're
like this hotshot with hundred-dollar bill now wanting to compensate
me I feel kind of dirty taking that money from
you because this was something I was happy to do
anyways it's kind of that kind of thinking so if
you really want to motivate your employees properly what do
you think you have to do it's not getting them
more carrots necessarily and it's certainly not giving them more
sticks nobody likes to be penalized for their performance at
work instead what you do is you inspire them great
leaders inspire great generals inspire their troops in battle great
presidents inspire the nation to rally around a cause and
the same is true for great leaders in companies every
great leader in a company is visionary he has a
vision he has some ideal that he is driving towards
something that's a mission of his and he is able
to articulate this mission effectively all the way down the
line so his troops know about it so that when
they're out there and you ask them to go to
slaughter to go face the trench machine guns when you
ask them to do that they better have a damn
good reason that they're doing it it's not because you're
paying them an extra thousand dollar bonus they're not going
to do that but they will do it if you
appeal to their higher values and what higher values am
I talking about these are higher values that all of
us all human beings appeal to on a certain level
we all want this and we want it intrinsically we
don't even need money for it these are things like
beauty excellence honesty justice order love kindness fairness these are
principles that people resonate with because these are like appealing
to their highest self so what you got to do
is you got to appeal to the highest self in
each one of your employees so what do they really
want what are their high selves so maybe you've got
a sales force right one tactic you can use to
motivate them is you can just say we're going to
give we're going to give the top three salesmen in
this 100 people sales force we're going to give them
an extra $5,000 bonus whoever ends up of the top
3 people at the end of the quarter and so
that might be kind of a traditional strategy a better
strategy though instead of having them fight for some bonus
which actually will be counterproductive a better strategy is to
create a vision for what they're working towards have them
buy in to the company's mission right not on a
superficial level on a deep level so that makes that
means for example have a product that your sales people
can be proud of that they want to sell don't
have them out there selling a crappy product that they
can't believe in have them want to believe in it
for example have them sell a product that's important to
humanity that's progressing humanity what do you think there's a
difference between having a sales person for example sell oh
I don't know like a cheap defective Chinese product that
they know breaks two months down the road and then
customers have to go and buy and replace it or
their sell or you're selling something like your salespeople are
selling like high quality wheelchairs to allow people to move
better or they're selling like a prosthetic leg a better
engineered high quality prosthetic leg that helps War veterans overcome
tragedies of war and amputee and like amputations which of
those do you think is gonna like appeal to their
higher higher values right it's kind of a no-brainer and
you can motivate people with that and make sure that
they see what they're actually doing with the positive influence
they're having so if your pop if your product if
your service if your company is having a positive influence
in the world and it should and if it isn't
then that's really the problem you fix first but let's
say it is make sure that your salespeople or whoever's
working for you is realizing what is happening and the
role that they're playing people are motivated when they have
a vision that they're working towards and they see that
that vision is doing good and they see that what
they're doing is impacting that vision so that's the next
point is you want to make sure that your employees
know what it is that they're contributing to the cause
because if I am sitting in a cubicle I'm just
typing away the computer all day and I don't see
the effect that that is having on the ultimate goal
then I'm not bought in I can't be it's not
possible I'm disconnected from that problem disconnected from the vision
I'm not seeing the feedback but for example if I'm
typing stuff up and then I'm also seeing the emails
that we're getting from the kinds of customers with rave
reviews and all these thank-you letters that we're getting and
we're literally like dragging in piles of thank-you letters into
the office and like dumping them on the on the
floor and on the coffee table what do you thin
like once in a while like we'll get up and
we'll read one of those thank-you letters or an employee
can just walk by and read one at random how
do you think that's going to make them feel totally
different right they can see the impact it's like oh
I made this piece of code if I'm a program
I made this of code and it allowed somebody to
all the sudden have this amazing experience and then somehow
that positively impacted their life now I can be bought
into that that might be important to me so that
is a very important point to keep in mind and
finally I think the last point that I'll make here
is if you really want your employees to be motivated
then you want them functioning as it as a unit
you want them to be cohesive and to do that
as the leader and as the manager you have to
be first of all in touch with your employees go
out there and be connected with them listen to their
concerns ask them what they want give them training actually
care about them if you treat them like cattle they're
going to behave it like cattle and it's going to
be hard to motivate them in any other way but
a carrot and a stick and that's not a very
effective way to motivate humans so treat them like humans
and then they will be motivated by human desires so
that is important and then also of course values values
are important make sure that your employee base is bought
into the values that you as a leader are espousing
so first of all that means you have to articulate
your values what is the company stands for what is
it that this division stands for what do we try
to accomplish like is it excellence is that loyalty is
it customer service you know what is it define that
stuff and then make sure that the people that are
on your team are actually bought into it not just
in name don't craft up some hokey mission statement and
values listen then just like pin it to some some
some board in the cafeteria this is something that people
have to be bought into because actually they've done research
on this Jim Collins famously did research on this and
and they found out that really what what it takes
to keep an organization very successful over the long run
is to have cohesion among values of employees everyone has
to be on board and they have to be bought
into the values of the leader if there's a lot
of disparity of values and one person has this opinion
another person has this opinion and the leader has another
direction and everyone's pulling in different directions what do you
think happens everyone's pulling in different directions and the ship
is going nowhere it's going around in circles you want
a clear direction to where you're going and you want
people that are bought into that direction and are on
board and are saying yeah I want to go there
too and when every one of your guys and girls
wants to go in the same direction as you do
then what do you think you're going to go you're
going to go there so those are some of my
basic basic fundamental tips about how you want to set
up your motivation strategy for employees this is a deep
topic I think I'm going to shoot some more videos
with more specifically breaking down each one of these points
and may be covering some other ideas that I have
about motivation and specifically team engagement so go ahead and
check out my site for those but anyways I'm gonna
wrap it up here go ahead leave your comments I'd
