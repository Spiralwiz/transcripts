[Music] all right let's talk about whether actualize.org is a
cult i get accused of being a cult leader on
the regular these days and i want to explain why
that is now of course there's a lot of trolls
who troll me and don't understand the work that we're
doing here with actualize.org and so they perceive it genuinely
they perceive it as some sort of cult work it's
really not but i want to go into some detail
to explain what this work is and how to distinguish
it from cult behavior and there will be some very
deep epistemic lessons here that are actually very important for
you to know i'm not trying to communicate here with
the trolls i can't reach the trolls they're not interested
in having their minds changed their minds are closed but
i am interested in communicating with those of you who
are doing this work and are serious about it or
maybe have just gotten introduced to this work and are
wondering what it's really about and you're trying to make
sense of like well is this legitimate work or is
this going to take me down some bad road and
you have legitimate reasons to be concerned because how do
you know that what i'm saying is true are you
supposed to just take this on as belief as ideology
where's the proof for all the radical claims that i
make and i do make some radical claims so there's
a lot to discuss here let's dig into it so
why do these teachings get labeled a cult why do
i get labeled a cult leader there's a tendency in
our society that when you encounter somebody teaching something rather
radical which is outside of the conventional norm of mainstream
thinking or materialism or outside conventional religious teachings or outside
conventional scientific teachings or what's taught in universities or at
school or outside the mainstream political spectrum you know there's
there's a range in politics uh you can be you
can be somewhat left leaning you can be somewhat right-leaning
but when you go too far to either extreme or
you adopt some totally different thing as a belief system
as an ideology then you tend to get labeled as
a cult so what happens is that there's a knee-jerk
reaction that our mind has when it hears someone saying
something which is very contradictory to the mind's view of
reality because the mind thinks that its view of reality
is true and correct this is true for religious people
and scientific people theists and atheists and philosophers it doesn't
really matter what part of the political spectrum you're on
or what you happen to believe the core imperative and
operating principle of your mind is that whatever your mind
thinks it thinks that is reality your mind thinks it
has reality figured out now this is not true at
all but reality for for your mind is like 95
figured out and then you think that oh well okay
yeah i'll i'll be a little bit humble and i'll
leave five percent unknown five percent unknown no no no
you got that backwards you got maybe five percent of
reality figured out 95 not at all and that five
percent you do have figured out a lot of that
is wrong too but so what happens is that the
mind though in order to maintain this illusion that it
has reality figured out anytime the mind hears anything that
would deeply question the foundations of its reality the mind
is going to generally be closed to that idea is
not going to want to go down that road is
not going to want to genuinely explore that possibility because
that requires a lot of mental work and it's also
personally very threatening and so instead the mind needs to
explain to itself somehow because the mind the mind's whole
modus operandi is that it's constantly explaining reality to itself
phenomena is happening and if some phenomena happens that doesn't
fit your preconceived frame for what reality is you have
to explain it away somehow like for example if you're
walking down the street and a ufo flies across the
sky and you see that but you don't believe in
ufos and you think that that's all nonsense and you
spent the last 20 years of your life debating ufo
people and telling them that ufos are complete nonsense and
then you see one going across the sky now for
your mind this creates a serious cognitive dissonance you have
two choices in your mind now you either admit that
you've been wrong your whole life and all your debates
and stuff were wrong or you make some kind of
excuse and usually it's much easier to make some kind
of excuse or go into denial and you might say
something like oh well that wasn't a ufo that was
just some uh it was a new military spacecraft ah
yeah they're probably just testing some new military or or
you might say oh it was just some uh you
know a weather balloon or is it oh there's just
some reflection off of some light source or my mind
was playing tricks on me i must have been hallucinating
or uh um or some kind of bird you get
what i'm saying i'm not making any specific point about
ufos i'm not telling you the ufos exist or don't
exist i don't know about ufos i'm just using this
as an example we're going to generalize from this example
your mind does this in all sorts of scenarios whether
it's a ufo or seeing a new kind of animal
that you haven't seen before or hearing some kind of
new philosophy or way of thinking about reality for example
if you grew up as an atheist and you went
to school and university to be a scientist under the
materialist paradigm believing that reality is just a material uh
physical system mechanical system with a bunch of unconscious atoms
bouncing around something like this which many scientists subscribe to
this kind of ideology so um when you hear someone
talking about religious topics or mystical topics your mind immediately
interprets that as odd those people are deluded see because
your mind can't reconcile the possibility that maybe there are
some things that religious people or mystical people are saying
that might have some validity to them because that would
be very threatening to your whole way of life in
your entire philosophy right so you don't really want to
question your philosophy or way of life you would rather
just excuse that away somehow and usually that's done by
demonizing the person or the source saying oh well that
there's not enough proof there's not enough authority there's not
enough double-blind placebo-controlled studies that's not coming from a university
that's not coming from harvard so whatever you come up
with excuses now i'm not picking on atheists or scientists
here per se this is true of virtually all minds
across the entire planet that have ever lived with their
models of reality right so we're saying something extremely general
and broad here it's a meta thing we're not talking
about any one particular belief system or ideology and trying
to disprove it or debunk it or say it's bad
instead we're trying to observe all of them operating from
a sort of a higher meta perspective and we're trying
to see how in all of these cases whether you're
a christian or a buddhist or a hindu or atheist
or a nihilist or a postmodernist or capitalist or a
socialist or a marxist or whatever you subscribe to there
are general features of the mind which are at work
these deep features and structures of the mind which are
locking your mind down into that particular model or paradigm
and nothing else wants to open up or break through
and it's very difficult so the whole challenge of this
work and what actualized.org is really all about the reason
we're talking about this mind stuff is because these teachings
you have to understand these are meta teachings that's what
makes these teachings different than most other teachings that you
see anywhere else most other teachings are trying to teach
you specific content and they're trying to get you to
believe or persuade you into a specific way of thinking
about reality as opposed to others so whether you're watching
some youtube video and the person trying to convince you
that marxism is the right way to go and capitalism
is evil or it's the opposite you're watching some conservative
who's who's telling you that the communists are taking over
and that that's bad see they're teaching you content they're
trying to get you to subscribe to some particular line
of thought and even with scientific sources that's also largely
true they're trying to teach you a specific set of
content they're not really looking at the epistemics or the
metaphysics of the situation that they're talking about and so
one distinction that's very helpful for you to make is
whether the teaching that you're or teacher that you're learning
from is teaching you content or is trying to reveal
to you the actual structures of your mind and how
your mind clings to content and uses content to wage
war on others as a distraction from looking deeper within
your own mind to see the the mechanisms that are
really at work see what your mind is always doing
is it's always in a process of constructing and imagining
reality that's true whether you're a new ager whether you're
religious whether you're uh not religious but spiritual in some
sense whether you do yoga whether you don't like any
of that stuff and you think all that is [
__ ] and you're a complete skeptic cynic atheist that's
also your mind playing that game so the difference really
between a cult and what i'm trying to teach you
here is that a cult is interested in indoctrinating you
into particular world view and locking you down into that
world view and the entire structure of the cult is
designed in such a way that it's trying to absolutize
a very narrow partial self-biased way of seeing the world
and then in order to do that it engages in
what i would call devilish activity selfish egotistical activity in
order to to create this reality bubble and to lock
you into it because this reality bubble is very useful
for acquiring money sex and power and that's what occult
is really truly about money sex power and the sense
that one has the truth a cult gives one a
sense of purpose i actually have a two-part series where
i go into depth about cult psychology and it's very
useful to study cult psychology i specifically shot that series
years ago i shot it because i wanted to inoculate
people against cult psychology uh a lot of people get
trapped in it especially these days on the internet there's
a lot of problems with disinformation and online cults and
things like that go watch my series called cult psychology
part one and called psychology part two i'm not gonna
rehash all of that especially in part one i i
list in great detail all the characteristics of a classic
cult and it really is worthwhile to study this not
to call someone a cult leader but to actually study
what does it mean to be a cult because again
our mind tends to use that word as a defense
mechanism so we have to be very careful now just
because our mind has a knee-jerk reaction calls something a
cult that it doesn't like that doesn't mean it is
a cult but also it doesn't mean that it's not
a cult it could be a cult some things out
there generally are cults so how do you distinguish which
is which well watch that series and you'll know exactly
how to distinguish i give you a whole list a
checklist you can go off and do the checklist so
a few of the features on that checklist is that
a cult is a hierarchical organization which is designed to
serve some narcissistic charismatic leader who's usually interested primarily in
sex money and power and then a cult puts a
lot of its resources and attention into recruiting others into
this hierarchical organization because really it's like a pyramid scheme
the resources are meant to funnel upwards so the cult
and the cult leader and the cult lieutenants who are
serving the leader towards the top of the pyramid they
are basically leeching resources from the very bottom of the
pyramid and uh they do this unlike a traditional pyramid
scheme which is just trying to get money from you
here they brainwash you into a perspective a way of
seeing the world you become so locked into that perspective
that now you're willing to donate lots of money you're
willing to support the cause you're willing to bend over
backwards for the leader you're willing to uh you know
engage in sexual behavior you wouldn't otherwise engage in you're
willing to surrender your power you're willing to surrender the
way you think and then you become like a sheep
and you're very easy to control and to manipulate and
that's exactly what the leader and his lieutenants want because
then that gives them a lot of power they can
use that and the ego loves power sex and money
the more ego one has the more shadow one has
the more one wants to wield uh power and acquire
money and luxury and fame and sex there are many
other features of a cult cults use psychological manipulation tactics
in order to lock members in and then to make
them paranoid about ever leaving that's one of the classic
hallmarks of a cult another one is that they try
to isolate you from your family and from your friends
so that you're easier to control and so um this
is the power of ideology and the power of the
mind see most people think that the mind is just
this silly innocent little thing you know you can have
different ideas and beliefs and it doesn't really matter it
doesn't really change reality but it very much does because
if you can control people's minds you can rule the
whole world that's basically how it works and it's a
very very effective survival strategy for those who don't know
how to earn money or acquire sex in legitimate ways
for them exploiting a group of naive people by brainwashing
them and locking them into a very narrow world view
uh that is very self-biased and self-serving of course that's
the whole that's the whole magic of being able to
create a worldview is that when you create a worldview
you don't just create any random worldview you create the
worldview that will serve your ego and its survival the
most you see so um it's an extremely effective survival
strategy but it has serious consequences it leads to suffering
and harm and perhaps the biggest problem from my point
of view or from actualize.org's point of view is that
it it leads one away from the truth it leads
away from consciousness it re it leads away from genuine
love and a lot of times it's tricky because these
cults they don't advertise that they're doing this these cults
portray themselves to be the good guys in fact a
cult tends to create a sort of a black and
white us versus them we're the good guys they're all
the bad guys sort of frame such that anyone in
the mainstream is portrayed to be a fool and that
those who are in the cult are actually the ones
who are in possession of the truth and the ones
who are really the good guys the loving ones the
saviors of mankind so it is very sneaky but also
you can see past these uh delusions and these and
deceptions uh pretty easily if you're aware of of what
to look for which i outline in my two-part series
called psychology part one and part two so uh the
biggest problem from uh from my point of view with
cults is that if you engage in cult thinking you're
never gonna discover the truth and the entire purpose of
actualize.org is to help you to have a clearer perception
of reality then what is conventionally possible through regular school
science academia conventional political discourse almost any other source that
you can learn from in society is not going to
be sufficient to get you crystal clear perception of reality
and even when i say crystal clear perception of reality
even that is is a sort of a term that
is is difficult to understand the significance of that because
most of us think we have it and most of
us think we can get it if we could just
keep doing more of the stuff we've been doing like
if i just read a few more books i'll i'll
have a crystal clear perception of reality or if i
just do a little bit more science i'll have a
crystal clear perception of reality no that's not how it
works to get a crystal clear perception of reality what
has to happen is you have to turn deeply inwards
and you have to start deconstructing your mind and you
have to start to notice how your own mind deceives
you i have a whole series specifically on that called
self-deception part one part two part three where i go
into various self-deception mechanisms so see the difference between what
we're doing here in a cult is that a cult
actually actively uses these self-deception mechanisms to deceive you whereas
what we're trying to do here is we're trying to
reveal to you these self-deception mechanisms and to show you
how you're deceiving yourself so as to make you conscious
enough to inoculate you against not only the deceptions of
others but yourself and if i were ever to deceive
you to try to deceive you you would have the
tools to be able to recognize that and to not
be deceived now of course you can always claim well
leo but isn't couldn't that be turned into a cult
too couldn't you make a cult about how you're not
a cult and then how you're teaching people how to
avoid cults and yet that becomes a cult yes you
could but you see what i care about is i'm
not interested in power i'm not interested in money and
i'm not that interested in sex i mean i am
interested in those things to the degree that i need
them to survive like i need some degree of power
i need some degree of sex because my body craves
it to some extent i need some degree of money
in order to feed myself and live a comfortable life
like most of us want but my work is not
about those things my work is not even about me
personally a lot of times people get this confused because
i tend to be charismatic and i tend to teach
this stuff in a in a kind of a personal
way really what you need to what you should understand
about my work is that my work is is totally
not about me it's got nothing to do with me
i'm sharing certain deep understandings that i've been able to
attain as i've been contemplating the nature of reality that's
all that i do is i just sit around and
just contemplate life at a much deeper level than most
people do most people don't do this and quite frankly
it surprises me it might sound like i'm trying to
portray myself as someone special here in a sense i
am special but i'm only special in this sense that
i'm extremely open-minded i just sit around and i constantly
contemplate reality like constantly 24 7 for my entire life
so in that sense that's special and i only recognize
now in retrospect that it's special just because of all
the people i've interacted with who don't do it it
took me a long time to recognize that i thought
that everybody did this see when i recognize that nobody
almost nobody in society is doing this that i'm like
well i could create a channel where i i you
youtube channel where i could share these insights with people
and they might be valuable to people and so here
we are uh but there's nothing special about me none
of the things i say hinges upon me or my
beliefs these are things i've discovered you could discover them
for yourself by doing the contemplation of course now the
trick is that most people don't want to do the
contemplation they're either not interested in it or it threatens
them and it's it's very tricky work it's very tricky
work and i think i have some talents in this
respect but nothing that makes me super special i mean
anyone can really do it if they really wanted to
some people could be more talented at it some people
less talented probably depends on the structure of your of
your brain of your mind how you were raised and
genetics and many other factors so the trick here is
that i was always aware from the very beginning when
i started actualize.org i was always aware of the problem
of ideology and epistemology really and i and i've been
teaching it the problem is is that how do you
get people interested in epistemology it's a very nerdy airy
fairy sort of topic that doesn't seem relevant to people
most teachers who teach self-help and that's sort of how
i started this channel is with just basic self-help teachings
they don't talk very much about metaphysics or epistemology because
frankly it's not very popular it doesn't earn you a
lot of money um it's difficult to talk about most
people tune it out they don't see the relevance of
it but i was teaching epistemology from the very beginning
because of how important i knew that it was to
get us to the kind of deep levels of development
that we want to reach uh and i've been warning
against ideology and belief systems from the very beginning i've
been warning about paradigm lock i've been warning about getting
locked into a single perspective i've been warning about going
out there and studying a diversity of sources not just
my own i've been sharing with you the various mechanisms
that the mind uses to trick itself and to trick
others i've been trying to inoculate you against cult psychology
and against ideology and against various political left or right
belief systems and materialist belief systems and religious belief systems
and even new age belief systems and beliefs in general
i have episodes that cover all of these topics if
you go back through my body of work and so
why did i do that i did that precisely because
i'm very cognizant enough how easy it is for humans
to fall into ideology and into cult dynamics if this
stuff is not explicitly discussed then cults and ideologies will
happen and in fact these mechanisms are so dangerous and
so pervasive that even if this stuff is discussed it
will still happen we should still discuss it and we
should still take measures and aims to uh to avoid
it as much as possible but it still generally tends
to happen because the majority of people do not possess
a deep enough consciousness of these self-deception mechanisms and so
really when something is called a cult the problem here
there's a deeper problem than just a specific very narrow
small organization most cults tend to be rather small and
limited in their scope that's not the real problem the
real problem is what i discussed in my cult psychology
part two it's not the strict cults it's the more
pervasive and subtle cult psychology which permeates all of society
and the reason it does is because really what we're
talking about is we're talking about the human mind not
understanding how it works not understanding its own mechanisms being
unconscious to itself and therefore when these minds which are
selfish and egotistical and self-biased don't do any personal development
they're low in their level of development cognitively morally spiritually
spiral dynamic stages red blue orange green these tier 1
stages these kinds of minds when they get together they
can't help but start to behave like cults sometimes to
a very extreme extent but other times in more subtle
ways this is even true within academia within science within
medicine within government within schools amongst your friends within corporations
within non-profit organizations this group think this paradigm lock is
very common and the whole thrust of my work is
to correct that i've devoted my entire life to correcting
that it's not so much for me about how to
help you to earn some more money or to improve
your personal life although that is a consequence that can
happen from from doing this work um and sometimes we
we cover those topics but for me the real point
of this work the reason i wake up in the
morning and i'm excited to do these episodes and i
put so much effort into them and someone do so
much research and so forth is because it's it's painfully
obvious to me that the biggest thing that holds back
and re retards mankind slows down mankind in other words
is it's almost as though think of mankind as being
stuck in this thick molasses and this molasses is the
lack of proper epistemic understanding and this molasses permeates every
single facet of culture and society and it has for
the last 10 000 years and it still does today
you find it in the military in all scientific institutions
academia medicine everywhere you find it you find it within
families you find it within churches and all of this
then leads to the collective stupidity of mankind and therefore
mankind is not able to understand itself and the world
and its relationship to the world and therefore mankind suffers
in all the ways that it does every single political
problem every single war every single um uh scientific problem
even every medical problem like i mean this goes so
deep every social problem we have and many of the
personal problems we have are simply due to a lack
of clear perception of ourselves the world and our relationship
to ourselves and the world and each other so for
me the most impactful thing i can do with my
life is to communicate to mankind the mechanisms that are
responsible for that why this is happening and how to
prevent it within your own self but the problem of
course is that changing this is extremely threatening it's threatening
at an individual level and it's threatening at a collective
level you might wonder well why are we stuck in
this molasses for the last 10 000 years surely someone
would have seen it pointed it out and then we
would have just solved it within a generation or two
but this deeply under-appreciates the seriousness of our problem we
are collectively constructing reality as humans that's what we're doing
but we're not conscious that we're doing it and we
will deny very vigorously that we are doing this and
if we can get away with this denial then we
can construct any reality we want essentially that's the mind's
game it's a game the mind is playing and to
escape this game is extremely difficult because your entire survival
hinges upon your mind continuing to play this game so
it might seem innocent at first like oh okay yeah
leo this sounds like a good idea let's let's just
let's just grab mankind by the hair and pull everybody
out of this molasses and free ourselves of this delusion
collective delusion that we're all in that sounds nice but
have you done it yourself to yourself because see what
you have to do here when you recognize what i'm
telling you is you have to you have to recognize
that you have to grab yourself by the hair and
pull yourself out of this molasses you might say that's
impossible well it's almost impossible and when you start doing
it you start to realize difficult it is because what
you realize that oh we're not just talking in abstractions
here we're really talking about my personal life and my
own personal survival because i survive not as an individual
but within a larger social construction i have a job
i go to there's a boss i have to follow
rules there's the police i have to worry about i
have to not break the laws otherwise i'm going to
go to jail or get shot i have to you
know fall learn those rules follow those rules i could
play so social games in order to get the sex
that i want to get the food that i need
all the things your body needs to survive you have
to play various social games to get those things whether
it's in government or in the corporate world or however
you get it even within science or academia you might
say well those are are pure pursuits of truth no
they aren't every scientist and academic and scholar is deeply
tied in with the survival situation of whatever organization they
work for whether it's their university or their non-profit group
because they got to feed themselves too and then it's
those ways in which you have to feed yourself that
then create yourself biases because you're not able to then
truly deconstruct reality because you need those specific constructions that
you've constructed in society has constructed that actually feed you
with food water oxygen sex shelter you know the basic
needs that you have and then furthermore they feed your
higher needs too they feed your needs for creativity your
needs for human contact uh your needs for some sort
of reputation and a sense of of doing good in
the world and they feed your even your needs for
self-actualization they feed those you see so while it might
seem like it's possible to just go and explore reality
and find the truth and see it clearly uh with
clear perception and there's there's no problem you just got
to go do it it's not so it's not so
easy because what you discover as you're starting to realize
how this whole thing is structured is that reality has
your nuts in a vice and as soon as you
start to question reality too much that vice gets screwed
tighter and tighter and your nuts are in it and
they're getting crushed and so most people when they feel
that crush they just go back to their illusions to
their ideologies to their paradigms there's a cost to jail
breaking your mind and that cost is the thing you
hold most dear your personal comfort your survival these things
become threatened so how do you convince eight billion people
to surrender their survival agendas and their personal biases whether
they're christians buddhists hindus atheists materialists scientists academics skeptics how
do you get them all to surrender that that's our
predicament so i've taken great lengths actually to make sure
that actualize.org never becomes a cult let me explain some
of those measures that i've taken first and foremost just
teaching this stuff and explaining it in very clear fashion
really focusing a lot on epistemology that's that's perhaps the
biggest measure that i've taken uh but other measures that
i've taken is that i've actually sacrificed the the my
own personal success in the successive actualized.org in order to
not have it turned into a cult at the level
that i'm at with youtube with the amount of subscribers
i have and how many views i can get i
can easily create shallow content that will funnel people into
a hierarchical structure if i wanted to i could create
a whole organization around this work if i really wanted
to i could get i could i could trick millions
of people if i really wanted to into joining this
organization building this pyramid scheme funneling the resources up i
could select a few lieutenants you know five ten people
who would be my loyal lieutenants who would also get
some of the perks and benefits i could pay them
nice salaries i could pay myself a huge salary i
could ask for huge donations charge for all sorts of
stuff i could publish you know merch and t-shirts and
coffee mugs and doormats and and then i can do
sponsorship deals and i can do course upon course upon
course i can funnel you into courses that will cost
a thousand dollars five thousand dollars ten thousand dollars i
can do mastermind groups i can charge thousands of dollars
for those i can create exclusive an exclusive tier that
you can join i can start to get you to
recruit others to create the sort of affiliate program i
know how to do all that i do none of
it i sell a book list i sell one course
that's all i sell i have some advertisements that are
just uh a natural part of youtube that's it that's
that's all the monetization i've done because the majority of
my attention goes into producing substantive work for me it's
not about building this organization in fact i have no
employees you think that's an accident you think i'm just
what i'm stupid or i'm lazy and i don't understand
that i could turn actualize that org into a into
a 10 20 50 employee company i could easily do
that i don't and it costs me it costs me
power i have less power because of this it costs
me money i have less i could have millions more
if i did this and it cost me sex too
i could get laid so much more and the quality
of of who i get laid with could be so
much higher if i did this because i could just
you know pick out the best from the from from
this giant group um so there's so much that the
ego could gain from from from doing such a thing
and a lot of youtubers that's what they do once
they get pretty successful you know they get over a
million subscribers or whatever and then they start to you
know hire employees they start to you know get serious
about it they do merch they do sponsorship deals and
all this sorts of stuff right why do i not
do this i deliberately resist hiring people i have more
work to do there's a bunch of stupid work that
i don't even like doing that i have to do
simply because i don't hire people because i'm concerned that
if i hire people then i'll want to hire more
people then it'll turn into organization then i'll have i'll
have more mouths to feed i'll be responsible for feeding
all the people in the company then that will require
me to sell out on my work to do more
of these sorts of tactics and turn this more into
a business than it is just me sharing wisdom with
you one on one i deliberately try to keep it
small because once these ideas are turned into a business
that will then start to turn into a cult those
are just the natural pressures that any spiritual teaching falls
under and not really just spiritual teachings but even if
you don't like the idea of spirituality and you fancy
yourself just a materialist scientist atheist academic academia has this
problem too once you join academia once you get paid
from academia you're part of the university system that's it
you're part of this pyramid scheme that is the university
system and all the devilry that comes with it all
the over overpriced textbooks and yearly edition updates that universities
do which are just a pure scam the scams that
they do with the student loans and the whole thing
of just pressuring kids into these universities even though you
know they shouldn't go or that they would be better
off just learning by themselves no you're going to take
on tens of thousands of student loan debts that you'll
be paying off for the rest of your life you
know it's it's a pyramid scheme that's what academia is
and even if you're working at harvard let's say or
mit or caltech one of these very prestigious universities and
you're working and you know you have your phd and
you got your 10-year position the only reason you're able
to have that 10-year position and do the work you
do is because these universities have this pyramid scheme structure
and basically you're leeching off of your students and then
of course they have giant endowments like for example harvard
you know has a multi-billion dollar endowment of where these
monies come from these monies these this money comes from
businesses and corporations which basically bribe harvard in order to
keep churning out harvard graduates such that these harvard graduates
then occupy the top positions of power in business and
in government and in society you see it's a even
though it's academia oftentimes it's sort of masquerading as though
it's above survival and it's just teaching you truth it's
the truth is is like a tertiary concern of academia
in academia the primary concern is the fundraising and and
maintaining the reputation and getting their graduates into higher positions
of power within society because that reflects better on the
university the university is surviving the university has a collective
ego see my episode called collective ego where i talk
about that corporations have collective egos it's not just the
ceo of amazon or microsoft or apple or google or
whatever company you might hate facebook at z verizon whatever
it is disney it's not just that the ceo is
some greedy capitalist who's trying to you know make himself
wealthy no no no you don't understand the depth of
the problem the depth of the problem is is that
the corporation itself has taken on a life of its
own beyond the ceo no ceo controls any of these
giant corporations anymore these corporations are like frankenstein monsters that
have taken on a life of their own beyond any
individual employee and these are these corporations they're they're trying
to survive because they're fighting with each other in the
same way that animals try to survive in the jungle
or in the forest at each other's expense in the
same way that you try to survive as an individual
it's just happening at a higher level with organizations corporations
government entities the military non-profits even spiritual communities they all
have collective egos so see what i do is i
don't at least i have it at this point i
haven't given any opportunity for a collective ego to develop
at least as part of the actualize of our official
organization now of course we have a forum where we
do have some collective ego going on as all forums
do um and we have sort of a loose community
of people who follow this work and of course you
guys you know chat with each other in the comments
sections and so forth um so of course there's that
but i mean what i want you to understand is
that these dynamics are so deeply ingrained into how humans
behave that they're virtually inevitable you can try to hold
it off as much as you can but in a
sense it's beyond your own individual ability to hold it
off i do what i can so i i've deliberately
not hired anybody um such that no organization of this
kind can form now that doesn't mean i won't hire
people in the future the reality is is that to
run to run this business and channel properly i do
need to hire people probably at some point but even
when i do i'm going to keep it very small
and i'm going to try to minimize as much as
possible because i don't want it to turn into this
sort of collective ego situation so again also don't get
me wrong i'm not saying that businesses are bad organizations
are bad society is bad none of these things are
bad you just have to understand the dangers that come
with them and you have to do them responsibly sort
of like if you're going to have children you can
have children consciously responsibly or you can just accidentally you
know get drunk one night and then impregnate somebody and
then and then you're stuck so it's not that having
children is wrong it's just that having them unconsciously is
probably not very wise likewise you can you can start
an organization it's okay there's no problem with starting an
organization just be very mindful of how easily your organization
will lead to devilry if you're not very conscious in
leading that organization and then also keep in mind once
you're dead even if you did everything perfectly once you're
dead that organization's going to take on a life of
its own and you won't be able to control it
so this has been true with every single spiritual teaching
ever in human history christianity judaism buddhism hinduism jainism none
of them are above this but it's also been true
for every university every academic pursuit every scientific organization every
non-profit organization every government it's also been true so don't
get the idea that only you know religious nut cases
and fundamentalists are vulnerable to this problem no all humans
are vulnerable to this problem this is the human problem
and it's not just humans in the abstract that are
vulnerable to this problem you specifically are highly vulnerable to
this problem and you're doing it and you're not conscious
of how you're doing it so here's a good question
for you to contemplate if you're really serious about this
work contemplate how you're contributing to cult psychology how you're
getting wrapped up in it regardless of what ideology or
belief system or worldview you subscribe to in fact when
you in a knee-jerk fashion call something that you disagree
with or someone that you're threatened by you call him
a cult leader or you call that a cult when
you say that without really bothering to study or think
deeply about what a cult is that is you engaging
in cult behavior ironically because you see the cult of
mainstream society has taught you that anything that contradicts mainstream
society's perspective must be a cult that's what cult your
culture has taught you mainstream society has defense mechanisms because
mainstream society is the giantest collective ego of them all
it makes corporations and non-profits and religious groups pale by
comparison the cult of mainstream society has very powerful defense
mechanisms to get you to stay locked within that cult
so another thing that i try to do to inoculate
you against this cult problem is that i try to
teach the relativity of all perspectives and i try to
expose you to many perspectives i don't just teach from
the buddhist perspective or the advaita perspective or the yoga
perspective or some hindu perspective or some christian perspective or
some scientific perspective i've taught you a little bit from
all of them but more importantly i've we've gone meta
on all of these as well right so that you
can you can see the world through all these different
lenses and i keep pushing you to explore more and
more lenses to see the world from because the more
i know that the more of them you see the
more you'll realize like oh these are just lenses one
is not better than the other per se i can
become good at swapping out these different lenses and looking
at the world different ways and then i can sort
of go meta and even ultimately the hope is if
you're going to jailbreak your mind fully you will be
able to look at the world without any lenses at
all and see what that is like but the problem
is that most people think they're looking at the world
without a lens when actually they are they're just not
aware of the lens they're looking at it from through
but there is a possibility of seeing reality without any
lenses and that's that's such a radical possibility that really
that's why people call me a cult leader is because
i have made some radical claims about god about the
nature of existence about the nature of the self and
others and uh some of these claims when taken completely
out of context out of the entire body of my
work which is you know over 300 hours of content
and by the way these 300 hours of content is
still just the tip of the iceberg of of what
i really understand and want to teach about reality it
may be maybe i've put five percent of my understandings
down on video the other 95 are not are not
recorded yet and maybe never will be because some stuff
is just too subtle to record or to even communicate
with words but anyways uh you know but even that
tip of the iceberg 300 hours you know you have
to really get deep into this work it's easy to
take a you know a fragment here a statement there
and then take it out of context and make it
seem like it's some sort of a you know crazy
teaching uh well reality is a radical thing yeah sometimes
my style is that i put things very bluntly and
provocatively i deliberately like to provoke because it gets the
mind out of its dogmatic slumber as kant would put
it and so um so yeah uh as it turns
out when you get a glimpse at reality without any
of your lenses without any of your models without any
of your belief systems without any of your ideologies you
go meta on all of that and you see reality
absolutely to see reality without any lenses is to say
that you see reality absolutely when you see reality absolutely
and that is possible that's such a shocking and radical
thing that when you put it into words it sounds
insane to ordinary people to people who are just normies
we might call them part of just mainstream the mainstream
society it seems insane to scientists it seems insane to
academics it seems insane to politicians it seems insane to
doctors and researchers it seems insane to religious people too
it even seems insane to to new age people i
was dealing with some health issues over the last year
and i tried everything i went to to all the
conventional doctors i went to a bunch of alternative doctors
you know trying to fix my um my gut issue
i had some bacteria infection in my gut and so
before i figured out what it really was i was
going to all these different doctors trying to figure out
what the hell was going on i wasn't feeling very
good um and i did some experiments i went to
some psychics and to some really new age people right
because i wanted to to experience that end of the
spectrum because you know i did all the traditional doctors
they didn't really help me so i went i did
some very extreme kind of new agey stuff um and
it was a great experience because it taught me actually
a lot about how new agers think and the various
traps they fall into but you know i was sitting
in the office of this um new age sort of
psychic healer type of lady she was like in her
60s or late 50s or something and uh and you
know she was she was trying to help me with
my health stuff we were kind of going through various
ideas i thought maybe she could give me some idea
that i could you know maybe run with that maybe
she could help me in some way so i did
that and um and then somehow we got on the
conversation of god and she was telling me about god
this god that and i'm sitting there kind of smiling
at her and i'm like i'm just like and this
is going to sound kind of arrogant but i was
like oh you mean you mean me i'm god she's
like no you're not god i'm like yeah i am
i'm god and she's like no you're not and then
and then rather than getting into a debate about about
it i just said okay you're right you're right i'm
not um but i mean um but see even to
a new ager psychic person when you when you tell
them that they're god they don't accept it they can't
accept it they think that they're a part of god
they don't realize that they are the full god they
can't accept it so um so yeah radical things like
that you discover radical truths so the whole challenge of
my life my work is that i've been able to
become conscious of some very very very radical truths that
are so amazing that if you became conscious of these
you would you would you would [ __ ] yourself
in enjoy it would be the most remarkable discovery you've
ever made in your life it would be the single
highest peak of your life everything else you've done in
your life would be worthless compared to this level of
understanding that's how remarkable this understanding is and i'm trying
to share that with with people but the challenges how
do i share that with them when they are so
wrapped up in this molasses of cultural indoctrination that all
of us were you know born into and grew up
in and i'm i'm not immune to that i was
also indoctrinated into that same molasses and i still am
every day every youtube video i watch is trying to
indoctrinate me into some world view so my problem is
how do i get people to this incredible level of
understanding when everything in their psychology is preventing them from
doing that everything in your mind is going to fight
against it and what's worse is that you don't understand
that this is what your mind is doing so i
understand it but you don't understand it so how do
we even begin to get you to understand it now
this might sound arrogant like i'm trying to place myself
above you but it's not at all arrogant it just
is the case now i'm not claiming i'm the only
one who understands these things plenty of people in society
do but um the majority don't 99 of people don't
and there's many levels of depth to understanding this you
can understand a little bit but not all the way
so i'm trying to get you to the highest levels
of understanding so how do we do that well the
only way to do that is to teach you how
to start to deconstruct your mind and to see how
your own mind is fooling you with all these different
worldviews and belief systems that you're subscribing to to help
you to jailbreak your mind that's the point of this
work and there are many many defense mechanisms that your
mind will employ to prevent the jail breaking from occurring
your mind has anti-jail breaking programming in it so every
one of my videos essentially its purpose is to chip
away a little bit you know episode by episode we
chip away at your mind a little bit a little
bit more a little bit more a little bit more
over months and years we chip away until your mind
starts to realize how it's fooling itself and once you're
becoming conscious of that after a certain extent you can
no longer fool yourself ever again in that same way
but of course there's many other ways in which you
fool yourself so it's not just a matter of discovering
one or two delusions within your mind it's a matter
of 50 or 100 different ways in which you deceive
yourself that are very very sneaky and it's a matter
of unraveling those and as you do that your sense
of reality crumbles because ultimately what's going on here is
that you you are god constructing the entire universe you've
constructed human life there is no human life without you
constructing it there is no society there is no culture
there is no science there is no medicine there is
no academia there is no government there is no such
thing as money there is no such thing as anything
unless it's constructed by a conscious mind there are no
atoms and molecules until your conscious mind constructs them that
is simply what's really going on reality is imaginary you're
even constructing this video this video is imaginary being perceived
by an imaginary human over there the problem is that
you're not conscious of how you're constructing it because if
you were conscious reality would dematerialize so if you want
reality to feel rock solid and material and you want
to feel scientific then you're committed to not deconstructing it
because that's what that is to have a rock solid
reality you have to be ignorant of how you're constructing
it then it seems rock solid but the more you
inquire and the more you deconstruct the less solid it
gets until eventually it just completely disappears and that's what
you're afraid of deep deep deep down in the depths
of your ego mind it knows that if it goes
through this process it will deconstruct all of reality and
you'll be left with nothing and your ego doesn't like
that so it's playing a game of defense against that
happening and the entire functioning of society depends upon this
without this constructive force there couldn't be government there couldn't
be an economy there couldn't be businesses that couldn't be
organizations there couldn't be a legal system there couldn't be
police there couldn't be military there couldn't be war there
couldn't be marriage there couldn't be religion there couldn't be
science so if you are attached to any of those
things existing you see you're more committed to their survival
than you are to the truth or to seeing reality
how it is or to understanding the nature of reality
and that's how most people are most people are too
committed to either the survival of their family their children
their business their bank account their scientific theories their academic
institution their military unit their government their nation their tribe
their state and for these things to function the functioning
of these things largely depends upon us believing that they're
real and that they are not imaginary so see like
money is is the perfect example of this because everyone
understands intuitively like if you think deeply about it that
money is a total illusion i mean what is money
really it's just an empty symbol that's all it is
digits or even coins it doesn't matter even if you
have gold coins i mean it's what is a gold
coin what is the value of a gold coin it's
nothing it has no value at all what is value
all value is imaginary but we need to behave as
though it's real because our life depends upon it you
see so the way that your mind tricks you into
believing things are real is simply by attaching it to
your survival because ultimately you believe that death is real
so that's that's the biggest falsehood you've believed in so
if you think death is real then of course anything
that threatens your death is perceived to be very real
as well and then of course from this you can
construct anything and all of that of course is predicated
upon the deception that death is real and it's not
imaginary if you want to know more about death see
my episode called what is death where i explain that
so the trick here is that your mind is not
playing fair you might think that your mind is interested
in truth and understanding it's not you might think that
your your mind is interested in in a genuine discussion
about some topic whether it's scientific or mystical or mystical
or whatever it's not your mind is not an honest
actor your mind is a dishonest actor which is interested
in avoiding death and why does your mind want to
avoid death no reason there's no reason to to be
alive or to be dead it makes no difference but
the mind has the bias that it does make a
difference and based upon this your entire life is predicated
you see and then from this stem all of your
problems and all of society's problems now of course just
saying this already opens me up to the criticism that
leo you're running a death cult because you know is
it isn't it a common trope among cult leaders to
talk about how oh death is not so bad drink
the kool-aid you know on all this and then and
then you know why don't you just kill yourself but
that's not what i teach of course um to say
that death is imaginary is not to say that you
should kill yourself there's no self to kill this is
not some sort of a nihilistic philosophy um it's just
that you've never questioned the nature of what death is
you've just always assumed that death is real right so
don't get me wrong nothing i say nothing i say
uh should be used to physically harm yourself so if
you're watching all my videos and at some point it
occurs to you that oh leo wants me to harm
myself physically no you've misunderstood i've never said that in
fact i think you should adopt the following rule is
that as you watch this content whatever you do and
i mean you're going to have ups and downs in
your spiritual journey there will be moments where you are
so down so depressed so miserable and so much suffering
because of you're realizing how much everything around you is
constructed by your own mind and you feel so lonely
and misunderstood in all this that you might feel like
you want to harm yourself physically and so here's the
rule of our work here with the work we're doing
the one rule you adopt is i'm willing to question
deconstruct whatever but i will never physically harm the body
in this process i will take good care of the
body i'll feed it well i'll exercise it i'll give
it the medicine it needs if it's if it needs
medicine i'll go see a doctor if i need to
see a doctor and i will take care of all
that and then go about your suffering your existential suffering
keep suffering go through your depression go through your dark
night of the soul all that stuff um yeah go
through your spiritual existential crisis um but don't harm the
body you see because one of the ego's last ways
of latching onto and holding power over you is that
when you go deep enough in the spiritual journey there's
gonna be sort of a fork in the road where
here is ego death and here is physically harming the
body and the death of the body and so there's
going to be this sort of fork in the road
and some egos are so dense that they would rather
physically kill the body than to relinquish the ego and
have the body free of the ego and so what
we want to do is we want to cut off
this this possibility of harming the body let the ego
suffer until its own suffering destroys it but if the
ego suffering gets so bad that the ego wants to
lash back out at the body and project it all
on the body and hurt the body you've screwed up
the process see there's a difference between saying i want
you to die the ego versus saying i want your
body to die actualize.org all these teachings have nothing to
do with the body per se but it is about
the death of you the ego you the human you
the biographical self so what i mean by ego is
the biographical self it's the idea that you were born
in a certain place at a certain time in a
certain world to certain people in a certain family you
went to a certain school that whole biographical story you're
telling yourself that's the ego that's the false self so
we're trying to deconstruct that without physically harming the body
or ruining your whole life i have a another episode
specifically devoted to the various problems and traps and dangers
of doing spiritual work it's called the dangers of spiritual
work go check that out i give some cautionary advice
there because the truth is that this work is dangerous
see people want to understand reality they want to do
science they want to understand consciousness and they want to
do it all in the comfort of their own armchair
and have it all be safe but it can't be
safe you see it has to be dangerous because we're
talking about survival here the construction of reality is not
just something you're doing just because you like to fantasize
you're doing it for a very deliberate purposeful reason you're
doing it to survive and danger is just a facet
of survival what you call dangerous is that which you
feel or perceive as hindering your survival so if you're
using your mind to construct a fantasy within which you're
living which helps you to survive of course the deconstruction
of that fantasy will be perceived as extremely threatening by
your own mind by you so to tell someone who
was born in the middle east and grew up a
muslim from from a little baby for 30 or 40
or 50 years he grew up in that culture to
tell that person that islam is a fantasy this is
one of the most threatening things you can tell to
that person if he was to take it seriously so
usually if you told him something like oh did you
know islam is a fantasy he's not going to entertain
that seriously for even a second because if he did
he would have an existential crisis whole life would collapse
because his business his family all his religious activities his
social activities his friends his company his government everything his
entire culture is is completely soaked through with islam so
of course if i tell him something like that he'll
call me a cult leader but this is much deeper
problem than just islam it doesn't matter if it's islam
christianity buddhism hinduism or materialism or science or atheism or
skepticism or cynicism or nihilism or postmodernism it doesn't matter
it all functions like islam the content doesn't matter your
mind simply clings to any content that it was programmed
with for its survival from birth do you see how
this works why does the mind get attached to islam
in a middle eastern arab culture because to survive in
that culture this has been true for the last thousand
and a half uh thousand five hundred years uh uh
one and a half millennia it's been true that to
survive in the middle east you had to subscribe to
islam you affect you couldn't really have an effective survival
strategy otherwise in that part of the world for deep
historical reasons likewise it's true that for millennia to survive
effectively in europe you had to be a christian if
you were something other than a christian you were persecuted
killed tortured raped you certainly weren't allowed to have the
best jobs you weren't given the most power you weren't
given the best sex or the best business opportunities and
your family suffered for it as well this creates a
very strong incentive to become a christian doesn't it likewise
in america since america's founding even up to today uh
being a christian in america is a very effective survival
strategy now it's it's starting to break apart in the
last 50 years especially but um for much of america's
history that's been the case and you know if you
live in india then you got to be a hindu
to survive effectively there so you see what happens is
that what part of the world you are born in
and the era that you're born in the generation you're
a part of there's a certain constructed fantasy that each
of those cultures and eras have that are the sort
of consensus fantasy that we all subscribe to in that
part of the world in order to live effectively with
each other based upon this collective fantasy we're able to
generate some legal system some police some military some some
economic systems some business rules and etiquettes ways of treating
each other so that we you know don't all kill
each other and then when you're born into it you're
like a fish in water and you're forced to adopt
it because if you don't adopt it you're not going
to get food shelter sex love approval status reputation fame
money business opportunities you won't get any of that you'll
be an outcast most importantly what you won't get is
you won't get love and that's the number one thing
you need as a child i mean even as an
adult as well but especially as a child in your
first 20 years from zero to 20 what's the thing
you need the most you need love if you don't
get love in those first 20 years you're going to
grow up to to be a a mentally ill borderline
psychotic sociopathic um criminal if you don't get the the
required love you need see so in a sense you're
um like i said as soon as you're born your
nuts are in a vice and then the people around
you squeeze that vice they crank it a little bit
more and more and more this happened to you in
your family happened to you in school happened to you
in high school happened to you in university as you
were growing up happened to you at your first job
that you got it happens so subtly that most of
us aren't even aware of it we get locked into
this reality bubble of our culture and the era that
we're living in and then we take that as reality
in the world and as truth we confuse survival with
truth really this reality bubble is just how that particular
group of people are surviving in that particular environment at
that particular time in human history and of course we
have all these different bubbles if you go to different
parts of the world at different eras in history you
will discover completely different bubbles compare the bubble of ancient
egypt to the bubble of ancient greece to the bubble
of ancient rome to the bubble of ancient china to
the bubble of today's china to the bubble of america
today to the bubble of europe today and all these
different cultures and countries and of course these large bubbles
have sub bubbles within them so within the larger bubble
of let's say let's say modern 21st century japan you
have a smaller bubble of a specific corporation maybe the
sony corporation the nintendo corporation or whatever toyota corporation and
they have their own little bubbles and they have their
own little subcultures and so there's cultures subcultures within subcultures
and it goes you know hellonically up and down the
holarchy this is the structure of consciousness so the more
you start to understand what i'm explaining here this meta
stuff the more inoculated you become against cult psychology but
it's still tricky you're never completely immune to self-deception nor
should you expect that i am completely immune to self-deception
as i've explained in detail in my self-deception series part
one two three especially part three i really stressed at
the end of that series that just because i'm able
to articulate many of the ways in which we deceive
ourselves and i'm able to articulate those things because i've
studied them within myself a lot and also within society
at large just because i'm able to articulate that that
doesn't mean that i'm perfect at spotting my own self-deceptions
in fact i told you that the whole key to
self-deception is that you really mostly have to worry about
your own self deceiving you that's the real key you
don't have to worry so much about others deceiving you
as long as you don't deceive yourself but that's the
hardest thing to do and i have self-deceptions within me
that i'm rooting out on a weekly monthly yearly basis
you know i'm doing the best i can all of
us are doing the best we know how to do
we're just at different levels some of us are a
little bit more experienced at it than others are so
i can still make mistakes i can be wrong about
certain things and i always have to be triple checking
myself i'm always doing it you don't see me doing
it on camera but when i'm off camera i'm always
questioning my own worldview always this is this is this
is so obvious that it it barely even needs to
be said but it does because some people just assume
that you know if they're like oh well leo has
his own personal ideology and belief system he's just he's
just preaching it that's all he's doing it's like no
no i'm constantly reevaluating everything in my worldview constantly and
just because i speak about the absolute or i speak
about god or i speak about absolute truth that that
doesn't mean that i'm an absolutist in and i've taken
that as like an ideology this is sort of a
pre-trans fallacy here because a lot of religious fundamentalists were
talking about the absolute but they're they actually they they're
not conscious of relativity that's the difference see my episode
called understanding relativism part one and i'll do a part
two in the future soon as well so um a
key a key feature of my work here is relativity
everything is relative right science relative medicine is relative religion
is relative spirituality is relative it's all relative but even
though that's the case there is an absolute when you
speak of it it's always relative i'll have a specific
episode about that because it's confusing to people it's tricky
to explain um but the whole the whole point of
relativity the power of relativity is that it it helps
you to not get locked into any one perspective to
not take any one perspective too seriously and that's precisely
the opposite of a cult because the entire function of
a cult is to create a system of defense mechanisms
to preserve a reality bubble to the exclusion of all
the other reality bubbles and that's the opposite of what
we're trying to do here now of course the problem
is that no matter how much i say this it
doesn't mean that you will actually do it there's a
difference between saying the things that i'm saying believing the
things that i'm saying and then actually executing them so
for example you very much could adopt the idea of
relativism or the idea of you being god or the
idea of self-deception you could adopt all of these as
an ideology you could just believe in these things you
could even create a church you know you could create
the church of self-deception where you go every sunday and
you discuss all the self-deception mechanisms in all the ways
in which people are deluded but as you're doing that
you're still not conscious of your own self-deceptions that's totally
possible and i'm very wary of that situation which is
why i take extraordinary measures not to do that i
could create something like that i don't in fact i
advise and caution you against doing that yourself this work
we're doing here all of it could be turned into
a belief system anything can be turned into a belief
system god can be turned into a belief system the
absolute can be turned into a belief system truth can
be turned into a belief system and it has of
times throughout history all around the world these things have
been turned into belief systems we call these christianity islam
hinduism buddhism and others and as soon as that happens
the truth is lost god is lost the absolute is
lost consciousness is lost you cannot formalize consciousness you cannot
turn consciousness into an algorithm you cannot write a book
that is the same as being conscious having beliefs subscribing
to a worldview or an ideology mouthing certain phrases none
of that is the same as consciousness even talking about
consciousness is not the same thing as consciousness you can't
systematize consciousness because consciousness is infinite and the systemitation the
system is systematization of anything is finite so the fundamental
problem here is that truth is always going to truth
with a capital t is always going to escape any
attempt at encapsulation and any attempt to encapsulate it to
symbolize it to formalize it to make it into a
technique or a mechanical method will always lead to evil
and devilry because evil and devilry is the finite and
truth and goodness and love is the infinite it's the
difference between reading books about surfing having beliefs about how
great and wonderful surfing is and how good you are
at surfing and actually being on a board in a
giant wave in the ocean maintaining your balance actively dynamically
to stay on that wave do you see the difference
what these teachings are trying to get you to do
is to actually go out on the waves and learn
how to surf that is what the finger is pointing
to that's the moon that the finger is pointing to
now if you're foolish you're going to get preoccupied on
the finger that's doing the pointing the finger that's doing
the pointing rather than the moon is your ideas about
surfing your beliefs about surfing the ideology you created around
surfing how great surfing is you might tell yourself in
your mind when you're with your friends discussing how to
surf that when you're reading books about it when you're
watching videos about it all of that is not surfing
which is just another way to say the map is
not the territory right so technically speaking actualize the work
videos when you're watching them and listening to them this
is not the same thing as being conscious you could
watch these videos consciously or unconsciously depends that depends on
you you might be watching these videos while you're playing
some video game or while you're cooking some food and
your attention is distracted and you're not conscious that's you
watching it unconsciously see the video itself does not guarantee
consciousness within you it can help ideally it can help
it's like a pointer but whether it actually lands very
much depends upon you see what's even funny is that
even when i talk about this stuff even when i'm
in the middle of teaching right now even right now
it's still not consciousness because i'm just teaching it right
now i'm trying to get these words out my focus
right now is not on being conscious my focus right
now is in communicating the words properly to you these
are two distinct pursuits and in fact when i am
in the middle of a of a teaching like right
now recording this this takes attention away from my ability
to be conscious i'm not really fully conscious when i'm
recording these videos because the opportunity isn't here i need
to be able to tell you things when i'm most
conscious is when i'm off screen you don't see me
in my most conscious you see me in my least
conscious what i'm teaching you might wonder like well leo
if if you're so conscious and all this why do
you charge money why do you sell stuff well again
understand the depth of the problem you see to be
alive is to have your nuts and a vice money
is how we prevent that vice from closing all the
way around our nuts as a society we've created that
fiction and that's how it works so as long as
you want to stay alive and i need to if
i want to teach these things to you to teach
these things to you i have to be able to
support myself and feed myself as does anyone this is
this isn't really this shouldn't shock you too much you
see the same criticism can be leveled against any scientist
or academic you can always criticize a scientist for saying
why do you receive a paycheck and what's going to
be his answer his answer is going to be well
to do my work i got to eat i got
to fuel my brain to you know think up these
theories i can't do science if i have to work
at mcdonald's to support myself and my family yeah exactly
that's true for all of us the question isn't whether
you're selling something everyone's selling something if you're working at
mcdonald's you're selling something if you're uh in any job
you're selling something even if you don't have a job
and you're a housewife you're still selling something you're selling
your reproductive ability as a housewife or sex or something
like that companionship you're always selling something to get something
else so that you can survive your survival is coming
from somewhere whether you're you know hunting and skinning a
deer to eat it to survive you could be surviving
that way or you're working at mcdonald's or you're working
at starbucks or your housewife or you're a prostitute or
you're a drug dealer or whatever you're always doing something
to survive you can't escape this it's just a question
of how deeply are you wrapped up in your survival
is your life all about survival or are you sort
of doing a moderate level of survival and then you're
using the rest of your time to actually maybe grow
your consciousness understand a few things you know like the
animals outside the birds outside all they do is survival
nothing but survival their whole life us humans we have
the luxury that we can do maybe half survival and
the other half we can do something beyond survival um
so i have to survive too i'm not somebody who's
above it all i'm in the world i'm incarnated in
the world i have to live by the rules of
our physical world and the rules of our social world
and so forth as long as i want to keep
living and as long as i want to keep teaching
and you're also bound by those rules many of the
same rules and so don't expect your spiritual teachers to
be above those rules they're in the mud with you
playing by the same rules even though all these rules
are imaginary since all of life is imaginary you got
to play by the rules if you want to maintain
your imaginary life i actually went to great lengths at
the beginning of my career to establish my financial independence
and this was crucial to the work that i'm able
to do now i surrendered a pretty great budding career
in game development in order to start my own business
and become financially independent because i knew i needed that
in order to do work that was uncorrupted by various
social influences in the future i went to through extraordinary
hell and suffering to create that for myself and this
is perhaps one of the biggest reasons that many academics
and scientists and scholars and philosophers aren't able to get
as far in their understanding of reality as i've been
able to get for the very practical survival reason that
they are participating and earning money from these institutions whose
agenda is very different from the seeking of truth originally
i wanted to be a philosophy phd and professor that
was my uh early goal in university but then as
i was starting to do philosophy within the university pyramid
system i very quickly realized it didn't take me long
it took me less than a year to realize that
if i consign myself to do philosophical work within the
pyramid system of an academic university system i will never
be able to reach the truth and that's what i
cared about so when i realized that i said i
can't be a philosopher within a university and so i
sort of gave up on that idea only when i
became financially independent completely free of any influence from any
boss any customer any corporation any business only when i
reached that level was i able to truly be able
to do philosophy independently i didn't have to meet anyone's
standards i didn't have to please a phd advisor i
didn't have to read the books they want me to
wanted me to read to write the things they wanted
me to write i could i was completely let loose
and this kind of freedom is extremely rare personally for
me creating this freedom was the most important priority in
my life in my in my twenties in my mid
to late twenties so i went through a lot of
effort to create that actualization helps me with that it
helps to keep me financially independent and it might seem
like oh that's a small thing what leo why are
you talking about this actually it's crucial it's absolutely crucial
because if you want to find the source of someone's
biggest self-biases and blind spots simply ask where his paycheck
is coming from and that tells you almost everything you
need to know about that person's biases take a look
at the survival agenda of the individual and the corporation
or organization that that individual is a part of that
is helping him to survive and defeat his family so
take a look at what is the survival agenda of
harvard of mit of caltech of the military of exxonmobil
of google of apple of amazon of facebook of the
nonprofit you're working for do they really care about understanding
reality if you're honest do they really care about seeking
truth do they care about consciousness do they care about
love are these their highest priorities or is their highest
priority the survival of that organization at any cost cost
to the environment cost to children cost to students cost
to the corruption of the mental epistemic web that all
of mankind is hooked into through advertising through media through
entertainment take a look at your church or your religious
organization are they more committed to god and love and
consciousness or are they more committed to the survival of
your church this pretty much tells you everything you need
to know when you understand this and so is it
such a big surprise that academics and scholars and philosophers
in these universities and scientists that they they don't have
a very deep understanding of consciousness and love and god
and life no it's not a surprise at all it's
completely predictable in fact the biggest surprise is why would
you be foolish enough to think that these people in
these organizations with so much ideology and group thinking paradigm
lock why would these people have a deep understanding of
reality if you want a very deep understanding of reality
you have to completely disconnect yourself from mainstream society not
in the sense that you have to become a hermit
or a recluse and not in the cult sense of
like oh you have to disown your family and not
talk to anybody no i'm not saying that i'm saying
that you have to free yourself of that vice that
your nuts are in because so long as your nuts
are in that vice what chance do you have of
really questioning things how can you question the university system
when you're a part of it how can you question
science when you're a scientist how can you question christianity
when you're a christian how can you question islam when
you're muslim how can you question uh the government when
you're occupying a high position in it and your job
depends upon you not questioning it how can you question
your family when you're a part of it and you're
committed to maintaining it see if your commitment to your
family is greater than your commitment to truth or to
law and order or something like that your family could
be engaged in criminal activity and you would ignore it
you would justify it as being okay or normal because
if you go against that you're gonna break your family
apart i know from personal experience it's broken my family
bar that's the difficulty with seeking truth is that the
only way you can find the truth is when you
put it as your number one priority the only way
you can understand anything in reality is when you genuinely
want to understand it more than you want to manipulate
other people or more than you want personal comfort for
yourself more than you want money or sex or fame
or love or whatever from others because as soon as
you want one of those things rather than understanding pure
understanding or pure truth these are these are completely different
pursuits and here you might ask leo what's in it
for me what's in it for the ego to pursue
pure understanding and truth rather than all the selfish stuff
i want the selfish stuff will the truth help me
get the selfish stuff and of course the answer is
very radical there's nothing in it for you the ego
in fact it's worse than nothing it's suffering to pursue
truth and pure understanding for the ego that's perceived as
suffering by the ego so why would you pursue it
leo why would anyone be stupid enough to pursue something
that doesn't gain them any selfish advantage in life see
if you ask that question you're already operating from a
selfish paradigm and there is no way to get to
the selfless paradigm from the selfish paradigm by trying to
ask well what does the selfless paradigm offer the selfish
paradigm nothing these are two different domains you can operate
from the selfless paradigm or the selfish paradigm and you
can't use selfishness to explain to yourself why you should
enter the selfless paradigm what you could do though is
you could notice that the more selfish you are and
the more selfish people are the worse life gets see
the trick with selfishness is it it's self undermining it's
self defeating it's finite and the beauty you might notice
of the selfless paradigm is that when you're in the
selfless paradigm you feel the most joy precisely because you're
free of the self because what you really want is
you want the love of the selfless paradigm but you
want to have it within your selfish paradigm but this
can't happen because true love is selfless and as soon
as you take love and you bring it into the
finite selfish paradigm that love turns into devilry see true
love can't have a reason when you're looking for a
reason for love you've lost love and you've deceived yourself
but to understand that requires consciousness the more conscious you
become the more appealing the selfless paradigm looks to you
the less conscious you are the more attached and needy
you are the more fearful you are the better the
selfish paradigm appears to you and then it doesn't compute
why anyone would care about the selfless paradigm but when
you're extremely conscious and you're totally selfless the idea that
someone would prefer the selfish paradigm is so ludicrous it
becomes it looks like insanity selfishness is insanity from the
selfless paradigm now which one is better which one is
right there's no such thing that's the beauty of the
selfless paradigm in the selfless paradigm you're so selfless it
doesn't even matter to you that other people are selfish
that's how selfless you are and then that's what leads
to the ultimate reunification the ultimate collapsing of this duality
of selfish or selfless and selfish is when you become
so selfless that you completely allow selfishness to flourish and
that's why it exists it also goes the other way
you can become so selfish that you experience so much
pain from that selfishness that you you kind of loop
back into selflessness because you realize that i can't live
my life for selfishness anymore and you commit your life
to selflessness so it goes full circle so my ability
to teach these teachings very much depends on my financial
independence and i'm not saying that because i'm asking for
donations or i'm asking to buy my course i'm just
i'm just saying this because this is a very important
point for you to understand because for a lot of
rational people it doesn't make sense how is it possible
that some dude on youtube just some random dude with
no phd on youtube could be talking about some of
these kind of advanced topics that are supposedly if true
you know if true contradict a lot of science and
a lot of you know prevailing ideas within universities and
you know top notch institutions like mit and harvard and
caltech and so forth how is that possible it doesn't
seem real realistic well i'm trying to explain to you
precisely why it's very realistic actually the fantasy is you
believing that these high echelon institutions are going to be
sources of the truth these these institutions cannot be sources
of the truth because for these institutions to survive they
have to be mostly spending their time attending to the
survival of those institutions which comes with a certain ideology
and worldview and paradigm maintaining those institutions in all institutions
are human constructions truth is not a human construction see
if we had a healthier society i wouldn't be here
on youtube as some you know lone individual some you
know crazy nut case by himself teaching this stuff this
stuff would be taught all in all universities to stop
this stuff would even be taught in elementary school if
we had a healthy education system but we're very far
from that we're centuries away from that our education system
is in the dark ages right now if we had
a healthy society you know i would have become a
professor because it would have been possible for me to
pursue the truth in a highly conscious organization but i
realize that that's not possible in a university system in
the 21st century now maybe in in 500 years all
that will change but right now we got the situation
we've got so um so the reality is is that
what you get from mainstream institutions schools universities governments non-profits
corporations and so forth is you get the the center
of gravity of the culture and the era in which
those institutions exist so spiral dynamics wise the center of
gravity in america for example most american universities their center
of gravity is roughly orange slash green on spiral dynamics
see my spider dynamics series if you don't know what
those colors mean but for those of you who do
that's the center of gravity so if you're going to
be listening to authorities from these institutions whether they're scientists
professors scholars philosophers public intellectuals and so forth you have
to realize that their entire survival agenda is wrapped around
this center of gravity so it's going to be roughly
orange green so maybe a little bit yellow a little
bit maybe some exceptional public intellectuals might be a little
bit yellow but that's about where they max out and
so if you're just going to be listening to them
and just following them blindly without deeply questioning all these
institutions and all of reality you're going to rise they're
gonna lift you up to their level but you're not
gonna go any higher to go higher you have to
embark on your own journey you have to free yourself
of all the attachments and all the limited thinking of
that particular stage of development to go higher and and
the higher you want to go the more radical your
deconstruction is going to have to be and the more
isolated you will feel not because i'm telling you that
you should leave your family behind or anything but just
because it will naturally happen you will become more isolated
because it's like rising out of um you know like
if you grew up your whole life as a pig
swimming in mud with all the other pigs and then
one day you got the idea that hey you know
i could like be an eagle flying in the sky
i don't have to be a pig and then when
you decide to become an eagle flying in the sky
you can look down at all your pig friends and
family members and co-workers and faculty members all you know
they're still in the mud and they're enjoying themselves in
that mud but you're soaring high above and when you're
high above there in the rarified uh you know upper
levels just by definition since it's higher there's fewer people
up there you might encounter a couple of eagles up
there but it's going to be mostly a lonely existence
it's not going to be like you know the same
kind of fun you used to had rolling around with
all the pigs eating all the [ __ ] that
they swam in so it's going to be a little
bit lonelier that's why a lot of mystics and aesthetics
and sages you know live high in the mountaintops somewhere
in some secluded retreat in a monastery somewhere in a
cave or whatever now you don't have to do that
i mean you can live in society i mean i
live in society i don't live in a cave anywhere
um but you know just there are some trade-offs just
recognize that there are some trade-offs but also the higher
you get the more you realize like i don't even
miss being in the mud anymore why do i gotta
be with all those pigs i mean do you really
need a do you need do you need 10 20
100 pig friends or would you rather have a couple
of eagle friends and just hang around you know fly
up there with the eagles look down you can you
can look down on the pigs but don't join them
in the mud is the point so uh really here's
a little bit of a deceptive aspect to my teachings
is that i speak in a very casual blunt sometimes
even obnoxious manner part of that's just my personality um
and my style and really these same ideas and teachings
could be taught in any kind of style there are
many different styles to these ideas but i just happen
to use this particular style because it just feels natural
authentic to me but um but my style can make
it seem as though the work is less serious than
it is because see if i was speaking in a
style like some crusty old boring university professor where i
just you know stood up there with a suit and
tie and i just spoke very properly and i just
kind of gave you a bunch of notes in a
very dry manner like a lecture if that was my
whole channel well i would have much less of an
audience than i have and to be fair i do
care about having an audience uh i do want to
spread these these ideas to more people so i don't
want to make my teaching so niche and so abs
you know abstract and so obstruct that that like only
academics are interested in it um part of my strategy
is that i don't target the academic crowd i target
normal people well one of the reasons that is because
the academic crowd is so deeply mired in academia that
they're never going to reach the truth it's actually easier
for me to reach an ordinary person who's not connected
with academia with these ideas than it is someone who's
in the academic system similar to like if i wanted
to teach some cutting-edge health information or methods to you
know the most educated doctors you would think well surely
they would understand it no they wouldn't the most educated
doctors who are working in hospitals they have the least
opportunity they're the most closed-minded to understanding new medical methods
and alternative medicines because they're so deeply embedded in the
system so i deliberately try to target those people who
aren't and the style i use is kind of casual
and so it might make it seem like the work
is not as serious you know like if i wanted
to be very technical i could use very big language
a lot of philosophers and academics do that it it's
it's sort of a twisted irony that i perceive most
academics and scholars and philosophers who use big words and
complex sounding ideas the actual material that they're talking about
is paper thin it's shallow and insignificant and it's not
worth your time even reading their books even though they
they fluff it up as though it's so important and
rigorous and academic and scientific but the things i'm talking
about in a very casual sort of obnoxious way sometimes
using silly examples and making jokes and whatever else and
you know being arrogant sometimes you know sometimes i'll say
i'm god you know like an academic or scientist would
never say that but the irony is is that the
kind of casual method that i use is the most
serious intellectual work you can do there is no more
serious intellectual work than this what they're doing at caltech
and mit and harvard that's that's kids games compared to
this intellectual work now that might sound arrogant it might
seem like i'm putting those people down there surely is
great work that is being done important work being done
at caltech mit harvard and other institutions they do some
great technical work but when it comes to understanding the
nature of life and existence itself that's nothing it's it's
it's less than nothing it's it's it's [ __ ]
and it's not serious it's not serious just because it's
coming from harvard or mit or caltech does not make
it serious this is serious but to understand how serious
it is you have to be able to look beneath
the surface appearances the outer style the language that's used
you have to sit and actually think through every idea
for yourself and evaluate it i'm not asking you to
believe me by all means be skeptical you might think
i'm not skeptical i am the most skeptical person in
the world i'm so skeptical that i even became so
skeptical of my own skepticism that i was able to
deconstruct and collapse my own skepticism which is an important
aspect of this deconstruction because skepticism itself becomes a very
big attachment and paradigm lock in this work but still
there's right ways to use skepticism i explained that in
my episode called true versus false skepticism go check that
out if you want more details on how to use
skepticism properly but you should use skepticism use skepticism towards
everything i say but use skepticism in a way where
you're not just dismissing it and you're using it as
a defense mechanism to deflect you know difficult truths i'm
telling you but rather you're going to use the skepticism
to then take the burden on yourself to validate these
things and so as i'm wrapping up here i should
just underscore this point anything that you learn from me
if you cannot validate it in your own direct experience
it isn't true that's the key that keeps this whole
enterprise that we're embarking upon from turning into an ideology
or belief system or a cult you must take the
burden of proof upon yourself you must invest the time
and energy and emotional labor into contemplating every point that
i make resisting the urge just to believe me because
i can sound persuasive i can be charismatic i can
sort of bully you into believing these things your job
is to resist that be skeptical yet open-minded and take
on the burden to test these things and only those
things that you've tested and that have revealed themselves to
you to be true in your experience only those things
are true so for example when i say that you
are god when i say that i am god when
i say that i am you when i say that
reality is love when i say that reality is infinite
when i say that everything including science is a hallucination
when i say that psychedelics can reveal these truths to
you when i say all these things all of that
is only true if it's true for you if you
are not conscious that i am god and you're not
conscious that you are god and you're not conscious that
reality is love and if you're not conscious that evil
doesn't exist then that means i am not god you
are not god reality is not love and evil exists
if you're not conscious that death is imaginary that means
death is real for you and no amount of believing
that death is imaginary is going to change that situation
in fact that's going to make it worse so it's
important that you're honest about where you're at because some
of the things i teach are way up here and
a lot of you are down here and it might
be tempting for you to you know as you're trying
to kind of reach here you might be taking the
fake it till you make it approach and you might
start to convince yourself that oh yeah death is imaginary
and and i am god and everything is love and
evil doesn't because you might you might start to believe
these things but you have no consciousness of these things
actually you haven't experienced them for yourself they're not true
in your experience and this this kind of fake it
till you make it in a certain sense you have
to do that you're you're you're trying to crawl your
way out of a deep hole just by hooking by
crook just you know through on your bloody you know
fingertips you're climbing out of this deep deep rocky hole
like a well um so in a certain sense it's
a struggle and you can't do it perfectly you're going
to make mistakes and you're going to struggle you're going
to do the fake it till you make it but
also as you're doing that recognize it's important to be
honest with where you're really at don't fool yourself into
thinking that you're up here when you're really down here
so maybe a more honest place for you to start
would be to say that well leo is sharing some
far out there ideas who knows maybe they can be
true maybe he's deluded maybe he's fooling himself maybe he's
hallucinating maybe he's a cult leader i don't really know
um could be could be that or maybe maybe he's
onto something but i can't just believe that he's onto
something because these are radical claims so what what can
i do to resolve this situation how can i validate
the things that he's saying and then do the work
to validate those things and if you take that attitude
then this won't turn into a cult uh now there's
also a situation that happens where when i get criticized
or actualizer gets criticized for being a cult those who
are doing the work who are part of the actualized
community they can come up and start to defend me
or my work and then this creates a problem in
a sense because it can feed into the appearance that
it's a cult because then the person who's calling us
a cult will say something like oh well but look
leo look at all your blind followers who are just
like sheep defending you that proves that you're a cult
no it doesn't prove that i'm a cult you have
to just understand how this dynamic works in social groups
if you're actually doing this work and you start to
validate some of the things that i'm saying if you
reach some of those higher peaks and you get a
glimpse of absolute truth you're gonna have some it's gonna
be a life-changing positive influence on you when you experience
that you too will sort of recognize the value of
this work and you recognize that hey you know we
should spread this this message across across society more it
would help mankind because it helped me help my friend
it would help others and so use the more you
get into this work the deeper you get into it
the more you start to appreciate it as you start
to appreciate it you might become very thankful to me
for sharing some of these ideas with you that's natural
i mean we're thankful to people who provide us with
a lot of value and so then when someone comes
and just starts saying all this actualization stuff is all
[ __ ] it's all a cult then of course
it's very natural you can see that those people want
to rise up and defend that they might even use
not the best tactics to defend it so there's that
element there's also a secondary element where some people who
are not doing the work but are just turning actualization
into an ideology there and then you know they're trying
to turn this into a cult uh that they of
course also rise up and try to defend not because
they have a deep experience and understanding of the value
and truth of this work but simply because they're just
adopting these things as beliefs they've watched a lot of
these videos and yes they will rise up and they
will blindly defend some of this work and that is
a problem so you've got a mixture of both of
these elements combining together creating sort of a messy situation
so nothing here is as clear-cut as it seems and
finally i want to end on this is that this
work is not about me because i'm charismatic and i
mouth off a bit and i'm arrogant sometimes and kind
of cocky it might seem like actualize.org is all about
leo not at all what i want you to do
is i want you to take the ideas that are
being shared and work with the ideas this is a
channel of ideas that's all it really is i'm just
sharing ideas with you these ideas are not mine per
se these are universal ideas i don't own these ideas
it's not important that these ideas come out of my
mouth or in my style or manner none of that
is important just take the ideas you don't even need
to tell people where you got the ideas from you
don't need to attribute them to me you don't need
to cite me this is not some sort of academic
game where i'm trying to get credit for ideas or
for research every idea i share with you is testable
by itself in isolation from the other ideas independent of
my own personal authority or credibility or what i say
or my style of communication or who i am as
a human you could find out tomorrow that i'm a
murderer and that will not change the idea that for
example death is imaginary or that reality is a hallucination
or that 5mu dmt will give you amazing insights into
the nature of reality or the truth that you are
god or that i am god or that i am
you or that evil is an illusion all of those
statements i just made can be tested and validated independently
of who i am or each other so this work
is really not about me i do this work despite
myself i teach these things despite all my limitations despite
my health problems despite my personal inadequacies despite mistakes i've
made in the past despite mistakes i'll make in the
future despite my fears and worries i have all that
human [ __ ] within me because i'm a human
living in life at least within this this particular dream
this incarnation so um that is that and none of
the ideas care about that or hinge on that in
the same way that we could discover tomorrow that albert
einstein was a racist a rapist and a and a
serial killer that would not change the validity of his
scientific discoveries now that is not license for scientists or
for spiritual teachers like myself to be devils or to
behave in unethical ways if i behave in illegal or
in ethical ways by all means uh you know i
should be held up uh to to the agreed upon
consequences for that i'm not immune from from any of
the of of you know those conventional social norms and
things like that and laws and rules and whatever just
like nobody is but it doesn't matter ultimately for this
work because what matters is the ideas and the ideas
exist independently of me and they can help you regardless
of my personal stuff and my personal stuff it does
infect my teachings i wish that every video i recorded
could be completely free from any personal stuff of mine
my own emotions my own prejudices my own biases my
own mistakes and errors and things i wish my work
could be flawless in that way but i can only
do the best that i can do that's what you
see here what you see here is the best that
i've been able to do now in the future it'll
probably improve that's my hope but you have to you
have to really separate the ideas from the person all
right um and again i'm telling you this precisely because
i want to preempt any possibility of turning this into
any kind of personality cult as though these are leo's
ideas it's all about leo leo is irrelevant and the
last last last lesson i promise i'm getting to the
end the last thing i'll say is this that um
i really don't like shooting videos that are reactionary a
lot of what youtube is about is about reactionary content
whether it's left wingers reacting against the right right wingers
reacting against the left atheists reacting against theists theists reacting
against atheists scientists reacting against mystics mystics reacting and scientists
like i don't want to participate in any kind of
reactionary content creation or debate with anybody now some people
take that as evidence of the fact that i can't
defend my ideas let me just clarify what this is
really about the depth of the work that i'm interested
in doing cannot be resolved through reactionary back and forth
youtube video debates or comment sections what i really want
to do with my work is i want to focus
completely on my work and deliver substantive content and as
soon as i run out of substantive content to deliver
i'm quitting youtube i'm not just going to hang around
and look for easy low-hanging fruit and cheap content to
put out there that's mostly what a lot of these
youtubers do what they do is rather than going through
the genuine labor of putting out some truly educational content
about something or really pursuing the truth of something what
they do is they just do you know criticism and
reactionary commentary this is very low effort and i have
zero interest in that kind of work so one of
the most difficult things for me to do is to
keep my eye on the ball of my purpose my
life purpose helping people to understand how their mind works
this molasses situation that i described so that's what my
energy is focused on i don't care about comments i
don't care about debates i don't care about criticisms i
don't care about people who don't understand the work i
don't care about arguing with anybody i don't care about
proving anything to anybody all of that is [ __
] compared to the actual doing of this work and
the teaching of how to do this work to people
that's a distraction right and so what egos do is
when they are agitated and they don't like something that
they that they heard something contradicts the worldview they will
start to you know get their feathers ruffled and they
will want to make a lot of noise squawk around
create distractions distractions are one of the ego's sneakiest defense
mechanisms i have a whole episode about that called distraction
go check out distraction where i explain this so i
have to be very careful not to get distracted by
a bunch of uh you know people hooting and hollering
so i that's why i don't get engaged in debates
i posted a video recently on my blog that explains
why debates don't work there's very deep profound reasons for
why debates don't work and why they're a waste of
time if you're looking for cheap easy youtube content that's
sensational gets you a lot of clicks and views debates
are perfect for that if you're interested in deep understanding
of reality if you're interested in serious truth seeking that
format is completely antithetical to such a pursuit which is
why i don't want to engage in it maybe in
the future some years down the road i'll engage in
a few debates here or there mostly for publicity's sake
it's not because i can't debate it would be very
easy to debate any atheists materialist skeptic nihilist postmodernist whatever
it doesn't matter it would be very easy to debate
these people it would just it would it would be
completely pointless other than for me to get views and
clicks which does have a point it does have a
point in that sense but um but the whole idea
that you can arrive at deep understanding of reality through
any kind of debate or even a dialogue you might
say well leo why don't you have some conversations and
dialogues why don't you do a bunch of interviews with
smart people you still don't get it you can't get
to deep understanding through talking it's all a distraction even
your dialogues and conversations and interviews and podcasts and all
this back and forth and all this it's all horse
[ __ ] it's not going to lead to deep
understanding you want some deep understanding take four grams of
mushrooms alone in a room on a two week long
retreat where you don't speak to anybody that will get
you some deep understanding you will get more deep understanding
from that one experience than you have from every debate
and podcast you [ __ ] listened to for the
last five years become very clear about what your priorities
are what do you want do you want to entertain
yourself with youtube videos about people debating ideas back and
forth or do you want genuine truth and understanding do
you want a genuine transformation in your state of consciousness
because you ain't going to get that watching these stupid
videos and listening to these reactionaries this is true not
only of spiritual stuff or philosophical ideas this is true
also of politics it's true of business it's true about
the environment if you care about a thing deeply if
you care about the environment if you care about business
if you care about helping mankind if you care about
some topic like science or evolution or religion or spirituality
watching debates and discussions is not really an expression of
your true concern for these things if you are wasting
hours and hours and hours of your life on youtube
watching this [ __ ] pretending as though you care
about this stuff you're fooling yourself it's a distraction it's
just one more defense mechanism if you really care about
the environment stop basking in the negative [ __ ]
you know do and gloom videos about the environment and
go actually do something constructive for the environment that will
show to yourself that you genuinely care about the environment
don't just sit around and and mope about how bad
it is that's too easy what action are you taking
what are you doing to focus your mind on some
specific thing you care about in life your life purpose
as i much as my teachings mature i'm noticing that
i have less and less tolerance for this kind of
social human [ __ ] i call it human [
__ ] just be very cognizant of all the entire
domain of human [ __ ] that exists everything is
filled with human [ __ ] whether it's in science
universities on youtube learn to spot the human [ __
] and set that to the side and say okay
what is my work what am i trying to genuinely
accomplish what value am i creating for the world because
there's all this noise the human [ __ ] that
i can easily get distracted into i don't really like
having to do these kind of defensive videos i would
rather focus my attention on generating genuine content i have
a book to write a massive book to write i
have other projects and business ideas that i'm serious about
i have i have a list of two or three
hundred serious videos that i need to release to have
the kind of impact i want on the world with
epistemology that's what the majority of my time and mental
energy should be going towards not arguing with anybody about
anything my work is self-explanatory it speaks for itself if
you can't understand what i'm saying through the videos you're
never going to understand it through any kind of dialogue
or debate you don't need a dialogue about this it's
crystal clear i'm telling you exactly what to do do
it experience the results or don't validate it or don't
that's the end of the story there's nothing to debate
there's nothing to argue about if you don't like my
style or my method follow somebody else if you disagree
with certain things that i say then they're not true
for you what's the problem be careful not to get
wrapped up in human [ __ ] you will waste
your whole life this way if you're not careful in
general i recommend that you devote your life to some
kind of work some kind of substantive meaningful work that
is not derivative of anybody else's work but as something
knew that you're contributing to mankind it's not a reaction
to something else it's not a critique of something it's
your own constructive work you will be a lot happier
if you do this and i'm going to be focusing
more of my future into that rather than playing any
kind of human nonsense games all right that's it i
hope that explains why actualize that org is not a
cult uh really there's no organization there's no hierarchy and
we don't we don't keep you here there's a very
loose community that we have on the forum and in
the comment sections you can participate in or not in
the future i have even considered maybe turning off the
comment sections completely maybe i'll even close the forum at
some point because in the end it's still a distraction
but for now we'll keep it see how it goes
uh i'm always very sort of leery of of what's
going on in the forum keeping a very tight lid
on things to not let it get out of control
because any time you get a bunch of people together
devilry is going to occur the less conscious they are
the more adelaide will occur and to be honest a
lot of people who watch me listen to me and
follow me are youngsters who are still very immature very
underdeveloped in their early 20s or 30s so of course
i mean i even have people in in their teens
watching this content so of course these people you know
nothing against you guys but you know you're young you're
immature that's totally natural and normal and you still have
a lot of development you have decades of development ahead
of you it'll probably take you 10 20 years of
doing this work to really start to solidify in it
to any significant extent and that's assuming you're even doing
the work not just you know listening absent-mindedly while cooking
or doing laundry um i'm seriously doing the work so
uh so yeah the the reality is that the majority
of people who follow actualize.org are not some enlightened uh
you know highly advanced folks by definition that's going to
be a small percentage of the population maybe five percent
10 something like that and in general the youtube platform
is mostly geared towards younger people so the majority of
my audience is younger and that's because i'm young you
also have to understand that i keep rambling on here
but you also have to understand that this work that
i've done in the last eight years or so this
has been work from age 28 to age 35. like
if you think about it it's pretty amazing not to
toot my own horn but to be doing this work
from from age 28 to 35 you're you're basically seeing
the tip of the iceberg of what my potential is
with this work right it's still you're still watching it
mature only like in the last year or two has
my work really started to mature it was very immature
when i look at my old older content like i
cringe at how immature it was so i'm still maturing
very much as a teacher and um a lot of
that has to do with the fact that i had
to grow myself very rapidly over the last eight years
just to keep pace with the channel because there's a
big responsibility on me not to mislead people right so
i'm very cognizant of the fact that any egoic issues
that i have and i do have them any shadow
elements that i have any ignorance that i have gets
all transferred to you my audience this can't be helped
the problem is that i wish i could just snap
my fingers and get rid of all those impurities immediately
but it's a process you know it's been like a
10 year process for me to remove many of my
ignorances and impurities and ego corruptions and that is an
ongoing process so the work is becoming less egoic and
better and more mature as i develop myself and as
i mature and so really the best of my work
is is is yet to come what you're seeing is
just the tip of the iceberg of the work and
really my best work is going to be not through
video it's going to be through the the book the
book probably multiple books that i'm going to be working
on that are still years and years maybe decades into
the future you have to really understand that when i
when i plan out my life purpose i think very
long term and my goal from the very beginning was
not just to release a few videos and to make
a channel that's popular and make some money it was
never about that it was always about you know reaching
to the deepest levels and it's taken a long time
to build up to it i had to take you
along on the journey with me and many of you
are growing fast enough to really keep pace with me
so you're getting left behind that's why some of the
latest videos you might not find interesting or relevant to
you that's just because you haven't you haven't reached it
yet it'll take you a decade to get there but
i have a responsibility to to develop myself at a
much more rapid rate than i normally would because i'm
cognizant of the effect that i have on you see
and that's good because it helps me to grow faster
if i didn't have this channel i wasn't burdened with
this responsibility then i would grow slower and i wouldn't
be as developed and as conscious as i am today
i've grown so much from the last eight years of
all the mistakes and all the comments you know i
read all the comments mostly you know hundreds of thousands
of comments by now uh a lot of it is
garbage but some of it is good advice some of
it makes me think so it makes me improve and
my work is not above criticism if you want to
criticize my curse of my work like seriously go ahead
do do a serious critique of my work but don't
don't engage in this sort of sniping um ad hominem
smearing he's a cult leader this and that it's all
[ __ ] or whatever like do take my points
and seriously if you can deconstruct them of course you
won't be able to because um uh you're not really
interested in deconstruction if you're seriously criticizing my work now
there could be minor criticisms of my work but you're
not gonna you're gonna have any serious deep criticisms my
of my work because in the end my work has
no substance to it see i'm not constructing anything that's
also what makes my work different from a lot of
other work and from cults most organizations and even humans
are trying to construct something science is in the construction
business philosophy is in the construction business religion and new
age stuff is in the construction business they're constructing mental
edifices in a sense i'm not i'm sharing ideas and
tools that you can use to deconstruct anything and by
the way when i say deconstruction i'm not just talking
about jacques deredaw's version of deconstruction i'm using deconstruction in
a sort of in my own sense independent of any
post-modernist uses of that word deconstruction is something much deeper
than any post-modernist understands or has used it for so
when i talk about deconstruction i'm talking about deconstructing the
entire mind and all of reality that's that's my bias
if you want to say i have a bias i
have a bias towards deconstructing everything that's been constructed is
that a bias yeah sure it's a bias and construction
is also a bias one is not better than the
other per se they just achieve different things construction is
very good for survival and playing games and fantasy and
deconstruction is very good for getting at the truth of
things and for um breaking out of illusions and for
jail breaking your mind so use whichever tool you want
you see you might think that actualized already has some
sort of core that's proposing like what i want to
do is i want to deconstruct everything and then i
want to turn deconstruction into my own philosophy and ideology
and then that is going to be the new construction
you might think that that's what actual drug is trying
to do no if you think that you don't understand
this work what actualization is trying to do is it's
trying to deconstruct all world views and then applying it
self-reflectively to itself in a strange loop fashion to deconstruct
even the notion of deconstruction such that ultimately you're left
with nothing you're left with absolute crystal clear perception of
reality through pure direct consciousness with no lenses so the
only way you can see what reality looks like with
no lenses is to deconstruct everything deconstruct all the lenses
and don't make a lens out of the deconstruction of
other lenses because you could do that which is what
post-modernists did and that is not good enough it's not
good enough so so really what's nice about doing such
an absolute deconstruction is that i have nothing to defend
you see most other philosophies or world views have something
that they're trying to defend marxists are trying to defend
something capitalists are trying to defend something muslims are trying
to defend something christians are trying to defend something scientists
are trying to defend something atheists are trying to defend
something even skeptics are trying to defend something their skepticism
namely nihilists are trying to defend something their nihilism post-modernists
are trying to defend something their post-modernism wouldn't it be
nice to go meta on all of that and to
just surrender the entire defense game have nothing to defend
have no idea belief or ideology or worldview to defend
see that's the genius counterintuitive move when you have nothing
to defend intellectually you're free you're free you're completely secure
you can't be phased you don't suffer anymore from a
threat to your worldview or ideology you don't need to
be afraid and you're so open-minded that you can understand
everything every worldview becomes like a toy in your hands
that you can just manipulate fumble around in your hands
look at it and then just discard it as a
toy and then move on to the next you can
appreciate them but you never identify with them you never
get wrapped up in the toy you never see it
as more than just a toy which all world views
really are and then you don't need to defend you
don't need to get angry you don't need to debate
you don't need to discuss you don't need to have
conversations you're just free you're completely non-ideological so finally let's
just end this right here with this this is the
ultimate idea everything about epistemology did i say as complex
and detailed as it is ultimately it all boils down
to this one simple rule the one simple rule is
be completely non-ideological about everything that's it be completely non-ideological
about absolutely everything and of course self-reflectively this means that
you will also not be ideological about being non-ideological i
am not saying that you turn being non-ideological into a
new worldview or belief system i am telling you to
actually behave non-ideologically i'm not telling you to think that
you're not ideological i'm not telling you to blame others
for being ideological while you fancy yourself being non-a non-ideological
i'm actually telling you something very simple which you can
do it's possible to do this be absolutely non-ideological about
everything you can do that you can also screw it
up there's a lot of ways to screw it up
and all my content is really just a way of
guiding you towards not screwing it up pointing out the
traps helping you along the way that's it and if
you want to understand a little bit more about how
ideology works see my episode called how ideology works where
i explain this in more detail all right that's it
i'm done here please click that like button for me
come check out actualize.org that's my website there you will
find the book list the life purpose course if you
want to get your sense of direction in life in
your career and your business however you plan to make
a living you can find the forum on there you
can find my blog on there where i post exclusive
content and videos and links and resources you can support
me actually not patreon.com actualized and i hope that addressed
some of the concerns and doubts and skepticisms that you
might have had about this work i hope it's clarified
what this work really is because there's a difference between
understanding what this work is versus just doing the work
kind of blindly fumbling through it the first few years
you're probably just gonna be blindly bumbling through it and
then you'll get a little bit more clear about what
this work really is it'll take some time for that
to sink in and this episode is going to do
a lot to speed that up for you i hope
by making these things very explicit whereas before they were
just merely implicit
