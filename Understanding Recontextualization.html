[Music] you when I was in elementary school in fourth
grade we had a tradition now I don't know how
it was at your school but at our school the
way it worked is is the kid whose birthday it
was was responsible for getting his parents to bring in
the cake or the cupcakes in this case to throw
the celebration party and so at the end of the
day we would have this celebration party for that kid
so on my birthday in fourth grade I got my
mom to bring in a couple of batches of cupcakes
that she got from the store it was like two
large tins for the whole class was about 30 or
so cupcakes for 30 kids and my mom brought these
in in the morning when she dropped me off at
school and then I gave these tins of cupcakes to
my teacher for safekeeping for the end of the day
when we would have the celebration and so I gave
them to her and I went off and just kind
of played around did my own stuff now it was
still relatively early in the morning maybe close to the
afternoon that I noticed one of the kids in the
class running by me with one of the cupcakes eating
it in a very sort of taunting manner very seductively
eating it and and kind of like rubbing it in
on my face like hmm Oh leo such a good
cupcake and just devouring this whole thing and then running
off and this happened and I was just kind of
like dumbstruck like how could this happen this son of
a [ __ ] stole one of my cupcakes how
could the teacher let him steal one of these cupcakes
but I tend to not be too confrontational so I
held this in but I stood and I stood for
the rest of the day all the way till the
end of the school day I stood about how this
guy got away with stealing one of my cupcakes and
I was angry at him and I was angry at
the teacher but I kept it inside and then we
had the party at the end of the day and
it went fine everyone was happy and then finally when
I was getting ready to go home the whole class
had left and it was just me and the teacher
and I just couldn't take it anymore I couldn't hold
it back and so finally I I burst out that
you'd say how could you how could you have let
this guy get away with stealing one of my cupcakes
and she says oh you mean Brendan oh yeah as
I was putting your cupcakes away into the cupboard for
safekeeping one of them fell out of the tin onto
the floor and so I was gonna throw it into
the trash can and just as I was about to
throw it in the trash can Brendan ran by and
he begged me for the cupcake so I let him
have it and that completely changed my entire feelings about
that whole situation I couldn't be angry at Brendan anymore
I couldn't be angry to teacher anymore and the whole
thing just melted away that is what I mean by
recontextualization and that's what we're gonna be talking about a
lot today there's a lot of deep stuff to say
about this I'm really excited about this topic of recontextualization
in fact this is a word a new vocabulary word
that I want you to add to your self-actualization vocabulary
vocabulary write it down and remember it because I'll be
referencing this word a lot in the future because it
has a lot of profound ramifications which we're gonna help
to flesh out today this is actually a topic from
the book that I want to write about epistemology were
I'm gonna talk about a lot of these sorts of
interesting topics of the mind what I'm really fascinated by
is the deceptive nature of the mind and how the
mind can shift perspectives how the mind can lose track
of itself get lost in its own in itself really
and there's many topics that are necessary to discuss to
explain all of that and that's what the book is
about but I'm kind of giving you a teaser about
it here one of the topics is recontextualization so what
is context context is the backdrop which frames a set
of facts and there can be different kinds of context
you can have historical context which gives you a frame
or a backdrop for some historical event or a literary
context which gives you the backdrop for a particular sentence
or passage or chapter in a novel for example right
to really understand a sentence or a chapter in a
long novel you need to read the entire novel because
that frames what that chapter means there can be social
contexts so something that you do out in public or
in a social setting like you go to a party
or whatever whether it's appropriate or not how people react
to it is going to very much depend on the
context so whatever you're doing has to match the context
the social context that you're doing it in for example
if you're at a fancy dinner party that's serving champagne
and caviar and everyone's dressed in tuxedos and ties and
ballroom gowns then you go farting in that environment that's
out of context that's gonna create problems for you on
the other hand if you're on a Saturday night at
home on the couch with a bunch of your friends
drinking beer and smoking pot and having a farting contest
then farting in that context is completely socially acceptable and
in fact it would be weird for you not to
participate they would look at you cross-eyed well they would
they would look at you cross if you if you
didn't participate there's also a metaphysical context which is well
that's the really juicy topic and we'll get we'll get
back to that in a minute now the word recontextualization
what does that mean that means a change in context
a change in framing or a change in the backdrop
which informs a certain set of facts or how you
see a certain situation now this might sound like kind
of an arcane esoteric kind of a nerdy topic likely
oh why would this be important this mechanism of recontextualization
is very important because it opens up a an interesting
possibility it opens up the possibility of radically changing your
under standing of a situation or of some brute facts
without changing the facts themselves and that's critical that's so
important and you'll understand why it's so important by the
time we get to the end of this episode because
it's probably still not clear but what I'm really driving
at is this problem that we see with science with
materialism and with rationalism people who subscribe to this paradigm
generally they commit the mistake of believing that Leo just
give me the facts you know don't worry about the
interpretations and opinions there yeah you've got your perceptions and
interpretations and opinions but then there are like the brute
scientific facts and you can't argue with those man and
so sometimes they'll criticize maybe some certain topics that I
talk about as being pseudo scientific or as being mystical
or as being fantastical or as being kind of woowoo
and sloppy not hard science because hard science deals with
the brute facts and spirituality and mysticism and personal development
and psychology this is sort of a higher order kind
of fluffy we might call it the social sciences sort
of thing it's like the division between physics and some
kind of social studies studies science like maybe anthropology or
feminism or women's study or something like that right you
make this kind of distinction the rationalist love to make
this distinction and then what they what they carry on
with that distinction is is there's a sort of like
implication from that that if you have the brute facts
as physics reports them to you those cannot be argued
with and those cannot change and therefore the fundamental building
blocks of reality can never be really challenged because those
are just the physical brute facts and what I'm saying
here with this concept of reekin sexual is recontextualization is
that now we have a mechanism for how we can
change radically changed your understanding of the world without affecting
the brute facts which is a very important mechanism because
a lot of people who are stuck within materialism and
rationalism just cannot comprehend how something like enlightenment or some
of the other mystical stuff that I talked about how
it can possibly be true because it doesn't reconcile with
the hard physical facts of a physics and of science
now in fact there is no contradiction but there can
be an apparent contradiction when you don't understand and take
into account this mechanism recontextualization what recontextualization offers us is
a mechanism for how reality can hide very significant truths
from you in plain sight and the way it does
that is because the the really deep truths in life
they are not in the brute facts they are in
the context which gives meaning and significance to those facts
as it turns out context is way more important than
content so context is the background content is the foreground
and most people get so preoccupied with the foreground or
the brute facts that they forget about the radical importance
of context and that's what I want to show to
you in this episode today I want to show you
how a change in context can flip facts around 180
degrees such that when you think something is true just
by looking at the content then by taking into account
the context you realize that actually what you thought was
true is false and vice versa what you thought was
false now becomes true and this allows us to turn
science completely inside out upside down without actually challenging the
physical facts and discoveries of materialist science because many of
their discoveries we don't want to challenge and sometimes people
will mistake me as being anti science when really I'm
not about anti science at all what we need to
do is we need to take the discoveries of science
but put them into the proper context so whenever I'm
ranting against science which I will be a little bit
in this episode I'm not ranting about the content of
science so much as I am about Sciences lack of
understanding about this problem of context so it turns out
that facts are actually not as important as people think
because what you really care about in life is not
the facts if you're honest what you care about is
you care about making sense of things you care about
understanding and when it comes to making sense or understanding
something that very much hinges upon getting the right context
such that even if you get the right content but
the wrong context you will still be wrong and vice
versa if you get the right context but you screw
up the content a little bit you get your facts
wrong a little bit you're still going to be right
in the big picture so recontextualization is such an important
concept because it explains why mind [ __ ] happen
and so really this episode here will dovetail nicely with
a prior episode that I did called the topic of
mind [ __ ] where I talk about mind Fox
and what they are and I give you many examples
so this is kind of like a part two to
that which is going to explain why these mind [
__ ] happen and how you can anticipate them and
this will help you to explain a lot of the
weird stuff that you will discover at the highest levels
of personal development and mysticism and non-duality this is a
way that we can turn the most certain convictions that
we have about reality upside down and I hope you
can see how significant that b-but let me give you
some examples just to drive this point home so let's
start with a linguistic example let's start with a phrase
like a man is jumping simple sentence right and if
I just told you let's just treat this like a
physical fact as though science was studying this and science
discovered that hey a man look a man is jumping
but what does a man is jumping really mean without
context let me show you what happens when you change
the context of a man is jumping so listen to
the following recontextualization I'm gonna say a man is jumping
then I'm gonna pause and then I'm gonna give you
the recontextualization rather what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
I'm gonna expand the context such that the meaning of
the phrase completely changes so here we go a man
is jumping on a trampoline and that's a very simple
example and maybe in that one you didn't quite notice
the change but even there I still want you to
notice the change it might have been a subtle change
so what I want you to do is go inside
and actually notice that when I first told you a
man is jumping in your mind you had some kind
of image and probably it was a very average stereotypical
image of what a man is jumping is like and
usually when you think of a man is jumping you
probably have an image of a man jumping like on
the ground maybe you imagine him jumping for joy or
jumping for some other reason but that's probably your image
but notice that there's a lot of other ways that
a man could be jumping than just jumping on the
ground or maybe jumping to throw a basketball or something
like that there's many different ways and so the additional
details that I give you change the context of what
a man is jumping really means so when I add
the additional context of a man is jumping on a
trampoline then now your picture change in it's like oh
that that significantly changes my original picture now maybe you
imagine a man jumping on the trampoline to be your
prototypical image okay well if that's the case we got
more examples which will again shift your image significantly so
here we go a man is jumping to take a
bullet for the president that's a pretty different image than
the one you originally had a man is jumping on
thin ice a man is jumping on the corpse of
his mother now notice that's a significantly different scene than
what you probably imagined when I originally said a man
is jumping you probably didn't imagine a man jumping on
the corpse of his mother and in fact in real
life if you discovered that your breast friend was jumping
on the corpse of his mother that would probably shock
you and would probably elicit some sort of emotional or
moral outrage within you some kind of emotional reaction that
might affect how you feel it might even make you
violent towards this person depending on how radical of a
recontextualization this is right like you might find out that
your best friend was sleeping with your girlfriend and when
you find that out that's gonna affect you in a
very significant way you see so the context matters very
much now if I told you that your best friend
slept with your girlfriend but really he did it because
he was forced to because they were both kidnapped by
a crazy serial killer who was into some kinky sex
type stuff and what he really wanted to do is
he wanted to watch and kind of like force these
two people into an awkward situation so he forced them
to have sex at gunpoint while he sat there watching
and jerking off to it and videotaping it for his
own amusement see again I changed the context of that
situation another time such that now again it's been recontextualized
your mind such that now you have a little bit
more understanding about the situation before maybe you were really
angry that your best friend slept with your girlfriend but
now you realize oh it was actually under the circumstances
of being under the the point of a gun it's
like oh yeah I can I can understand that and
so now again you're said your situation your understanding the
situation changes significantly so it's not just about the facts
it's about the context some more examples a man is
jumping on the head of a turtle as in Super
Mario Brothers a man is jumping in his dream a
man is jumping on TV a man is jumping in
a comic book a man is jumping into a pool
with no water so that's a double recontextualization right there
so first I told you he's jumping into a pool
and so you have an image of a man jumping
into a pool but your prototypical image of a man
jumping into a pool is probably one where the pool
is filled with water isn't it that's what you assume
you don't bother to go and really question your assumptions
and consider the possibility what if the pool is empty
so when I tell you that additional fact that turns
out to be a very significant fact and really changes
the picture that could mean the difference between life and
death whether man is jumping into a pool with water
or no water very significant you would be extremely significant
to you if it was happening to you it would
be extremely significant to you if I was telling you
this story about your child like I said hey me
and your kid we went to the pool and he
jumped into the pool but there was no water in
the pool like that that would shock you when you
heard that because you can you can you can connect
the dots you see how about a man is jumping
ahead of the gun now that one's interesting because now
we've we've even taken it out of the realm of
sort of literal meanings because now we're sort of using
it figuratively he didn't actually jump in this case in
this case we're saying that he maybe he he cheated
in the race he jumped ahead of the gun but
he didn't actually jumped he just started early he started
ahead of the clock so notice that now I've completely
changed what a man is jumping really is it has
nothing even to do with a man physically jumping up
and down a man is jumping ahead in the novel
again has nothing to do with physical jumping he maybe
is bored with some chapter in the novel so he's
jumping ahead to the next chapter for something more exciting
that's not actually a jump not a physical jump how
about a man is jumping down his wife's throat now
he's not physically jumping down her throat he's having an
argument he's scolding her something like that that's what we
mean when I originally said a man is jumping did
you imagine that I could have meant that he's actually
jumping down his wife's throat probably not that's probably very
far from what you thought I meant notice that there's
this entire ever-expanding almost infinite field of possibilities for what
a man is jump a man is jumping really means
and you basically didn't consider almost any of them when
I first started talking about this now as I'm talking
more you're starting to expand your domain of possibilities now
you're starting to think a little bit outside the box
how about a man is jumping out of his skin
or a man is jumping to conclusions or a man
is jumping through hoops now he's not literally jumping through
hoops we usually say this figuratively he's jumping oops to
please somebody or to do something for his company to
get through some red tape that sort of thing a
man is jumping at the opportunity how about this a
man is jumping into bed with his mother certainly changes
the meaning of things isn't how about this one a
man is jumping out of an airplane with a defective
parachute in his dream in a movie that was one
two three four that was four recontextualization x' in one
scene and notice how significantly different that is imagine if
you were in that situation imagine if you were jumping
out of an airplane with a defective parachute but then
you realize oh this is just a dream but then
actually this wasn't even a dream it was being depicted
on a movie screen that this was happening you see
how we're we're [ __ ] with the reality of
the situation so the question is what's actually real here
is this a movie is this a dream is this
real life what really is it and how do we
know when we finally gotten to the truth of things
to the ultimate context you see the problem with context
is that if we can keep expanding the context forever
how will you ever know when you've gotten to the
bottom line and if you haven't gotten to the bottom
line then how can you actually be certain that anything
you know is actually true and this is a really
deep problem of epistemology this is the problem of knowing
how do you know anything for sure how do you
know that the thing you know won't be radically recontextualized
by some future discovery that's why this concept is so
important put another way recontextualization is imagine a picture such
that when you zoom out the entire meaning of the
picture gets reversed imagine a portrait photograph of a woman
who's smiling and she's just happy like this but then
you zoom out a little bit and you see there's
a gun pointed to her head and the man is
starting to pull the trigger unless she smiles certainly changes
the entire context of that photograph doesn't it just by
zooming out a couple of feet you get to see
that gun that wasn't visible there before so before you
might have said oh yeah the woman is happy like
this he's just happy but when you see the gun
the smile even though she's smiling that no longer says
she's happy the situation has changed entirely so my question
to you is how do you know that everything that
you understand as rock-solid physical reality won't be recontextualized in
the future to be something that right now it isn't
just by a little bit of zooming out think about
that we'll get back to that here's another example here's
an image imagine a man who's resting comfortably on a
soft silky cushion in a coffin six feet underground while
he's still alive so it's a double recontextualization imagine this
one picture a hot girl at a nightclub if you're
a guy who's really into you or maybe if you're
a girl imagine a hot guy is really into you
he's handsome he's attractive he's six foot tall muscular really
into you but then this girl this guy turns out
to be a prostitute wow that certainly changes the situation
doesn't it when you learn that does that ever happen
to you it's happened to me once or twice especially
here in Las Vegas happens pretty often actually happens so
often you get good at seeing it before it even
comes still sometimes it catches you off-guard and it's like
damn that was that was quite a mindfuck but let's
go further imagine further that this hot girl is a
vampire she's a prostitute and she's a vampire now that
really changes the situation doesn't it you would think twice
about sleeping with her then imagine a man is covered
in blood who's riding into battle on a horse in
a Civil War Reenactment in front of a blue screen
on a Hollywood film set as seen by an editor
on his computer as he's editing the final movie that
was a triple recontextualization so originally you just had the
man riding into battle and you assumed that it was
just a real battle that's what you just assume that's
your implicit assumption but then no it's a reenactment so
they're just pretending they're not really gonna kill people okay
but then oh no it's it's not even a reenactment
it's a Hollywood set and it's not even Hollywood set
this is something now now an editor is watching on
his computer screen after it's long been filmed years later
perhaps you see how we're [ __ ] with the
reality of the situation and how easily you can get
confused if you just focus on the content and ignore
the context it's really important to know that this whole
thing is happening inside of a computer and not real
life and if you confuse those things you can see
how that can read to lead to great delusion so
now you're starting to see why the big picture is
so important and why I emphasize big picture thinking in
pretty much all of my content so much because the
big picture can completely recontextualize the little picture and so
if you get overly preoccupied with a little picture you
get the little picture totally right but you can screw
up the big picture which will render your little picture
completely useless in the same way that you can win
a battle in a war but lose the whole war
so what I'm really concerned about in life because I'm
a human being first and foremost before I'm a scientist
before I'm a philosopher before I have a speaker before
I'm a businessperson I am a human being and as
a human being as a living thing which is a
part of reality I am therefore a reality because anything
that is living is by definition a part of reality
therefore as reality the highest-level issue that I'm concerned about
is what is reality and getting that picture right because
if I get that picture wrong everything else is content
within reality and so my number one priority then becomes
in life to find out am I getting the right
context for what reality is unfortunately most people don't approach
life that way and that leads them to great delusion
and much problems emotional problems relationship problems problems in science
problems the philosophy promised within psychology and everywhere else political
problems social problems sexual problems all the problems stem from
this ultimate problem which is why I stress the big
picture and which is why would I encourage you to
do is to make a commitment right now and for
the rest of your life to be really focused on
the big picture and to not get lost in the
details in the minutiae this is a very sneaky and
subtle trap that a lot of very intelligent people fall
into there are many people in the world who are
top-notch academics and have PhDs and even Nobel Prizes but
they get those Nobel prizes and PhDs for little picture
thinking not for big picture thinking and even though their
little picture can be good their big picture can be
terrible and then from that everything else goes wrong what's
more important than the facts is how the facts get
selected and framed and this is the biggest thing that
science modern science struggles with they're really really good at
finding the facts but they're terrible at properly selecting the
facts and properly framing and interpreting the facts in fact
there is an entire denial there's a philosophical denial that
what I'm talking about here is even significant to the
enterprise of science scientists act as though the facts are
just the facts man and we'll just discover them and
whatever they are they just are and the fracks they're
not biased my ego is not going to up use
the facts and it doesn't matter which facts I select
and how the facts are framed I ask none of
that stuff is significant and maybe they'll can see that
ilio yeah maybe maybe what you're talking about is true
in the social sciences maybe in the social sciences it
is important how the facts are selected and how they're
framed but not in the physical sciences not in chemistry
not in biology not in physics not in mathematics this
is the problem that in and of itself is little
picture thinking which ignores the significance of context the most
important context is metaphysical context what do I mean by
this I mean that you have a backdrop an entire
web of concepts which is used for interpreting your very
present experience that you are having right now and your
entire experience of life including science mathematics and relationships and
business and politics and anything else that you will ever
do in life and the problem is that this context
is never made explicit nobody ever tells you what this
context is context is when you're going to school when
you're in college when you're learning at work and other
places nobody really explicate sit for you and so you're
walking around with this metaphysical web of beliefs which constitute
the context the metaphysical context that you are interpreting all
of reality from it's the backdrop against which you see
the foreground and you're unaware of this backdrop and you're
not even aware that you are interpreting reality you just
take your interpretations it has reality and that's the whole
problem so what are some examples of this metaphysical context
that I'm talking about well there's uh there's a lot
of stuff there's a lot there's so much of it
that it would take you years to fully explicate it
that's why it's so challenging and it's really buried deep
in your mind but but generally here's the metaphysical context
that most human beings have it's the dualistic materialistic context
so you actually believe and you right now are interpreting
your present experience from the following context you believe that
you were born that you are a human being that
you are alive in the 21st century that you are
inside of a universe this is a physical universe it
has a lot of depth to it and basically the
deeper you go the more you zoom une zoom in
ultimately you discover that it's physical istic and that it's
made out of molecules and particles and that particles are
bouncing around and this stuff is happening and that this
can be tracked with the laws of physics and mathematics
you believe that you will die and you have this
sort of even further even a deeper context sort of
a meta context which tells you that none of this
stuff that I just said is context you believe that
it's fact of course there's a lot more that we
could add to it but this is just sort of
the beginning just to start to reveal a little bit
of this context to you here's some examples that will
further illustrate what I'm talking about here with metaphysical context
so when you are outside have you noticed this when
you look at the Sun setting or rising you can
look at it in two ways one way you can
look at is you can actually look at it as
though the Sun is setting let's say and so you're
seeing the sunset now visually the Sun is setting but
of course you know just from basic elementary school science
classes that the Sun is actually not moving it's the
earth which is rotating and the earth is kind of
rotating backwards and it's because the earth is rotating backwards
that it appears the Sun is sort of rotating forwards
over the horizon now be honest when you actually look
at the Sun setting do you think of the Sun
as moving or are you conscious that it's actually the
earth that's moving that's a tricky one because you might
actually be very scientific you might be a physicist you
know I took I took two years of advanced physics
and in university I was studying to be an aerospace
engineer and I was good at physics I enjoyed physics
but when I still go outside today and I look
at the Sun if I'm honest to me the Sun
looks like it's setting and I don't usually think of
the earth as spinning I think of the Sun is
actually moving now of course I know better logically I
know better if I go inside my mind I think
about it yeah of course I know what's actually happening
I know the theory but here's the point the point
is that all of that theories context what's you're literally
seeing in both cases whether you think the Sun moves
or it doesn't whether you are a modern human being
today who knows that the Earth orbits the Sun or
maybe or somebody from a thousand years ago back before
Copernicus who believed that the earth was the center of
the universe in both cases the empirical evidence is identical
when you look at the Sun it always appears that
the Sun is sort of moving that's what it appears
like you never actually experience the earth moving so whether
you believe the earth if you believe that the earth
is actually moving what that is is that's a context
you see it was actually a through ingenious some genius
person like Copernicus had to come along and had to
recontextualize the situation come up with a conceptual framework which
actually says no it's not how it appears it's actually
backwards from what it appears it appears we you know
we humans have been alive for thousands of years and
it's always appeared that the Sun was was moving around
the earth and but no that appearance is wrong he
had to create that conceptual context for himself to recontextualize
a situation and then when he looked at the the
Sun it looked very different to him in that context
even though the facts the situation didn't actually change that's
why science is so tricky it's never about looking at
something and just saying oh that's what it is it's
never that simple because to say that something is this
way or that way is to have a conceptual web
of background beliefs which is informing what you're saying which
is why science gets itself into a lot of trouble
and can easily misinterpret and misunderstand reality even though it
gets the facts right technically the facts are right like
if a scientist 2,000 years ago measured the motion of
the Sun he could measure the actual motion of the
Sun like it moves a couple of inches per per
hour per 5 minutes or whatever span of time you
want to calculate it as so he can actually measure
the rate of the sun's motion and that would be
true technically the measurement is correct the question is what
is he actually measuring that's what really matters a similar
thing we could say as an example is how you
view the Stars today today when you go out and
you look at the Stars because you have a background
context that you got from elementary school which informs you
of what stars really are stars are just Suns just
very far away so you look at them and you
and your takes your breath away maybe if you're out
in the desert you're looking at the Milky Way and
it's just like hundreds now you see all these thousands
of stars and it's just amazing and you realize like
oh my god those are all solar systems an entire
galaxy so far away just like our Sun they probably
have planets like ours rotating around them but what is
that you're not seeing any of that in that picture
that's not evident in your perceptions that's all conceptual context
now you might say Leo but it's true but the
question is how do you know it's true because someone
told you in school have you ever actually taken a
telescope and look through the skull telescope to confirm that
stars are actually Suns is that even possible with a
kind of amateur telescope or would you need some sort
of like massive laboratory telescope to be able to confirm
that if even you could with one of those maybe
you need the hull of Hubble telescope to confirm that
see have you actually looked with your own eyes no
probably not and yet you believe it and see this
is the blind spot of science is that although science
believes and likes to tell itself that it doesn't operate
on beliefs because it's fact-based and it's empirical that's only
a half truth the reality is is that 99% of
what you call science is purely conceptual and within those
99% is where all the epistemic errors happen where you
make gross errors about the nature of reality within those
99% now you could say Leo but some of those
conceptual contextual things that I have in the back of
my mind for example that that stars are actually Suns
it's true ultimately if we took the Hubble telescope and
we photographed it we would find out that it's true
maybe you're assuming that though you see that's also a
part of your context is you're assuming that's true without
actually having ever verified it therefore technically if we want
to be epistemic ly technically accurate here your belief that
stars or Suns is technically no different than a fundamentalist
Islamic terrorists belief that killing civilians will get him into
heaven there is absolutely no difference Epis Toma logically there
if we want to be technical there will be a
difference if you actually pull out a telescope and look
through that telescope and you can actually verify for yourself
but until that is just a belief and that's how
it is for most of science so while it's true
that there is a difference between science and religion in
the sense that science has that 1% of empirical validation
it still has 99% of concepts and webs of belief
and lots of stuff taken on blind faith and what's
even more similar between science and religion is that you
will adamantly deny that what I'm saying here is actually
true you will want to draw a sharp boundary if
you're a materialist or scientist or an atheist or rational
so you will run a draw a very sharp demarcation
between science and religion and you will want to say
that there is a big difference there's a big difference
because science is empirical and we can validate it with
with formulas and the difference is Leo that in the
past human beings have have have actually looked at this
stuff Galileo he looked at and he verified it for
us or somebody else verified it for me right but
the what the fundamentalist Islamist will say the same thing
that in the past Mohammed has verified all these truths
for him and so today he's just standing on the
shoulders of giants the way that you are standing on
the shoulders of giants so whose true who's right who
are you gonna believe you see the problems here very
tricky stuff how about atomic theory as an example you
probably if you're scientifically minded you think about what is
reality and you look at objects maybe sometimes even get
an object and you start to wonder like oh look
look at that look at that coffee mug that's sitting
on the table always smash atoms and those atoms are
made of moloch subdivision of subatomic particles and quarks and
strange or whatever nonsense you believe in but notice that
that that's all conceptual contextual stuff that you bring to
the situation in fact you've never actually seen an atom
in your entire life see so it's very significant for
you to start to understand and to start to distinguish
between what is actually empirical fact in your direct experience
versus conceptual metaphysical background stuff because we're all your mistakes
lie is in your conceptual metaphysical background stuff so the
mistake that people make when they hear me criticizing science
is they think that what I'm criticizing science on is
the empirical data no I don't criticize the empirical data
the empirical data is what it is like if you
take that coffee cup and you measure it with a
ruler and you find out that it's two inches wide
that's what it is I don't dispute that part what
I dispute is all the conceptual baggage that you bring
into the situation and how you think of that cup
and all of the theories you have about it and
what you think it means and where you think it
came from and all of that because none of that
is actually found in direct experience all of that stuff
is a vastly complicated web of metaphysical concepts that are
interlinked to each other in a very complicated and messy
manner and that can lead to all sorts of problems
and it's there that the problems lurk not in the
actual coffee cup and the measuring of the two-inch diameter
and all that sort of stuff and of course if
you're a student of history especially epistemic history and scientific
history then you know that what I'm described here perfectly
explains all the scientific Tiffany's and discoveries and recontextualization that
have happened throughout scientific history so for example we had
Isaac Newton who basically thought that there was absolute time
in space and objects moved around in it there was
gravity blah blah blah and then Einstein came along and
shattered that entire paradigm radically recontextualized it got rid of
the notion of absolute time absolute space they became entangled
time and space are now entangled and there's no such
thing as absolute velocity no such thing as absolute position
and many such other quandary switch are very paradoxical and
tricky and and that completely changed how you view reality
although of course the problem is that people don't go
around thinking of reality on terms of Einstein's general relativity
they still have a very naive view of reality they
have the Newtonian view of reality so really most people
even the most scientific people in practice their view of
reality is about 400 years out of date if you
want to be if you want to be true to
science and then of course after that came quantum mechanics
and quantum mechanics further complicated things and really broke our
conventional notions of physical three-dimensional reality this is sort of
just completely flew out the window but of course most
people don't think of the world in a quantum mechanical
way and that's right in quantum mechanics itself is a
conceptual scheme you have to understand there's a lot of
shenanigans that go on within how science misunderstands quantum mechanics
so it's all tricky stuff Darwinian evolution is another one
of these examples today because stage orange Spile dynamic stage
oranges is on the rise materialism sunrise atheism is on
the rise all these are popular science popular religion is
kind of becoming a an old ancient archaic dinosaur that's
dying out at least by mentalist religion so with that
people now view the whole world as a sort of
Darwinian evolution playground works like all are evolving and and
installed darwinian is survival of the fittest but you don't
actually see evolution in progress if you're if you're honest
about it it's a contextual scheme that you bring to
some situation and then that colors how you view your
relationships how you view sports how you view business and
competition and governments and societies and economics like all this
is colored by these conceptual schemes that you have and
yet most people just accept it as fact now I'm
not denying here per se that Darwinian evolution is false
I'm not denying general relativity I'm not denying that the
earth is is orbiting around the Sun I'm not denying
any of these things I'm just pointing out what these
things actually are they are conceptual schemes and they are
context and if they are context that means they can
be recontextualized and that's the key that's why this is
so important of course you can really start to appreciate
the importance of context with the example of the matrix
that's why that movie was so such a big cultural
phenomenon because it really got you to buy into the
significance of what recontextualization is neo discovers that he's inside
the matrix that completely changes what he thinks reality is
for him and that opens up the possibility of escaping
the old context into some radically new context or in
his case actually escaping the matrix entirely and of course
that's ultimately why we're talking about context is because what
you can discover is you can discover how to escape
this entire conceptual contextual game but there's more to it
than just that so there's really two kinds of recontextualization
what I call ordinary and radical the ordinary kind is
like my cupcake story a surprising twist or a shock
but it's not reality shattering when I discovered that this
cupcake fell on the floor and that actually my friend
didn't steal it or my my school buddy didn't steal
it that you know that didn't shake my reality that
wasn't really a metaphysical discovery the physics of reality didn't
change but it was still psychologically significant to me it
affected my mood it affected my emotions that affected my
attitude and so you will find in your own life
probably examples like my cupcake story where stuff was recontextualized
for you this is sort of like on the level
of psychology or in the social domain and that was
very significant for example if you're depressed some recontextualization in
the psychological or social domain could could lift that depression
or maybe you're depressed because you're improperly you're putting certain
situations or facts in your life into improper context so
that's what therapy is often about is about changing the
context the psychological context but this is still ordinary recontextualization
so examples of this would be plot twists in movies
like Star Wars Fight Club unusual suspects like the Luke
I am your father or recontextualization see that was very
significant because that completely changed how you viewed Luke and
Darth Vader and their relationship after you discovered that Darth
Vader is Luke's father or in Fight Club the twist
at the end when you discover by the way spoiler
alert um if you when you discovered that the two
main characters actually identical they're one in the same character
that recontextualizes in an instant everything that was going on
previously in the movie and that's very significant and notice
what your mind does in that situation when you have
that aha moment that epiphany that recontextualization your mind that
has to backtrack go back into the past go through
all the scenes in the movie think through the again
but now refactor them or recontextualize them to put them
in the proper context because it realizes oh [ __
] 90% of the whole movie was in the wrong
context and that's what's so enjoyable and amazing about that
movie if people like that movie I'm actually not a
big fan of that movie but um that's for another
day same thing with usual suspects when you discover at
the very very end that Kevin Spacey's character who was
playing stupid the entire time was actually the evil villain
villain Keyser söze when you discover that and it's like
the very end of the movie and he's able to
escape and and then you have to go back and
have to refactor all the scenes and think about them
ah oh oh ah oh he was yeah he planned
that oh he did all like how evil he was
that so everything changes how about if you discovered that
the person who bullied you in school did so because
his mother died from cancer that would be pretty significant
wouldn't it again that's not a metaphysical recontextualize entrains your
understanding of physical reality but psychologically that could be very
significant like you could have harbored some animosity towards that
bully for 1020 years of your life but then maybe
you you meet him at a class reunion you discover
that actually all what happened back then is that his
mother died from cancer and that's why he was such
an [ __ ] to you it's like oh oh
dude I understand okay I understand and then you can
let go of that see how about if you discover
that you were adopted that would be a pretty significant
but still ordinary what I call the ordinary type of
recontextualization it would be very significant to psychologically but you
wouldn't change your saying of reality and then of course
there's the second type which is the really interesting type
which is what I call radical recontextualization this is one
where actually it effects physical reality it flips some aspect
of physical reality inside out radical recontextualization of this kind
can come from psychedelics yoga meditation self-inquiry contemplation really any
kind of contemplative or mystical practices and in fact that's
the whole point of doing those practices is to recontextualize
this very present moment that you're having right now so
the reason I'm talking about this is because there is
something hidden in plain sight right now within this very
experience that you're having right now such that if we
recontextualize this very present experience you will realize that what
this present experience is and has always been your entire
life has not been life this isn't life that's happening
right here this is not a physical universe you're not
inside some sort of Big Bang right now you're not
really a human being you're not even having this experience
right now even though you think you are you think
you're having an experience right now because of the context
in which you're framing it that's a conceptual context when
you remove that context this very present experience it won't
physically change per se I'm not saying that some magical
unicorn will fly in here and angels will will come
down from the clouds and God in His bearded form
will appear to you sitting on a throne glowing with
light I'm not saying that I'm saying that this very
boring mundane experience you're having right now will be recontextualized
such that you will awaken to the fact that this
right here is God this this it's been God the
whole time that's a radical recontextualization when you discover that
this is God you also discover that you were never
here this was never your life there isn't just one
such radical recontextualization there are many which is why there
are many facets to awakening which is why awakening is
a complicated topic and it's not a simple mind it
is just hey I'm awake and that's it and it's
done no there's many facets other examples of radical recontextualization
include for example realizing that perception is actually being that's
one facet that's basically what I just described to you
another one is disco is discovering that actually you are
God another one is realizing that reality everything you see
here is a dream or a hallucination that's another facet
all of these facets are in a sense related but
also distinct from each other you can realize that everything
here is made of consciousness you can discover that every
material object is consciousness I've talked about that the past
in my what is consciousness episode you can realize that
there's no such thing as past and future that past
and future are just concepts and that there is only
eternity so this moment that's happening right now it's not
it's not a instant in a long timeline this moment
that's happening right now this very word that I'm saying
now and now and now and now each one of
these words has existed for eternity even though it's seeming
like right now time is flowing and I'm saying different
words and it's seeming like the words I said just
a second ago are now gone that's how it seems
but each one of those exists in eternity and this
very moment right now is eternity but for you to
be conscious of that you need a radical recontextualization to
happen and notice that a radical recontextualization is not a
belief it's not something you believe it doesn't help that
you believe it it doesn't help that you believe in
God it doesn't help that you believe me all the
stuff that I'm saying that doesn't help you at all
that doesn't change the context unless it actually does if
it does then some radical [ __ ] will happen
to you and then it'll be way beyond belief for
you but uh the point is actually have the recontextualization
happen not to talk about it not to think about
it not to believe it but to have it happen
that's a crucial distinction you can also have a radical
recontextualization where you realize that non-existence is a concept and
that actually there's no such thing as non-existence everything exists
that's pretty radical to realize that you can also have
another radical recontextualization where you realize that everything that you
see around you right now and all of reality is
actually nothing and that it never actually happened so what
I'm talking about right now and everything that I've been
saying in my scene like this stuff is actually happening
in real life but actually if you properly recontextualize what
this is that's happening here you will realize that actually
it's nothing and that nothing has ever happened that's a
pretty deep one you're not likely to get that one
very easily you can also recontextualize every physical object such
that if you take a physical object like let's say
you take a pencil you can look at that pencil
and you can look at it for so long that
and you remove all the metaphysical baggage that you have
that you're projecting onto it that you're using to interpret
it such that the finiteness of the pencil will disappear
and you will you will become conscious that this pencil
is actually infinite that's pretty radical unto you can also
recontextualize all of reality such that you discover that you
actually created the universe you created it that's a pretty
radical one too of course you can recontextualize to discover
that actually you you never existed you were never born
and you will never die and now what you are
is you're a concept you are a concept you were
born as a concept and you will die as a
concept but this experience that's happening right now this is
not a concept the experience is not a concept but
you what you think you are that human being that's
a concept the body's not a concept but you inside
the body that's a concept that's pretty pretty uh pretty
deep one to other examples imagine if you discovered that
what life is really isn't you being a human being
who's just kind of like living to survive according to
Darwinian evolution but actually you are something that an alien
species is simulating in their computers in order to harvest
your experiences to learn from your experiences in life such
that when you're going through all the [ __ ]
you're going through in life like when you're you know
you stub your toe in the morning and it hurts
aliens are collecting that information or just like storing it
in their databases or like when you're sitting there eating
an apple they're collecting that information I'm like what apples
tastes like and they're kind of storing it in their
databases and when you fall in love they're collecting that
and when you're when you're having sex they're collecting that
and when you get cancer and you're dying don't they'll
collect that experience it'll sort of collecting all these experiences
so imagine if that if you discovered one day if
I'm not saying this is this is actually possible I'm
saying if imagine if you could discover something like that
how radically that would recontextualize your very experience of life
every notice that every single moment from that point on
would be completely different for you even though nothing would
really change about your life your life would still go
on you just have to get up in the morning
and you still touch stub your toe and you'd still
eat apples and you still have sex and you still
maybe get a disease at some point and die all
that would still happen but how you thought of it
would radically change if you knew for a fact that
aliens were collecting all of your data and that what
all this was was just a matrix like simulation for
the pleasure and entertainment of aliens maybe aliens are sitting
somewhere up there looking at this it's like a viet
video feed and jerking off to it you don't know
imagine if you discovered that that would certainly change how
you view life wouldn't it probably would so that's why
it's so important this concept imagine if you discovered one
day that you chose your parents you weren't just accidentally
born through some physical process but actually before you came
into your body into existence on this earth that you
actually selected the precise situation that you would place yourself
if you selected your parents you selected the part of
the well first you selected the timeframe the specific era
and year within human history that you would be born
so you decide I'll be born in in the 20th
century or the 21st century and then you decide okay
I'm gonna be born in some country I'll be born
in Africa in some remote village and you decided that
for some specific reasons because you wanted to experience what
Africa was like in the 21st century and you wanted
to experience what it was like to get malaria and
you wanted to experience what it was like to to
live in a place where there was no stable government
and where people were running around with machetes and chopping
at each other and and maybe trading drugs and doing
this sort of stuff or maybe you decided no I
want to be born in in some Western European democracy
in the 25th century where life is sweet and it's
just this is communist utopia where I can just be
born and not have to work and just get supplied
with with schooling and education up through through University and
life is easy and drugs are available for for free
to everybody I could smoke pot and do this and
this or maybe you decide no I want to go
back into like fifth century Arabia and see what life
was like then or maybe I wanted I want to
experience what life was like as a slave in the
colonial south and you discover that then you actually you
incarnate and you go into that body and then you
live that whole life now if you actually discovered I'm
not saying that's true I'm saying if you discovered that
how do you think that would affect your attitude about
life as you're still living inside of it that would
be pretty significant wouldn't if you have a disease of
some kind of some kind of physical ailment imagine if
you discovered that you created that disease for some reason
that would be pretty radical because right now of course
if you have this disease you think of yourself as
a victim it's like oh poor me why do I
have this disease why am I still cursed why do
other people not have this disease what if you created
that disease for some higher purpose I'm not saying that's
true I'm just saying just consider it that's a possibility
what if you discovered one day that you are the
source of all the evil in the world it's not
that there are people running around they're terrorists and Nazis
and so forth who do evil things to two people
for god knows what reasons but that you actually created
all of that evil yourself I'm not necessarily saying it's
true I'm just saying imagine if you could discover that
how significantly that might recontextualize your entire life most people
of course deny the possibility of radical recontextualization they will
agree with me of course yeah Leo ordinary recontextualization is
possible I've had experiences like your cupcake story yeah that
stuff does happen but now you're just getting outlandish with
this stuff you're just being fantastical you're just coming up
with stupid examples about aliens and diseases and evil and
and this and that and and God and whatever else
you're just coming up with these silly examples but you
can't really have that happen in reality because reality is
real but of course how do you know reality is
real that's the question the reason that people do not
want to admit of the possibility of radical recontextualization is
because it undermines your sense of reality is very threatening
it's destabilizing it on more's you because reality for you
is like an anchor it's the thing that you can
ground yourself in so that you can start to make
sense of the world and live your life imagine what
would happen if you had no anchors if you didn't
know what was real if you woke up in the
morning you didn't even know if if this stuff was
real how would you live what would you do how
would you know what's right and what's wrong all of
those would be very important questions and you'd be confused
about it and you wouldn't know who to turn to
because you might go to some professor and ask him
but how can you trust the professor how do you
know that what he tells you is actually right you
see by asking a professor you're grounding yourself in the
professor's authority by asking the Quran you're grounding yourself in
the Quran Zathura t by coming up with your own
theories you're now grounding yourself in the authority of your
own theories or logic or whatever so what every human
being fundamentally is doing is they are somehow finding a
way to anchor themselves otherwise they have an existential crisis
they don't know what to do or what they're doing
here you don't even know if you were born if
you really are honest because to know that you were
born you have to anchor yourself in your memories your
memories you have to believe that they're reliable how do
you know that well leo my memory usually is reliable
but how do you know that how do you know
some some fake memories weren't implanted into your mind when
you were created maybe you were you were genetically engineered
in some test tube and then we implanted your mind
with some memories that you were born in such a
such a place to such and such parents and under
such and such conditions how do you know you see
but this [ __ ] with your reality too much
people usually don't like having their reality [ __ ]
with which I find actually really odd because I love
getting my reality [ __ ] with to me this
is the best stuff ever like the more my reality
of [ __ ] the better I love it I
love it it's a it's almost like sex you know
like a really feminine woman will love to get her
brain's [ __ ] out and you got to approach
reality in the same way even if you're a man
you gotta like kind of want the the magnificence of
reality to [ __ ] your brains out to mind
[ __ ] like literally mind [ __ ] you
until your sense of self is destroyed and that's what
enlightenment is it's the most beautiful thing it's the most
amazing thing but it does require surrender it does require
humility it requires a sort of acquired taste for getting
mind [ __ ] and some people they don't like
that because they're too busy protecting defending clinging to stuff
you know every ego is clinging to stuff why do
you think it's cling to stuff fundamentally you're clinging to
stuff because that's how you ground you got to ground
yourself in something and whatever you ground herself in is
gonna be a thing even an idea is a thing
a Bible a professor your university diploma what your parents
told you what Mohammed told you you know whatever you're
trying to ground yourself even some past mystical experience you've
had if you've had an enlightenment experience in the past
maybe just had a glimpse a little awakening then it
went away a for a few days okay but now
see you're trying to ground yourself in that but the
point is that reality is fundamentally groundless and that's what
nobody wants to admit imagine just imagine if one day
in the future mankind discovered a truth about reality that
was so radical that it undermined the foundations of all
of modern mathematics just invalidated the entire field of mathematics
is that possible is such a thing possible if you
ask most scientists rationalist atheists materialists and ordinary people they
will say no and what I just want you to
consider is that maybe it's possible now the mistake here
would be to to say leo but how is it
possible because you see as soon as you ask the
question how is it possible that now opens us up
to the next problem which is a failure of imagination
don't confuse a failure of imagination on your part with
impossibility or possibility on the part of the universe the
universe could have a lot of tricks up its sleeve
you gotta stay humble and not think that just because
I can't imagine it it can't happen that is the
source of much epistemic wrong think and delusion so the
moral of the story with all this recontextualization business is
that I just want you to start to take radical
recontextualization seriously as a possibility that will really open up
your mind and open you up to the highest levels
of development stage turquoise I want you to take seriously
the idea that actually facts in and of themselves are
rather meaningless and which what's far more important is the
context in which the facts are placed really deeply understand
that you can have all the right facts but still
deeply misunderstand reality which is the whole problem with modern
science it gets the facts right but it gets the
understanding wrong wrong context is the perfect self-deception mechanism so
add this one to that list of self-deception mechanisms I
gave you in my self deception three-part series scientists and
rationalists underestimate the degree to which 180 degree reversals of
factual situations are possible through changes of context science is
really good at context but terrible I mean sorry really
good at content but terrible at context academics are needed
to get the content right and mystics and sages are
needed to get the context right so you see we
do need both I'm not saying academics are completely useless
and that we should burn them all at the stake
as much as maybe I would enjoy that no academics
they serve a valid function lab technicians they serve a
valid function we need technical scientists to go out there
and do the measurements but don't count on them to
get the big picture right for that you need sages
and mystics so it's really by combining the two together
that you get the best understanding of reality possible you
get the context right and then you also get the
content right and don't make the mistake of thinking just
just because you got the context right that then you
will automatically understand all the content no for example the
Buddha got the context right but the Buddha didn't know
anything about nuclear physics or about evolution or about biology
or about cells or about astronomy or about cosmology right
he didn't know about these things because those things are
content so when you get enlightened that's about getting the
context right you become aware and awake to the context
and by the way the context for everything is the
universal self I I is the context of everything but
then the content part of your awakening is that you
realize that the content is infinite so this is why
science will never end it will keep going on and
on and on forever which is actually really interesting because
see if the content is actually infinite like I'm saying
that means that all the sides that mankind has done
for the last two thousand years let's say it is
infinitely far away from understanding all of the content on
reality because the content of reality is infinite and the
science that man has done is only 2,000 years that
means that if science keeps working for another trillion years
it will be as far away from understanding reality as
it is today as it was 2,000 years ago you
see that's the that's the problem science is that you
think that you're actually getting deeper and deeper understanding of
reality but that's only because you assume reality is finite
so you're assuming that at some point you're gonna get
to the bottom of things but if reality turns out
to be infinite then that assumption doesn't hold and therefore
you will be chasing your tail to infinity forever for
a trillion years see so wouldn't it be nice to
realize this stuff now rather than waiting a trillion years
to discover it and lastly I just want you to
become much more highly context-sensitive not just to metaphysical context
which of course is very important but also for example
historical context I see a lot of people being a
historical because to have proper historical context means you got
to do a lot of reading a lot of study
of course people are lazy and they're ignorant so they
don't do a lot of reading and studying of history
they don't bother to learn the details and so they
don't have proper context for things like someone might read
a story about the Buddha and say oh the Buddha
was sexist because the Buddha Buddha didn't want to allow
for female monks and nuns but you have to understand
the context what was the context of ancient India two
and a half thousand years ago very different from today
you can't take today's equal rights context and apply to
the Buddha two and a thousand years ago likewise people
criticize Mohammed for being a warlord yeah today of course
if someone was a warlord in modern urban United States
stage green smile dynamics was a warlord yeah that would
be a big problem but back in ancient Arabia a
thousand five hundred years ago where the predominant stage was
purple and red a warlord was actually a relatively advanced
step in evolution because warlords are actually above purple tribes
see context important how about Marcus Aurelius Marcus Aurelius slaughtered
Christians some people hold that against him well you can't
understand the context slaughtering Christians back then was was supposed
to be correct because they were a sect that was
corrupting the society back then they won't like Christians today
about Thomas Jefferson owning slaves seems horrible from 21st century
stage Greene but uh I'm sure he was much more
advanced than than most people in the world - and
a hat well two hundred years ago or so even
though he owned slaves right so you got how to
put this stuff into context stage Orange which is where
Thomas Jefferson was at two hundred years ago that was
innovative just like that was the cutting edge back then
the US Constitution stage Orange document was a very innovative
document for that time today is getting a little out
of date we need a more green Constitution but that's
another topic also be highly context sensitive with psychological context
social context and of course the context of all teachings
you have to understand that when a teaching comes at
you whether it's through a video through a book through
a live seminar or whatever you're doing any kind of
teaching whether it's a business teaching actualized I work teaching
some non dual teaching some relationship advice pickup teaching whatever
you have to put it into context especially with mystical
teachings especially with the stuff that I talk about a
lot of times you see gurus giving contradictory advice to
different people with similar issues like there might be a
guru and two students come to him student a and
student B both of them have the similar problem and
so student a asks the guru what should I do
and the Guru tells him to do one thing then
the next day student be asked the Guru what should
I do about my problem is similar and the guy
will tell him the ought to do the opposite thing
and then those two people will get together the next
day and they will they will say hey what do
you tell you what about what do you tell you
and said oh he told me to do this and
no he told me the opposite of that what why
is that easy lying to me he's he trying to
trick us as he playing games no it's because the
Guru is very context sensitive so the Guru is giving
you the teaching to person a that that person needs
for his specific situation the Guru is sensitive to that
person's energy pattern the Guru is sensitive to that person's
framing of their question why are they asking the question
what is their level of development are they ready for
some advanced teaching or do they need an intermediate in
their meaty airy teaching or a newbie teaching you see
what can they handle the Guru has to evaluate all
these things the Guru does this in an instant and
pops out an answer but then the other person who
has the same problem but can't handle the advanced answer
or can't can't understand what the Guru is gonna tell
this guy has to give them a different answer context
sensitivity and so when you're reading some mystical literature you
have to be very careful about interpreting these teachings and
putting them into the proper context make sure that they
actually fit with your situation with summon at your level
just because Eckhart Tolle says something doesn't mean that it's
gonna work for you at your level at this time
this stage of development in this part of the country
or this part of the world that you're in maybe
it will maybe won't that takes some discernment on your
part to figure that out all right that's it I'm
done here please remember to click that like button for
me and come check out actualized org that's my website
check out the blog I'm posting new stuff there all
the time some profound insights check out the forum the
forum is doing great we're having more and more interesting
and deeper discussions about spiral dynamics other kinds of cool
topics on the forum so come check it out I
think you can potentially find some interesting resources there that
will deepen this journey for you come check out the
book list lots of books for you to read that
will recontextualize stuff for you come check out the life
purpose course and lastly what I want to say is
that I want you to understand the significance of what
we're doing with this work we are trying to develop
an understanding that is deeper than the understanding that the
best academics have I'm talking about people in Harvard and
Princeton and Stanford and Yale and all these prestigious places
and some of these academics they do great work so
you know I can't I can't criticize them but but
just understand that that almost none of them really understand
what reality is about or how to actually live life
their understanding is very narrow very technical very little picture
they're not connecting all the dots they're not at stage
turquoise they're not going to the ultimate depths of human
understanding that are possible and you might wonder Leo but
how can that be I mean these people get paid
lots of money and they get grants and they get
PhDs and Nobel Prizes and they write books and they
give big speaking tours and they're famous and they're these
big celebrities and everybody knows these physicists and these science
social scientists and psychologists and all this how could they
not know it makes no sense how is it possible
that just some guy on YouTube could know more than
these people and I'm not trying to be arrogant I'm
not trying to say that I know more than these
people again it's a very context sensitive in certain places
I know more in certain places I know a lot
less it all depends on what we're talking about different
domains my focus and your focus is the big picture
and what you got to understand is that someone who
is not focused on the big picture will never understand
the big picture it's very easy to get sucked into
academia and to spend 20 years getting immersed into academic
culture and to academic bureaucracy it just got to go
through that and then you become this bureaucratic little picture
academic and even though you can publish great books you
can even we'll know win Nobel Prizes you are never
gonna get the big picture with that approach and it's
just that simple that's the explanation for why they're not
doing it they're not doing it because they're not after
it and they're not after it because they are not
open-minded enough they don't think it's actually possible or that
it's important or because it directly contradicts their work methodologies
their paradigms and their institutional norms you see there's there's
a lot of academic and cultural norms in universities which
when you're in them for a long time and you
grow up in them which means that you go to
school then you go to grad school grad school than
grad school and all this by the time you're done
with all that you are so thoroughly indoctrinated that you
are a fish and water you don't know that you've
been indoctrinated you don't think of those things that you
are taught as indoctrination you think of them as reality
and then by that point you're just so locked in
and so bought into the paradigm you've so so much
money and time into it you're hundreds of thousands of
dollars in debt student debt and all this sort of
stuff that you got just to get your PhD and
now you got to publish papers and there's all these
responsibilities on you got to teach you how to do
research you gotta get grant money you got to fulfill
on your promises to keep your grant money that it
just becomes this cycle it just becomes this mindless cycle
and there's no real deep understanding not to mention which
universities these days are really getting corrupted by by the
capitalist system and by businesses by corporation such that if
you're trying to pursue some line of research which is
not directly tied with business interests it's not something you
can patent it's not something you can sell and make
a huge lot of money on and go IPO and
of course the deepest mystical truths are completely free and
they're democratic so you can't monopolize them you can't patent
them and they've all been discovered thousands of years ago
so you're not discovering anything new so you can't really
publish any groundbreaking research on this stuff so of course
for academics in that system it's just it it's not
it's not viable they can't survive in that system they'll
go hungry you know so they got to play the
survival game and the survival game has nothing to do
with understanding and with truth and in fact it's mostly
the opposite of that if you're playing the survival game
we can almost guarantee that you will never come to
the deepest understanding of what reality is so stick around
with actualise org and my commitment to you is to
try to deliver content which is not technical but which
is big-picture and all the stuff as you watch it
it'll all come together for you you will have this
very big picture synthesis and you will have an understanding
you'll be shocked at how much you understand and you'll
be you'll be amazed at at just how ignorant otherwise
intelligent and scientific people are compared to you even though
all you've done is basically just watch some YouTube videos
you
