            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-fiuWSZaoU4' target='_blank'>Sensitivity - Why Personal Development Is Impossible For You Right Now</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Sensitivity and Biohacking</b>: Leo, Leo, uses the concept of biohacking to illustrate the need for sensitivity in personal development. Leo defines biohacking as an act of enhancing mind and body performance through specific exercises, regulated nutrition, and the use of supplements. As per Leo, successful biohackers are those who carry a sharp self-awareness of the various changes happening in themselves to make necessary adjustments.
</li><li><b>Developing a Palate for Life</b>: Leo uses the term "developing a palate for life" to represent one's ability to become sensitive to their surroundings. This concept emerged from his observation of biohackers who are sensitive to the subtlest changes in their body and environment. For instance, taking note of the small changes in body performance while taking a supplement.
</li><li><b>Importance of Sensing Subtle Changes</b>: The practice of being aware of the subtle changes following the intake of supplements or switching of diets is crucial while biohacking. Leo admits that, initially, he struggled to sense the changes in his body from supplements, but he acknowledges that this sensitivity is something that anyone could develop by paying attention.
</li><li><b>Developing Awareness in Different Aspects of Life</b>: Leo stresses the significance of developing sensitivity to varying undertakings such as meditation, diet, and media consumption. He explains that when these tasks are employed in one's life, the initial impacts may seem subtle but would eventually contribute to considerable effects in the long run. 
</li><li><b>The Analogy of the Boiling Frog</b>: Leo mentions the fable of the boiling frog to articulate the imperceptible yet influential effects of low-quality media and negative habits on life. This gradual acclimation to negative influences can be harmful and limit potential. 
</li><li><b>Noticing Effects of Diet on Performance</b>: Leo stresses the importance of noting the impact of diet on one's mental and physical performance. Paying attention to the subtlest changes after meals, such as the impact on work performance or mood, could play a critical role in personal development.
</li><li><b>Importance of Digital Awareness</b>: Leo discusses the weight of consciousness on the effects of media, including television and the internet. The cumulative influences of media may seem subtle but could have profound effects on consciousness and overall life fulfillment.  
</li><li><b>Paradox of Subtlety and Influence</b>: Leo explains that despite their subtlety, the cumulative influences from media, negative friends, poor diet, and negative habits could significantly drag down life quality and performance. This situation is likened to the boiling frog scenario, where gradual increases in negative influences could lead to significant deteriorations unnoticed.
</li><li><b>Negative Spiral due to Consumption of Low-Grade Information</b>: Leo Gura explains that a constant influx of low-grade information such as reality TV, gossip, celebrity news etc. can slowly and subtly lower one's quality of life, hindering the ability to live up to dreams and aspirations. This negative downward spiral is very subtle but its effects are significant, causing frustration and dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Impact of Advertising</b>: He discusses his personal experience of completely cutting out TV, particularly cable TV, from his life about three years ago. The reduction in exposure to advertising made him more sensitive to its influence whenever he comes across it, providing him with a sudden, powerful shock of negativity. He attributes this to his lack of prior awareness due to constant exposure.
</li><li><b>Effect of Mainstream Food</b>: Leo talks about the negative influence mainstream food, which is usually unhealthy, has on people without them even realizing it. Using his personal experience of undertaking the paleo diet, he mentions how he became sensitive to the amount of sugar present in common foods like salads and Starbucks Frappuccinos, which he didn't notice before cleaning up his diet.
</li><li><b>Importance of Sensitivity to Subtle Influences</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the significance of developing sensitivity towards subtle but important influences that get camouflaged due to acclimatization. These influences, which include excessive sugar in diets and low consciousness media, play a significant role in negatively affecting our lives.
</li><li><b>Living in a Low Consciousness Environment</b>: He highlights the importance of being mindful of one's diet and the quality of information one consumes, given that current environments reinforce negative and low consciousness habits which hinder self-actualization and a powerful, fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>An Underdeveloped Palate</b>: Leo likens the lack of sensitivity to an underdeveloped palate and uses the analogy of wine tasting to explain. He talks about how a trained wine taster can differentiate between flavors and regions while an average drinker only gets a big hit of alcohol. Similarly, the consumption of mainstream media and culture conditions us to seek constant excitement and overlook subtle pleasures and nuances. 
</li><li><b>Seeking Instant Gratification</b>: According to Gura, our tendency to seek instant gratification and always expect exciting experiences has led to the underdevelopment of our "palates", causing us to lose sensitivity to subtle influences and pleasures.
</li><li><b>Expectation of immediate gratification</b>: Leo notes that mainstream culture instills a constant need for vibrating and exhilarating experiences. Society often encourages us to seek thrilling and instant rewards, such as fat paychecks, blockbuster movies, and rich, flavorful meals. 
</li><li><b>Loss of sensitivity</b>: This constant need for heightened excitement, according to Leo, can lead to a loss of sensitivity towards subtle pleasures and intricacies in life. Using his personal experience with hot sauce dulling his taste palette, he illustrates how overexposure to strong sensations can numb one to more refined experiences.
</li><li><b>Cultural desensitization</b>: Leo extends the hot sauce analogy to explain how existing in a media-saturated, expectation-laden environment limits our ability to value life's subtleties and complexities. He suggests this cultural influence often numbs people to the more nuanced aspects of life, including food and personal development.
</li><li><b>Enhanced sensitivity through lifestyle change</b>: Leo discusses how transitioning to healthier diets can increase sensitivity to how sugar and fat impact our mental and physical performance. Similarly, he argues that engaging in personal development practices such as meditation, journaling, affirmations, or visualizations can initially seem insignificant due to our blown-out sensitivity. However, with time, these activities accumulate noticeable effects, granting a greater appreciation for these practices.
</li><li><b>Impacts of negative thinking</b>: Leo identifies everyday thoughts and emotions as significant influences on the trajectory of our lives. He observes that people often underestimate how their thought processes impact their reality, leading to a lack of self-actualization due to constant anxiety, stress, and worry.
</li><li><b>Appreciation for life</b>: Leo points out how persistent exposure to easy stimulation, such as television, distances people from appreciating the beauty of life and reality. This conditioning infatuates individuals with immediate, intense sensory experiences, making it challenging for them to opt for subtler, cleaner pleasures like meditation or pursuing a career.
</li><li><b>Transition to high consciousness values</b>: Leo concludes by emphasizing the importance of switching from low to high consciousness values, arguing that while the latter might not offer the same immediate rush as the former, they provide a deeper level of fulfillment and satisfaction. He believes that values such as pursuing beauty, truth, justice, excellence, calmness, and peacefulness are commonly undervalued due to our societal conditioning towards instant gratification.
</li><li><b>Importance of shifting from low consciousness values to high consciousness ones</b>: Leo identifies different types of values. Low consciousness values, such as chasing immediate gratification and intense sensory experiences, are compared to drug addiction. These values can bring temporary happiness but often lead to dissatisfaction because they prevent individuals from living up to their potential. High consciousness values, on the other hand, revolve around pursuing beauty, truth, justice, excellence, calmness, and peacefulness. These subtler, long-term values can seem less appealing when compared to the immediate rewards of low consciousness ones, but they pave the way for deeper fulfilment, happiness, and self-actualization. Leo urges individuals to transition towards high consciousness values and live a life true to their potential.
</li><li><b>Key to self-actualization is developing sensitivity and appreciation towards life</b>: Leo explains that overstimulation and immediate gratification can lead to numbness and inability to appreciate the beauty in everyday life. Just like a drug, when individuals get hooked on these bold sensations, they may struggle to find pleasure in everyday occurrences. Leo emphasizes that it's essential to slow down and appreciate the beauty in commonplace things, like the complexity of a leaf or the structure of a crack on a wall. Such sensitivity and appreciation of the complexity and subtle beauty in everyday life is what leads to real enjoyment and fulfilment, and by extension, self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Importance of increasing sensitivity and awareness to our daily experiences</b>: Leo urges listeners to be more aware of their everyday activities and thoughts. Small actions and habits like hitting the snooze button multiple times in the morning can have a long-term impact on their overall well-being. These actions might induce a chain of negative thoughts and kill their sense of peace, leading to stress and panic, thereby lowering their overall fulfilment in life. Increasing sensitivity and awareness about these everyday activities is essential for personal development.
</li><li><b>Eliminating sources of over-stimulation and low consciousness values to raise consciousness</b>: Leo suggests identifying at least three sources in one's life that stimulate low consciousness, like watching TV, participating in addictive behaviours, hanging out with negative friends, consuming unhealthy foods, or failing to develop positive habits, and eliminating them. Leo notes that by committing to eliminating these regulating sources of low consciousness for a month, can induce positive shifts, improve sensitivity, make individuals more appreciative of life, and ultimately advances them towards self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Adopting philosophy of expanding sensitivity and consciously choosing high consciousness values</b>: Leo emphasizes that increasing sensitivity and actively choosing high consciousness values in life can assist in reaching a self-actualized state. The philosophy is not about performing a single act, but maintaining a constant commitment to suppress low consciousness values and elevate high consciousness ones for personal growth and development.
