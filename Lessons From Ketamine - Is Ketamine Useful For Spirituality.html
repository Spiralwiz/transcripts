[Music] warning ketamine can be addictive and can cause bladder
and kidney damage if used chronically do not use dissociative
or psychedelics if you are mentally unstable this information is
for educational purposes only and not psychotherapeutic advice lessons from
ketamine this is an episode about what i learned from
trying ketamine for myself and i want to compare and
contrast it as a dissociative that it is with psychedelics
which i've done a lot of in the past and
so it's interesting to see the differences between those two
and the difference in states of consciousness and kinds of
awakening that a dissociative can produce versus the classical psychedelics
like mushrooms lsd dmt fabio dmt and all that other
stuff that i've talked about in the past so this
is interesting i've tried a lot of different psychedelic substances
that i haven't even issued trip reports on or talked
about publicly because honestly many of them are just more
of the same sort of stuff different flavors or variations
on the same kind of stuff that you get with
mushrooms lsd and dmt but ketamine is something a little
bit different which is why i felt it was worthwhile
to put out this episode so i plugged about 30
milligrams of ketamine r isomer and it plugs great comes
on in about 10 minutes the duration lasts for about
an hour and a half then after that hour and
a half there's lingering side effects for another hour let's
say or so uh but you're really tripping for just
about an hour and a half at most so it's
pretty short as far as psychedelic trips go it's about
the same length of a 5-meo malt trip actually which
i've talked about in the past go see my episode
about 5-meo mult so i'm going to be sharing the
sort of trip that i went through and the effects
the most poignant aspects of the trip and and what
unique and interesting effects it had that were different from
traditional psychedelics so right away the most significant difference is
the way that it distorts the visual field the visual
field gets very wonky in an uncomfortable sort of way
your vision gets a little bit blurry you get a
little bit of a double vision going on sort of
a double vision effect it's not like you're seeing double
of your visual field it's not that double but just
there's like a little doubling that you see and there's
this thing that's referred to as like visual slippage which
means that as you're looking around the room it just
feels kind of weird and alien almost as though there's
something wrong with your visual field it's distorting your visual
field not in the classic psychedelic way where your visual
field is kind of dancing and morphing around and interesting
colors are coming forth the neon psychedelic classic colors you
don't really get any of that at least i don't
on a low dose of ketamine and my dose i
would say it wasn't low it was kind of like
a medium dose and remember people have different sensitivities i'm
very sensitive to all psychedelics so i would assume that
i'm also more sensitive to ketamine than most people but
anyways there's no change in colors per se uh but
the visual field feels off it feels a bit alien
weird and uncomfortable and it makes it actually a little
bit difficult to function i imagine that if i doubled
my dose the visual field would get very wonky and
it would be quite challenging to to even look around
the room and to see things and to function in
normal way and then if the dose was significantly higher
reading from other people's trip reports of very high doses
of ketamine which i haven't personally done but there's a
lot of consensus on this is that basically your even
your visual field will get so twisted and distorted that
you won't really be able to use it you won't
even be able to read or at really high doses
you won't even really be able to turn the lights
on and off so there's that which is a little
bit disconcerting that's one of the reasons i'm a little
cautious about going high on the on the dose with
ketamine but people have definitely done it you just have
to be careful because you will be out of normal
function for about an hour and a half speaking of
which is difficult to walk even on the sort of
moderate dose that i did it was difficult to walk
uh you walk like you're intoxicated you can't walk quite
straight it's difficult to balance and so that also gave
me concern because at that dose it was manageable it
wasn't really dangerous but if you double triple the dose
or more you're going to completely lose your ability to
walk and i can definitely see people trying to walk
on this substance at high doses fumbling stumbling around tripping
falling hitting their head on a coffee table something like
that so it can definitely get dangerous if you're going
to be doing higher doses of ketamine anything beyond a
moderate dose you basically have to lock yourself in a
room ideally with with no windows and no doors so
i'm just going to have a door but i deal
with no windows so you don't jump out accidentally or
have a trip sitter with you just to watch you
so that you don't hurt yourself and you have to
force yourself to just like lie in bed and don't
go running around and having fun you know this ketamine
it's not really like a fun substance that you get
to have a bunch of fun on the way you
can on low doses of psychedelics where you can go
outside and you can frolic around and you can kind
of enjoy the scenery you don't really get that from
from ketamine ketamine has a obviously very dissociating and anesthetic
quality to it because it is an anesthetic it's basically
an animal tranquilizer they use it in veterinary services on
dogs cats horses to anesthetize them but that's at a
very high dose you don't take that much when you're
doing it in the way that you know we're doing
it for to trip and it's dissociating so what does
that mean i mean it's a dissociative that's a class
of chemical or drug uh but what does it really
mean this word dissociation so i have a few definitions
that i looked up for you here the first one
is from webmd.com and it says quote dissociation is a
break in how your mind handles information you may feel
disconnected from your thoughts feelings memories and surroundings it can
affect your sense of identity and your perception of time
end quote that's very very true you do become disconnected
from your thoughts feelings memories and to maybe to a
lesser extent surroundings at the dose that i did but
i'm sure at a higher dose you would disconnect from
your surroundings as well and then another quote i have
for you is from wikipedia on this topic which says
quote dissociation is any of a wide variety of experiences
ranging from a mild emotional detachment from the immediate surroundings
to a more severe disconnection from physical and emotional experiences
the major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment
from reality rather than a loss of reality as in
psychosis end quote so that's sort of your standard textbook
definition of dissociation but really you don't quite understand what
that word means until you do some ketamine and you
start to feel that effect come on and that's what's
really so interesting about it and what makes it different
from many of the other psychedelics is that of course
the other psychedelics the classic psychedelics they will screw with
your thought process and they can get you a sense
of no self they can get you to feel like
you know you're disconnected from your traditional human identity of
course they do all that and they can put you
in deep meditated like states but but ketamine is still
quite unique and it's worth talking about that and uh
it has some interesting implications for the work that we're
doing here with actualize.org with spirituality and with metaphysics and
epistemology so what's really interesting about ketamine is that it
shuts off symbolic reasoning and thinking and it's difficult to
explain to someone the significance of that basically it nukes
your conceptual mind very significantly even at a moderate dose
and if the dose was doubled i would imagine that
it would wipe that out entirely it becomes quite difficult
to think it becomes difficult to reason it becomes difficult
to do analysis or any kind of symbolic logic which
is mostly what you're doing with your mind most of
the time and i was doing some research in preparation
for this talk looking at some scientific studies of you
know what does ketamine actually do sort of neurologically chemically
in the brain how does it actually function and what
kind of effect does it have on you know brain
waves and that kind of thing and there's a great
research study that they did recently on sheep where they
gave ketamine to sheep and what they realized that when
you give a high enough dose of ketamine to a
sheep what happens is and then they attach electrodes you
know they basically do an eeg scan with electrodes of
the of the sheep's brain and what they notice is
that it it completely shuts off the cerebral cortex the
cerebral cortex is that part of your brain you know
it's the it's the frontal lobes so to speak it's
the most evolved highest level part of the brain in
humans especially it's more evolved than in other animals this
is what distinguishes humans from other animals this is what
gives us our humanness you might say our capacity to
reason to logic to analyze to conceptualize and all of
language so it deactivates that whole thing and it's one
thing just to say that to you but it's another
thing to actually live through what you know how that's
happening um now you might say here well leo isn't
that sort of like what the point of meditation is
is to shut off the thinking mind and just to
sit there like an animal like a cat on a
windowsill and just experience life and of course that is
a lot of what meditation aims to do so very
interestingly what i found with ketamine is that it aligns
very well the kind of state of consciousness that it
put me in aligns very well with the classic buddhist
advaita vedanta sorts of meditative states and experiences and even
awakenings that i hear a lot from buddhists and people
who follow that sort of eastern path um a lot
less mystical a lot less visionary i would say and
more just like it nukes the cerebral cortex you lose
even the desire to think or to analyze anything and
it gives your mind a deep sense of relief it
almost turns you into an animal i would say if
you want to know what it kind of like you
want to imagine what is it like to be an
animal they can't really logic they can't do mathematics they
don't do advanced reasoning they probably don't think very far
ahead into the future or about their past they're sort
of just very like living in the moment and not
doing a lot of symbolic thinking and and that's exactly
what ketamine gets you a taste of what's interesting though
is how it actually feels and what you you know
what insights you take away from this because even though
in this work we talk a lot about how your
mind is conceptualizing all the time and that really what
you're living in is you're not living in reality you're
living in a sort of augmented reality where your conceptual
mind is projecting and interpreting and doing like a lot
of a lot of additional layers adding a lot of
additional layers on top of just the raw stuff that's
there in reality we might say even though we all
kind of logically know this we understand this but you
don't appreciate how much of your life is conceptual until
you take something like ketamine and it just wipes out
the whole conceptual mind i'll talk more about that in
a second but before i get there because i just
kind of want to go in order of how this
occurred for me during my experience is that the first
thing that i notice as all this is coming on
you know beyond my visual field getting wonky and my
inability to walk and all that i'm just sitting there
the first thing that i noticed is just how deeply
relaxed and comfortable i start to feel it puts me
into an instant effortless meditative state where my mind is
completely blank and and um but you would think that
well but if i'm if i'm like in this dissociated
sort of like mindless state then it might feel bad
actually no it feels amazing because for the first time
in your life perhaps especially if you've never meditated or
you've never become a very efficient meditator because it would
take you years to be able to reach a state
like this through meditation you get to a point in
you get to a point in this experience where you're
completely free of your thinking mind and it's such an
enormous relief it's like a giant weight has been lifted
off your shoulders that you didn't even feel was there
in the same way that when you're walking around on
the surface of the earth it's pretty effortless just to
walk around but you don't actually feel how much work
your body is doing to counteract the gravity on earth
but then when you shoot into outer space and you're
floating around in a vacuum then all of a sudden
you see what it's really like when there's no gravity
and how effortless that experience is and then you come
back down to earth and you feel oh my god
it's so heavy to be on earth because i've been
out in outer space right so this is the this
is the experience that astronauts have well the same sort
of thing happens here but with ketamine but but conceptually
you don't really appreciate how much of your life is
deeply conceptual even many of the things that you think
are scientific or physical facts actually turns out to be
conceptual and this gets wiped away and it's quite astounding
uh personally you know i've meditated for years but i've
never been able to reach a meditative state that was
this empty of thought and this sort of like mindless
you might say like a true state of no mind
uh i've not been able to reach reach that just
through my normal efforts part of that is because i'm
very conceptual i'm very intellectual so for me one of
my personal like greatest strengths but also weaknesses in life
is that i am very intellectual about my approach and
my attitude towards life there's pros and cons to that
so the biggest pro to that is that i can
put out all this great deep content that explains to
you using symbolic reasoning how reality works that's what all
of my videos are about right and if you like
my content that's why you like it that's sort of
like my unique selling point to you but the flip
side of that is that then it becomes difficult really
difficult to shut off the mind because the mind gets
in this attitude of thinking and trying to understand everything
all the time so it's it's in a sense it's
antithetical to to meditation because in meditation you just want
a blank mind and then but then there's there's also
pros and cons to having a blank mind so a
lot of what the meditative people don't tell you the
buddhists and so forth they don't tell you what you're
losing by being in a state of no mind you
are losing some things too you're not just gaining freedom
but for now let's just focus on what you're gaining
what you're gaining is this enormous sense of freedom i
felt like so relaxed so at ease and deeply happy
like a profound sense of happiness and it's not a
happiness that's like an ecstatic pleasure or bliss or ecstasy
which of course you can experience on classic psychedelics i've
experienced that a lot that's its own separate category of
happiness this happiness here it's a much more even keeled
just like mellow very chill just like ah complete relief
from the need to think about anything you're not thinking
about your future anymore you're not thinking about work tomorrow
you're not thinking about the kids that you got to
take care of you're not thinking about all the [
__ ] in your life that's bothering you all of
that is wiped out and what i imagine for many
people this will be the first time in their life
that they have been truly happy there's just like a
pure very innocent joy to just sitting and being comfortable
without being bored without being excited without having any kind
of feelings tugging you in one direction or another you
know even positive emotions when you're excited about something when
you're horny you might think like these are great and
of course they can be great but um they're not
peaceful because even your positive emotions a lot of times
they're pulling you towards something you have a desire or
something like that is happening they're not letting you really
just be at peace and just be kind of still
and so ketamine does that for you and it and
then and then what you realize what's so valuable about
this which takes it just beyond some sort of you
know temporary escape from the obligations of normal life what's
valuable about this actually from personal development point of view
and from a spiritual point of view is that it
shows you rather than just telling you it shows you
just how much suffering is caused by your conceptualizing mind
and you're worrying about the future most people i think
have no idea because even for me this was a
bit shocking of a revelation most people have no idea
how much of their suffering is caused simply by by
their thinking about the future constructing and projecting a future
in fact it's even more extreme that i'm letting on
here because really what i realized in this state of
no mind is that all of suffering is caused by
that all of it and of course you can hear
advanced meditators and buddhists tell you this kind of stuff
but it's one thing to hear it and to read
it in a book it's another thing to actually experience
it because that is a holy [ __ ] moment
where it's like holy [ __ ] i'm completely free
of suffering i'm in such a peaceful deeply relaxed state
i want nothing i need nothing nothing is pulling me
in any direction i have no goals no plans i
don't care about anything and i can't even think about
i can't even be bothered to think about the future
or the past that's what ketamine does for you and
then you're just left in the present moment and then
as they say of course is like what problems exist
in the present moment really none and you just feel
simply happy without being in a state of pleasure you're
just happy you're content you're satisfied and you need nothing
you don't feel like anything is missing because what you
don't realize most people don't realize that the reason you
can't be satisfied sitting here right now doing nothing is
because your mind is so used as part of its
survival strategy your mind is so used to thinking about
all the stuff you need to worry about and do
in the future to acquire the things you think you
need to be happy whether it's money shelter sex relationship
stuff answering your emails maintaining your job going to the
gym all that stuff you don't realize how much effort
it takes to maintain all that stuff most people don't
realize that and so it's quite profound to actually experience
a state of completely no suffering and also no boredom
at the same time you might think well isn't that
kind of boring it's not boring because boredom is also
something your conceptual mind is constructing that too is gone
resistance is gone any kind of lingering anxiety in you
is gone fear is gone you can't be bothered to
fear anything again most people don't realize how much residual
low-grade anxiety and fear exists in your mind and in
your body as a sort of a constant low-grade humming
background noise throughout your whole day as you're going through
your day even if nothing terrible is happening to you
even if you're having a good day there's always that
that little bit of worry and anxiety just as being
part of a human living in life you know there's
dangers in the future that you got to avoid you
got chores to do taxes to take care of this
obligation that obligation your schedule is full you got to
go somewhere be this place answer that person so all
of that is wiped away and it's very relieving furthermore
what i would say is that there was a lifting
for me of depression and well i already mentioned anxiety
but yeah a lifting of depression and anxiety um and
it's not that i have depression i've never really been
a depressive person i i've struggled with depression a little
bit more in the last couple years because of some
of the health issues that i've been dealing with just
because they were so uh stubborn that you know after
a certain while of dealing with a health issue you
can't fix it you get depressed over it but but
that that's a that's a minor thing anyways um i'm
not really a depressive person but again most of us
don't realize that there's a little bit of sort of
a background hum of depression like almost like a little
like a little fog that you're living in day to
day throughout your life you don't even realize it so
ketamine lifts that away and it does the same thing
with anxiety now i even noticed that like i don't
i don't consider myself as having depression but i sort
of noticed a little bit of that depression kind of
just like lifted i'm like whoa wait a minute where'd
that do i didn't even realize i had that depression
like it just kind of like lifted and went away
because it's there all the time so you don't notice
that same with the with the anxiety so so based
off that i can see how powerful this tool of
ketamine can be for people who really suffer from depression
or anxiety like high levels of it i've never been
a super anxious or depressive person but some people are
some of you guys are and i can see how
this can be very powerful for that what it does
it it will show you that your depression and your
anxiety is stemming from your future projecting in your conceptualizing
mind so basically it's how your psyche is surviving in
the world conceptually that is causing your depression and your
anxiety a lot of times people think that oh well
i'm depressed because like life is meaningless and i'm depressed
because i because you know i'm a nihilist or something
like that go see my episode about about nihilism where
i i counter many of the common misconceptions about nihilism
but but actually that's not why you're depressed you're not
depressed or anxious because of some nihilism you're depressed because
your mind is constructing negative meaning but you're not aware
of that but or even if you are aware of
that you're not you're not capable of stopping it you
don't know how to stop it because your mind is
just in this depressive habit that it's built up over
years and decades and it's the way you're thinking about
your life the meanings you're attaching to different aspects of
your life whether it's your relationships or your inability to
get laid or your frustration with your health problems or
your problems at your job and um you know whatever
is causing your depression maybe some family situation that's causing
you depression or anxiety that's all conceptual all those problems
believe it or not are conceptual and ketamine just wipes
those away so i can see how this is a
double-edged sword here you have to be careful because if
you do suffer from depression anxiety you might be tempted
to say like well leo then this is the cure
this is the magic pill to lift my depression my
anxiety yes in a certain sense the problem is that
it only is going to last for an hour and
a half and then you're going to come back to
your old conceptualizing mind which is going to recreate your
depression see so then you might say well leo then
then there's no value to it whatsoever no that's wrong
there is value to it because it shows you through
direct experience that it is your mind constructing your depression
or your anxiety and it might give you insights into
how you need to change how your mind works to
stop doing that the other double edge here sort of
the danger with this is that even if it can
show you all these good things and it can lift
your depression for a while of course if you're very
depressed and very anxious this is going to feel like
such a huge relief to you that you're very likely
to be going to become addicted to this substance and
you're going to start using it chronically to escape from
dealing with the problems in your life and furthermore from
handling and changing the way that your mind works to
create the depression right see the real work here would
be to take the ketamine experience the relief enjoy that
but really use that moment to see how your mind
constructs depression or anxiety and then when you come back
make a resolution to say okay what that showed me
is that i can live without depression anxiety but i
need to change how my mind works i need to
reconstruct my whole psyche so it stops creating depression and
anxiety and then you got to go through the you
know maybe a multi-year-long process to do that i'm not
fully sure what that would involve doing but you'd have
to change how you think how you conceptualize things and
so forth that would be difficult work most people who
are very depressed or anxious they would not want to
do that difficult work instead they would fall into the
trap of saying ah that lifted my depression it feels
like a cure-all let me just do more ketamine and
they just do dose after dose after dose of ketamine
to the point where they're taking like five grams of
ketamine per day and then this destroys their bladder their
kidneys gets them addicted and and it doesn't really solve
anything for them because eventually they're going to have to
you know they're going to you're going to rat ketamine
at some point you can't be on ketamine your whole
life and also when you're on this ketamine you're not
very functional you can't also be a highly functional person
when you're on a moderate to high dose of ketamine
because you can barely walk so uh i can see
a very powerful potential here for this substance to alleviate
severe depression and to help people with anxiety and other
things like that but there's also a danger here if
you misuse it so basically it puts you into a
state of no mind and it puts you into a
state where nothing matters in a good way this would
be like true nihilism it shows you really the difference
between a sort of a conceptual nihilism and true nihilism
conceptual nihilism is when you're telling your mind is telling
you that oh nothing matters and and life sucks and
then you become cynical and this whatever right this is
[ __ ] this isn't real nihilism real nihilism would
be where like you truly don't give a [ __
] about anything and you're just happy as [ __
] as a result because nothing matters nothing matters nothing
means anything there's nothing to do there's no point there's
no goal but there's also no boredom there's no negative
meanings attached to the meaninglessness it's just perfectly meaningless and
it's awesome you're basically just like sitting like a cat
on a windowsill enjoying whatever experience is before it just
being and it feels amazing but it goes deeper than
this for me what happened after this is that i
started to kind of introspect and go inside myself and
do a little spiritual work the way that i like
to do on psychedelics and very quickly i got a
strong sense of like questioning my own identity very deep
sense of ego dissolution and no self it produces what
i would call the sort of classic no self awakening
that many buddhists talk about and many advice talk about
so you can definitely get that with ketamine especially at
the higher doses you'll get it that was very easy
for me to see it was easy for me to
introspect and to to realize just how constructed my entire
human identity is of course i've experienced this many times
on other psychedelics so this is nothing new for me
but but still i would say that on other psychedelics
you could have a sort of a no-self awakening but
then usually it'll also be mixed together with a lot
of like mystical visions and visionary stuff and sort of
like more of the sort of like flavors of god
and and that kind of stuff whereas here uh you
don't get much of that it's it's it's more bland
it's just sort of a more bland no-self which is
like a no-self-awakening which is sort of like what what
the buddhists usually talk about and hold as like the
pinnacle of spiritual work is just like wipe out the
self to the point where it almost feels like you're
just depersonalized like nothing is personal you can't be bothered
to take anything personal anymore you can't even be bothered
to be afraid or to be angry or to be
jealous or to be frustrated like it's like you're sitting
there and under this ketamine state you're like why would
i even bother with feeling that way why would i
have these thoughts about worrying about the future or the
past it also suppresses your memory to the point where
if you have problems you know if you have trauma
in the past it'll probably suppress that i would imagine
because it becomes more difficult to access your memories because
a lot of those are symbolic and also highly conceptual
and and yeah so you look inside yourself you realize
there's no self there you realize that your whole human
identity is just a construction symbolic construction and since symbolic
reasoning is not even coming up for you you're not
even like thinking of yourself as a as a personal
biographical self anymore you're just sitting there as a conscious
being uh but then it kind of went one step
deeper than that for me is then uh i kept
contemplating introspecting more and then i i hit upon this
very profound sense of not knowing if you've been following
my work you know i'm a fan of peter ralston's
work he was a big influence on me especially earlier
in my spiritual journey and his book the book of
not knowing i'm a big fan of that book if
you've read that book if you like that book and
some of his work you can see that like what
he's talking about with not knowing if you struggle to
understand what what is not knowing and what is its
significance ketamine will show you ketamine will basically show you
that you don't know anything it shows you that all
you're knowing is conceptual and symbolic and that when one
when that is wiped out you literally just don't know
and i went further than that i introspected i was
able to get in touch with infinity with my infinite
consciousness while i was on this ketamine and then i
i introspected so deeply into the infinity that i like
and this this is it's not like i hadn't realized
this in the past but it was just so prominent
and so poignant on ketamine like i'm i had the
most profound sense of not knowing that i've ever had
i don't get not knowing so much on other psychedelics
i'll compare and contrast in a second with stuff like
five meow and dmt uh but before we get to
that just the not knowing like i really looked at
what is the nature of knowing anything and i looked
at the infinite consciousness that i am and then i
realized that me as infinity is completely unknowable it's literally
absolutely impossible to know infinity is so hard to explain
because it seems like sort of like a cop-out or
almost like this might make you cynical or nihilistic but
actually there's a sort of a meta-knowing you know that
you as infinity are not knowable and that any attempt
to try to know or to explicate infinity is just
absurd and futile and this is not a problem for
you like it is for the conceptual mind this can
be a problem for the ego this can be problem
but when you in in this ketamine state there is
no conceptual mind there is no ego at this point
and so it becomes this deeply profound mystical sense of
not knowing and you realize the absurdity of trying to
know things you realize how shallow and trivial and delusional
that is and so you you appreciate the power of
not knowing and you surrender even the desire to know
and you don't really appreciate how much your mind has
the desire to know and to make sense of reality
so this whole sense making apparatus that the ego mind
is is and that it functions and it's doing that
function all the time most people aren't even aware that
that it's doing this that your mind is doing this
trying to make sense of everything all the time this
your mind is doing this even if you're not some
deep intellectual uh your mind is still doing this well
that's wiped out and not only is it wiped out
but you see the absurdity of that you see the
futility of that and then you resign to it you
surrender to the not knowing you don't treat it as
a bug you treat it as a feature and then
from that you get a profound sense of peace and
joy and personally for me this was very valuable because
look uh my mind loves to understand things that's like
what my whole like reason for living is you might
say is the understanding of reality and that's that's important
i'm not dismissing the the importance of understanding i'll talk
more about that in the future and even in this
episode but um it's such a huge relief especially for
me who spent his whole life trying to understand everything
to just realize that all of that it has its
use but the but there's something like even deeper than
that which is the not knowing now it's still what's
funny is that the not knowing still involves an understanding
you're understanding that you cannot be known that infinity cannot
be known so that's still a form of understanding um
but uh you realize that all the relative notions of
knowing that those are [Music] never gonna get you to
the truest knowing the truest knowing is the not knowing
the knowing that infinity cannot be known and that's an
enormous relief and i think this would be a huge
relief especially for intellectuals if you're an intellectual type if
you're an overthinker over analyzer if you're hyper left brained
if you're very logical if you're very scientifically minded um
i don't know why but right now as i say
that a picture in my mind is coming up of
kurt jymongel i did an interview with him he's just
like very sciency oriented very logical sort of very rational
very meticulous you know he asks very meticulous scientific questions
about spiritual topics and other sorts of topics um yeah
i mean it's great he's got a beautiful mind in
a certain sense but also like you can see just
how like how much mind is going on there um
and then like for him to do some ketamine i
would imagine like and to experience this freedom from mind
and then looking back at his usual way of interfacing
with reality just like completely full of intellect removing all
that and seeing that difference that contrast that would be
hugely valuable to him i think because otherwise you're stuck
in your mind and you don't even know you're stuck
in your mind and you're trying to use your mind
to get yourself unstuck from your mind that gets you
just more stuck in your mind right this is this
is the biggest problem with intellectuals is they actually think
that more intellectualizing will solve their problem and it doesn't
and most of them are blind to it this is
their biggest blind spot with academic types with professor types
with public intellectuals people like sam harris and jordan peterson
like these sorts of these sorts of people um [Music]
the richard dawkins types of people uh a good dose
of ketamine will humble will humble them and uh will
rob them the of the illusion of knowing because see
with people like that and i include myself in that
group of people with people like us who are highly
intellectual like a lot of our ego is is related
to building up some sort of model of reality where
like we really think we understand something through our conceptualizing
and we do a lot of analysis and we do
a lot of like technical intellectual work and we really
think we're getting somewhere and then we take pride in
our ability to think carefully and all this um and
look that that's good at a certain level but there's
a level that's you might say deeper than that or
above transcendent of that which is um there's deeper aspects
of reality that you just cannot access and then in
fact that whole scheme of intellectualizing analyzing modeling mapping making
sense of things that whole scheme is precisely the obstacle
to realizing some of the deeper aspects of reality and
so i think ketamine can can help very much with
people like that who are stuck in their minds uh
furthermore what i got is i got a little bit
of a taste of god of myself as god um
i think that might be though because i have that
now almost any time i want to anytime i introspect
i can sense myself as god so that that i
think just came from you know hundreds of of mystical
awakenings that i've had on more classic psychedelics over the
years so to me i'm very comfortable with that that's
very easy for me to access uh but it's nothing
extraordinary it's nothing like as profound as you would get
on five million dmt or five million malt or even
mushrooms or lsd so ketamine i think it could put
you in touch with god or yourself as god but
um i think for i think most people wouldn't get
that on ketamine they would overlook it it would be
too subtle too mild for them and it it it
just ketamine would not be as effective for a god
realization as something like 5meo or dmt or even mushrooms
so there's that i had insight while i was introspecting
here i had insight into how mind and self creates
meaning knowing and suffering i actually was able to see
how my mind was creating it and that was extremely
valuable it's very valuable to see that because usually in
your normal state of consciousness you can't see that and
on psychedelics you can see some of that but i
would say psychedelics take you in a slightly different direction
there is something unique some unique insights and realizations i
got from ketamine that i did not get from over
150 trips on classic psychedelics many of which were amazing
and way more profound than this ketamine trip so it's
not that this ketamine trip was like my deepest trip
or my highest awakening or anything like that it wasn't
i've had much higher awakenings and god realizations and mystical
experiences through other chemicals but there was ketamine had a
unique enough flavor profile that it highlighted certain flavors of
consciousness and awakening and this whole spiritual work and how
my psyche worked it hits on certain notes that classic
psychedelics hit on at all or hit on indirectly and
i'm not saying here that you couldn't realize many of
these things that i'm talking about on some other chemical
or some classic psychedelic you probably could realize any of
these things on almost any psychedelic the issue is sort
of like certain chemicals just like hit you with certain
facets of awakening and spirituality in more prominent ways in
the same way that you know your tongue you can
put different foods on it and it'll that food will
even though most food consists of sweet sour salty um
you know umami flavors there's only like five different basic
flavors you know spicy um there's only like five basic
flavors but each food hits your tongue receptors in a
different way and highlights different aspects of the sweetness the
saltiness and the different combinations thereof right there's a lot
of variation in food even though there's like only a
few basic type of taste receptors so i find it's
the same way like with the mind or with the
brain and these chemicals um there's not that many different
facets of awakening and spirituality and how your mind works
but at the same time there's there's multiple dozens of
them and you can hit them from different angles and
you can explore them and you can go into them
at different lengths you know there's different degrees of sourness
for example you know something can be a little bit
sour or like ridiculously sour and you don't really appreciate
what sour this is until you feel and explore all
the different variations of sourness and even how it combines
and connects with sweetness and saltiness and all this so
that's kind of what's happening here so i think there's
something valuable about this ketamine experience even though i've basically
touched upon all these different facets in previous work that
i've done through tripping and meditation and so forth i
would say that ketamine gives you a sense of what
depersonalization disorder and derealization disorder might be like it does
feel that way a lot of times people complain when
they have a depersonalization or realizations where they actually complain
that they're suffering so in that sense ketamine isn't like
that because there's no suffering it's in fact it's the
opposite of that so it's maybe it's not fully the
same as depersonalization derealization maybe it is more just like
sort of a classic buddhist awakening it's simple it's stark
it's zen like it's not very mystical or imaginative and
then after a few hours it basically goes away but
i was left with a pleasant afterglow that lifting of
depression and low-grade anxiety and just kind of like a
joy and sort of freedom from your own mental [
__ ] and monkey chatter that last that that was
like an afterglow that stayed with me for a couple
of days and then of course what happens is that
because you're back in normal life your normal mind comes
back your symbolic reasoning all comes back online um after
your trip and then of course you're you're in the
middle of life and you're faced with emails you gotta
answer taxes you gotta do chores you gotta do business
problems relationship problems family problems career problems money problems sexual
problems right all this it all comes flooding back and
then your mind just goes back into survival mode and
it's it's thinking about how to handle all this stuff
it's like you're juggling balls you know juggling 10 different
balls surviving and then very quickly you fall right back
into your old habits and if you're not careful you're
just going to fall right back into them and you're
going to you're going to recreate your depression you're going
to recreate your anxiety by how your mind is attaching
and projecting meaning onto everything in the world because that's
part of your survival process and so what was very
valuable to me about ketamine is it showed me just
like the connection between how my mind is thinking about
certain things in the future the meaning is attaching to
that and then how that's coming back to bite me
in the ass with some low-grade form of suffering anxiety
fear sadness disappointment frustration and then how that cycle is
perpetuating itself and furthermore where that all came from it's
like oh i can go back into my childhood i
can see that oh this is just like a survival
strategy that i learned back when i was at school
you know i learned to handle life this way and
to think this way about this thing and then if
this happens that i look at that negatively and if
if that happens i look at it positively and then
like you learn how to basically psychically survive you learn
how to survive as a mind when you're a kid
and then those habits just get ingrained over decades and
then you're just executing them spontaneously without even thinking about
them and so the real work in personal development and
spiritual growth is to see that and then change those
habits which of course is a much bigger thing and
ketamine will not simply change all that for you it's
not going to fix everything for you it's not some
magic pill but the thing is that most people have
no idea that this is even happening they don't even
know that where their suffering is coming from they don't
see and they won't even believe you when you tell
them that your suffering is created by your own mind
they don't believe it they really think their suffering is
coming from some external problem in the world like leo
i'm suffering because my dad is an [ __ ]
or i'm suffering because my girlfriend's a [ __ ]
or i'm suffering because she cheated on me or i'm
suffering because i don't have enough money that's not why
you're suffering you're suffering because of how your mind is
attaching meaning to those things and constantly thinking about those
things ruminating negatively about those things and you're not conscious
of that whole process and you know how to stop
you don't know how to stop it and this is
how you're surviving literally your physical survival depends upon the
meanings you're attaching and the sort of augmented reality that
your psyche has created to survive as that particular psyche
that you identify as that's the true cause of your
suffering so if you're one of these people who is
interested into spiritual work because you really want to escape
suffering and hey you know a lot of buddhists frame
spirituality in this way buddha himself probably did i think
is you know the point of spirituality just keep suffering
well if that is truly why you want to pursue
spirituality and you're pursuing my work and awakening in god
because you think it's going to free you from suffering
and that's what you care about most because you're in
such a deep state of suffering this is for you
and i don't just mean that you should do a
bunch of ketamine what i mean is that maybe do
a little ketamine and then notice notice the actual structure
that is creating your suffering become conscious of that and
then go about the difficult work of correcting those habits
and that's how you can escape your suffering so the
value of ketamine in this process would be to kind
of be the gateway to show you rather than just
me telling you or some guru or some buddhist telling
you it's very different for some buddhist monk to tell
you something versus you actually experiencing the very mechanism by
which your mind creates suffering because if you're not conscious
of it you're going to be at its effect you
can't transcend it and so yeah there's going to be
some some kind of afterglow but then the afterglow will
wear off so be ready for that don't think that
the afterglow will stick around forever so now let's compare
a little bit uh ketamine versus something like 5-meodmt because
you're probably wondering well leo i like what i'm hearing
here about ketamine so should i do ketamine instead of
five meow dmt what's your favorite now is do you
like having more than 500 mt what about dmt what
about mushrooms what about five mile malt what about other
stuff you've talked about uh you know leo what's better
for our work here if i'm trying to actualize all
this actualized stuff what's the best chemical to help me
uh i would still say that if you really want
the deepest understanding of reality possible what you're actually searching
for is you're not searching for a buddhist style no
self awakening i mean that's good you want that but
what you're really after is you're off after omniscience ketamine
doesn't give you that omniscience um and what you're really
after with omniscience is you're after god you're after god
realization god realization is still the highest even though there's
no not knowing stuff is great the no-self stuff is
great freedom from suffering is great all that is great
uh you know no mind that's great but it it
it it's just it pales in comparison to realizing yourself
as god and a state of complete omniscience and love
oh i forgot to talk about love uh let's bring
that up since we're on this topic um let's mention
that well i mean the reason i forgot to talk
about is because there really was none you don't really
get i didn't get any profound sense of love on
this ketamine trip and i doubt i would get much
more of it if i did higher doses because i
didn't really get any of flavors of love no real
realizations of love and so uh ketamine would not be
good for realizing love that doesn't mean love is any
less real it just means that ketamine doesn't focus on
that facet of awakening or consciousness at least not for
in my experience so um uh yeah so if you
if you want the highest awakening you got to realize
[ __ ] love is what i'm telling you so
for that purpose five mbo dmt is still one of
the best five emul malt is still one of the
best i would say those are the the two the
two best uh dmt classic dmt and ndmt also up
there probably in the top three um of course lsd
mushrooms those are all all good um but at a
lower tier really your top three are five of your
gmt five mule mult and classic dmt i would i
would put those at the very top um and so
if you're looking for god realization then then those three
if you're looking for for love realization then one of
those three and i would still prefer to do those
over ketamine but i still think there's value in ketamine
i think there's value in doing it more than once
i think there's value in doing it at higher doses
carefully right because it it does inhibit your ability to
walk and just even to to see so you gotta
be careful there's danger potential there um but it's worth
exploring i think five trips of ketamine in your lifetime
at least would be good good to explore that um
and then i don't know maybe if you're finding value
in it keep doing it beyond that but i probably
wouldn't do it more than like five or ten times
because i would just find more value in in the
other chemicals for what i'm interested in which is the
highest understanding of reality um ketamine is not going to
cut it and in fact it might create a false
sense that you're done so to speak and that you've
sort of realized the buddhists classic buddhist awakening sort of
thing and that you're sort of done and that now
there's nothing to know and that's it you're done and
the reality is that that's an illusion you're fooling yourself
and really what's very fascinating about comparing something like five
amio malt with ketamine is that it just shows you
the limitations of narrow paths like buddhism or advaita vedanta
or neo-advice stuff or this sort of like very simplistic
no-self teachings these sort of very stripped-down reductionistic versions of
spirituality these forms of spirituality where you're just you're you're
aiming towards cessation or the quieting of the mind you're
aiming towards no mind and that this is the sort
of the ultimate realization these are not the ultimate realization
they're great but they're not the ultimate and i think
it's very difficult to see that without any chemicals because
if you're just going to be following a buddhist path
just to reach that level of no mind and like
liberation or whatever else you want to call it you
know buddhists have all sorts of words for it you
know um to reach to reach these kinds of states
of consciousness requires so much work it's so rare that
when you do achieve it you're going to think you've
arrived and you're not going to know what you're missing
and really that's because you don't realize the infinite number
of states that consciousness can take and you have no
idea the highest states that consciousness can take and again
like i've said in the past meditation is not going
to take you to the highest states of awakening it
just isn't and the reason i say that is not
to be arrogant but because i've interacted with a lot
of people in the spiritual community who have done buddhist
practice and various kinds of neo-invited practices and advised vedanta
practices and so forth and uh it's just obvious to
me that they haven't had the most profound kind of
awakenings that i've experienced on for example fibromyalgia malt or
five amino dmt that's a whole other order of magnitude
of thing and um to me it's a higher it's
a higher awakening and it takes you more actually in
the sort of religious direction and more into the christian
direction than it does into the eastern buddhist vedantic direction
which are more stripped down forms of spirituality the five-meal
molten family of gmt takes you more into what i
would say is like the ecstatic forms of spirituality it's
an ecstatic mysticism whereas buddhism is more just like ketamine
that just sort of like nukes your conceptual mind but
nuking your conceptual mind is not the same thing as
omniscience or infinite consciousness or god realization or the realization
that reality is love and that's why a lot of
buddhists will deny god or they will deny love not
all of them some of them admit it but a
lot of them i've talked to advanced buddhists who have
clearly have no idea what god is they clearly aren't
conscious of themselves as god and that's because all they've
done in their 40 years of practice is they just
sat in meditation and they've trained themselves what does meditation
do it just trains you to nuke your conceptual mind
and then you're sitting there instead of no mind and
that's great you're free of suffering you're peaceful someone could
even pour a can of gasoline on you and light
it on fire and maybe you're not gonna make a
peep because you've trained yourself so well and your mind's
not creating any any suffering and you could burn alive
and that's looks cool right it looks very badass and
you might say you're liberated and all that that's all
fine and there's maybe a utility for all that but
it is it isn't the same as god realization you're
not actually omniscient so for me i would take five
ammo dmt or 5mm malt or dmt classic dmt over
ketamine and i think it's very useful to compare and
contrast in your own direct experience look if you're a
serious meditator if you're a serious buddhist a serious advice
or vedanta practitioner or yogi or whatever whatever it is
i can't communicate enough to you how valuable it is
for you to experience radically different states of consciousness that
are very different from the tradition or the sort of
lineage that you come from if you're good at meditation
that's great but i bet you you're missing something if
you can enter effortlessly in a state of no mind
and no suffering that's great you've achieved that let's say
but i bet you you're missing something and you don't
know what you're missing until the psychedelic shows you what
you're missing that's really one of the magic powers of
psychedelics it's not that they're going to completely transform your
mind and make you liberated and free of all suffering
forever in that sense psychedelics are pretty bad if that's
all you want then psychedelics won't give that to you
in many cases but what psychedelics really are good at
is just showing you the full gamut of what consciousness
is capable of and it shows you how radically different
high states of consciousness can be not all high states
of conscious are the same they can be radically different
and it shows you why there's so much diversity within
spiritual traditions and mystical traditions they're not all the same
the christians the buddhists the vedantists the yogis they're not
all talking about the same stuff they're accessing different states
of consciousness high states of consciousness mystical states of consciousness
godly states of conscience but in different ways and different
flavors and at different degrees and depths but none of
them are accessing the full gamut therefore there's so much
disagreement dispute and hostility and naysaying and criticism from one
tradition to the next there's also a lot of overlap
of course as well there's a lot of agreement but
there's a lot of disagreement too and this explains why
a lot of even awakened teachers will will disagree with
each other criticize each other fight with each other and
claim that one is not awakened when the other one
is and all that kind of stuff right it seems
petty but actually it's not petty it's it's because the
gamut of consciousness is much broader than anybody thinks even
awakened people and you need to understand that awakening comes
in many degrees and many flavors this word awakening or
enlightenment is a very dangerous word in the sense that
you hear it then you just start to assume that
well everyone who's talking about awakening or enlightenment are talking
about the same thing the same experience the same depth
the same breath all the same facets and the answer
is no that's not the case people are using this
word awakening or enlightenment or whatever they're using it in
their own personal way referring to their own personal experiences
which are different from other awakened people's experiences and it's
very hard to then compare those experiences the only way
to do it is personally for yourself the only way
you can compare different kinds of awakenings different depths and
degrees and flavors of awakenings different facets of awakenings is
by going through it yourself and that's very difficult to
do through any kind of singular spiritual practice it's very
easy to do with a a variety of different types
of chemicals it's like a consciousness buffet that's the difference
a traditional spiritual path is like going to your same
favorite restaurant over and over and over and over again
and really eating the same meal over and over again
and getting really familiar with that meal and maybe even
very satisfied with it over time to the point where
you forget that there's more than just that one meal
that's possible in the culinary world and then what i'm
advocating is more of a buffet approach right you go
to a las vegas buffet the caesars buffet one of
the best buffets in vegas that i've been to you
go there and then you get to sample a hundred
different things and some of them are not so great
other than are amazing but but but there's a sort
of a meta a meta quality to it that's above
and beyond any individual dishes that you get to experience
and compare and contrast all of them and you see
that oh my god that's really the magic of consciousness
and and god and and mind is not that it
does one thing deeply but that it has this incredible
diversity to it and then you can make sense of
mystical traditions and spiritual traditions and different religions a lot
better and you can make sense of spiritual disputes a
lot better because you realize that really a lot of
what spiritual disputes are about is like you know one
person at a buffet arguing for their favorite dish another
person arguing for their favorite dish because all they've eaten
is just that one dish they didn't go around the
whole buffet and try all the different dishes to see
the the the infinite diversity of the dishes and the
various kinds of pros and cons to those dishes so
the reason i'm so passionate about psychedelics you know people
keep saying leo when are you going to hear the
message and hang up the phone it's like um i
like exploring consciousness what else is there to do but
to explore consciousness to me that's the point of life
is to explore consciousness um so i i've never found
this sort of like singular mono-maniacal buddhist tradition or advice
and tradition or yoga tradition to be appealing to me
because it always felt just intuitively too limiting why would
i straight jacket myself by sticking to one tradition now
of course there's pros and cons to this when you
stick to one tradition you can go like really hard
on and get really good at meditating so i do
sacrifice in that sense i'm not the best meditator but
i think what i sacrificed there i've made more i've
more than made up for in other ways by exposing
myself to this vast gamut this diversity of of high
states of conscience and awakenings and facets of awakenings that
just simply i would not have been able to explore
and wouldn't even know about if i just blindly stuck
to some dogmatic uh you know buddhist meditative practice for
decades the way that some hardcore buddhists do and look
i appreciate their dedication that that's not easy to do
um honestly i envy that kind of you know mono
maniacal focus that some buddhist practitioners have i don't have
that to me i love exploring the diversity of consciousness
too much to sit there for you know for years
and decades doing the same old breath counting technique to
me um that that's that's that's way too limiting of
a form of spirituality i need a much more broader
richer form of spirituality than that so that's what i'm
pursuing and and i just i love the fact that
conscious has so much diversity to it to explore and
i'm excited to explore that further because the amazing thing
is that you never know what you're going to find
around the corner you think you've got all the facets
but then you realize there was something hidden in some
nook around the corner that you didn't quite know about
and maybe some chemical unlocks that for you so that
to me is the true value and power of psychedelics
so uh what's the final verdict on ketamine is it
worth doing here is my thoughts in a nutshell here's
a summary ketamine is good for depression and anxiety at
least temporarily i wouldn't expect it to be a magic
pill to solve it forever and don't think you can
just keep doing ketamine every day and you're going to
be well off i don't think that's going to work
but it is good for a temporary relief i think
if you're having suicidal thoughts it can be very helpful
against that too i think like for example if you're
on the edge of killing yourself and you have no
other saving grace you've tried everything else and nothing works
uh at that point i think yeah you have nothing
to lose give ketamine a shot it'll definitely wipe out
your suicidal thoughts at least for a few hours maybe
for a few days hey that's better you know that
might hold you over if you're in a really bad
funk suicidally speaking uh ketamine is great for shutting off
the mind for accessing non-symbolic consciousness if you don't know
what that is for analysis suppression if you suffer from
analysis paralysis then um just overthinking everything or anxiety caused
by that then ketamine will be good for that again
at least temporarily ketamine is good for showing you how
you're constructing that your depression your anxiety through your thoughts
it's good for that it's good for accessing not knowing
deep states of not knowing if you don't understand what
not knowing is or you haven't had a profound awakening
into not knowing you need that i think that's very
important and that might be difficult to access on certain
other psychedelics realizing no self that's also important of course
it's important to realize that your biographical human conceptual self
is a fabrication ketamine could be good for that the
downside of ketamine is going to be that it's going
to distort your visual field in an uncomfortable way and
the higher the dose the worse it's going to get
with blurring vision double division wandering vision it's going to
be hard to even focus on things and see things
clearly there's going to be difficulty walking that can become
dangerous the other downside is that there's going to be
a higher danger at higher doses it's not really a
fun psychedelic you're not going to be very sociable on
it it's not good for recreation i would have a
lot more fun personally on five million dmt or fabio
malt or almost any other psychedelic i would probably have
more fun on except salvia so it's not fun for
me um ketamine the other downside of ketamine it's not
as mystical as classic psychedelics it's not as profound as
5-meo dmt malt or dmt so if you're really looking
for like deep mystical spiritual profundity and insight um ketamine
is not the best for that it's not as godly
or loving so if you're looking for a god realization
or a love realization love awakening god awakening uh probably
try something other than than ketamine it is potentially physically
harmful there's reports that with a lot of use and
it has to be quite a lot of use you
will start to experience bladder problems and kidney problems pretty
severe ones but this is usually with people who've used
it you know who consume like multiple grams of ketamine
per day which is an enormous amount these are people
who are basically addicts uh speaking of which there's potential
here for addiction i can especially see it with people
who are very depressed very anxious or very suicidal once
they get a little taste of ketamine and they see
how good it is because it's going to give them
such a huge sense of relief from all that [
__ ] that you're just going to want to do
it the whole day every day every week and if
you get into that territory now you're using it to
escape your problems you're not actually solving any of your
problems you're fooling yourself and on top of that you're
actually physically harming your bladder and your kidneys and probably
other parts of your body maybe even your brain with
that much use and also what's going to happen is
you're going to build up tolerance that's the that's the
last negative thing i have to say about ketamine is
that it has tolerance so it takes about seven days
for the tolerance to go away seven ten days to
completely remove the tolerance but if you get addicted to
it you keep using it all the time you can
develop tolerance that's going to eventually turn into tolerance that
lasts for weeks and even for months if you way
over use it so the nice thing about the more
classic psychedelics especially five in the odmt fabio malt and
dmt is that they have no tolerance whatsoever now mushrooms
and lsd those do have tolerance which is about also
seven to ten days um but the classic psychedelics relatively
speaking compared to ketamine they don't actually cause physical harm
to the brain or your kidney or your bladder or
any of your organ systems as far as i understand
and in my experience so i definitely think that something
like 5mm dmt is physically safer it's also not addictive
um so there's there's less potential for abuse there now
i have to uh i have to mention that i've
only done a moderate dose of ketamine i haven't done
high doses or doses high enough to reach what they
call the k hole uh and so some of you
who have reached the k hole might be saying leo
what are you talking about ketamine is so profound and
so mystical and and all this like you're underselling ketamine
because you just haven't gone deep enough i'm fully aware
of that possibility uh i'm extra careful with ketamine because
i am worried about how it might affect my health
and so forth and you know some of the dangers
with losing sight of your vision and losing your your
walking ability there's definitely dangers to ketamine beyond stuff that
you can experience on five meow dmt or other psychedelics
so i'm cautious about that i don't know maybe at
some point in my life i will take enough ketamine
to experience a k-hole um i've read reports about it
it sounds pretty profound i would like to experience it
um maybe at one point in my life but uh
i'm not really rushing to get there and um [Music]
i don't know uh i still think you're gonna get
ultimately a deeper a deeper awakening through something like 5mu
dmt um but maybe i'm wrong but maybe the k-hole
will will change my mind about i don't know so
um so just keep that in mind this is sort
of like giving you the moderate dosed version of what
ketamine is if you take it at really high doses
it might get much more profound than what i've talked
about here but also keep in mind that if you
take crazy high doses of five amino gmt or fibonium
malt or dmt you will also reach states that are
just absurdly profound beyond anything that words can describe so
again you know you have to kind of compare apples
to apples here because if you take a if you
compare a mild dose of five of you on gmt
with a k whole dose of ketamine then yeah the
ketamine might be more profound but you got to also
then take like the k whole version dose of 5
amio dmt to compare it to the k-hole uh dose
of ketamine and then you know who knows who knows
which one is is gonna be more profound and then
also we have to be open to the possibility that
for different people it different substances will have different degrees
of profundity kind of depends on what your priorities are
what your interests are and even your genetics and how
the chemical affects your brain because these chemicals affect people
in different ways and you're really not going to know
until you try for yourself so with that said ultimately
the question is should you do ketamine do i recommend
it here's my thoughts on that first of all if
you're not mentally stable and you suffer from mental illness
then i don't recommend any kind of chemical for you
no tripping for you basically uh is too risky but
assuming that's not the issue uh i think like i
said it's worth doing at least a few times if
you're serious about understanding consciousness my teachings are geared towards
people that really want to understand consciousness if you don't
care about understanding consciousness and exploring the full gamut of
consciousness then don't don't do it and maybe for you
your mushrooms and your lsd is enough for me personally
it's worthwhile to experience the difference to be able to
contrast tryptamines versus dissociatives because they are a different class
of chemical and if you only do psychedelics and tryptamines
uh and you miss out on the dissociatives then you're
gonna be missing something potentially so to me that's that's
a valuable contrast and experience to have but overall i
still prefer tryptamines over dissociatives and then the final point
is the healing potential there is some great healing potential
with this chemical for depression anxiety trauma suicidal thoughts that's
that's the plus side but the minus side is that
those people who suffer the most from those conditions are
probably going to be the people that most likely abuse
ketamine and get addicted to it and destroy their body
with that addiction and use it as an escape rather
than as a legitimate tool for personal development and growth
and so in that case i don't know what to
tell you people like you know if you're on the
brink of suicidal depression for example um should you take
ketamine i mean on the one hand you got you
got little to lose if you're already thinking about killing
yourself on the other hand um maybe it just sends
you over the top and makes you even more suicidal
after you come back down from it you know because
when you're going to be in it you're going to
feel great but when you come out of it you're
going to feel so shitty again and if you're not
going to take responsibility for actually changing your life and
the way your mind works you're just going to go
back into your old thoughts and that's probably going to
make you even more depressed and more hopeless and even
more suicidal and maybe then you get addicted to ketamine
and i don't know is it better for you to
have suicidal thoughts um and potentially kill yourself or is
it better for you to get addicted to ketamine for
the next five years and destroy your your bladder and
your kidneys but at least you don't kill yourself you
know with a gun uh which is better i don't
know there's no way i can answer that for you
you know you got to figure that out for yourself
i'm just sharing some of my thoughts and experiences with
you ultimately it's very important for me that you take
full responsibility for whatever you put into your body how
you change your consciousness how you explore consciousness how you
do personal development work how you do spiritual work right
i'm not telling you to do any particular thing i'm
sharing my experiences i'm giving you ideas of what's possible
you have to then do your own research and critically
decide for yourself as the ceo of your life the
chief executive of your life that's you as the ceo
of your life you bear full responsibility for what you
decide to do with your life which meditation techniques you
decide to do which yoga techniques which books you read
which teachers you listen to whether you even listen to
what i'm saying and you believe me or disbelieve me
you're responsible for that in the end don't try to
offload that responsibility on to me i try to make
these videos as safe as possible but in the wrong
hands this information is not safe nothing is safe in
the wrong hands a fork is not safe in the
wrong hands so just keep that in mind as you're
thinking about all this stuff don't try to do things
because you think i told you to do them i
didn't tell you to do anything i want you to
be mature enough and take ownership over your life that
when you decide to do something it's because you decided
to do it because you think it's right for you
based on your best intuitions and research rather than because
some authority figure or some charismatic youtuber persuaded you with
some fancy words to do something don't do things just
because you see me doing them do things because it
makes sense for you in your overarching plan for your
life that you yourself have designed carefully consciously by sitting
down and reflecting independent of whatever anybody else thinks or
says including myself based on your highest values and your
life purpose and your priorities this is crucial you can't
have a good life without taking on this responsibility it's
a big responsibility to take ownership of your own life
and to make decisions for yourself and to generate your
own answers rather than looking for other authority figures to
just give you the answers the easy answers without working
for them generating your own answers takes more work that's
why people don't do it because they're they're lazy and
they want just somebody to give them a quick answer
somebody smart somebody charismatic somebody that they can hold up
put on a pedestal as some authority figure guru spiritual
teacher or whatever so hopefully you understand that and i
think most of you do and as long as you
do that that's that's what should keep you more or
less safe at least as safe as you can be
now there's no guarantees of safety in life uh you
just want to take precautions and one of the most
important precautions is to think for yourself and not just
to blindly follow the words of that of others or
just do something that i'm doing just because i'm doing
it see i'm me and you're you i have a
unique character profile you have a unique character profile ketamine
could affect me differently than the way it affects you
dmt can affect me differently than the way that it
affects you and my goals could be different from your
goals my spiritual goals can be different from your spiritual
goals you see so that's all something you have to
think about you know sit and contemplate this stuff go
for a drive go drive around town for an hour
contemplate this stuff for yourself rather than just clicking on
the next video and just glutting your mind with more
video more video more video more video i hope you're
taking time to pause and reflect on these videos especially
my videos because i pack a lot of material and
insight into these videos a lot of experience goes into
these episodes such that you can watch one of them
and contemplate it for weeks for months for years and
extract more insights from it and then also act on
it and get gain experiences and re-watch it like you
have to you have to engage with this material don't
just be passively listening to this stuff while you're cooking
dinner every night and you just watch one video after
another video after another and not thinking about it and
you're just always constantly jumping from video to video to
video just listening and vibing information being programmed by my
words while you're doing some mindless chore but but not
sitting down and actually consciously thinking about these things that
were said to you that would be a big mistake
a big trap that i want you to avoid all
right that's it for today see you the next one
you
