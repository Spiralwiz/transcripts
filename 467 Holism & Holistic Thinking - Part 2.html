            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/g4A7SBx-CEg' target='_blank'>Holism & Holistic Thinking - Part 2</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Holism's impact on theoretical physics</b>: Leo Gura describes his experiences while undergoing a 14-day water fast and how he noticed that not eating for several days changed the way his mind functions. He suggests that the quality of science depends heavily on your personal nutrition, which impacts how the brain and mind work. Physicists and scientists might deny the impact of nutrition on their theoretical discoveries, yet their ability to form theories or understand them can depend largely on their nutrition. Ignoring the connection between good science and personal nutrition indicates a lack of a holistic perspective.
</li><li><b>Effect of nutrition on consciousness</b>: Poor personal nutrition can prevent people, especially materialistic scientists, from having direct experiences of mystical or spiritual insights. Gura suggests that the dismissal of spiritual experiences as superstitions is due to clogged nervous systems affected by poor nutrition - preventing higher levels of consciousness. This dismissal is a result of a lack of holistic connection between nutrition and the potential for profound experiences. 
</li><li><b>Need for holistic perspective to improve Science</b>: The quality of scientific discoveries depends highly on personal health and lifestyle factors, including not only nutrition but also exercise, levels of toxins, and medications. This underscores a need for a holistic perspective in the scientific community where individuals recognize the interconnections between different aspects of life to improve their scientific explorations. 
</li><li><b>Holism's impact on personal and societal problems</b>: Adopting a holistic attitude towards life is transformative. Problems once seen as insurmountable from a reductionist perspective can be resolved with a holistic view. Many issues individuals face are rooted in a lack of holism. But moving from treating different aspects of life as separate entities to interconnected pieces of a bigger picture can lead to solutions previously unseen.
</li><li><b>Examples of problems arising from lack of holistic thinking</b>: Gura lays out a series of societal and personal problems stemming from a lack of holistic thinking. He identifies environmental and ecological issues as one of the significant societal implications of non-holistic thinking. This is evident amongst people who litter, demonstrating a complete disregard for how small personal actions can contribute to larger environmental issues. 
</li><li><b>Disconnection between seperate aspects of life leading to problems</b>: Gura points out that compartmentalizing various aspects of lifelike relationships, nutritional habits, psychological well-being, science, etc.can create barriers to better insights and results. Recognizing the deep interconnection between these life domains dissolves these barriers and opens up paths for more holistic and beneficial approaches to life issues. 
</li><li><b>Value of holistic thinking to achieve sustainable outcomes</b>: Emphasizing the significance of holistic thinking, Gura notes that being uninformed about the broader impacts of individual actions or decisions can lead to unsatisfactory and unsustainable outcomes, underlining the need for a holistic approach to make progress in life.
</li><li><b>Ecological Lack of Holism</b>: Leo points out the environmental degradation caused by lack of holistic thinking, such as overfishing and pollution. He highlights how the introduction of invasive species can trigger an ecological chain reaction, like how the non-native weasels in Hawaii started decimating bird populations due to targeted predation and lack of natural enemies, thus showing the importance of considering all interconnections in a species' introduction to a new environment. 
</li><li><b>Unholistic Approach in Western Medicine</b>: Leo shares his personal negative experiences with doctors who focus on narrow symptom lists and specific specialties, often passing patients around without considering all possible interconnected aspects of their health. These experiences underline how unholistic and compartmentalized Western medicine can be, ignoring critical interconnected aspects of health and leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.
</li><li><b>Holism in Human Health</b>: Leo emphasizes that good health can only be achieved through a holistic approach to the human body, considering all interconnected aspects of our health, not only physical but also mental and emotional, highlighting the connection between the teeth and the immune system as an overlooked example in modern medicine. Neglecting this holistic approach has resulted in millions of preventable health issues, often treated with medication instead of preventative measures like diet adjustment and exercise.
</li><li><b>Healing through Nutrition</b>: Leo shares how diet and exercise can dramatically improve health and even cure illnesses such as heart disease and autoimmune disorders. However, he criticizes that many medical professionals, including cardiologists, often do not consider these options, focusing more on performing their specialties and prescribing medication, ignoring the essential role nutrition plays in health. 
</li><li><b>Current State of Nutritional Understanding</b>: Leo mentions that fad diets and nutrition trends lack holistic thinking. He suggests that focusing on individual dietary goals like losing weight or following a vegan diet for ethical reasons can ignore important factors like the environmental impact of industrial farming, ethical treatment of animals, and sustainability. His emphasis lies on adopting a broader, more holistic approach to nutrition, considering all associated effects, including personal and environmental health.
</li><li><b>Holistic approach to Nutrition</b>: Nutrition involves not just personal health but the well-being of society, animals, and the environment. Diets focused solely on aspects like fat loss, muscle gain, or ethical principles like veganism for animal welfare is seen as non-holistic. Health may deteriorate due to strict veganism or non-vegetarian diets based on cheap, harmful food products. 
</li><li><b>Context in Nutrition</b>: Context is necessary in deciding nutritional intake. Factors such as age, gender, race, etc., influence the effect nutrients can have on one's body. Health consideration should balance with societal and environmental impacts, including global warming, overfishing, soil depletion, and deforestation for cash crops.
</li><li><b>Limits of Nutrition Labels</b>: Nutrition labels limit understanding as they only highlight macronutrients & calories, ignoring different types of carbs, fats and proteins and the varied impact they can have depending on individual bodies. The labels also neglect antioxidants and pigments in plants, which have important health properties. 
</li><li><b>Ethical Considerations in Nutrition</b>: Ethical arguments, such as choosing veganism for animal rights or adverse environmental impacts due to animal farming, are important in choosing a diet but should not compromise one's personal health. Long-term health damage is a negative consequence. 
</li><li><b>Dissection of Business Practices</b>: Modern day businesses are focused on extracting monetary value from various aspects of human life like art, spirituality, environment, health, societal well-being etc; rather than caring for these aspects on their own. While businesses operate in these fields, they prioritize profit over the actual value these aspects hold for sustainable human existence.
</li><li><b>Business Participation in Diverse Fields</b>: Despite business engaging in various areas like art, spirituality, environment, health, and society, the concern is not for the fields themselves but the profit they can extract. They lack genuine care for their influence on these fields. 
</li><li><b>Soulless Business Practices</b>: Commercial expertise often overlooks the intrinsic value of impacting people's lives or uplifting society. The pursuit of profit devalues the significance of other considerations and leads to practices that lack soul and spirit.
</li><li><b>Prioritizing Positive Impact over Profit</b>: Positive societal impact, raising social consciousness and personal development should be prioritized above business interests. Advocates for such a holistic business approach argue it as the practical course of action for long-term sustainability.
</li><li><b>The Business of Actualized.org</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges the potential for substantial increases in earnings, visibility, and popularity if he shifted more resources to marketing. However, he chooses to focus on the substance and quality of the work instead, which leads to better content.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Corporate Culture</b>: Leo Gura criticizes the corporate world's dismissal of art, spirituality, and health, leading to unhealthy practices and societal problems. Despite the financial and social benefits, he left the corporate world due to these issues, emphasizing the need for independent, holistic business approaches.
</li><li><b>Unhealthy Practices in the Game Development Industry</b>: Gura points to the harmful work culture prevalent in the game development industry. Practices such as excessive working hours, fast food consumption and disregard for employee health pose serious long-term risks both on an individual and societal level.
</li><li><b>Negative Effects of Marketing</b>: Marketing is critiqued for its largely unacknowledged and detrimental impact on societal well-being and human psychology. Gura believes that the pervasiveness and subliminal message of advertisements shape desires, fears, and worldviews from a young age, leading to a widespread societal "brainwashing."
</li><li><b>Geopolitical Consequences of Unholistic Thinking</b>: Gura argues that a lack of holistic understanding in geopolitics can lead to devastating errors, such as the Iraq War. The failure to consider all the intricate, interconnected factors of a region before deciding to intervene militarily reflects an absence of holistic thinking.
</li><li><b>Scientific Ignorance of Metaphysics and Epistemology</b>: The scientist's disregard for metaphysics and epistemology is highlighted as an example of unholistic thinking in science. Gura asserts that the current scientific method implicitly relies on a materialistic worldview, limiting its potential for deeper understanding and scientific progress.
</li><li><b>Ignoring the importance of metaphysics and spirituality in science</b>: Leo argues that academic scientists often have an unholistic perspective, maintaining that science and spirituality are separate fields. This limiting view prevents them from truly understanding or resolving issues such as the mind-body problem, which Leo suggests can only be resolved through metaphysics, epistemology, and spirituality.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of consciousness</b>: According to Leo, many scientists are under the erroneous belief that science cannot explain consciousness, often dismissing it as unworthy of scientific study. However, he argues that understanding consciousness is perfectly attainable, but this understanding eludes most scientists due to their failure to think holistically and understand the interconnectedness of matter and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Failure to generalize scientific discoveries</b>: Leo asserts that scientists often fail to generalize lessons from specific scientific findings, such as those from quantum mechanics, to broader fields and domains. This failure to generalize prevents insights from advancing our understanding in other areas. Leo criticizes scientists' conservative approach, stating that their unwillingness to broaden the scope of understanding significantly hinders scientific progress.
</li><li><b>Shortcomings of psychology</b>: Leo criticizes the field of psychology for its reductionistic approach and dismissal of spiritual, existential, and epistemological considerations in treating patients. He blames this for poor results in therapy and believes that a holistic understanding of the ego, achievable only through deep spiritual understanding, is essential for effective treatment.
</li><li><b>Limitations of reductionism in logical and mathematical fields</b>: Leo points out past attempts at reductionism in the fields of logic and mathematics, such as Logicism and Hilbert's project. These movements attempted to simplify all mathematical truths into formal logical systems, but they ultimately failed. Leo cites Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and Russell's paradox as factors that contributed to their failure, highlighting the paradoxical nature of consciousness and symbolic understanding as obstacles to simplification.
</li><li><b>Adherence to narrowly defined domains</b>: Leo criticizes those in the scientific, mathematical, and logical fields for their refusal to acknowledge potential generalizations that could be drawn from specific theories or findings. He asserts that many professionals in these fields are resistant to thinking beyond their narrowly established domains, preventing them from seeing potential interconnected implications and broader understandings.
</li><li><b>Holism in scientific understanding</b>: Leo emphasizes the necessity of a holistic approach in interpreting scientific discoveries, arguing that a failure to do so limits our understanding. He posits that the "bubble" mentality, or confining oneself to a certain paradigm or worldview, can inhibit the ability to form interconnections and generalize understanding across domains. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of limited understanding</b>: Leo alleges that those who maintain a limited understanding in their fields of studybe it mathematics, logic, or scienceare neglectful and negatively affect those dependent on their work, particularly in the context of psychology and therapy.
</li><li><b>Reductionist failures in understanding reality</b>: Despite the failures of reductionist attempts, like logical positivism, at breaking complex phenomena down into simpler parts for understanding, many similar problems persist in modern science. Reality is a complex unity that requires a holistic approach to understand it fully, rather than being broken into bits and pieces.
</li><li><b>The unholistic approach in technology and business</b>: The invention of technologies for business purposes often overlooks important ethical considerations due to the lack of holistic thinking. This convenience for business profitability fosters ethical ignorance and can potentially produce harmful effects.
</li><li><b>Einstein's theories and the progression towards holistic thinking</b>: Einstein's special relativity theory, which focused on the difference in velocity when moving in the same direction, was later expanded into general relativity to include more complex elements like acceleration, rotational forces, and planetary orbits. If Einstein's thinking had been more holistic, he could have generalized relativity even further to apply to all aspects of the universe, including the human mind, science, religion, and different cultures.
</li><li><b>The lack of holistic thinking in education system</b>: The current education system largely ignores important areas like personal development, emotional intelligence, love, epistemology, metaphysics, spirituality, nutrition, and health. A deep reform is needed to create an education system that focuses more on these pivotal areas for personal and social development.
</li><li><b>Limitation of scientific studies</b>: Scientific studies, despite providing crucial insights, often present narrow, unholistic results that can be easily recontextualized by future data and studies. Their narrow focus can lead to misleading perceptions of truth and harmful beliefs.
</li><li><b>The limitations of narrow scientific studies</b>: Relying on studies that focus on specific aspects like coffee or red wine can be misleading due to their lack of holistic approach. The complex nature of the human organism can't be understood from such limited research, potentially leading to harm from misinformative results.
</li><li><b>Leading a hedonistic lifestyle</b>: With a holistic approach, one would consider the total impact of lifestyle choices like junk food or lack of exercise. These activities may bring immediate gratification but harm one's overall well-being, relationships, productivity, and longevity in the long run.
</li><li><b>Staying stuck in unsatisfying work for monetary gains</b>: Sticking to a job that doesn't align with one's values and life purpose but pays well can lead to long-term dissatisfaction. A holistic approach enables making the difficult decision to leave and find fulfilling work despite temporary financial setbacks.
</li><li><b>Being a workaholic and avoiding medical check-ups</b>: Taking an unholistic approach can lead to harmful behaviors like being a workaholic, ignoring balanced living and health check-ups. These actions can result in burnout, diseases, and overall declined health.
</li><li><b>Losing sight of the ultimate goal in long-term projects</b>: It's easy to lose track of the actual purpose of lengthy projects due to daily work demands. Taking a step back to reaffirm the ultimate goal and reassess your path can help maintain the integrity and ultimate impact of your work or project.
</li><li><b>Being 'cheap' when hiring employees</b>: Hiring cheap labor often backfires as it may mean compromising on skills, talent, innovation and overall performance. A holistic approach recommends investing in quality workforce for a healthier, long-term business output.
</li><li><b>Lying in relationships</b>: Dishonesty fractures relationships in the long-run, eroding its quality and sustainability. A successful relationship requires building upon a foundation of honesty, highlighting the importance of holistic thinking in maintaining a healthy, meaningful bond.
</li><li><b>Unholistic approach in the pickup community</b>: Focusing solely on male perspectives in the pickup community ignores the female viewpoint, proving the lack of holism in the field. Despite short-term 'success' (getting laid), such an approach does not facilitate deep, meaningful connections.
</li><li><b>Impact of an Unholistic Attitude on Relationships</b>: Leo Gura discusses the negative effects of an unholistic perspective on relationships, particularly regarding the pickup community's approach towards sex, dating, and relationships. He highlights an overemphasis on personal benefit, leading to less fulfilling relationships.
</li><li><b>Effects of Staying Married "For The Sake of Children"</b>: He mentions how some couples remain together solely for their children. However, if the couple's relationship is toxic and filled with continuous arguing, this could negatively influence their children over time. In such cases, holistic thinking would suggest separation might be healthier for the children.
</li><li><b>Business Practices and Customer Relations</b>: Unethical business practices such as ripping off customers may seem beneficial in the short term, but it is unholistic and may result in long term failure once the customers become resentful.
</li><li><b>Significance of Theory in Practical Applications</b>: Gura criticizes the dismissal of theory in favor of practicality, arguing that it limits growth and understanding. Theoretical understanding can inform practice, showing new ways to implement actions and fine-tune procedures.
</li><li><b>Effects of Spiritual Negligence</b>: A lack of holism can be identified in the avoidance of spiritual work or existential contemplation, resulting in a life filled with deep suffering, especially towards aging and facing death. 
</li><li><b>Paradigm Lock as an Unholistic Practice</b>: Gura suggests the lack of holistic thinking leads to a paradigm lock where individuals are stuck in worldviews or paradigms, limiting their broader understanding. Paradigms can restrict individuals from exploring alternate perspectives which could lead to a higher understanding.
</li><li><b>Corruption and Holistic Intelligence</b>: He describes corruption as a manifestation of lack of holistic intelligence. Corruption isn't only about government or corporate corruption, but it permeates all levels of society and can be minimized by promoting holistic intelligence.
</li><li><b>Holistic Approach to Understanding Paradigms</b>: Encourages viewers to contemplate their own perspectives and how they align or contrast with different paradigms. This holistic approach promotes breaking out of restrictive paradigms and contributes to mind jailbreaking, facilitating a broader understanding beyond the individual paradigms.
</li><li><b>Seeing Beyond Paradigms with the help of Holistic Thinking</b>: Notes the importance of rising above personal paradigms and integrating diverse viewpoints. Perceiving reality and paradigms through a holistic lens allows for the emergence of a higher, more encompassing perspective, ultimately leading to an infinitely holistic way of thinking.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness Between Individual and Collective Level</b>: Gura emphasizes the interconnectedness between the individual and collective level, asserting that both have to be balanced with each other. This integration reduces the fragmentation and disease that stems from seeing them as separate entities.
</li><li><b>Catch-22 of Holism</b>: Thinking holistically requires appreciating the value of holism. However, appreciating the value of holism requires thinking holistically, creating a catch-22. Therefore, it's difficult to convince someone to think holistically if they don't see value in it.
</li><li><b>Understanding Life via Holism</b>: Understanding various aspects of life such as dynamics between men and women, war and conflict, trauma, evil, societal health, and corruption require a holistic approach. By valuing and seeking out deeper understanding, one naturally tends toward holistic thinking.
</li><li><b>Components of Holistic Thinking</b>: Holistic thinking involves taking responsibility for everything and recognizing the effects of actions on the whole. This includes internalizing external factors beyond one's immediate survival concerns. In addition, holism requires being aware of systemic emergent properties and considering changes that construct a non-linear, interconnected system. 
</li><li><b>Failure to Adopt Holism</b>: If one fails to adopt a holistic lifestyle, they may pursue paths that seem attractive like acquiring wealth and power, but ultimately result in dissatisfaction. An unholistic lifestyle can lead to a state of constant striving in a hedonic treadmill and, thus, does not yield deep fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Significance of Holistic Living</b>: The holistic path may be difficult and challenging but ultimately results in depth, meaning, and fulfillment. To lead a holistic life, one has to consider all levels of existence, internalize external impacts, make responsible choices, and take into account the emergence of new systems and realities. 
</li><li><b>Emergence of New Consciousness from Interconnectedness</b>: Due to the steady integration of mankind through technology like the internet, a new form of collective consciousness may be emerging akin to a hive mind. This reflects the holistic belief of new realities constantly forming and evolving. 
</li><li><b>Counter-intuitive Outcomes</b>: A key part of holistic thinking is understanding that outcomes in complex systems can often be counter-intuitive or lead to the opposite of what was expected. Actions within these systems can often backfire, meaning holistic thinkers always need to be prepared for non-linear outcomes and inversions.
</li><li><b>(Holistic thinking and interconnectedness)</b>: Holistic thinking involves understanding both the parts and the whole and recognizing how they fit together. This perspective enables a better understanding of complex dynamics, such as individual problems being intertwined with collective issues. Duality cannot ultimately be separated, highlighting the interconnectedness of seemingly distinct elements.
</li><li><b>(Moving beyond dualities)</b>: Duality, such as that between men and women or individual and collective problems, is inherently interconnected. At the highest level of understanding, these dualities merge and are recognized as relative differences rather than absolute ones.
</li><li><b>(Holistic thinking requires a long-term perspective)</b>: Besides understanding parts and wholes and interconnection, holistic thinking also requires a long-term perspective, considering the impacts and effects of decisions and actions beyond the immediate context. This perspective is necessary for addressing grand challenges like climate change.
</li><li><b>(Importance of priorities, context, and balance in holistic thinking)</b>: Holistic thinking also necessitates considering the relevance, priority, context, and balance while making decisions, further emphasizing its complexity. It involves thinking about what really matters and how to balance different aspects of any situation.
</li><li><b>(Caring about the whole)</b>: Beyond just thinking holistically, it's critical to care about the whole genuinely. However, many people struggle with this because personal survival needs often take precedence. Thus, to become genuinely holistic, one must first find sustainable and healthy solutions to meet basic survival needs.
</li><li><b>(Different levels of understanding politics)</b>: Politics provides a good example of different levels of holistic understanding, ranging from a surface-level idea of defeating opposing parties to viewing politics as a means of improving society and reducing suffering. Further, the highest holistic understanding views politics as a reflection of the universe becoming more interconnected and self-aware, ultimately leading to infinite love.
</li><li><b>(Continuous learning and perspective enlargement)</b>: Broadening the perspective requires constant learning and self-improvement. This involves solving personal survival challenges sustainably, so an individual has the mental capacity to consider larger issues. Achieving the highest stage of holistic understanding requires spiritual awakenings and a profound comprehension of the interconnectedness of everything. 
</li><li><b>(Teaching holistic thinking)</b>: The challenge is in teaching this highest level of understanding to wide audiences, as it requires individual spiritual awakenings. Nevertheless, gradual progress towards holistic thinking can occur as individuals endeavor to solve their survival challenges in sustainable and healthy ways.
</li><li><b>Holistic Thinking in Politics</b>: Politics, at a fundamental level, can be seen as a facet of the universe becoming self-aware, interconnected, and embodying infinite love. It is about creation itself. However, not everyone may be capable or willing to grasp this concept due to self-bias and the limitation of their level of cognitive development.
</li><li><b>Levels of Understanding in Science</b>: Science, at different tiers of cognition, can be viewed as an instrument for manipulating reality, a tool for measurements, a means to grasp the universe and its phenomena, and, at its highest level, a process of the universe realizing itself as God and love. It's explained that science is identical to spirituality and is an exploration of God understanding itself out of curiosity and love.
</li><li><b>Every Perspective Has some Value</b>: The philosophy that every perspective, even ones that may seem twisted, has some degree of truth and value to it, and understanding it contributes to an expanded perception making it crucial to holistic thinking.
</li><li><b>Developing Holistic Thinking</b>: Any field can adopt different levels of holistic thinking. Ways to develop it include: asking quality questions, expanding perspectives, breaking down materialistic views, understanding one's self biases, developing intuition, avoiding quick satisfaction with low-level answers, appreciating diversity of perspectives, and accepting the idea "everyone is right" to some degree.
</li><li><b>Questions to Foster Holistic Thinking</b>: Powerful questions to encourage holistic thinking include: How are X and Y interconnected? What is the big picture here? What is the larger context? What is the ultimate point of this? Why am I doing this? How is this part of something larger? How does this part serve the whole? How is this part of a duality?
</li><li><b>Holistic approaches and questions</b>: Leo suggests various questions that help in adopting a holistic approach, including considering the overall health of the whole, questioning how parts should be rebalanced for the benefit of the whole, and identifying parts that are selflessly leeching from the whole. Exploring how systems might be fragmented and how they can be unified and healed also promotes holistic thinking.
</li><li><b>Drawing boundaries in holistic thinking</b>: In holistic thinking, it's crucial to consider who is defining boundaries and how. Narrow, selfishly drawn boundaries can exclude many factors, leading to a lack of holistic understanding. When confronted with a situation, questioning one's involvement  direct or indirect  encourages holistic thinking and personal responsibility.
</li><li><b>God consciousness and holistic thinking</b>: Considering situations through the perspective of 'God consciousness'  a state of mind that is unbiased, selfless, unattached, benevolent, all-loving, all-understanding, non-judgmental, and seeks exquisite balance for the good of all  can offer powerful insights for holistic thinking.
</li><li><b>Practice of holistic thinking vs. manipulation</b>: Leo emphasizes that using the understanding of holistic thinking for manipulation for personal gains is not truly holistic, but selfish and toxic. The highest level of holistic thinking integrates the perspective of all, including reductionism and unholistic elements.
</li><li><b>Incorporating unconventional in holistic thinking</b>: To truly practice holistic thinking, one has to embrace even those elements that are traditionally regarded as contradictory or antagonistic to a holistic perspective. This would include evil or unholistic practices. Embracing them doesn't mean accepting or promoting these practices, but acknowledging them as part of reality.
</li><li><b>State of consciousness and holistic thinking</b>: The highest level of holistic thinking goes beyond thought and enters the realm of pure infinite consciousness. Changing individual states of consciousness, including through the use of psychedelics, can effectively lead to more holistic thinking. 
</li><li><b>Holistic approach in everyday situations</b>: Leo provides examples of how to apply a holistic approach in everyday situations. This involves asking oneself how one can better serve the whole and noting how unholistic tendencies like division, fragmentation, and reductionism are biases that need to be released. 
</li><li><b>Final thoughts on holistic thinking</b>: The practice of holistic thinking can be challenging due to its demands on personal ego, yet it offers substantial rewards, steering towards goodness. Therefore, the adoption and application of holistic thinking fundamentally aligns with winning at life.
</li><li><b>Holism and Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics are often described as providing a holistic feeling, demonstrating a unity and interconnectedness of everything. This holistic perspective is powerful and can potentially lead to deeper spiritual insights.
</li><li><b>Healing through Holistic Thinking</b>: To solve societal and personal problems, a holistic mind must be cultivated. Unholistic solutions like seeking quick, immediate gratification often lead to recurring or new issues. Considering problems in a holistic manner with a focus on long-term solutions and understanding the bigger picture leads to more effective resolutions. 
</li><li><b>Effect of Fragmented and Unholistic Thinkng</b>: Many life problems that seem impossible, such as financial difficulties, failed relationships, health problems, addictions, and more have likely been approached in a limited and unholistic way. He encourages the viewer to question their ways of thinking and consider the issue from a more holistic perspective to find effective solutions.
</li><li><b>Holism, Ethics, and Happiness</b>: True holism incorporates and integrates 'unholistic' aspects. It involves surrendering one's ego and accepting all aspects of reality, even those perceived as negative. True holism goes beyond thought and recognises that deeper consciousness is a determinant of one's holistic development. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-awareness and Improvement</b>: Acknowledging the biases we hold is key to understanding why we perceive certain things as 'bad'. Leo proposes that the attainment of good is equivalent to the practice of holism. Therefore, if one desires to achieve the highest good possible, they must seek the highest level of holism. 
</li><li><b>Holism in Context</b>: Holistic thinking provides an upper hand in life&mdash;multidimensional solutions and better resolutions to problems are born out of this thought process. The more holistic one is, the higher the chance of emerging victorious in the 'game of life'.
</li><li><b>Continuing Personal Development</b>: Checking out various resources such as lectures and books can aid in developing a more holistic paradigm. Leo emphasizes the importance of reading at least 100 books from his reading list. The knowledge and understanding gained from these sources will contribute to the journey of self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Summary</b>: To encapsulate, this section underscores the importance of holistic thinking in resolving personal and societal issues effectively. It posits that true holism extends beyond rational thinking to embody a deeper understanding and acceptance of all facets of reality. It also emphasizes that continuous learning and in-depth understanding of various topics can significantly help in becoming more holistic thinkers.
