[Music] in this episode i'm going to share with you
a rather profound and root level solution to two very
common problems that people face with personal development and that
is people pleasing and dealing with loneliness this is not
your ordinary self-help advice here this is this is something
rather advanced but at the same time it's simple enough
that many of you i think would benefit from it
and it comes from some of my own recent advancements
in consciousness and some epiphanies that i've had with regard
to these two problems and especially with the first problem
of people pleasing this is a problem that i faced
for a long time in my life since i was
a kid and when i first moved to america from
another country i had difficulty acclimating and therefore i developed
certain habits of people-pleasing that has taken me decades literally
multiple decades to understand just to understand to become aware
of and then try to come up with solutions to
fix and i think only recently have i sort of
started to crack that that nut and we're gonna kill
two birds with one stone here because not only are
we gonna give you a root solution to your people
pleasing which i know many of you suffer from but
also uh with the loneliness problem which i have never
suffered from that much but i know many of you
do and i'll help you to figure that out as
well so where do we begin uh let me gather
my thoughts here okay so how do i want to
purchase um the thing is is that in the first
20 years of our lives as we're growing up we
basically start off like animals little children are basically like
animals they have the cognitive development of an animal and
then they have to quickly adapt to fit into society
and society is very much a collective game and you
have to learn to play by the collective rules of
the game or you start to run into problems very
quickly so as a child you were acculturated you were
assimilated socially you were civilized from just an animal and
um you were domesticated and these are not necessarily bad
things i mean this needs to happen because we can't
have children running around and then even as adults you
know biting their neighbors and yelling at each other and
throwing their feces and all sorts of things like this
that an animal might do that chimps at the zoo
might do so we do need to civilize ourselves if
we're going to live in a large society the way
that we do today so that's all necessary and unavoidable
but there are certain consequences and costs that come with
that so one of the costs is that you start
to develop extrinsic reward mechanisms in order to satisfy yourself
so rather than just making yourself happy you you learn
to behave in ways that get approval love and satisfaction
from others and this rather than being intrinsic becomes extrinsic
and this can become a serious problem because your sense
of happiness is given away to others who then hold
it and then dole out little bits of that happiness
to you that make you satisfied and this then turns
you into a pavlovian dog you have to jump through
hoops to get the happiness and love and satisfaction and
approval that you want whether it's with respect to your
parents or your friends or your colleagues or at school
for grades i know one bad habit i developed that
took a long time for me to unwire is that
i was very into academics in school and then i
developed this sort of reward mechanism where i would feel
really good when i got good grades when i got
the highest grades and then that became sort of an
ego thing for me and that became a big driver
in my life and that was good in a sense
it wasn't a problem for a long time because it
let me get through school that was good it let
me educate myself that was good you know there is
some correlation between high grades and how how much you
know about the world and how how well you study
and so forth but um but also it is just
basically jumping through hoops for people and then if you
get that engrained into your mind then it actually became
difficult once i got out of school and university and
i started getting grades it actually became sort of difficult
for me to to find my sense of satisfaction in
life because there were no more teachers or universities giving
me grades awards and such things that gave me pleasure
and now i was sort of left empty or maybe
what would have happened is i would have gone to
other people and tried to find a substitute for that
like maybe in an intimate relationship i might get into
an intimate relationship and then i would expect rewards and
praise in a grade like manner from my partner now
i didn't really do that i'm just saying as an
example that could have happened to me um if i
was less self-aware and so you have to be very
careful as to what kind of extrinsic reward mechanisms your
ego mind develops as it's trying to survive in the
social domain because this happens unconsciously we've talked about survival
and how it shapes you and influences you in the
past past episodes especially see my episode called um how
survival shapes who you are and understanding survival part one
and part two those are all uh crucial for your
understanding of this but um i won't go into that
that here my point is simply that if you develop
these extrinsic reward mechanisms and other people hold the goodies
that then you have to do stuff to get then
can you see how you're never really going to be
satisfied in life you're constantly going to be playing this
game of doing stuff for others to get your reward
and this is core to what people pleasing is about
if you're a people pleaser one way or another somehow
you adopted this habit of getting your happiness extrinsically from
others and this is a problem for men and women
but it's especially i think a problem more for women
and the reason it is for women a problem more
so is because women derive more of their satisfaction from
interacting and building social bonds in social networks women are
more social than men women tend to be uh playing
these sorts of roles of helpers and caretakers and lovers
they play into these roles especially the more feminine they
are the more they enjoy that kind of role whereas
men sometimes are more masculine and they they can sort
of be off in their own world um you know
tinkering with computers or gadgets and stuff and they don't
they don't derive so much of their happiness and satisfaction
from trying to please others whereas women do and women
fall into this trap in intimate relationships especially trying to
please their sexual partners and husbands or with their children
they fall into this trap uh you know trying to
play the role of the sort of the good selfless
mother or even at work with their clients trying to
please their clients please the boss please their co-workers please
their friends and so it just becomes this this giant
social game and then the only time you feel good
is when you've pleased somebody but the problem there is
that it doesn't last it never lasts notice that no
matter how many people you've pleased in your life you're
never now at some deep level of satisfaction with yourself
it becomes just another material pursuit almost in the same
way that men might chase after money or chase after
sex and you know no matter how much money you
get or how much sex you get it's never going
to deeply satisfy you so you just keep chasing for
more well the same thing can happen with the people
pleasing uh except it's much easier to fool yourself you
know with money it's easy to sort of see like
well money is of course money's not going to make
me happy if you got even a little bit of
awareness you can you can see that ahead of time
most people can't but still you should be able to
um or with sex you should be able to see
that no matter how much sex you have it's not
gonna fulfill you um so hopefully you can see that
but then it's much easier to fool yourself like well
but you know aren't i being spiritual when i'm being
selfless and trying to serve others isn't that the proper
way to live life i thought i was being spiritual
well actually you're not you're not being as spiritual as
you think you are and i'll show you how to
how to really apply spirituality here to to get a
deep sense of satisfaction it's very counterintuitive it's sort of
the opposite of what you think and the the solution
is to take back control and sovereignty over your own
reward mechanism and to make it intrinsic completely intrinsic such
that you give yourself the satisfaction the love the praise
the approval that you want now uh i'm going to
explain this a lot more detail here but even as
i just say that already your mind might be objecting
and resisting because in a sense what i'm doing is
i'm i'm trying to get your mind to short-circuit its
reward mechanisms you've built this extrinsic circuit which means that
i gotta do stuff in the world stuff has to
happen in the outer world i have to see it
happen it has to match my own standards and if
that happens then i can allow myself to feel happy
this is true whether you're pursuing business success or sexual
conquests or some sort of uh valuation of the stock
of your company that you're trying to hit or whether
you're you know a woman in an intimate relationship trying
to please your husband or your children it's all the
same thing structurally speaking the content is different but the
structure is all the same right these extrinsic uh reward
cycles and so the solution is to just short-circuit that
entire thing and to just directly go to giving yourself
the happiness and love that you want this is so
counterintuitive that i know that when i first heard about
this idea when i first got into self-help over a
decade ago my mind would would kind of balk at
this idea that i would give myself happiness i would
i remember i would say to myself so i was
driving in the car and i heard this idea and
i would say to myself something like well yeah sure
of course i can i can kind of myself into
feeling happy and giving myself rewards but it's not the
same thing as getting an actual external objective reward it's
just like the self-help uh like a new agey sort
of where i'm just kind of like doing positive thinking
to make myself feel good but it's not the real
happiness because the real happiness depends on some external condition
being met like x amount of dollars in my bank
account or the kind of sex i'm having or the
kind of people i'm actually serving out there and so
what happens is that we we can feel guilty giving
ourselves the love and the satisfaction that we want because
we feel like it's it's almost feels like you're cheating
when you're doing this and in a sense you are
i'm basically telling you how to cheat in life and
cut out all of that external that you do that
doesn't need to be done in order to feel happy
and to feel satisfied to feel loved but your mind
if it was in a growing up in a survival
situation where you had to in order to survive you
had to please other people in your family at school
you know your authority figures adults at church and so
forth after 20 years of living like that the idea
that you can just be giving yourself happiness and approval
directly without any kind of other in the way without
any middlemen this starts to seem like it's crazy it
starts to feel feel like it's cheating like it's unfair
and that um it's sort of like it's it's almost
too easy leo it's too easy i like going out
there and working hard to get my you know my
little dog treat whatever that is for you money sex
approval love see but uh consider that there's actually something
very deep that you're fundamentally missing here is that just
like i've talked about in my episode how authority works
i've explained how you give away your sovereignty and your
authority to others in terms of what is true and
what is not true you look up to authority figures
to tell you what is true to validate for you
what is true rather than going inside and internally sovereignly
telling yourself what is true well the same sort of
thing happens with satisfaction and with happiness and with love
you've given away your sovereignty to other people to various
kinds of authority figures and now you're not really able
to be satisfied because you're looking for other people to
satisfy you and you've developed these deeply ingrained habits of
working hard bending over backwards being a doormat in order
to satisfy others and you've turned this into an aspect
of your ego where your ego enjoys being selfless and
good or it has this image of being hard-working whatever
image sort of you have that aligns with this such
that that image now in order to satisfy that image
you have to constantly be working and working and working
to be happy and to be satisfied or to feel
love so in your mind maybe you think like well
i can't feel love unless i'm selfless towards others and
doing good stuff for others otherwise it would be cheating
and then you might even feel guilty for allowing yourself
to feel loved for sort of like no reason at
all you've invented reasons you've invented standards for what is
necessary for you to feel love or to feel like
you deserve to be loved you've done the same thing
with the your career success too a lot of people
won't allow themselves to be satisfied or to actually enjoy
their career because to them if they're satisfied well then
that's going to mean that i don't work so hard
and if i don't work so hard i'm not going
to reach that next milestone and if i don't reach
that next milestone whatever that is you know if my
company is not going to be worth 50 million dollars
if i'm going to be satisfied that my company's only
worth 10 million then i'm never going to reach 50
million it kind of works like that of course the
problem is that once your company does reach 50 million
you're still not going to be satisfied then you're going
to want 100 million and then a billion and where
does it end it doesn't end that's the problem same
thing with satisfying other humans no matter how many nice
things you do for your clients or for your husband
or for your children you're never going to be deeply
satisfied by that and so you're going to be caught
in this trap of constantly struggling every day to get
a little bit of that drug of approval of satisfaction
of gratitude of thanks from others maybe you've developed this
habit that you only feel love and happiness when somebody
else thanks you and then if that's sort of a
standard you've set for yourself in your mind and you
can only feel good about yourself when other people tell
you that you're a good person now what does that
mean that means now you have to be a slave
for the rest of your life to serving others bending
over backwards for others and then collecting their thanks and
when they don't give you the thanks you think you
deserve because you work hard but they are in in
greats and they take it for granted they don't give
you the thanks they don't give you sort of the
praise you think you deserve for working harder for being
so selfless that makes you bitter inside because you've been
denied the reward you're like a dog who jumped through
a hoop but then the master was looking the other
way didn't see it and didn't give you a treat
and now you're upset at the master see so can
you see that this this is a this is this
is not a very intelligent situation that you've placed yourself
in wouldn't it be much nicer if you can take
back your sovereignty and control and actually take full responsibility
of the reward mechanisms that are in your mind that
are used to make you happy and to satisfy yourself
to take control of those and to not allow other
people any control over that and to be your own
master give yourself the treats this would be a very
interesting twist on the situation this would be kind of
a going of a full circle this would be sort
of like a non-dual approach to happiness whereas before you
were stuck in the dual approach the dual approach is
that there's a self there's an other and the way
that i as a self become happy is by doing
stuff for the other the other is responsible for making
me happy now that other could be a person a
family member a lover uh or a even an animal
like a pet of yours or it could even be
an institution you work for or something like that but
what if you integrated that other into yourself which is
sort of like what you're doing when you're practicing nonduality
because you're realizing everything is one you're breaking down the
boundaries between self and other so if you break down
the boundary between yourself and other one of the things
that allows you to do is to recognize that wait
a minute why i've been have i been being so
foolish why don't i just give myself the treats and
at first it seems like you're cheating but actually what
you realize is that this is a more advanced way
of living life and actually it's even more difficult to
take responsibility for making yourself feel happy this is actually
a sign of maturity and growth and it takes quite
a bit of consciousness just to do this just to
open your mind to this possibility because then it's actually
harder to survive in society because now you might wonder
well leo if i can make myself feel happy and
loved if i can give myself the praise if i
don't need the 50 million dollar company if i don't
need my children to make me happy and to tell
me thank you for for doing nice things that if
if i don't need my husband to to make me
happy if um if i don't need the awards and
the achievements then why do anything in life if i
can literally just sit around basking in my own happiness
and love and self-satisfaction then that short-circuits all of life
yeah exactly that's the genius of this method that's its
power you think this is a bug this is not
a bug this is a feature this is exactly what
you want you want to short circuit that because you
see then it frees you up to behave without being
beholden to others because see right now if you're a
people pleaser if you derive your happiness externally you're actually
not acting autonomously you're a slave you're acting in ways
that you think you must act in order to get
the little dog treats that you so crave whereas imagine
the following alternative scenario where you took responsibility for your
happiness and satisfaction and love you gave that to yourself
you filled yourself with that and then you would be
so full of love and happiness and satisfaction that it
would naturally pour out of you back out into the
world and then you could behave without attachment or fear
or being beholden to somebody else because you truly would
be coming from a place of a fullness and happiness
not emptiness because when you come from a place of
desperation and emptiness and neediness then you're you're gonna try
to manipulate others for the you know to get hap
to get them to give you the dog trees you
want but but when you no longer need their dog
treats because you're already full then you can act in
the highest good then you can act according to your
own authentic values then you're truly free and autonomous you
see and then when somebody doesn't give you something it's
okay because you're not attached to it you don't need
it and therefore you don't get needy with them you
don't get bitter at them you don't resent them you
don't judge them whereas otherwise you would be doing all
those things so the solution here is very simple the
solution is to take back ownership of the reward mechanisms
and to make yourself satisfied give yourself the satisfaction and
how to do that i'll i'll talk about as we
keep going there's there's a lot more i need to
explain here before we get to that so um i
want to share a little bit of how i came
to this this sort of epiphany with regards to satisfying
myself um so this this is a good example in
my own life over the last 10 years a lot
of the satisfaction that i got was through my life
purpose which is doing this work that i do with
actualize.org which is basically sharing deep insights and understandings with
others like you this gives me a lot of satisfaction
like enormous amounts of satisfaction but uh after some years
of doing this i started to notice that there's a
problem with this and the problem is that first of
all that i have to constantly keep releasing new videos
because if i stop releasing videos then i don't get
the sort of feedback of the pleasure of you know
delivering some some piece of wisdom so this this puts
me into sort of a perpetual slavery to doing this
work and also what i notice is that no matter
how many videos i release i've released hundreds of them
i never get to a point where i'm really fully
satisfied because i release a video it's good but then
i've got to release the next one and the next
one and the next one to keep getting more satisfaction
so there's that problem and i've been noticing that for
years um so that tells me that i gotta transition
away from that but but furthermore what has happened recently
is that i've been i've been having such profound levels
of consciousness and understanding and insight that it's getting beyond
the point of being able to share with anybody there's
almost nobody in the world who i can communicate with
that is conscious enough to be able to understand the
deepest insights that i've had about reality and this has
presented a problem for me because in the past i
was able to share those they were at the level
of communication i was able to share those with you
but now i'm getting the point where i can't even
share them with you anymore and lately my insights have
become so profound that i i realized started to realize
and sort of come to face to face with the
with the prospect that i won't ever be able to
share them with any other human in the universe i
try but uh and there's different levels of insight that
i have but the highest levels basically are going to
be completely unshareable and i've i've had to resign myself
to that and um and since i get most of
my juice in life from sharing the profoundest insights this
has been a bummer for me because my whole thing
is like well i want to share the deepest insights
with people but then when i reach those insights i
realize that i i won't be able to share them
they're too profound to be spoken or communicated in any
way and there's not a sense of other that even
exists at that level of insight to be able to
do a communication with so this is a very deep
degree of non-duality but anyways so but then this got
me to realize something which is that ultimately there's a
sort of a trap of trying to share with others
see a lot of the happiness we get in life
is from sharing which is why people share stuff on
social media they actually get happiness from that when you
share a funny video with your mom or with your
friend and you laugh at it together or when you
when you experience some achievement in life and then you
share with your family and then they they they congratulate
you for it this makes your achievement much better and
juicier whereas if you have nobody to share it with
then your achievement sort of falls flat like what is
the point of winning an olympic gold medal if none
of your friends or family or anybody in your life
that you love or care about will ever know about
it what's the point you see that takes a lot
of the juice out of winning an olympic gold medal
well i've run into that situation i don't i'm not
in the olympics you might say i'm in the consciousness
olympics but in the consciousness olympics when you reach the
gold medal nobody else knows you've reached it that's sort
of the the the bittersweet tragedy of doing really deep
consciousness work is that your greatest achievements nobody else will
understand or know from the outside when they look at
you you're gonna look like a totally normal person and
they have no idea that you just have this massive
awakening or god realization or whatever they won't know only
you can know uh and that's ultimately because only god
can know itself only god can appreciate its own beauty
and its own infinitude and its own goodness and its
own intelligence and uh that's again that's not a bug
that's a feature so anyways what i've what i've had
to reconcile myself to is i sort of bit the
bullet and i said okay so i'm going to be
having these very very deep awakenings and insights and the
bottom line is that i'm just not going to be
able to share them with anybody at all and i
can be okay with that and that what i have
to do is i have to rewire my thinking and
my reward mechanism such that i just bask in my
own infinitude and in my own self-realization and that it's
not going to be about other people praising me or
even helping other people to achieve it themselves because the
levels of insight that i've reached i'm starting to realize
that nobody else will ever reach these insights who follows
my work it's just impossible it's basically impossible um if
it happens you know a few exceptional people might do
it through through a fluke luck or something like that
but i basically give it up on the idea that
i can teach it um and then so i can't
get my satisfaction from teaching it therefore i can only
get satisfaction from basking in it myself so literally it
becomes a sort of self-indulgence where i realize that the
only thing in the universe that can understand the universe
to the same degree that i understand the universe is
myself because i am the entire universe and therefore i
just have to fully resign myself to that and be
at peace with that and just enjoy it and just
allow myself to be satisfied at my own self-understanding and
then so from that i got the realization that well
really that's that's where true satisfaction happiness comes from it's
not about sharing with others it's not about pleasing others
it's not about getting rewards from others it's not about
achieving anything it's simply really what is your capacity for
self-satisfaction that's really what it boils down to do you
want to be happy in life do you want to
experience the highest levels of love well then it can't
be extrinsic it must be intrinsic you must be able
to just be be able to sit and just to
bask in your own joy of yourself and of existence
the beauty of existence that you're conscious of and just
sit quietly silently not trying to share it with others
or spoiling it by trying to write a book or
shoot a video or take a photograph or whatever but
just bask in it bask in it and that's harder
to do than it seems because most of us have
been so conditioned that we have this tendency to want
to go out there and talk about it write about
it share it but when you're doing that you're actually
creating a subtle sense of other and you're not fully
appreciating you're not deepening your appreciation of what that thing
is i want you to notice that like the next
time you find some sort of cool video online or
something funny like a joke a meme and immediately you
get this gut reaction to go share with your friends
or your family i want you to pause and not
share it at all and just just enjoy it and
appreciate it just by yourself just buyers don't don't need
the entire social matrix to validate you don't need other
people to tell you how funny it is recognize that
it's just really really funny if it is for you
and then don't need somebody else to validate it and
so this now connects with the loneliness aspect you might
wonder what does it have to do with loneliness well
see what happens when you really turn the rewards extrinsic
from extrinsic to intrinsic it's almost as though and this
might sound negative at first like you're locking yourself in
this solipsistic bubble where you are your own source of
truth your own source of happiness and love and praise
your own source of humor you don't need others to
humor you or to laugh with you if you find
something funny you're fully happy just laughing at yourself and
being the only person in the world to laugh at
it you see but a lot of people wouldn't be
satisfied with that because when they laugh they want others
to laugh too and so it's very counter-intuitive to actually
deliberately consciously lock yourself in the solipsistic bubble and to
tell yourself almost imagine as though you were living life
as the only person who existed like there was no
other conscious entity in the universe but you imagine that
all the humans were dead all the animals were dead
it was just you and then ask yourself could i
enjoy life could i deeply still enjoy life and if
you tell yourself no that's a problem that shows you
that you've built a lot of extrinsic reward mechanisms because
see that takes away this condition this sort of thought
experiment takes away all the external sources of validation and
enjoyment for you and so see you would be forced
to find ways to please yourself in this situation if
you were the last person on this planet and you
might say well that's a horrible situation that would be
depressing i would want to kill myself if that ever
happened that shows you just how deep of a rot
your mind is in that you would say that see
what you want to do is you want to reach
a point where if you were the last person left
on earth you could be totally joyful and totally happy
to live out the rest of your life all by
yourself just basking in the beauty of of reality because
reality is still here it hasn't gone anywhere there's no
people there's no more social aspect to life but so
what the social aspect to life is not really where
the deepest joy of life comes from the deepest joy
comes from the appreciation of existence itself and the beauty
and intelligence and majesty of it building that connection that
metaphysical connection to reality is what spirituality is all about
i've talked about it in my episode called what is
spirituality go check that out so uh so you want
to build such a deep metaphysical connection such a personal
connection with the raw fabric of reality itself such that
that in and of itself makes you complete and everything
else is just a cherry on top you don't need
it you don't need humans you don't need comedy you
don't need entertainment you don't need sex you don't need
uh you know children to to to do stuff with
like you can just be happy by yourself make yourself
satisfied and so this simultaneously if you can do that
this simultaneously solves the problem of being a people pleaser
and the problem of loneliness because the problem of loneliness
the reason you feel lonely is because you haven't built
that deep metaphysical connection with yourself and with reality and
if you get lonely easily what that shows you is
that you haven't spent enough time in your own solitude
connecting with yourself and that you've built a lot of
these reward mechanisms that have to do with getting approval
validation love entertainment humor from others and this is why
you get lonely so easily you're not truly able to
enjoy life by yourself you're only able to enjoy it
with others with friends with family members this is a
problem this is a problem you might say well leo
what's the problem because i'm being selfless and i'm you
know i'm sharing with others i'm giving my life to
others to my children to my spouse and to all
this sorts of stuff to my family so what's wrong
with that well what's wrong with that is that you're
giving your power away you're giving your sovereignty away and
you're making yourself a slave to them and also remember
that they will never ever ever be able to validate
for you the deepest truth and the deepest form of
love and the deepest satisfaction in reality because that only
exists within yourself that's not something you can share with
anybody else it only exists within yourself your friends and
family are not going to validate your awakening they're not
going to celebrate your awakening with you they are not
going to be conscious enough to rise to the level
of consciousness that you will rise to through this work
almost nobody you know will be conscious enough to understand
or appreciate what you've accomplished other than yourself so you
need to start to change your reward mechanism such that
you feel complete just within your own self recognition and
self understanding and you don't feel lonely because of this
you don't feel isolated you don't feel misunderstood you don't
feel unrecognized you know your own innate love goodness consciousness
you know what you are you as god must be
the only entity in the universe that acknowledges itself as
what it is and basks in itself as what it
is this is crucial for you to reach the highest
levels of satisfaction in life and by the time you
accomplish this you will no longer be a people pleaser
and you will no longer be lonely at least not
in the ways you used to be now this does
not mean don't get the mistake here that i'm telling
you to leave your family or to never be social
or to become a recluse or to um be mean
to people or to be bitter at people not at
all i think it's important that you maintain some degree
of socialization you don't just become a total recluse but
ultimately you want to get to a point where all
of the love the deepest love the deepest satisfaction and
joy you get in life comes only from yourself when
you are in solitude by yourself and then when you're
out in the world you can still go to a
party you can go to a club you can go
you know pick up girls you can you can have
children whatever you can socialize with your family then when
you're doing that do it but that's just the icing
on the cake that's not the cake itself the mistake
people make is that they make that the cake itself
when it should just be the icing the core of
your being has to be grounded within yourself not out
there in the hands of other people because that will
then put you into this dysfunctional relationship where you have
to do things for them please them sacrifice your own
values and truth for them you have to lie manipulate
construct fictions and so forth to play these social games
and even if you do all that it will still
never fully satisfy you the only true satisfaction is within
your own self and so now that you understand that
i recommend that you work towards building that and how
do you do that well just basically by practicing feeling
love more deeply within yourself for absolutely no reason appreciating
yourself as this conscious entity that you are appreciate yourself
as the universe as god as consciousness as infinity as
absolute love as absolute truth appreciate just by sitting in
an empty room you should be able to deeply appreciate
the very fabric of existence itself that's what spirituality is
really about that then creates the kernel of the happiness
in your life around which everything else can be you
know additions built on top and if you don't have
that kernel fundamentally you will never be satisfied no amount
of houses cars sex or children will will correct for
that no amount of good deeds will correct for that
another way there's a lot of creative ways you can
come up with to practice this for example you could
go do a good deed for somebody without them knowing
about it in anonymity and then just keep it to
yourself don't tell anybody about it so normally you know
if we donate some money or we do something nice
for somebody else we we want the praise from talking
about it we'll talk to our friends we'll tell our
spouse that we did this nice thing and then she'll
give us some some credit for it and tell us
how good we are and that'll make us feel happy
no cut that out do something good for somebody and
then be the only person in the universe that knows
that you did that good thing so like maybe you
know you want to take a take five hundred dollars
put it in an envelope go stick that envelope into
your you know somebody on your in your neighborhood block
you know stick it in there in their mailbox and
it's an unmarked envelope you don't put your name on
it or anything and then you don't tell anybody about
it and then when you come back home the next
day when you're sitting there just kind of reflecting on
your life you can just feel good and just bask
in the fact that you did that because you were
good you are good that was an act of your
own universal goodness and derive more pleasure and satisfaction from
basking in your own goodness contemplating your own goodness than
you ever would from anybody praising you and realize that
you realizing your own innate goodness is worth infinitely more
than your spouse or your wife or your uh um
or your friends telling you how good you are for
doing that thing because when they tell you how good
you are they're coming out from a very materialistic perspective
see they don't have a deep spiritual connection to the
actual goodness of the universe and the goodness within you
that is driving you to love and to act in
the world only you can appreciate that within yourself the
kind of praise they give you will be superficial praise
you need to realize and it will be highly dependent
upon them and their judgments of you because as soon
as you do something that they disagree with they will
stop praising you in fact you see maybe you even
go and you know put this envelope of 500 into
your neighbor's mailbox um and then you tell your your
mom about it and then she might even she might
even chastise you she might say oh but you don't
have enough money you needed that money you know uh
for yourself or why didn't you give that money to
your brother you know he's closer to you than you're
some random neighbor you know why are you being so
selfish and foolish she might actually tell you that and
then this might kind of make you feel bad because
you you called her to tell her about something good
you did and you expected her to give you some
praise for it and then she didn't even give you
the praise for it she criticized you for it and
then you're going to feel bad whereas if you didn't
tell her and you just bash in your own goodness
because you know that what you did is good you
know that what you did is selfless even though others
may not know it so why do you need them
to acknowledge you just cut that cord cut that umbilical
cord stop needing other people to acknowledge your own inner
goodness your love your selflessness your consciousness your intelligence it
should be enough for you to recognize these things simply
within yourself and that's it and then actually there's a
trick here because this is actually harder to do than
you would think because first of all it requires self-reflection
second of all it requires slowing your life down such
that you actually have time for solitude most people don't
most people don't have time to even contemplate the good
things they've done this week because they're too busy chasing
the next good thing they can't even even appreciate themselves
they aren't even grateful to themselves that's how absurd this
situation is if you can't be grateful to yourself for
the good things you do how can you expect others
to to do so for you you see you yourself
don't even recognize your own goodness innate goodness and then
you get bitter at others for not doing it and
of course others don't recognize it in themselves either because
to to recognize one's own innate goodness this takes a
high level of consciousness and maturity most people feel so
unlovable so broken so undeserving so guilty that they don't
even allow themselves to give themselves praise because the survival
conditions they were raised in were so severe that that
was considered a luxury so a lot of people motivate
themselves by brow beating themselves by telling them how how
shitty they are how bad they are um and then
this becomes an entire attitude and way of life you
feel bad about yourself even though you do good things
but it's never enough so imagine the following ideal imagine
reaching a state of consciousness and spiritual development such that
you're able to just sit in a room and just
be fully satisfied with just sitting in a room without
anything without having to do anything it's not even about
that you placed an envelope with 500 into somebody's mailbox
even that is compared to this ultimate level that i'm
trying to communicate to you where literally just you sitting
alone in a room and looking at the room you
are so in love and in awe by the existence
of the room by the physical just the raw physical
fabric of reality itself you are so appreciative of this
and existence itself that that in and of itself is
enough to satisfy you and then the more you contemplate
and bask in that present moment in the absolute truth
and absolute love that that moment is the more conscious
you become of the spiritual nature of that present moment
of that room um just the deeper and deeper sense
of bliss you experience and then you bliss out on
literally just existence itself and that becomes the best part
of your day so rather than the way you live
now where you know you you go out there at
the beginning of the day you you drink your coffee
then you're rushing to to go to work and to
do that thing and this thing take care of the
kids and to do this and that and all this
then by the end of the day you're exhausted and
maybe you feel like you've been productive and therefore you
allow yourself a little bit of happiness because you've been
productive today rather than that the external activities you do
in your day these will actually be distractions to just
coming back home sitting in a room by yourself and
just basking in the in the glory of existence that
you are and then when it comes to doing your
chores and stuff this actually takes you out of that
that bliss so you go you do your chores then
you come back see and then you're not expecting your
chores to make you happy you're not expecting your productivity
to make you happy you're not expecting something you say
or do for your clients to make you happy and
you might say well leo but isn't this extremely selfish
of me to live this way in this solipsistic bubble
where i'm just sitting there and sort of fellating myself
in my own mind it seems almost dysfunctional well it
seems dysfunctional only because the way you've been taught in
the way that most people around you pursue happiness is
the true dysfunction running around there trying to please others
do stuff to get happy that's the true dysfunction what
you're not understanding is that if you're able to reach
this level of happiness and self-satisfaction that i'm talking about
when you do go out there and do your chores
and interact with others and socialize which you'll still do
when you do do those things you will be coming
from a such deeper place than you are now you're
not going to be like a thirsty dog running around
looking for a little bit of satisfaction from somebody else
you have taken responsibility for giving yourself the satisfaction and
love that you deserve and then when you're out in
the world because you're gonna be so satisfied and full
of love you will naturally automatically be loving and selfless
towards others so it seems that by withdrawing into yourself
you're becoming isolated and solipsistic and uh and selfish yes
for a certain period of time it might be that
way as you withdraw and cut off some of those
social connections you're not maybe going to be there for
your friends and family as much as you would have
otherwise when you were their little lap dog that's true
but later you're going to come back on your own
terms as a truly sovereign conscious being and then after
having helped yourself now you will be able to be
in a position to help others you can't really help
others when you're enslaved to them you see this is
very counterintuitive paradoxically to live the most selfless life first
you have to live very selfishly by withdrawing into yourself
you know the classic story of the buddha is that
the buddha abandoned his family the buddha supposedly lived in
a palace he had a life of privilege and luxury
he had a family he had his you know people
had extended long families you know wide families back in
those days they had you know he had a whole
palace full of probably family members uncles aunts fathers mothers
he had a wife he had a child and then
he just uh one day in the middle of the
night walked out on all of them didn't even say
goodbye just left them just try to imagine how betrayed
they must have felt and then he wandered through the
woods for seven years meditating and you know pursuing awakening
until finally he awoke and then he came back so
he didn't abandon him forever he needed to go through
that period of selfishness you might say he was extremely
selfish for those seven years yeah but that selfishness was
to realize the infant itself the selfless self and then
when he realized that then he came back and then
he helped to help them realize it too you see
you can't really help others to love unless you're able
to realize love for yourself unless you're able to love
yourself so a lot of the problem that many of
these women face who are people pleasers who get into
abusive relationships and so forth very easily and get stuck
in them is that you ladies um you have this
self-image of being very loving and selfless but it's not
true love and it's not true selflessness at least it's
not the deepest form of it because the deepest form
of it is self-love what you'll realize if you do
the spiritual work deeply enough and you awaken enough is
that love is not something you do love is something
you are goodness is not something you do through good
deeds and charity and bending over backwards for others goodness
is what you are and what i'm talking about here
is not easy to do because actually cultivating and raising
your capacity for love and for your own recognition of
your own goodness and just allowing yourself to feel satisfied
for no reason at all other than consciousness of existence
this is uh this is difficult to do your mind
is not going to want to do this because you
see the way that your ego mind controls you is
by setting up these conditions for happiness because that's how
it gets you to do the survival activities that you
got to do and the fact that you need to
trick yourself in this way in order to get stuff
done in the world this shows you that you don't
have the highest level of motivation and now you might
some people might say here like well leo but this
sort of all sounds like sort of self brainwashing you're
just sitting there in a room sort of bullshitting yourself
into happiness and that's not truth that's just some you
know new agey wishful thinking type of stuff it's just
positive thinking whereas if i have to go out there
and build a 50 million dollar company that's objective that's
tangible you see and so when i get happiness for
building that that company for getting a million dollars or
for having sex with some hot person or for for
raising a couple of beautiful children this is tangible material
stuff and therefore that's what deserves the true satisfaction not
just sitting in a room doing nothing that's like cheating
well this is actually sort of a deep part of
the materialistic paradigm is thinking that the material stuff out
there is somehow more real and more true than your
own inner nature and actually the situation is the opposite
of how you portray it in your materialist worldview it's
not that your million dollars is what's objectively real or
your children or the good deeds you do for charity
or something like that the truest thing those are all
illusions the truest thing is your own existence your own
consciousness your own god nature yourself as the universe your
own intrinsic beauty that's the real truth that's absolute truth
and everything else out there in the world the external
material stuff that you think is objective that's all derivative
stuff that's all second order stuff all of that stuff
only has meaning and existence predicated upon the fact that
you exist that you have consciousness that you are god
dreaming up this universe those are all figments of your
dream and so what you need to do is you
need to recollect your sovereignty re-collect your sovereignty and then
use that as the anchor point from which then you
take action from which then you emote from which then
your thoughts come and from which then everything else you
do in your life comes and if you do that
you will overcome the problem of people pleasing and you
will overcome the problem of materialistic chasing of endless things
that never really satisfy you and you will overcome the
problem of loneliness and you will also overcome the ultimate
problem is not being able to communicate the infinite beauty
of the universe with other people because only you can
recognize the infinite beauty of the universe with your mind's
eye through your own consciousness nobody else can do this
for you you can share bits and pieces of that
beauty but you can't share the full beauty only you
can recognize the full beauty now there are many ways
that you can begin to practice this like i said
you could put some money in your neighbor's mailbox you
could also practice this by simply appreciating things more for
example do things that you would normally only do with
others start doing them by yourself without needing their validation
so for example if you would normally never travel alone
go travel somewhere alone if you think you need someone
else to travel with to make you feel good otherwise
you feel kind of weird and awkward like why would
i travel somewhere by myself why would i go to
a restaurant all by myself why would i go to
an amusement park all by myself that seems kind of
like a loser thing to do no this is actually
deep spiritual work here if you can go to an
amusement park all by yourself and just enjoy it and
appreciate it for what it is with without having a
bunch of friends following you around and giving you praise
and laughing at your stupid jokes and so forth then
then you got something see now you really got something
you got true happiness right there go travel to a
national park to a beach to a beautiful city or
other place and just walk around in it in this
sort of solitude this kind of melancholy the solipsistic bubble
don't talk to anybody just walk around just appreciate look
around appreciate the beauty that's there and bask and let
that satisfy you let that be enough for you and
keep building and building upon that until it can give
you almost orgasmic levels of pleasure just to do that
and then when you do go on a trip with
somebody else you will appreciate it so much more than
you ever had i'm not saying that you never you
know go on trips with other people i'm just saying
that you can turn this into a sort of a
practice to build yourself up to train yourself up and
then you're still going to be able to socialize in
fact i recommend you do still socialize but just do
it from a deeper place do it from a place
of satisfaction not a place of desperation and neediness and
you can find many other ways to deepen your satisfaction
for example eating food go to a nice restaurant a
really nice restaurant in town all by yourself order a
really nice piece of whatever you like to eat maybe
something a little exotic that you would normally eat that
you would love order that and then just sit there
and eat it slowly very deliberately and appreciate and enjoy
the out of it in a way that you would
never do with your friends because when you're with your
friends everyone's talking and laughing and yelling sharing stories and
stuff and then the thing you're eating you don't even
notice that you're eating it you're so unconscious and as
you're sitting there also appreciate the solitude of it see
solitude can have sort of a negative connotation and it
al but also has a positive side there's sort of
a positive melancholic side to solitude where you're by yourself
and you might feel like wouldn't it be nice to
have somebody here like a girlfriend or a boyfriend or
a friend but then you let that go and you
realize yeah that might be nice but it's also nice
just to be here all alone too with my thoughts
i can just contemplate and appreciate what's here and i
can also appreciate that because there's a lack of other
here in the future when there is going to be
somebody next to me that i can talk to and
share my experiences with that i'll be able to appreciate
that so much more because there will be that contrast
and i get a and i can experience and and
be satisfied with both situations i can be satisfied by
myself or i can be satisfied with somebody else there
with me partaking in that and then only when you're
coming from that place are you truly sovereign and uh
can you truly be authentic because then you don't need
other people to be there with you you don't need
to control and manipulate other people if they come they
come and if they don't it doesn't matter you can
still enjoy yourself go to the movies by yourself if
you never do and enjoy it enjoy it just as
much as you would with friends enjoy it even more
than you would with friends because your friends are talking
over you and eating food just causing distractions enjoy it
and then when you're done watching it don't talk about
it with anybody just enjoy it in your own mind
maybe you saw an amazing movie something amazing happened and
then your instinct is to you know text your friend
and tell them about it resist that don't do it
just appreciate that movie as it is by yourself because
look the fundamental truth is that in the end you
are the only conscious entity in the universe and so
if you don't appreciate the universe who will don't expect
your dumb friends who are all unconscious to appreciate the
universe at the level of depth that you can ultimately
what we're doing here is i'm trying to guide you
towards a very deep profound appreciation of existence and reality
and that can only be done by you it's not
going to be done by your friends and family they
will not do this work they will take all of
existence for granted they will even take good things for
granted you can go to a great movie with your
friends and then when you're walking out with them one
of your friends because he's just an ungrateful he's going
to be criticizing it and judging it not appreciating it
even if it was really good and he's going to
be raining on your parade and the reason i can
be so sure of that is because this requires training
this is not something you do from one or two
days of work this is something that you cultivate over
years and most people are not going to do it
they don't even know that they should be doing this
nobody taught them to do this you're the one of
the few humans on the entire planet that is going
to do this if you do it and the level
of satisfaction and joy that this will bring to you
10 20 years down the road if you really train
this muscle up it's like a muscle you trade it
up you're going to have a level of joy in
life that nobody around you can understand and when you
have that joy you're not going to be able to
share with anybody but yourself but that's not going to
be a problem because you've trained yourself to bask in
your own joy and you will finally feel complete and
you will also overcome the other problem that almost everybody
faces which is that they feel unlovable they feel they
don't deserve love well the way you solve that problem
is really easy you give yourself the love you give
yourself more and more and more love until you realize
you are love and then you're always conscious of the
love that you are the love that the universe is
and then you don't need other people to give you
love and then you don't feel unlovable anymore and then
this solves all your self-esteem problems too it's very counter-intuitive
because you see the ego mind has co-opted true love
and happiness and satisfaction to use it to manipulate you
to do its survival bidding and if you don't take
ownership over that process and take control over it yourself
you're never really going to be satisfied in life because
survival and the mechanisms your ego mind has has constructed
in order to help you to survive it's not about
happiness it's just about surviving which is why no matter
how good you are at surviving it's never going to
make you happy it's not designed to make you happy
the only thing that can make you happy is your
own cultivation of satisfaction within you your own self-love your
own recognition of the beauty that is all around you
if you can't recognize the beauty that is here nobody
else is going to do it for you this is
not a job you can outsource to somebody else like
you can get somebody you can pay somebody to cut
your lawn for you and that works you can pay
somebody to clean your house that works but you can't
pay someone to appreciate life for you if you can't
do that you're going to be miserable and depressed and
you can also even get somebody to love you because
no amount of love from the outside will be sufficient
to match the infinite love that can be found on
the inside and you will not be satisfied with anything
shy of infinite love because that's what you are and
until you realize that you will never be satisfied because
deep down consciousness knows what it is and consciousness is
seeking to reunite with its true nature which is infinite
love and beauty and intelligence and goodness these are all
things inside of you but they have been so obscured
by layers of social conditioning and fear and guilt and
shame and bad habits and survival programs and indoctrination and
bad beliefs that you got from teachers and parents that
you don't you're out of touch with your own divine
nature within you see you got to discover that and
when you discover that that's what you really want all
the external stuff you've been chasing has just been a
poor substitute for what you were really looking for the
divine nature within and when you discover that that is
the root solution to people pleasing and to loneliness very
counter-intuitive stuff see my episode called the counter uh intuitive
nature of life where i give many examples of counterintuitiveness
well this is one of those add this example to
that list of counterintuitive things so now that you know
all this what are you gonna do about it or
you can actually do the work to cultivate this because
if you don't do the work nothing's gonna happen 10
20 years will go by and you will be as
miserable as you've always been even more so because then
in 20 years you're gonna be wishing you did what
i told you to do here but then it's gonna
be too late so start now come up with some
ways to start to practice this and then of course
ultimately what you need to do is you have some
awakenings to your own true inner nature as love as
goodness as god as absolute truth um and then that
will make you more present more grounded and more appreciative
of the beauty that is here see that's going to
build that metaphysical connection to reality and then ultimately what
happens is that you start to appreciate reality itself more
and more and more and more even like i don't
know like these days when i look at a fork
i can just look at a fork and just sort
of marvel at the intelligence of a fork now this
might sound absurd to some of you um newbies here
i know that if somebody told me even ten years
ago or five years ago that a fork has any
intelligence to it i would have thought you're you're crazy
uh you're some sort of new age uh idiot or
something like that you know talking about the intelligence of
a fork these days when i look at a fork
ordinary dinner fork uh it's exactly the opposite it baffles
me that most people can't see the infinite intelligence in
a dinner fork so everything gets turned upside down and
then life just becomes so profound the depth of life
the richness of life this is true richness it's not
about external possessions it's really about how much can you
appreciate the intelligence of the design of this entire dream
that you're in and then just looking at it makes
you feel full of delight and joy because what was
ordinary just an ordinary fork or a car or a
person or a cat or a dog you see it
for what it really is which is a finite manifestation
of the god the infinite mind that you are a
projection of your own mind and then you can see
and appreciate its beauty its innate beauty and intelligence and
its goodness and its connection to the entire uh whole
of of what the universe is all right that's it

the clips channel so if you guys aren't using it
i'll stop doing it so make use of that resource
while it's there and that is that um what i
want you to notice here in conclusion is that many
of the problems in your life can be solved at
multiple levels you can find a lot of solutions to
the problem of loneliness or to the problem of people
pleasing that are rather shallow you can find plenty of
those on youtube what i gave you here was a
very deep solution now what you should know is that
the deep solutions are more difficult to understand they're more
difficult to explain they take longer they take longer to
implement they're more abstract and it's it's a little bit
harder to figure out how to implement them and they
also take a investment in your life multiple years to
really bear fruit but the upside is that when you
make deep long-term investments that solve problems at the root
you don't have to keep fighting the problem over and
over and over again for years you can keep fighting
the problem of loneliness or people policing for for a
decade with shallow solutions that will never hit it at
the root what i taught you here will hit it
at the root and then you won't have to live
with it anymore whereas if you don't hit it at
the root you're gonna waste more time and it might
stick with you for the rest of your life and
you'll be frustrated because you'll be wondering like well but
i you know i did this shallow solution that i
heard in some video somewhere or read in some book
and it didn't really work and i still got a
problem and then you might start to think well self-help
doesn't really work it does work if you do it
deep enough if you really want to get serious about
it but if you just want to play around on
the surface level then you're probably not going to be
pleased with the results from your self-help work so again
like i've said in the past life is designed such
that you're going to get what you put into it
so the question is how much do you want to
put into it and really the question then is how
much do you want to get out of it how
deep do you want your life to be do you
want to have a really deep profound experience of life
well then you're going to have to dig deep and
do the work because it's not just going to land
on your lap so everything that i teach is predicated
upon the idea that you want to live life more
profoundly than the average person and if you don't what
are you what are you doing here you should go
watch somebody else because my whole thing is depth what
gets me excited to to do this content is the
depth that's possible with this and the depth that's possible
is so deep that none of you guys fathom how
deep this goes even with all the stuff that i've
said and all the stuff that i might have exaggerated
in the past it goes way deeper than all that
the depth of it is infinite and it's impossible to
communicate but um still you know i'm going to do
the best i can here and then we'll see how
deep you go really depends upon you how deep do
you want to go
