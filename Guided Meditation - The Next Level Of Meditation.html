hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to walk you through a guided meditation
I'm going to show you what is perhaps the least
painful and the most pleasant way to meditate this is
a live exercise that I want you to do with
me this is not something you just listen to this
is something you actually have to sit down and do
so find 20 or 30 minutes to set aside right
now or sometime today and do this exercise do not
put this off I'm going to give you just a
little brief introduction here but mostly there's not going to
be any Theory here I want you to get a
direct experience of what it's like to do an awesome
meditation session alright so don't put this off remember that
almost all my episodes I give you specific simple but
specific action steps that you can start taking to start
transforming your life and if you dismiss them and just
say oh that's not important I already know that then
you're missing like 90% of the juice this is where
the power is at listening the theory is not where
the power is at the power is in the practice
so start the practice right here if you're new to
meditation then this will be a great introduction it'll show
you how to do it in a very pleasant way
and if you've already been meditating for a while then
this will still be valuable to you because I'm going
to introduce a very important critical component here which likely
your current meditation sessions are missing especially if you have
this problem where you're frustrated with meditation so this is
going to be very valuable for you the important component
that I want to introduce to you here is the
component of letting go the component of surrender too often
when we get into meditation we come into it and
we have all these objectives such as we want to
be a good meditator we're told to quiet our mind
we're told to let go of thoughts and what happens
is that we're so busy letting go of thoughts that
we end up actually being in control the entire time
and what we don't realize is that the letting go
and the surrender is a critical part of a successful
meditation session and I want to give credit to ig
shanti who I got this insight from right he really
opened my eyes to this fact that man I need
a less neurotic way to meditate I need a meditation
method where I am really letting go and I'm actually
enjoying it rather than sitting there and neurotically trying to
manipulate all my thoughts so this is sort of like
the no manipulation method you want to call that but
that's all the theory I need to give you everything
else you're going to learn here in the exercise so
let's get started go ahead and find a comfortable position
preferably seated not lying down and set aside some time
where nobody will distract you where you can focus on
this because you're going to go pretty deep in a
short amount of time so you're sitting in this comfortable
position you're going to close your eyes for the duration
of this guided meditation so go ahead and close your
eyes get comfortable in your seat and just sit for
a second there and be still still yourself you don't
need to sit in some meditative special posture sit comfortably
in a relaxed way the way that you would if
you were let's say watching your favorite TV show go
ahead and take any ideas you have about meditation or
any favorite methods that you've been using and just put
them aside you won't need them for now this is
something different with your eyes closed start to feel into
your body and just become aware of the various sensations
that comprise your body your feet your legs your abdomen
your chest your hands whatever it is you don't need
to especially feel into anything just let your awareness wander
outside of your skull and just let it notice whatever
comes into awareness really feel the body including any unpleasant
sensations just allow yourself to feel them as you're sitting
here listening to me do not try to meditate there
is nothing for you to do here there is nothing
to accomplish do not manipulate your experience in any way
there is no need to enter in some kind of
special mental state do not even manipulate yourself into relaxation
do not manipulate your thoughts do not try to stop
or to control your thoughts but simply let go of
control that's it that's all you got to do just
let go of control as you sit there in stillness
even though your eyes are closed you remain wide awake
you're awake and alert behind the closed eyelids notice the
external sensations that are occurring for you right now external
sensations are any sensations that are outside of your skull
including your body so if you're noticing your feet that's
an external sensation start to notice all the external sensations
that are happening outside of your skull now push yourself
out gently push yourself out of your skull and into
the external sensations don't try to do this just notice
that it's already done there is nothing to try or
to do these external sensations are already there and they
are already in your awareness and just become reality rather
than being some thing that lives inside your skull or
rather than being a human body sitting there instead become
all of reality become every sight sound thought internal and
external sensation become all of it don't merely watch it
but actually be it you don't need to try to
do that just notice that it's already the case you
already are it there is nothing to do here nothing
needs to be manipulated in order for you to be
reality because you are reality every second no special mental
state is required because it's always the case so there's
nothing to try and nothing to do notice that there
is nowhere to go there is nowhere else for you
to be then right here where can reality run -
from itself know where reality is everything that's occurring there
is nowhere to run there is nowhere to manipulate to
notice that notice that there is nothing to do notice
also that there is nothing to understand or to know
or to figure out with your mind so the mind
can be completely let go because there is nothing for
it to figure out let go of trying to become
enlightened or to have any other kind of quote meditative
experience the meditative experience is always the case every experience
is a meditative experience because meditation is simply what is
surrender yourself completely to what is surrender the mind and
surrender the body let go of all manipulation even let
go of the desire to let go let go of
every struggle let go of any lingering worries that you
have let everything go and relax your body fully relax
your jaw relax your shoulders relax your arms and your
hands release all the tension in your abdomen and relax
your legs and as you're relaxing your body completely relax
your mind do not manipulate anything just notice everything exactly
as it is and notice how relaxed to do allow
everything to just be including anything that's annoying or perhaps
a bit unpleasant allow that to be - and if
you have any resistance to letting go or if you
have some resistance to an annoying sensation allow that resistance
as well do not manipulate your resistance just allow it
stop caring about anything there is nothing to care about
there is no objective you do not even care about
being peaceful or calm or relaxed or happy let go
of caring and just be perfectly still notice your mind
becoming very restful the mind just shutting down and notice
your sense of self just getting pulled and absorbed into
your surrounding environment all the sensations that are outside your
skull notice yourself just getting absorbed into that and becoming
it all that meditation really is is a resting of
the mind for this short period throughout your day your
mind will be totally at rest but inside you will
be fully alert and awake be fully alert even though
you are fully relaxed notice the natural spontaneous joy that
overcomes you from simply being peacefully alert alert but perfectly
still in body and mind be outside of your head
be all of reality notice that this is already the
case there is nothing to do surrender any last remaining
shreds of the need for control or manipulation surrender yourself
completely to reality and just sit if you notice thoughts
arising allow them to arise if you notice a desire
for control or manipulation arising just remember to fully surrender
and to let go just let go anything is distressing
you just let it go if you're unable to let
something go just let go let go of the desire
to let go enjoy your silence you enjoy reality this
is all there is there's nothing else enjoy being aware
notice that awareness is perfectly effortless you do not need
to make any effort to be aware good take a
few last moments to enjoy the silence gather any lessons
that you learned here from this experience you can take
them with you when you awaken so go ahead and
slowly open your eyes and come on back okay great
welcome back so that was a taste of meditation done
properly meditation done in a manner where you actually let
go and surrender the ego and you start to merge
with reality a bit did you notice that did you
notice the merging of reality starts to happen effortlessly when
the mind is simply silenced and letting go has occurred
the key lesson here is that you do not silence
the mind through control and manipulation but paradoxically just by
letting go right and at first what happens is that
your mind can wobble a bit and when you let
it go it can run away and it can go
into monkey chatter but over time and this can happen
rather quickly just within five or ten minutes if you
just keep letting go and letting go and letting go
and you keep letting go of any desire to not
go into monkey mind mode and all they just keep
letting go over and over and over again and you
just keep pushing yourself out of your skull a little
bit in a very gentle non manipulative sort of way
then after a while you just enter this very very
very deep peaceful place and then you can sit there
sit there for half an hour sit there for a
whole hour if you can that would be the ideal
but if you only got 20 minutes a day do
it for only 20 minutes a day so I hope
you got some real first-hand insights about how to do
meditation better apply these insights to your current meditation practice
if you don't have and practice start one immediately because
this is the number one the number one self-improvement habit
that you can create that's it it's simple but it's
number one and if you're interested and you want to
use what I talked about here as a guided meditation
aid and you're just starting off and you don't feel
like you can do this with yourself when you're seeding
when you're sitting down to meditate then I'm going to
have an audio for you that's just going to be
a you know straight edited just the guided part none
of the theory nothing what I'm saying right now but
just the guided part so you can loop it put
it on your phone or on your iPod or something
just kind of loop it over and over again every
day and use it to meditate so that's it I'm
