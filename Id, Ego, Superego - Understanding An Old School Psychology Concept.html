hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about it ego and the
super-ego all right welcome back so let's talk about the
it'd the ego and the super-ego in this video I
want to cover what these concepts are and how they
play into practical personal development how do we actually apply
these old-school concepts from really Sigmund Freud back in the
early 1900s how do we take them and how do
we make sense of them and actually use them to
help us today in our own lives to improve our
self-control and our ability to be happy and successful so
let's talk about that let's really define what the it'd
the ego and the super-ego are like I said these
are some old-school concepts coming from Sigmund Freud way back
in the day and in a lot of ways they're
somewhat obsolete today they're somewhat archaic and the whole Sigmund
Freud school of thought the whole analytical psychoanalytical school of
thought is in many ways not what you want to
be using in order to move forward in your own
personal growth what I'm delivering to you guys through actualized
org is more practical more modern ideas things you can
go out there and apply but we can still take
some lessons from this old model that Freud developed and
we can see how we can use it to help
us today so a really good analogy that I loved
and I got from Jonathan Haight who wrote the happiness
hypothesis there he gives us on this amazing analogy for
what the it'd the ego and the super-ego are he
says it's like this imagine in the old times there's
an old buggy a horse carriage drawn buggy and here
you've got the horses which are pulling this buggy forward
at breakneck speed then what do you got you've got
the rider on top of the buggy who is holding
the reins and trying to control the horses trying to
steer the horses he's also got a whip so he's
whipping the horses to make them run and that is
like the relationship between the heed and the ego the
it'd are the horses the ego is the rider he's
trying to control the horses but then inside the carriage
behind the rider is his old father and his father
is yelling at the rider telling him where to steer
the carriage and that is like the super-ego so I
love this image because it's so easy to remember and
it just clearly illustrates what each one of these functions
of the psyche are and that's exactly what Freud was
talking about here these are functions of the psyche the
heed the ego and the super-ego so what is the
it that it is the horse or the multiple horses
that you've got pulling your carriage forward so what is
that literally well that can be described as your more
base instinctual desires this is that force within you that
force within your psyche that is looking for instant gratification
that is looking for pleasure it's more or less unconscious
right the way that you would imagine a horse a
horse is just kind of doing its own thing it's
not too worried about where we're going it's just hungry
or it's thirsty or it wants to run or it
doesn't want to move and that's just a horse then
you've got the ego the ego is the rider he's
the rational one he is the more conscious one and
he's the one who's in control he's thinking long-term he's
planning he's the realistic person he's the the strategic element
of the psyche he's that part of you that's being
rational and that's planning your life that's the ego and
it's trying to rein in the it it's trying to
rein in the horses because sometimes the horses want to
do crazy things that not healthy for the overall throw
over old carriage and rider situation it might even be
something that's not healthy for the horses themselves maybe the
horses decide that they will go want to lead the
carriage and themselves off a cliff and they'll do that
unless the rider holds the back and steers them in
the right direction and then of course we can't forget
the lovable old cranky man the father sitting in the
carriage behind the rider and he's the wise one he's
the one who knows best he's got experience he's got
morals he's got ideals he's got high standards he is
the societal influence you might say and he's the one
who's lecturing who's moralizing the rider on how to best
steer the horses so he might criticize the rider in
one aspect of how he manages the horses or he
might he might offer some suggestion or some advice about
how it should be done better and that is the
super-ego and what is that well that's the part of
our psyche that is the moralizing part it's our conscience
you might say it's that part that is the ideal
self but also the critical self it's that inner critic
that we all have that tells us that we know
we could be doing better and that we should be
living up to something more than we currently are so
this is the dynamic the it'd the ego the super-ego
this is how Freud thought of it this is how
Freud characterized the human psyche is that he thought that
we had this very low base part which is virtually
unconscious the horses but it all it wants are instant
gratification and desires right quick hits of pleasure without thinking
about long-term repercussions then he imagined we've got the flip
side of that the complete opposite which is like the
the moralizing site the ideal side of us which knows
what should be done which is the conscious part but
it's also the part that can be sometimes to ideal
stick to moralizing to sermonizing and so then you have
this dysfunction in-between which is the ego and it's the
egos job to kind of guide between the two extremes
the ego is trying to really live up to the
conscience but in the hand it's also trying to appease
the horses and it's trying to appease the the it'd
so yes the ego wants to to indulge in pleasures
but isn't one indulgent pleasures in such a way that
it's self-destructive and it's going to lead you off a
cliff so he listens to the super-ego and then sometimes
the super-ego is a little bit too Stern and a
little bit too self criticizing too judgemental and so the
the ego wants to bring it back towards the it'd
and this is the job of the ego it's to
mediate between these two extremes like the best in us
and the worst in us to kind of mediate between
the two and to keep us on the road on
the road going forward in life doing whatever it is
that we have to do now there are a few
problems here with this model I mean first of all
it's not literally how the mind works this is just
more of a kind of a figurative or just a
a diagram diagrammatic way of looking at what is going
on here so this is not literally what's happening you
don't actually have an it in your brain you don't
actually have an ego in your brain and a super-ego
it's all kind of meshed together and so some of
these roles are hard to really deal delineate I think
there's something powerful here though to the idea that we
do have a lower self or something that seems like
that in our brain you know it's that lower self
that tells us that we shouldn't go to the gym
today that we should just take it easy it's that
lower self that says we shouldn't push it at work
today we should just take it easy maybe we should
just take a vacation maybe we should drop off that
diet maybe we've been good enough so we should indulge
in some TV or some internet or some sort of
easy stimulation maybe go get that third martini maybe go
drinking with the friends go have a party do something
fun do some recreational drugs right that's the it'd and
we all we've all been there we've all given in
to that and we also know the dangers of that
the dangers of that are forming bad negative habits that
can really destroy your life I mean in the the
worst of situations like drugs like literally those habits can
wreck your entire life but even in more subtle ways
even in more socially acceptable ways just simple things like
watching television or being addicted to partying and drinking even
though that's socially more socially acceptable than hardcore drugs it's
still probably destroying your life and robbing you of all
the potential that you've got so you got to watch
out for that you got to watch out for that
for that in then of course we also know the
conscience part and the conscience part I think is really
where Freud's model here kind of starts to break down
is I think the ego is more accurate and that
the the the super-ego is the problematic thing because really
you don't have you don't have this I mean you
do have some sort of societal conditioning and you probably
have morals that you picked up from your parents and
from society and from the media it just things from
culture that you're told are taboo that are wrong and
so you've got those in the back of your mind
but that is really not your highest self your highest
self is something different than the super-ego really if we
take this whole model and we we cut it up
in a different way I think a more accurate way
to cut it up would be to simply say you
that you've got your lower unconscious self and then you've
got your higher conscious of because your conscious self naturally
tries to live up to ideals and it naturally tries
to do good and your higher self this is where
you ultimately want to be it's not that you should
be mediating between your your lower self and your higher
self no you should be going totally for your higher
self but this higher self is not the moralistic higher
self that your parents taught you about it's not that
that sermon that you got church that tells you that
if you don't do good and you don't do right
and then if you lie and you cheat and you
have sex then you're going to go to hell with
brimstone and and pain and torture it's not it's not
about that that's not how it works and I think
that this is where Freud's model really starts to break
down is that use probably coming at it more from
this religious context and the societal conditioning context that was
telling you what to do no in reality the way
it works is that when you're doing things for the
lower values you're doing things just to get pleasure or
stimulation or doing things that are easy and comfortable really
what you're doing is you're behaving in an unconscious way
and when you're doing that that is the evil of
the world that is what's destroying your life that's also
what's causing evil in the world is when people live
like that they live unconsciously they get angry they have
negative thoughts are always judgmental they're criticizing they're engaging in
activities that are not good for them in the long
run they're they're hurting their health they're hurting their relationships
hurting their businesses their work their careers that is all
unconscious when you start to move towards consciousness you start
to develop more knowledge more self-awareness then what happens is
that really you move towards your higher self and your
higher self is not a mixture of both good and
bad elements like the super-ego is because the super-ego on
the one hand it has ideals but it also is
negative in the sense that it's critical right it's like
that critical parent well that parent might have good intentions
but in the end that criticism that the parent is
throwing out the judgments the constant nagging that's not healthy
and that's actually an unconscious behavior so what we want
to do is in Freud's model what we would do
is we would take the super-ego we would carve out
that critical part and we would now move it over
into the it'd that's where it properly belongs and so
if we reformulate that whole model then what you've got
is you've got the it'd which is the negative stuff
and then you've got the higher self you've got now
the new super-ego which one is what I call the
higher self and that's you being fully conscious when you're
fully conscious that's ultimately where you want to be that's
when you're making the best decisions that's when you're thinking
long term that's when you're able to delay gratification that's
when you're able to be wise that's when you're able
to control your impulses you're able to control your thought
patterns you're able to do things with complete awareness you're
also very happy with life as it is you don't
always need to be judging and criticizing browbeating yourself up
all the time brow beating yourself and beating yourself up
over the fact that you're not able to do as
much as you wanted to do that's not a healthy
impulse sometimes people get that wrong and I think that's
referred got it wrong is that that's not a healthy
impulse a healthy impulse is being completely conscious and it's
also accepting the fact that you're not perfect and that
you're going to slip up sometimes and that's okay what
you're trying to do is you're trying to be conscious
of all your imperfections as well as the things that
are good about you and really when you get to
a very high level of consciousness in your life then
what happens is that you just become at peace with
what is you're not so worried about striving for something
you're not so worried about judging yourself for doing something
wrong or not living up to some sort of goal
you're just more comfortable you're more peace now you might
say well if that's the case don't you become listless
don't you become unmotivated don't you become lazy actually no
what happens is that when you stop criticizing yourself you
become more motivated when you're at peace it's not like
you have no motivation now it's not like you just
sit on the couch in fact quite the opposite when
you're at peace everything's okay and now you have a
very healthy emotional foundation from which to act upon you're
not attached to two things and that's healthy to be
attached to results and outcomes is neurotic so that parent
that's sitting in the back of the buggy yelling at
his son to steer the cart to the left or
to the right that's really not a healthy relationship that's
not a healthy attitude that's a neurotic situation kind of
interesting to think about huh how does that apply to
your relationship with your parents yeah that's what I thought
right probably a little bit of that going on there
too so basically that is what the it'd the ego
and superego is now how does this actually apply to
your life and what can you do with this well
I think what you do with it is that you
start to recognize that there are these forces within your
mind and there's this tug-of-war going on that part of
it is pretty accurate there is a tug of war
going on between your lower self and your higher self
and sometimes the lower self wins out sometimes the higher
self wins out and sometimes we do get confused about
really what is the lower self what is the higher
self sometimes those elements kind of intermix and it's hard
to even distinguish is our higher self really doing the
best for us or does it have elements within it
that are actually part of the lower self that are
critical that are judgmental that are trying to get us
to achieve things that are not really in line with
what we want authentically I think this is the real
the journey of personal development is that you go through
this and you start to weed and sort out because
it's not quite so simple to say what is the
lower self and what is the higher self within you
you have to actually do some work you have to
do some introspection do some personal development and slowly as
you get more experienced you start to see which elements
are really part of your higher self and which elements
are not and as you do that as you make
as you make this this distinction more and more clear
in your mind it becomes easier for you to become
disciplined it becomes easier for you to go towards the
route of consciousness and to do the things that are
high conscious and that are good for you and you
don't have to browbeat yourself to get them to happen
it's an easy flowing kind of discipline and that's really
what self-actualization is is the self actualized person has made
this distinction very clear for himself and he is naturally
effortlessly guiding himself towards what's good it's not just doing
the bad stuff and knowing that there's good stuff you
should be doing it's knowing the good and the fact
that you know what's good makes you want to do
it that's ultimately the level that you want to get
to so I think that's really the power of this
idea is that this is something that's real and this
is something that you can have in your life is
that you can carve out this distinction very clearly for
yourself by doing conscious personal velopment work to the point
where the things that are healthy for you are the
things that you're doing naturally I've personally experienced this a
lot in the last year in my own life where
a lot the things that I've been struggling with a
lot of the bad stuff that I knew I shouldn't
be doing now I don't do them effortlessly that's because
