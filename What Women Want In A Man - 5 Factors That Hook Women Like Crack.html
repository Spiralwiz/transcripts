hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about what women want in
a man what women really want in a man let's
talk about that what is it that women really want
this is such a fascinating topic to me and I'm
so excited to talk about it because I spent so
much of my own blood sweat and tears figuring this
out I came from such a dysfunctional place in my
life with lack of relationships and not understanding the opposite
sex not understanding sex at all not understanding the dynamics
of psychology involved and so basically I was completely miserable
and I had to really work really hard to dig
my way out of that hole and in that process
I I learned a lot of stuff studied a lot
of material but then actually went out and practiced it
and applied it so this is kind of where I'm
coming from it now I'm always excited to go back
and share my biggest insights with some of you guys
who might be kind of going through that same kind
of situation in your life it's really important to understand
what women want because well if you don't understand what
a woman wants then you're not going to be able
to attract her and you're not going to be able
to keep her so for me personally when I started
on this journey a few years back what I told
myself is that I'm not just gonna use a little
gimmick to try to attract a woman what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna understand women at their core really
understand them and they're not that difficult to understand most
men have a lot of trouble understanding women but really
if you dig into it and you go out there
and you practice and you do a lit of studying
it's not that hard and here I'm gonna give you
the straightforward how-to of what it takes to attract a
woman and what it is that a woman is really
looking for in a man because that's what we're talking
about what's gonna attract her is what she's looking for
so they're kind of two sides of the same coin
so the first point I'm gonna make is first of
all never listen to a woman about what she wants
in a man all right it might sound like well
the proper person ask is the woman why don't I
go ask a woman about what she wants and then
give it to her the problem with that is that
it doesn't work I try it guys have tried that
it's not gonna help you if you're a guy and
you want to get better with girls it's not going
to help you because a woman's way of understanding what
she wants and a woman's way of understanding her own
psychology is not the same understanding that a guy needs
to have of her psychology right a woman is not
their psycho analyzing herself to the same kind of degree
that a guy psycho analyzes a woman so we're really
coming from kind of asymmetrical points of view on this
and that's okay that's fine a woman is more in
the moment she doesn't care to really analyze exactly what's
going on that wounds the the moment for her and
that really kind of like ruins the whole love connection
relationship thing I mean some women are into analyzing it
but most women are not really that interested in analyzing
what it takes to fall in love they just happens
very spontaneously and naturally for them and in fact most
of them can get offended or can be kind of
put off when they see that a guy is trying
to like psychoanalyze them and kind of like nitpick and
try to pull out the the like the wiring and
to kind of like see like what are the actual
like mechanics of love of sex of attraction but we're
gonna go into that because this is an analytical video
I'm an analytical guy and this is what guys need
to know if they're struggling if you're not struggling then
you probably don't need to know this stuff you probably
already know it intuitively so women what the women really
want very simple women want deep emotional intimacy every woman
really wants this this is the coordinate right this is
the Nugget from this we can then derive other things
that she wants but this is ultimately what she's looking
for in a man and in a relationship and of
course women are are very social creatures women are driven
by relationships and by emotions and social interaction a lot
more so than guys are for women that's like a
fish and water motion I'm not saying that all women
are like that I mean these are general generalizations but
still nevertheless it's very true that women are very fluid
in relationships they have easier time in relationship there's actually
neuroscience that shows that physiologically the woman's brain is more
adapted to relationship building and is more adapted to two
actual verbal cognition so verbal skills are stronger and females
and they are in males because of just the way
that the brain is wired differently the male brain is
more wired towards logical analysis so understanding that is important
right because once you understand that then you can kind
of see where the woman is coming from and what
she wants and also kind of what rubs her the
wrong way and also why women behave in the way
salient they behave so women love people women are tend
to be caring women to be very free-flowing spontaneous if
they're feminine and they've got a strong feminine energy then
they're gonna be spontaneous and they're gonna be emotional they're
also gonna be nurturing so they've got all these qualities
the reason I'm talking about this is because it's going
to now connect us into what women are looking for
right you have to understand a woman first before you
can see what she wants and understand why she wants
these things so that's kind of where the woman is
now what is she really looking for well I mean
this is not some magic or some secret like there's
one secret thing that a woman wants no I mean
you got to look at it from the woman's perspective
in the same way that you can look at it
from a guy's perspective like what does a guy want
in a girl I mean he wants everything what does
a woman want in a man she wants everything I
mean she wants to full package who would say no
to everything the question is what can she get and
the question is what can you get as a guy
so there's always a little bit of adversity here between
what you want and what you get it's kind of
like an auction system right you have a seller who
puts up an item and then you have bidders and
the seller is gonna get only as much as the
bidders are willing to give it's like that in an
auction like it on eBay it's like that in the
stock market with buyers and sellers of stocks and it's
actually like that in the sex market right in the
dating and relationship market it is a market and people
are out there shopping around and what are they shopping
around for they're shopping around for the maximum survival of
their offspring and that doesn't always feel that way to
a woman it certainly doesn't feel like she's shopping around
for maximum survival of her offspring but in fact if
you look at it and you analyze the science that's
what's happening it's just that there's a lot of nice
emotions involved with it and the emotions carry you through
and the rest it happens unconsciously I mean a guy
is doing the same thing most guys are not psychoanalyzing
and like really looking at the science behind what they're
doing but nevertheless there is there is this this core
this core here right that you're trying to maximize your
reproductive value well to do that that means you're trying
to find the best possible mate so what does a
woman want I mean she wants everything she wants good
looks she wants security she wants social status she wants
loyalty from the guy she wants a guy who's confident
she wants a guy who has humor she wants a
guy who is detached and not needy with her she
wants a guy who's edgy and adventurous and she wants
a guy who she could have like deep intimate dirty
sex with all right these are the core elements of
what a woman wants if you can give her all
of these things you're gonna be her ideal match she's
gonna love you all right now of course you don't
need to worry too much about trying to give her
everything you don't need to in a real world she's
not gonna want everything because she can't get everything she's
gonna settle for something and a guy does this to
a guy ideally and a woman he's gonna want a
whole list of things right just like a woman in
a man wants certain things a guy will want certain
things in a girl and they're gonna be different but
they're still gonna be equally rigorous guys are picky and
women are picky it's not that one of them is
more picky than the next they're both equally picky but
they're picky in different ways so a woman is picky
in these ways and what's interesting here is that this
whole list that I rattled off I'm gonna go into
detail on each one of them and what's interesting is
that some of the points on this list are really
not as important as they are made out to be
in popular culture in the media or even as you
would think they might be important or even what a
woman would tell you so if you actually go out
there and you study this stuff and you actually go
out and do practical interactions with women and you go
out and you date lots of women what you're going
to discover is the core principles of what a woman
really wants in a man and the others you're gonna
discover are kind of like you know take it or
leave it they're not deal-breakers there are certain things in
a man that are absolute deal-breakers for a woman so
let's go and talk about that that's really fascinating so
the first part of this list good looks security social
status and loyalty these are all things that you would
think a woman would really really want in a man
so good looks a lot of guys are really hung
up about looks and they think that they need to
improve their looks a lot in order to get a
better girl the next is security a lot of guys
will try to attract a woman with security and by
security we mean money or playing that provider role in
her life doing nice things for her doing her favors
being the nice guy you know just kind of going
above and beyond providing for her financially there's that then
there's the third point of social status so women are
attracted to social status they like a guy who has
some sort of social value in society not just a
bum on the street but someone who has got like
a nice career or he's got some some celebrity he's
got some prestige he's got some fame women are notoriously
attracted to that it just totally turns them on and
the next point is loyalty so women are relationship bound
types of creatures most women like to be in exclusive
relationships most women like to be in kind of a
one-on-one deep very intimate relationship this goes back to the
original point of what do women really want they want
deep emotional intimacy so the best way for them to
get that is in relationship because also that that has
some of the other points too it gives them give
some more security as well and of course boosts reproductive
value and chances for their offspring so those four points
though as important as they might seem they are they're
actually not deal-breakers they're not that important so if you're
struggling with your looks as a guy if you've got
security problems so you don't have a lot of money
and you don't have a great career or if you
have no social status you're basically a nobody and if
you don't even want to be loyal to the girl
I mean I would encourage you to hit all those
points but you don't need to hit those points in
fact some of the most successful guys don't hit any
of those points at all and they're ridiculously ridiculous accessible
with women and I'm not just talking about like getting
lots of average girls I'm talking about getting like the
hottest possible supermodel porn star girls so these guys are
ridiculous lethal and that's because what they have is they
have these other points on this list which are the
deal breakers they've got the deal breakers down and then
the other stuff you know it would be nice to
have some of some guys have it but if you
don't have it not very important here are the deal
breakers all right so this is where it gets really
cool confidence as a man if you don't have confidence
you're pretty much worthless to a woman so confidence is
so important basically a woman will not date a man
who's who's lower in confidence than her than she is
so not possible at all or even if she does
end up sleeping with you or dating you for a
little bit in the end it's not going to be
something to be a match so I kind of it's
not gonna be a happy long-term relationship so you need
to have more confidence than your woman you need to
be a strong you need to be masculine you need
to be a man the next point is humor women
love humor notoriously so they'll tell you this and on
this point they're actually right that this is something that
they really want in a man and the reason that
they want humor is because women are emotional creatures what
they really want is they want emotional stimulation and emotional
stimulation can be both positive and negative but of course
they like the positive emotions more although a little bit
of negative emotion is still stimulating to them and they
enjoy that they'd like to have a range of emotions
they're not like guys who are just like a flatline
emotionally you know guys are just kind of like stoic
calm we're either happy or sad or we're angry or
horny like those are the only emotions we have as
a guy whereas for a woman there's a I'm much
kind of like broader and subtler range of emotions that
she likes to go through and humor and laughing and
smiling is so important if you can make your woman
laugh and be playful with her I'm doctor playful attitude
towards your relationship with her then she will love you
so much and that's gonna be rare that's rare to
find in a man so that's a really a really
critical point the next point is detachment a man needs
to be detached from his woman and now this is
a point that women will actually dispute you on and
they'll say well I don't really want a detached guy
what is this detachment thing detachment it sounds like he's
an [ __ ] and he doesn't care about me
that's not what detachment means detachment simply means that you're
a man and as a man you're on purpose in
your life and that the woman is not primary it's
your life and sometimes women will say well but I
want to be you know the center of my man's
life that's not what you really want what a woman
really wants is she wants her man to be completely
grounded confident masculine out there achieving in the world and
then she wants him to be loyal to her of
course and to be nice and sweet to her and
all that detachment doesn't mean that you're an [ __
] but it does mean that you're grounded in something
outside of your woman so that you're not needy with
her women will leave needy guys in a second not
only will they leave them in a second they won't
even talk to them they will reject you just go
out and try it go to any bar any club
be needy with a woman that you've met for five
minutes she will [ __ ] leave you like the
plague all right it's obnoxious so do not be needy
with women you have to be detached this is such
a deal-breaker this may be one of the biggest deal-breakers
as far as guys and girls go in the dating
scene if you're a guy with neediness issues you need
to iron those out all right the next point is
women like guys who are edgy what does this mean
edgy guys who are edgy are not the straight-laced kind
of JP Morgan stockbroker types guys who are edgy are
more like the adventurous kind of archetype right he's the
adventurer he's like the poet the musician the artist the
quirky hippie something like that like these are stereotypes but
ultimately what a woman wants there is she wants a
sense of like newness the guy is there to infuse
her with emotions so in order to do that I
mean who's gonna infuse it with more emotions some sort
of like beatnik poet or the guy from JP Morgan
who sells stocks I mean nothing against guys from JP
Morgan I'm sure they have interesting lives and wolf of
wallstreet proves that you know stockbrokers can have can have
an adventurous lifestyle so whatever but just kind of as
stereotypes you get the idea the idea is that you
want to be interesting and you want to be a
little bit dangerous women like men who are a little
bit dangerous challenged them women need to be challenged see
if the woman is challenging the man in the relationship
that's that's backwards and it shows signs of dysfunction and
chances are that she's gonna get bored with you as
the man and leave you because she wants something exciting
she wants a man who was out there and like
doing stuff in the world not a guy who just
goes to his boring high five job and then comes
home has sex with her and then there's nothing else
like to her that gets really boring there's no emotional
stimulation in that maybe that works with a guy it
doesn't really work well for the girl she wants to
blazon and then lastly intimate dirty sex may be my
favorite all right intimate dirty sex women love this they'll
never admit it to you but because it's just socially
unacceptable for them to do so they have a lot
of social conditioning that gives them a lot of limiting
beliefs around sex generally I find but this is so
important if you can give your woman deep intimate and
dirty sex and I'm stressing intimate and dirty those two
should come together right there they're kind of a match
if you've got both of those and you're doing that
on a regular basis then wow she's gonna love you
and that alone right there can be enough to get
her a dick to take you like crack and basically
all the other points I mean if you get the
sex part right all the other points as long as
you're able to attract her and then you get the
sex point the sex point correct all the other points
you can kind of drop and you'll still be able
to keep around for quite a while because women do
really love sex and if you can please her in
the bedroom in the right way then wow you have
a huge advantage over so many other guys so this
is it these are the points again to recap the
points that are real important the ones that are deal-breakers
for a woman if you don't have our confidence humor
detachment edginess or adventure Ness and intimate dirty sex the
points that are not so important and a woman will
not need them although she would like them our good
looks financial security social status loyalty alright so if you've
been having trouble with women then we can probably understand
why and that's because you've been focusing on the points
a lot of guys they'll build their entire lives around
capturing their green their dream girl by hitting these points
that are not really that important to them so they're
gonna go and try to get the best looks at
they can and then maybe try to earn a lot
of money and then maybe get some social status in
the community and then promise they're gonna be loyal to
the girl like say that they're gonna marry marry her
whatever and they think that that's how they're gonna get
the girl and they're gonna keep her happy but that's
not what she really wants I mean she'll take those
things but she will leave you at all in a
flash of a second if she finds a guy who's
willing to be with her who is super confident humorous
and playful detached from outcome and adventurous and gives her
intimate and dirty sex like there's no comparison about who
she's gonna go with because look at what what we're
talking about here here she's getting tons of emotional stimulation
right emotional stimulation this is what her whole life is
about emotional stimulation being feminine she gets that here here
with the security and the social status I mean those
are nice those can provide for her those can be
nice to her on the logical level maybe she even
needs those things in her life because maybe she's strapped
for money or maybe she wants to be part of
the social circle that you're part of okay that's nice
but there's like there's there's so little emotional stimulation in
those things in and of themselves I mean realistically most
guys will blend all this together and they'll be kind
of in the middle somewhere but some guys can be
very extreme on one end or very extreme on the
other so if you're very extreme here or there I
mean ultimately I encourage you to to be the full
package because I mean that's what she ultimately wants she
wants the full package and if you want to get
the hottest girl that you can get as a guy
you're looking for a very hot girl you're also looking
for you know that intelligent woman that you really want
you're looking for the kind of girl that is gonna
like that that's going to be girlfriend material relationship material
if you want that kind of girl then you're gonna
have to grow yourself as a man so the better
you can can become as a man then the more
options are gonna have with higher quality women and the
way that you do that is you look at these
points and you tell yourself okay so what does a
woman really want and how good am I on this
point so it's my confidence how good is my humor
how good is my mind attachment how good is my
adventure ness how good am I in bed and you
can also look at looks and social status and security
and loyalty you can look at those things too and
ideally try to up every single one of those max
them out to a ten right if you can max
all those out to a ten that's gonna be your
best chance at creating the best relationship with the best
highest quality girl that you can find I recommend you
do that I think that that's what ultimately personal development
leads you towards is getting all of these little pieces
into place that you can be the best man for
your girl and you don't do that in order to
attract her in some sort of sneaky way you do
it because you want to be the best man that
you can be of course you want to have the
best girl that you can have in your own life
that's a that's kind of a selfish motive but still
I mean she wants the same thing she wants to
be a high quality woman and she wants to attract
the highest quality man so you guys are really doing
the same things and now you're kind of meeting together
and if you boost all these things up then you
have a really good chance of attracting a really high
quality girl ultimately what a woman wants is the full
package right and it's very interesting because a lot of
times that it will seem like women are after the
good looks or they're after the security or the social
status and you know some women are someone will really
focus in on that but you as a guy do
not want to attract a woman based on these these
factors here these factors of good looks security social status
and loyalty the problem is if you attract a woman
based on that you might even succeed for a little
bit but you're gonna be you're gonna be living in
very dangerous territory because she's always going to be emotionally
on the lookout for that edgy coughin humorous guy that's
gonna be the problem he said you're gonna be like
the provider for her and she's gonna like that logically
she's gonna feel nice with you but the girl inside
her the feminine energy insider is gonna be pulling every
ounce of her being towards the guy who's really stimulating
her emotionally and that's why a lot of times a
woman will leave the kind of boring guy go for
the exciting guy don't blame her for it I mean
that's what she wants blame yourself for the fact that
you did her based on these stupid factors that you
thought were really attracting her but she didn't really want
right you kind of tricked her into being with you
based on these factors that were not that important to
her so make sure that you attract a woman on
the factors that are critical not on the ones that
aren't and if you're going through and you're trying to
improve yourself on all this list of factors focus on
the ones that are the most important right focus on
your confidence first focus on your humor focused on your
detachment focus on yours your edginess if you get those
things handled then you know you'll handle the money and
the other stuff too but those are really really what
are gonna help you to attract the kind of woman
that you want and ultimately all of this that is
leading towards it's leading towards the fact that a woman
wants the stud she wants the guy who can bang
a ton of hot girls he has tons of options
but then what he does is he finds the perfect
one in her and he settles for her and that
makes her feel so unique and special right think about
it this awesome guy he's super confident he's he's he's
funny he's playful he's not attached to anything he's very
carefree in the world he's going on adventures and having
fun with his friends and he has a lot of
experience with other women and now he finds his dream
princess that dream princess there she is and she and
he thinks that she's the most adorable one and she's
the perfect one for him and he chooses her and
he gives up all that for her like to a
woman that is what you want that is the ideal
situation of course it can be hard to get that
because usually a guy like that is also not very
interested in settling down and giving up all this for
that one girl because you have so many other options
with other girls but that's your choice whether you want
to do that or not that's up to you I
recommend building yourself up as a man in every category
