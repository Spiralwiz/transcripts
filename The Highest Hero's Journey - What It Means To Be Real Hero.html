Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about understanding the highest hero's
journey. spoken about the hero's journey before in my life
purpose course. And there I speak about it from a
certain angle. And the angle I come at it from
there is a very practical one, where I show you
how to take this framework of the hero's journey and
apply it to build your career, to build your business,
to find your sense of purpose and the kind of
impact you want to have with your life on society.
How do you want to contribute to the world. And
so we talk a lot about that there. But what
I want to talk about here is I want to
cover it from a different angle. And this is the
perhaps even more important angle of spirituality and non duality.
So what is the interconnection between the hero's journey spirituality,
and non duality? That's what we're gonna discuss here. Actually,
before I did actualize that org, and I was still
not clear about my own life purpose, I was toying
with all sorts of different ideas of what I could
do with my life, career wise. And one of the
things I was toying with was seriously considering the idea
of becoming a science fiction writer. And to do that,
I started studying a lot of stuff, I started to
study narrative, how narrative works, how storytelling works. What are
the common themes and tropes of storytelling, of drama, I
started to study and read books on character development, the
psychology of drama, and also the psychology of dictators and
villains, I became very interested in that. So I started
to read biographies about Hitler, about Saddam Hussein, about other
villains, that I would consider villains, these dictators and such
to see, you know, what is the psychology of these
people that lead them to then abuse, their power, and
so forth, because I wanted to create a really good
villain for my story, because I felt like my hero
in the story could only really be as good as
the villain. And I felt like most villains out there
that you find in the movies and in the books,
they are, aren't as rich and nuanced and psychologically compelling,
as I thought I could make mine. So I started
to study all that. Because what I thought was that
to be a good storyteller, you have to really understand
human psychology. And in a sense, that's one of the
reasons that I got propelled into personal development is because
by studying all this, of course, I couldn't help but
also taken a lot of self help information, and then
make interconnections between the psychology of these villains, which was
so fascinating to me, and the psychology of these heroes,
which was fascinating to me, and then my own psychology,
and then how do I fit into that picture? You
see? But before that was before actualize that org. And
one of the things that I was also studying was
the development of Star Wars, because Star Wars was sort
of the influence that got me interested in this idea
of becoming a science fiction writer, of course, very influential
IP. So I started to study the way that the
original Star Wars was created, started reading about it, watching
interviews, and so forth, and looking at the all the
source material. So what's all the source material for Star
Wars? Where did it come from? What inspired it? So
I started reading Flash Gordon comics, because George Lucas said
it. That's one of the things that inspired him. I
also started reading these valerian comics, which I want to
show you these are pretty cool. These are some old
school French comics, which few people know about until now,
because this summer, there's a valerian movie coming out by
Luc Besson, who also did the fifth element. And the
fifth element was inspired by these valerian comics. And Star
Wars was also inspired by these Alerion comics are some
designs that are just like taken straight out of these,
these these comic books, and they're, they're quite, quite fascinating
to read. It's kind of like going back through time
into the 1970s, and 60s and 50s kind of style.
And also, it's got this kind of European French flavor
to it. So I thought these were cool. I just
wanted to show them to you. You can still buy
these on Amazon. They're pretty fun to read. But anyways,
so there was that. And I was fascinated by all
that. And then of course, I stumbled upon Joseph Campbell,
who is the American mythologist and scholar of comparative religion,
who was one of the inspirations for Star Wars, and
he's the guy who came up with the whole concept
that we call the hero's journey. He didn't actually invent
the hero's journey. He's just the one who made it
sort of popular and made it explicit. In our consciousness
over the last 50 years. So let's get the foundation
here because we need to understand what we're talking about
when we mean the hero's journey. So, before I can
give you my commentary and how it relates to spirituality,
here's my summary for you of what the hero's journey
is. And this is a very illuminating thing to understand.
Because this here, in a nutshell, is what human life
is about. But instead a very sort of stylized and
schematic manner. And you have to be able to see
how this fits in with your practical, everyday life. So
the hero's journey begins just by seeing the hero in
his everyday ordinary existence, living with his tribe, or his
people, in his village or town, wherever he comes from.
And at this point, he's not really a hero, he's
just an ordinary guy, or girl. And in this ordinary
existence, he's very comfortable. And it's just a very sort
of boring, average existence. It's not special at all. Then
what happens though, is that the hero is presented with
a call to action, the call to action is, what
is the opportunity is the window of opportunity that is
presented to the hero that tests whether he really wants
to go on an adventure. So something new and something
radical comes into his existence, which beckons him to go
on this adventure. And, of course, what does the hero
do? Does he accept the adventure? No, because to be
psychologically accurate here, we have to recognize that the human
psyche is very lazy. Because it's stuck in homeostasis, and
it wants to maintain its ordinary, comfortable, mundane existence. And
it's very risk averse. As very fearful. So if I
come to you, and I say, Hey, come on my
rocket ship, and I'm going to fly you to a
new planet, a new galaxy. And there we're going to
battle dragons and space aliens together. What are you going
to say? Are you going to say yes, Leo, let's
do it. Let's go right now. Now, it might seem
at first like yeah, that's what I want to do.
That sounds fun. But you got to understand that it's
one thing to be watching this on the silver screen.
When it's happening, somebody else's another thing to be in
the heroes shoes. So I want you right now to
put yourself in the hero's shoes. So if I come
to you and tell you that, hey, you're coming with
me to a new galaxy to fight space, dragons and
stuff? What are you going to say? You're going to
say? Hell, no. Leo, I got to go to work
tomorrow, I got to pay the bills, I got to
feed the kids, I got to prepare food, I got
all this stuff to do. I got all these commitments,
I got all these obligations, I don't have time to
fly out there. I'm tired. I was working all day,
I was working for 10 hours today, I'm not gonna
go out there and fly with you somewhere to risk,
what to risk my life, my health, my security, for
what to go on some wild goose chase. No way,
I'm not going to do that. So you reject the
call to action. That's what 99% of people do. And
actually including the hero, because the hero is pretty ordinary.
What happens next, though, is that finally he's forced to
accept the call to action, because the call to action
imposes itself upon him. So classically, like in Star Wars,
what happened to get Luke to go on the adventure?
Well, they had to scrub troopers had to destroy his,
his house, his homestead, his farm, and his uncle and
aunt. Right. And so now he's got no choice. His
whole family and house has been destroyed, he's got nowhere
to go. So of course, now he has to go
on the adventure. So something like this happens, right? He's
forced to accept the call, by extraordinary circumstances. And so
he ventures out into unknown territory, which is dangerous. And
he's not sure what he's going to find there. It's
full of risks. And this is where the adventure really
begins. And the first thing that happens to him is
he faces the Threshold Guardian, one of many that he
will face. The Threshold Guardian is an archetype, which basically
is your first obstacle whenever you go on any journey.
So I don't know if you've ever encountered this, but
have you ever gone on like a road trip and
you plan out this road trip, it's going to be
this long, faraway destination that you're going to you're excited,
you get in there, you're, you're you know, you're driving,
let's say you're using your car, you're driving for the
first 100 miles and then you get a flat tire.
So that's your first Threshold Guardian, is that first flat
tire? Because what that does is that tests whether you
really want to go on this trip or not, whether
you're really serious about it. So most people when they
face that first Threshold Guardian, they're defeated and they crawl
back to their old existence. But the here rode, he
sees that there's a bigger vision here, he knows that
there's something bigger he's fighting for. So he tries to
overcome that Threshold Guardian. Maybe he succeeds, or maybe he
fails. If he fails, then he needs to go and
find a mentor that will teach him how to do
battle. And train him and maybe give him some secret
weapon, a magic potion, a lightsaber, a mirror shield, some
kind of armor, some sort of amulet, you know, something
that will serve him as a weapon or a tool
on this journey for overcoming all the tough obstacles that
will be ahead. So he finds this mentor, and he
gets his training. And then he goes off to face
more threshold guardians. And with this training, and of course,
with the mentors advice, he's able to defeat the threshold
guardians and go further and further and deeper into uncharted
territory. Now, the mentor, this is an important point, what
is the mentor? Well, of course, the mentor is a
hero himself from a past generation. So he is usually
a wise old man, or woman who has already gone
through this journey herself. And now she's there to give
advice and training to new heroes who come about trying
to accomplish the same things. We'll get back to that
later. So anyways, the hero with the training goes off,
he faces more threshold guardians, he defeats them. And finally,
he has to face the final boss. And what is
the final boss, the final boss is, let's say, the
dragon, the dragon which guards the Holy Grail, and the
hero is after the Holy Grail. So he's just not
on this adventure. For a lark. He's on this adventure,
because he's been promised that there's something valuable at the
end of this journey for him. That is what we
call the Holy Grail, or the elixir of life. Or
he's trying to save the damsel in distress. And she's
the Holy Grail. And she's, of course, behind the dragon.
So he has to defeat the dragon. Usually, what happens
is that the first encounter with the dragon, this is
like the final boss in the video game. There are
minor bosses before the final boss, but then the final
boss is a really tough one. And when you first
faced the final boss, you usually fail, you have to
go back and lick your wounds. And really rethink your
strategy. So the hero does that. And this here leads
to the most important aspect, psychologically speaking of the entire
journey, which is what's called entering the belly of the
whale. This is where the feet the hero has to
now face himself. He has to really rethink his whole
life, and whole his whole approach to this journey. And
he has to face his own inner demons. Because he
recognizes that the things that are holding him back from
successfully defeating the final boss is his own inner demons
and weaknesses and fears. So that's really where the war
gets waged on the inside. So he goes, he turns
inside, he faces himself, he conquers his inner demons. That's
the hardest point in the journey. Once he gets past
that, now he's free, and he can go and he
can fight the dragon, defeat the dragon, and get the
Holy Grail. Now, an interesting thing happens when he gets
the Holy Grail. There is a sort of 180 degree
reversal, in his understanding of what the Holy Grail was
all about. Originally, he thought that he would go and
he would defeat this dragon, get the Holy Grail and
then be live happily ever after. Because he would now
have this, this, you know, this prize, he would have
all the gold, or all the jewels or something like
that. And that now that would make him happy. But
as soon as he reaches the Grail, and he puts
his hands on it, he realizes that the journey was
not really about the Grail, the journey was about who
he became in order to get the Grail. And that
is really what the Grail is. And so in a
sense, he surrenders the physical material, Grail, the treasure, that's
not important anymore. And he finds his peace and his
happiness in who he has become, and simply in being
the new, more powerful version of himself that he has
become by going on this whole journey. In a sense,
this is a journey to find himself. And so he's
found himself. And at that point, the Grail becomes insignificant.
The real Grail is finding yourself. And so he takes
the Grail, both the physical one and the immaterial one,
and now he returns home back to his tribe, or
to his village or town, to share the lessons that
he's learned. But of course, the irony here is that
the tribe cannot comprehend his lessons, because they have not
gone on this journey themselves. And because they are stuck
in complacency, and they are stuck in stuck in group
thinking. And so when he tries to communicate and share
the lessons with his tribe, it falls on deaf ears.
And so the hero then retires, and he now is
there and available to any new hero, who, from the
tribe decides to accept a new call, as part of
a new generation of heroes. And now, the old hero
is available as a mentor, to mentor and train and
guide, the new younger heroes should they arise. But that's
a rare thing. Because very few people from the tribe
really want to be heroes. They're comfortable living in their
mundane ordinary existence. And so in a sense, the circle
completes itself. And that is the hero's journey, as described
by Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell, very interesting is very interesting
to study Joseph Campbell, and how he arrived at the
hero's journey, and his formulations of it, he was a
mythologist. And he studied a lot of mythological traditions from
cultures, around the entire globe, across various eras and generations.
And he just discovered these consistent threads and patterns throughout
all the mythologies of human beings, whether it was from
Africa, or from Asia, or from Europe or from anywhere.
And this is, what he found is that there's the
hero's journey, it's always described in slightly different language. And
it looks different, you're fighting different monsters. There's different types
of mentors. And there's this different threshold guardians, and the
Holy Grail is always different. But in the end, the
structure here is the same. And this structure is very
important for you to understand for your life, because this
is the structure of human life in a sense. But
it goes deeper than just that. Because the real journey
and this is what most people miss. And this is
why I wanted to shoot this whole episode is to
not just to tell you about the physical journey of
fighting dragons and monsters, you know about that you've watched
plenty of movies where that has happened. And you've probably
heard about the hero's journey already. But what you probably
don't really know is that the real journey is all
done on the inside. That's the key takeaway that I
want you to learn here. Joseph Campbell derived the core
of the hero's journey from Vedanta. Vedanta is a Hindu
philosophy of non duality. It's one of the oldest spiritual
traditions and philosophies that we have. It's several 1000 years
old, over two or 3000 years old. Some of the
earliest written texts in Sanskrit from India. That's where he
derived from and what is the data about the data
is about the pursuit of enlightenment. What I want you
to get here is that all the external journeys of
heroes are just a metaphor for the internal journey towards
consciousness and enlightenment. So when you see movies, or comic
books, superheroes, TV shows, you're reading novels, and you see
all these great heroes, men and women who seemed valiant
and they're fighting against forces of good and evil, right?
They're fighting evil, they are the force of good. And
you think like, yeah, that's, that's the hero. That's kind
of how I should be. Understand that all of that
is metaphor. In reality, there is no outside battle. There
are no outside monsters and there is no outside evil.
The battle the monsters and the evil is you. It's
not anything other or separate from you. It's you. You
are on a journey to fight yourself. What you see
in the comic books and in the movies, these are
childish caricatures, metaphors that we have confused for the true
inner spiritual journey. And that journey basically amounts to you
taking a stand and your life on one critical issue.
And here's what that is. The issue of siding with
ego or siding with truth. This is very important. You're
going to have to make this choice in your life.
And it will be made whether you make it consciously
or not. It will be made by default. If you
don't know that you're making it. The choice is between
Will you serve your time in this life, serving ego,
or pursuing the truth with a capital T. That's basically
what human life boils down to. And that's what the
hero's journey boils down to. What is a hero? A
hero is someone who chooses truth over ego. And everybody
else who's not a hero, why are they ordinary? Why
do we not talk about them or really care about
them? Because they're just part of the crowd. And the
crowd always serves ego, never serving the truth. That is
the fundamental choice. Because what evil is, is evil is
literally selfishness. Or ego. And so in the degree to
which the hero is good, is the degree to which
he breaks loyalty with ego, and he rejects it. And
this is a very difficult thing to do. This is
one of the most counterintuitive moves you could make in
your life. Is this, this choice of truth over ego?
Because you know what's going to happen? When you choose
truth? At first, it might seem like oh, well, Leo,
that's pretty easy. Of course, let's just all choose truth.
Not so fast. Because when you choose truth, are you
prepared for the consequences of what will happen when the
truth butts heads with ego? And what if there is
a really fundamental conflict there, in the sense that you
can't have both, you can't have yourself and the truth.
If you want the full truth, you have to give
up yourself completely. Or if you want to hang on
to yourself, then you can never get the truth. So
when it really comes to a head like that, what
are you going to choose? See, most people are quick
to choose the truth, before they recognize the full consequences
of what that means. Because they think that they can
choose the truth and honor their selfishness at the same
time. But you can't do that if you do that
you become the villain, not the hero. The villain is
who maintains the status quo. Selfishness, evil, that's all it
is. Evil is not some metaphysical force out there. It's
not some dragon or some demons. It's simply selfishness. It's
you, it's yourself. It's everything you do to serve yourself
agenda. That's what villain he is. And you are the
villain. Make no mistake about it. The villain is not
living in some other country. He's not some president or
ruler. He's yourself. He is the person who has abandoned
truth for ego. And he serves to represent the status
quo of society and of culture. If you take a
look at all these movies, and all these novels that
talk about heroes, what do you see, you see the
hero battling, usually what some villain who represents what the
status quo, or the existing social order, because the existing
social order, is always serving the ego, it doesn't care
about the truth. So that's the that's the defining characteristic
of a hero. And that's why we hold heroes as
as remarkable and noteworthy people is because they have summoned
something higher within themselves, that allows them to pursue the
truth, whereas most people cannot do that. They shrink at
that challenge. That's a very big challenge. And that's the
decision that you are being left to make in your
life. But we'll come back to that. Let me also
talk about what the Holy Grail is, what is the
holy grail? The Holy Grail is not treasure. It's not
some sexy damsel in distress that you get to go
start a family with. It's the truth or God, or
enlightenment, or consciousness, all of these things are synonymous. With
the Holy Grail, and the truth, or enlightenment, or God
or consciousness is fundamentally intangible. So you can't cling it,
grab it, hold on to it, put it in your
bank account. You can't buy a house with it. You
can't rule an empire with it. You see, that's why
most villains don't care about the truth. Because the villain
wants power. Why power, because power allows him to serve
the self more better. You see, you can't serve the
self with truth with God, you can serve itself with
power though. And the villain because he's chosen ego over
truth, doesn't want the Holy Grail. He will do everything
to try to besmirch, and destroy the Holy Grail, taint,
the Holy Grail, convince people that there is no Holy
Grail. So the hero has to go fight the villain,
in order to let the truth shine forth, so to
speak upon the people. Because the villain usually tries to
hold back the truth from the people. So that's where
you get into this cosmic battle between good and evil,
between truth and ego. It's very important that you understand
that there is nothing external to be fought in life.
There are no demons out there that you are fighting.
People get so confused by this. Because I think that
even though in our modern consciousness, there is the idea
of the hero's journey, people understand it. That's why people
love watching all these superhero movies and so forth. They
like to see the good guy prevail over the villains.
But really, this deludes a lot of audiences, because I
don't think they really understand what the journey is about.
The journey is not materialistic. It is not about conquering
some monster, or stopping some plague or some disease, or
stopping some terrorists or defeating some Nazis. That's all metaphor.
It's just metaphor. You got to see what the metaphor
is telling you. The metaphor is telling you that you
need to go on that inner spiritual journey. You, you,
you. And the sad part here is that people feel
confused about this whole thing is that they spent half
their life diddling around, half their life is already over.
And they haven't even accepted the call. They haven't even
begun their journey on the inside, and they trick themselves
with perhaps telling themselves that Oh, no, I am on
a journey already, Leo. But really, you're on some materialistic
journey, you're chasing a wild goose. So if you fancy
yourself as on a real hero's journey, to pursue money,
or career success, or a family, this is not a
real hero's journey. In a sense, it's actually a trap
and a distraction. You've misunderstood what the hero's journey is
about, you're no hero, in doing that, you're actually very
ordinary. And actually, that is the path that produces the
villains. So by taking the materialistic path, you will become
a villain. This is guaranteed you will become a villain
because you can't help yourself, because the only person that's
not going to become a villain is the one who
spiritually purifies himself through the process of going inside and
becoming a hero. by attaining the Holy Grail, that's the
only way. See, or you're just gonna be part of
the crowd, part of the unknowing masses, the herd of
humanity who doesn't have an opinion about anything, and commits
evil anyways, simply by by following the villains orders. See,
the majority of people aren't really heroes or villains, they
are just enablers, and CO conspirators of the villain, the
majority of people because we're in your unconscious, you don't
know any better, you're gonna do what the villain tells
you. Because, hey, you're just as selfish as the villain,
basically, maybe a little bit less. So maybe you're not
going to go to his extremes to feed his ego,
but you're still out there feeding your ego mostly. And
so you're going to basically resonate with whatever the villain
is telling you to do. So he's going to be
your leader, and you're going to be a little minion
of the villain. And you're going to be fighting and
demonizing all the heroes who come out of the woodwork.
So what I want you to recognize is that for
your whole life, basically, you've been refusing the call. And
you haven't even been conscious of the fact that you've
and refusing the call. The call for a deep inner
spiritual journey has been presenting itself to you in many
ways. But you weren't clear that this was the case.
And so you've been refusing it. You've been hesitating. You've
been scared, you had a lot of good reasons why
not to go on this journey. You didn't even understand
as your this journey was being presented to you or
you confused it for an external materialistic journey. Also understand
that the real heroes are not the athletes and celebrities,
the business tycoons and the politicians. These are the false
heroes. The real heroes are the Zen masters, the yogi's
the mystics and the saints, the hermits, the people who
get almost no recognition at all, they are the real
heroes, they are the ones who actually went on a
true inner spiritual journey, and they actually found the Holy
Grail. And the Holy Grail has made them humble and
modest. So they don't go flashing it in your face.
And even if you if they did, you still wouldn't
get it. Because to get the subtlety of the Holy
Grail, you need to actually go on the journey, and
let it transform you. Before you can even just conceptually
understand what the Zen master and the yogi are talking
about. You already need to be on the journey. They
need to, in a sense, be preaching to the choir,
you need to be coming to them, rather than than
them coming to you. So why isn't it that everyone
is the hero? Why are heroes rare? Precisely because it
requires breaking loyalty with yourself. And this is the thing
that is common amongst all people amongst all the crowds
is that they are fundamentally loyal to themselves. That's what
pragmatism entails. And that's what most life is about is
about pragmatism. Most people are not very principled people, they
just go with the flow. And they do the thing
that serves their ego, the quickest and the easiest. That's
what they do. And to actually turn your back on
yourself, in a self, this is the ultimate sacrilege or
heresy as far as society is concerned, because all of
society is conspiracy, so that we serve the self together,
you see, because if we try to serve the self
in isolation, by ourselves alone each of us, then we
would start to notice that, hey, I'm serving the self,
this isn't right, I should stop doing this. But together,
when we come together, we can create a mass delusion,
that serving the self is normal. We can normalize each
other in the same way that a bunch of Nazis
coming together, being Nazis together, can become blind to the
evils of their own actions and their own selfishness. You
see, so that's what society has done to you. And
you're a part of that and the whole mechanism. You,
not somebody else, you this is critical for you to
grasp. The hardest thing you will ever do in life
is to make that critical decision to say no to
yourself, and to say yes to truth at the cost
of yourself. As soon as you do this, you will
become an outcast. You will also be on your way
to becoming a true hero. But you will generally be
demonized and isolated by the rest of society. Because this
is a big no no. Because you're breaking the secret
conspiracy. To serve the self. In practice, accepting the call
to adventure is very difficult. I want you to pay
extra special attention in movies and novels from now on
when you read about heroes about this critical phase where
the hero accepts the call, and at first refuses the
call. Because this is very critical. At first when I
read about this, in the hero's journey from Joseph Campbell,
I felt like well, why is it necessary that the
hero plays coy? Why can't the hero just want to
go out on this grand adventure? But that's just not
psychologically true. Because most of us, as adventurous as we
think we are, we're not nearly as that adventurous. Really.
We're very pragmatic and lazy, and we're very risk averse.
So the reason it's so rare that people accept the
call is because to accept the call, you have to
be sort of a romantic because if you do a
sort of cool headed rational calculation, and analysis of whether
you should or shouldn't accept the call, if you do
a sort of pros and cons list of accepting or
refusing the call, you'll see that there are 100 excellent
reasons why you should not go on this adventure, because
of all the risks and dangers and all the bad
stuff that will happen to you. And why you should
stay put, why you should make maintain the status quo
be part of the tribe, not shake the boat. So
if you're just a totally pragmatic person, you will always
choose the status quo, you will never accept the call.
So the hero has to be a bit of a
romantic, he also has to be a risk taker. Because
this choice is fundamentally uncertain, you're going from a place
of certainty and security to a place of uncertainty and
unsecured it. And this, of course, conjures up fear. So
you have to have the faith, to see that that
will be worth it in the long run. Another reason
it's difficult is because you got to share many of
your intoxications. So your culture in your tribe, as intoxicated
you see, with all sorts of addictions, addictions to entertainment,
to sex, to drugs, to alcohol, to coffee, to food,
to fat, to salt, to television, to internet, to social
media, all of these are intoxications, specifically designed by society
to be tools of this conspiracy of ego over truth.
And so you, as a member of the society now
have to reach escape velocity, to break out of the
orbit of the gravitational pole of this selfish community that
you're a part of this unconscious community is sort of
like you have this gravitational wave of unconsciousness that you're
trying to break through. And it's really hard because you
have to undo all your intoxications most heroes never even
accept the call because they're just too intoxicated. By modern
life. And the more technologically advanced our society gets, the
more powerful our intoxicants get, and the harder it is
to go on a hero's journey. That's why there's something
romantic and simple about the hero's journey. Because we recognize
that our technology is doing more harm than good does.
Another reason that it's so difficult is because the peer
pressure, so you're gonna have a lot of peer pressure
from your family, former colleagues, from your friends, all pulling
you back down into the everyday mundane existence, they're going
to tell you what, are you crazy going on this
journey off to some new galaxy to fight some dragon
space dragons? That's some dangerous, risky stuff. Why would you
be crazy enough to want to do that, don't do
that. That's stupid. Stay here, you're safe, you're comfortable, we'll
take care of you. And you have to say no
to that. Which means you have to risk being ostracized,
you have to risk of stepping on some people's toes.
And the other reason that it's so difficult to accept
the call is because it requires a vision, you have
to have a vision of what you're going after, you
have to see the holy grail in your mind's eye.
Long before you actually see it in real life in
your hands. You'll never hold it in your hands until
you see it in your mind's eye. And most people
are very bad at visioning. They can't vision consistently. They
can't see that far ahead. They're myopic, and so they
never accept the call. And in fact, they think of
people who do accept the call as being foolish and
stupid. But that's only because they lacked the vision. Why
do we admire heroes as a culture? And why do
heroes make us emotional? For example, when you see a
great hero in a movie, his actions can bring you
to tears. Why is that? Have you ever wondered? It's
because the hero shows us our highest potential. In that
act of doing something heroic, we see for are a
glimmer in ourselves what our life should be about. It
should be about not doing heroic acts. That's the superficial
material level, I'm talking about the deeper level here. Our
mission is to spiritually purify ourselves, to go on this
inner journey to tap into everything we've got. And you're
going to need everything you've got every ounce of strength
and courage you can muster, to go on this inner
spiritual journey, it's much more scary than going on some
external adventure, to fight some monsters, facing yourself facing the
monster that is you, that's the scariest thing of all.
It's also very tricky. Because this monster of yourself, you're
fighting yourself when you're fighting yourself. Yourself uses all sorts
of tricks and sleight of hand and self deceptions against
you. You see, it's difficult, because you can't really discriminate
which parts of yourself are good, and which are bad,
which have to be fought and which not have to
be thought, you're in conflict, you're confused. In a sense,
it's like the monster has, you know, slap some mud
in your face, you can't see, you can't think straight,
you can't see straight, you're fighting yourself. It's very difficult.
It's confusing. It's disorienting. It's very counterintuitive, because you would
never think that you need to fight yourself in life.
And that you will be your own greatest enemy. So
for that you will need to muster a lot of
strength and courage. That's why heroes make us emotional. Why
must the hero struggle? You might wonder, you know, why?
Isn't it just easy for the hero to go and
obtain the Holy Grail? Why does it have to be
this epic battle with dragons, the threshold guardians and all
this difficulty? Well, because you're opposed by the status quo,
first of all, so your entire environment is conspiring against
you. Because when you rise up, and you embody your
highest potential, that means everyone else will see that that's
possible. And that will rub them the wrong way, I
mean, the right way, that will rub them the wrong
way. Because that means that, hey, they have to admit
to themselves, they have to be conscious now of what
they've been repressing. They have to acknowledge their own villainy.
And they don't want to do that. They don't want
to acknowledge their own selfishness, the whole point of society
is to be a conspiracy for us not to have
to acknowledge our own selfishness, so that we can get
away with being selfish. That's the whole point. So society,
in a sense is against you. Because society is all
about loyalty to the self. And a lot of it
is about power. See, what is power about power is
about preservation of the self. A truly secure person never
needs power. And insecure person needs more power to preserve
the self. So this is why their struggle, there's also
struggle, because you're coming to terms with yourself, you've never
really met yourself before. You just assume you have. So
when you discover that actually you don't know who you
are, what you are, why you are the way you
are. That in and of itself will be a struggle
just to come to terms with that, let alone to
start to change that. Why doesn't the tribe just accept
the heroes lessons? So why is it the case that
when the hero finally returns back home with the Holy
Grail, that his tribe isn't just immediately all cured? Precisely
because the only way that you can really develop this
understanding is by going on a journey yourself. is a
very important point to understand. The point is that understanding
here is not intellectual understanding. This is not something that
a hero can just write in a book. And then
you pick up the book and you read and say,
oh, yeah, of course. Now I have a simulated all
the lessons of the hero. No, the way it's going
to work is if a hero writes it down in
a book, and they do. You read the book, and
you say, oh my god, it's the dumbest thing I've
ever seen. This hero was stupid, and you throw the
book into the fire, and you go off and you
join your friends, in drinking, partying, whoring around and all
the other stuff that you do, as part of your
tribe. The only way you will understand what the hero
wrote in the book is by actually going and encountering
all the obstacles that the hero encountered. To learn these
lessons. These are hard won lessons. And the ultimate Holy
Grail is much too subtle and much Two grand, to
me communicated through any kind of symbols, it's literally incommunicable
is non symbolic, which means that you cannot put it
in symbol form, which means that you can't utter it.
You can't write it down. You can't schematize it, you
can't model it. You can't subject it to scientific analysis.
Which is why science will not solve this problem for
you. You see, finding meaning and happiness in your life
is not a scientific problem. It's a human spiritual problem,
which requires that you go through this process, that's in
a sense, why you're alive. You see, you're not alive
to breed, and to enjoy yourself with carnal pleasures, and
to become successful, that's not why you're alive. You're not
alive to work, either. You're alive. So that you can
experience the truth, of reality of what life is of
what reality is. That is the holy grail. But that's
a very big thing. It also turns out to be
a very paradoxical and counterintuitive and subtle thing. And the
only way to really appreciate the subtlety of it is
to go on this journey, and to make all the
mistakes, and then learn your lessons that way. So that
life or reality teaches you through the school of hard
knocks. Which is why you can't outsource the hero's journey
to anybody. You can't get your friend to do it
for you, your mom and dad can't do it for
you. Sort of corporation can't do it for you, despite
maybe what they would advertise. And why do mentors become
hermits? Why are they usually depicted as these little old
men living in little huts far off from the tribe?
It's because the Holy Grail leaves them speechless. That's its
power. It's so powerful and grand, that you would never
believe it, if it was told to you. So the
wisest mentors keep their mouths shut. Unless you come to
them. And you really ask for their advice. And even
then, when they give you advice, they tend to be
fairly tight lipped. And they might frustrate you with that
sort of Zen approach. You know, you come to a
mentor. And then you wonder, why is this mentor not
just giving me all the answers? Why is he forcing
me to, to do all this hard work and to
derive all these answers for myself? That's not because the
mentor is an asshole. Or he's just some, you know,
crotchety old man, not not because of that. It's because
he understands that the only way you can understand is
by going through the journey yourself. And he doesn't want
you to accidentally fool yourself into a false sense of
theoretical understanding, intellectual understanding, without the experience to back it
up. So he's going to push you and force you
to actually go on the journey for yourself. So he's
going to try to be light with his answers. He's
just going to give you hints. Because he knows that
he can't actually hand over the holy grail to you
even though he's got it. He's got the holy grail
right here. And yet, he knows that you have to
go through all those threshold guardians, go fight that damn
dragon defeat the dragon only then after list risking life
and limb, only then can you have the Holy Grail
to. And so the mentor generally he's happy, he's peaceful,
he retires off by himself, also, because he doesn't want
to be part of this circus act. It's carnival. That
is the conspiracy of society is the he doesn't really
want to be part of that game. Because that's just
a conspiracy to serve ego, and he has rejected ego.
He's accepted the truth. And once he's got the truth,
he doesn't need society anymore. Not really. He can live
within it, he can mingle inside of it. But it
doesn't really excite him that much. So now you start
to understand subtle some of the spiritual subtleties of the
hero's journey is quite a profound and deep framework. What
are the takeaways here practically for your life? Firstly, I
want you to understand that society will not lead you
to salvation or to happiness or to meaning these are
things you have to find on your own. You cannot
outsource this, because this is a spiritual problem. It's a
problem of not understanding what reality is, you can't get
this without the Holy Grail. This is what the Holy
Grail is about. That's why it's holy. It's the elixir
of immortality is what it really is. And you'll be
shocked when you when you get for Far, far enough
into this journey, you'll be shocked at how literal some
of these descriptions are. Sometimes it'll feel like you're actually
fighting a dragon within yourself. Sometimes you'll see like, oh,
yeah, today, I really faced a Threshold Guardian. Or I
really met my mentor. Or once you get to the
very end, and you actually get a taste, a little
taste of the elixir of immortality, you will discover Holy
shit. It's actually an elixir for immortality. It's not just
poetry. This is real. This is literal. It's the elixir
of immortality that's available to you. But see, do you
recognize that? Can you see what that really means? Can
you read between the lines? It's really too good to
be true. That's part of the reason that so few
people go on the hero's journey, they, they just can't
believe that it could be that good. And it is,
but the problem is that it takes some investment first,
you know that goodness comes at the end, not at
the beginning. The second takeaway for you is to understand
that this here is a process. This is a framework.
And you can save yourself a lot of time by
understanding the brain, the framework and process and learn from
the lessons of past generations, you don't need to reinvent
the wheel. This is how your life is going to
unfold. Either you will accept the hero's journey or you
won't. And if you accept that you will go through
these characteristic phases. They're all going to be there you
will recognize them. Perhaps more so in retrospect, than from
the beginning. But the more you can see it from
the beginning to better because it'll be easier for you.
Because then you can remind yourself, when you're in this
process on this journey, and you face a Threshold Guardian,
and you get your ass kicked by that Threshold Guardian,
you can tell yourself, oh, yeah, that was just the
Threshold Guardian. I shouldn't worry too much, because I know
that I'm supposed to get my ass kicked by the
first Threshold Guardian, that just means I need to go
find a better mentor, get more training, and then come
back and face them again. See, and in this way,
you keep yourself on the path. Whereas if you don't
understand the overarching big picture of the path, then what's
going to happen is that you're going to, you're going
to get discouraged. And you're just going to quit when
you face that first or second Threshold Guardian. Or when
the dragon kicks your ass for the first time you
see that dragon and scares the shit out of you.
And you just run away and you never look at
it again. But when you understand the overarching big picture
here, you understand that all I see the dragon, it
scares the shit out of me. And what that means
is I gotta go to the belly of the whale
and face my own inner demons and deepest fears all
now I understand how to defeat the dragon, you see.
So this is a roadmap here that's being laid out
to you so that you can see how to get
from point a point A to point Z point A
being your mundane everyday existence right now, point z being
enlightenment or the Holy Grail, the elixir of immortality. The
next takeaway is that what you really got to do
is get to the point where you accept the call
99% of people have not accepted even the call. Don't
mistake how significant this first step of accepting the call
is. Most of your life, you've been refusing the call,
what you got to do is find the thing in
you, which will make it worthwhile to accept the call
and be very explicit and clear about what that is.
I don't know what that is for you. Maybe you
got to contemplate your own death. Maybe you got to
become conscious of the shortness of your own life. Or
you gotta get Dissatisfied with your current existence to such
an extent that you see that it's unsustainable, it'll never
lead you to happiness or meaning. And then once that
becomes clear to you, then you can make a clear
cut decisions. Okay, I'm accepting the call and all the
costs that come with it. Don't think of this adventure
as just a carefree fun Lark? No, this involves some
very serious emotional labor. Which is why you need to
be explicit about your reasons for why you're going on
this journey, why it's important to you why it's the
most important thing in your life. And you got to
be clear with yourself that you're willing to take some
sacrifices and to pay the cost and to do the
emotional heavy lifting. Otherwise you will have no chance in
hell of doing that. The final takeaway is to realize
that really what you've been secretly craving, your whole life
is to give your life to something bigger than yourself.
You just haven't discovered how to do that. You've been
hesitating. You've been looking around at all your friends and
your tribe. And you've been seeing that they've been giving
you signals not to do it. And so you've held
back. And so one of two things will happen. Either
you will keep hesitating. And you will hesitate for the
rest of your life and you will stall and you
will die with regrets. Knowing at the end of your
life that you hesitated, and that you didn't really go
on the journey you were meant to go on. Or
at some point you will wise up, you will say
no to all the peer pressure, and you will go
and you will carve your own path through the dark
forest. Face the threshold guardians, defeat the dragon, obtain the
Holy Grail, and retire in peace, knowing that you fulfilled
the mission of your life. And with that, I want
to leave you with one last thing. And that is
a haiku by an old Zen master, a true hero.
Someone who has done exactly what I talked about here,
and his name is Rio Khan. And here's what he
says. The village has disappeared in the evening missed, and
the path is hard to follow. Walking through the pines,
I returned to my lonely hut
