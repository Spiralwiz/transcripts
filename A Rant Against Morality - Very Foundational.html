Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to rant against morality All right, I get
to be a little self righteous in this one. So
I'm excited. Let's get started. Basically, what I want to
show you is that your model of morality, your morals
of what you think is right and wrong, good and
Evil, is actually having the opposite effect that you want
it to have. And it's severely stunting your growth and
psychological well being. And it's keeping you from being fulfilled
and is keeping you from reaching your full potential. That's
my message in a nutshell. But now there's a lot
of details that we need to go into to explain
why this is because this is a very counterintuitive thing.
Most people cannot wrap their mind around what I'm about
to say. This episode is very, very foundational. This is
not just philosophy here, this is going to be very
practical. I'm going to show you with this episode and
the upcoming episode in the future, I'm going to show
you how much of your life is being damaged in
a very practical, very concrete way. And how this is
slowing you down and creating a lot of the problems
that you have in your life. Problems like guilt, shame,
blame, victim mentality, righteousness, anger, and all this kind of
stuff. So let's begin at the beginning. a developmental psychologist
by the name of Lawrence Kohlberg did some research in
the 1950s on morality. And what he discovered by interviewing
lots of different subjects is he discovered there's basically stages
kind of preset stages of morality through which a human
psyche evolves and develops. Basically, there are three stages. So
the first stage is preconventional. Morality, the second stage is
conventional morality. And then his third final stage was post
conventional. What are these in a nutshell, basically, you begin
at the preconventional stage. And that's the most basic, most
crude form of morality. And what that is, is a
sort of stick and carrot version of morality, which means
that you act to not do wrong so that you
don't get punished. That's kind of the very, very basic
level, the next level of evolution up from that, and
this is still preconventional is the carrot, rather than the
stick, which means that you do good, so that you
can get rewards, whether it's approval from others, or patting
yourself on the back this kind of stuff. Right? So
both of these, the carrot and the stick comprise preconventional
morality. So that's kind of where you start, then you
evolve. And not everyone evolves past this, a lot of
people stay stuck there forever, right. But if you keep
growing your psyche, and keep developing, and you keep maturing,
then you evolve to the next stage, which is conventional
morality. And what this is, is basically conformist, authoritative forms
of morality. So conformity means that the reason that you
do something that you're supposed to do, the reason you
do good is because if you didn't, then you would
not be conforming, and therefore you would arouse the disapproval
of others around you. So you're trying to conform. And
then you can grow and evolve a little bit higher
than that still staying in the conventional stage. And you
get into the authoritative forms of morality, which means that
the reason that you do something or don't do something
is because some higher authority told you what's right, and
what's wrong. So this higher authority might be the Bible
might be the Pope might be the US Constitution, or
your parents or whoever. Right. And then if you evolve
past this stage, now we're getting out of conventional and
we're going into post conventional, in post conventional, what you
have is you have social contract theory. And what this
is, this comes to us basically from the European enlightenment,
which by the way, has nothing to do with actual
enlightenment that I talked about. In other episodes, European enlightenment
was just like a philosophical movement in the 17 and
1800s. But what that is, is it arose this idea
of rows of social contract, which basically means that if
you're a member of a community, the reason that you
want to act moral and ethical is because, you know,
we're all in this together. We're all in the same
boat, so to speak. And even just by being born
and being part of whatever nation, you're part of, that
nation is based upon social contract, which basically means that,
you know, we've kind of come together and we've mutually
agreed, whether in an explicit way, or an implicit way,
we have agreed to work together and to not work
against each other. And so because of this, we want
to do good and we don't want to harm others.
And our morals are grounded in that. Okay. And then
if you evolve a little bit past social contract, then
you get to Kohlberg 's highest stage, which is principle
based morality. And what this means is, you act based
on internal principles. So all the external rewards and all
the external rules, you've internalized them in a sense, where
you are acting on your own conscience. And on your
own sense, your intuition of what's right and what's wrong.
And you no longer need to appeal to any authorities,
or to any conventions, or to any kind of social
contracts. And that's it, at least for Kohlberg. Now, what's
interesting to me is that Kohlberg left out the most
important stage of morality, the highest stage, which is what
I call transcendent morality, and transcendent morality ever talked about
in the second half of this episode. But just in
a nutshell, what it is, is basically it's a consciousness
of ultimate truth, and ultimate reality. And when you become
fully conscious or enlightened, then you break down the boundary
between self and other. And literally what happens is that
everything becomes you, everything becomes the self. And there is
a complete and utter utter surrender of you to reality,
the larger force of reality, or, as some might want
to call it, God or whatever you want to call
it, nature, reality existence, you basically surrender to this higher
power, and you act now, compassionately towards everyone, and everything,
because you literally perceive the entire world as your body.
It's a very radical thing. And more than that, than
just that you recognize that all of existence is basically
a giant ball of love, of unconditional love. And what
you do is you surrender your ego, to such an
extent that everything is unconditionally loved by you. Even the
good, I mean, especially the good, but even the evil,
even the bad stuff, even the stuff that looks ugly,
or looks vile, or looks immoral, you even start to
love that. Because you see it as a unity. There
are no divisions. It's one giant unity. And so you
surrender to that, and you approach all of reality with
unconditional love. And that's transcendent, transcendent morality, is what that
is. So we'll circle back to that in a little
bit. But let's talk about traditional or conventional morality first.
So this is all the stuff that is not transcendent
morality. Now, there's a lot of problems with traditional morality,
which I want to talk about. Traditional morality is where
99.99999% of people live, very few people ever live to
get to transcendent morality. So the problem with traditional morality,
though, is that it's actually very damaging. It promotes unconscious
obedience to rules or authority figures, or even to your
own intuitions about what's right and what's wrong. The problem
here is that it's done in an unconscious way. It's
done in a dogmatic way. You're following a certain set
of rules. And what happens when you do this is
that it leads to moralization. moralization, and this moralization can
happen in very gross, obvious ways. Or it can happen
in extremely subtle ways. And what moralism is, is it's
a rigid set of do's and don'ts. And it's a
sort of judgmental attitude towards reality, where you're dissecting, you're
cutting and dicing up reality, which is one unified whole,
in truth. You're, you're fragmenting reality. And then you're saying,
well, these things on this side, these things are good
things. And those things on that side, those things are
evil things. And maybe you carve out some space in
the middle for some neutral things. But basically, that's kind
of your spectrum. And what happens is that you start
to see the world in a very black and white
sort of way. And anything that's on this side, the
evil side, you judge it, and you move away from
it and you deny it within yourself. And so your
reality becomes fragmented. And from this comes moralism. Now you
might say, well, Leo, you know, moralism has nothing to
do with me, because it sounds like you're talking about
like religious morality, but I'm not religious, I'm secular, or
I'm an atheist. So Leo, this doesn't apply to me,
right? Be very careful about that kind of defense, because
you're dismissing something very deep and important here. Actually, what
I'm talking about applies to you, even if you're an
atheist, even if you're secular. Even if you're scientifically minded
or rationally minded, and you don't believe in religion at
all. It still applies to you, because you moralize. Nonetheless,
unless you've done a whole lot of self development work,
you moralize a lot. Whether you're religious or not. That's
what I mean by very subtle forms of moralizing. And
I'll give you some examples as we go on here.
But let's give you some examples of the obvious sources
of moralization. So obviously, all the religious sources so this
is actually one of the reasons that atheists and rational
people try to stay away from religion is because there's
so much moralism within religion. So Christianity, Catholicism. I know
Catholicism is a form of Christianity, but Catholicism is in
a specially moralistic form of Christianity. So it bears being
called out on its own. Also, Islam Islam is extremely
moralistic in the way that it's practiced in the Middle
East. Even Buddhism, Buddha's me isn't even supposed to be
a religion. Nevertheless, Buddhism tends to veer towards moralism when
it's practiced by people. Judaism is moralistic as well. So
basically, all the major religions are moralistic. Also, there's like
these ideologies, ideologies here in the West, in the United
States, like conservativism, political conservativism, or cultural conservativism. People like
Jerry Falwell, and Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson, you know,
these talk show hosts, or, you know, conservative figures basically
in the public. So they do a lot of moralizing.
And a lot of their ideas and ideologies are based
upon kind of moralization. or certain moral authority that they
have over their constituents are their followers, or in contrast
to the people that they criticize. But it's not just
conservativism it also happens in liberalism, too. So liberals, and
hippies and green people, you know, environmentalist people, they also
moralize, just on different grounds in a different way. But
they still moralize, you know, when someone tells you that
you shouldn't eat meat. Because of this, this, this and
this, and, you know, you shouldn't pollute the water and
you're, you know, you're bad for polluting the water and,
and you know, those evil corporations on Wall Street and
how much money they make and how they neglect the
poor and the the destitute and the crippled. You know,
that's also moralization. So it happens on both sides of
political aisles. And here now we're getting into probably something
that's more practical for you. Because most of you guys
that watch me aren't too like fundamentalist religious, I assume.
But. But the secular forms of moralism. Examples of this
include all the moralism that goes on in your family.
So when you were growing up, and whatever family you're
in, right now, you know, if you're older, you're probably
still seeing your folks once in a while, or your
siblings. But there's a whole slew like a little, a
little system of morality within your family that got enforced
from the very beginning when you were born, and probably
still gets enforced today. And that probably creates a lot
of tension for you and your life. And many of
those rules laid down by your parents, you're still either
acting to align with those in your life as an
adult, or you're acting and rebelling against them as an
adult. So either way, it's affecting you. Also, in your
intimate relationships, moralism becomes a huge potential problem. Because let's
say you're married or you're in a long term relationship
with a girlfriend or boyfriend, okay? What's going to happen
there is again, because that's also like the new family
that you're starting. You're starting your own family, basically. And
there now you're going to be the one who sets
various rules. And of course, your partner is going to
have different notions than you about the kind of rules
that should be set. And so there's going to be
an argument they're going on a kind of a debate
back and forth. That's going to stretch over the course.
For years and decades between you two about what the
rules should be, and who's disobeying the rules and who's
being unfair, and who's being at fault, and who's guilty,
and who's innocent, right. So that whole discussion and that
whole argument will go on with you too. And that
can lead to a lot of frustration could lead to
a lot of divorce, a lot of divorces happen because
of the moralizing that goes on between couples and relationships.
Also, there's a certain moralization that happens with cultural etiquette.
You know, cultural etiquette is stuff like, you know, should
I bow? Should I say, thank you? Should I say
please, should I hold the door open? Should I not
cut off some guy in traffic? Or should he not
cut me off? This kind of stuff, you know, just
kind of like little rules that aren't very religious. They're
not very charged. But still, you can see how you
know, if you hold a belief such as like, nobody
is supposed to ever cut me off in traffic. And
somebody does, then that's going to make you angry. And
you're going to suffer on account of that, because of
your moralism there. And then, of course, the most important
form of moralism is probably the one that goes on
inside yourself. moralism that you created for yourself. So the
rules you have set for yourself, outside of all these
areas I've talked about, but you as a human being
as you were growing up, and as you were a
teenager, you made certain decisions about what should and what
should not occur in life, what's right, and what's wrong,
what's fair and what's not fair. And these rules as
you've made them, you've applied them to others in order
to judge others. And then of course, you by necessity,
your mind has to apply them to itself too. Because
you know, if you judge someone for being evil, because
he ripped somebody off and stole some money from them,
if you then five years later, go and try to
rip somebody off, then your mind will say, Oh, then
that means I'm evil, because I judge that other person's
being evil. Right? And so now you have this to
contend with. So those are some examples of where moralism
occurs in our lives. But let's discuss now, what the
problem is with moralism because it's not obvious. You might
say, well, Leah, you know, moralism is a good thing,
because we have rules. If we didn't have rules, then
it would just be chaos and anarchy. Is that what
you're advocating? Before I address some of those objections, which
I will, let's talk about the problems with moralism. The
problem here is not religion. Make sure you don't make
that mistake. It's not a religious problem. This is a
much broader problem than just religion. The problem is mechanical
illness. The problem is setting down a simplified black and
white rule for how life should be, and then expecting
life to go according to that rule. And then also
expecting yourself to Now originally behave in in a mechanical
unconscious way, according to that rule. What I said is
very profound. It takes a bit of thinking to unpack
all that, right. What do I mean by mechanical illness
and unconsciousness and all these kinds of terms? What I
mean is that to actually be moral and good. You
need to do it from a place of consciousness of
awareness in the present moment, you have to be aware
of the situation. And from that comes the greatest good.
But when you just have a brute force rule, that
you have been following your whole life and have a
whole set of these rules, and you believe that the
rules constitute morality, then what happens is that you are
just blindly following bureaucratic rules. And a lot of times
these rules are so simplistic that they don't actually fit
real life situations. And also, you can apply these rules
in a mechanical nature in a mechanical manner, to the
point where you apply the rule and you actually end
up using the rule to act immorally. That's the problem
with rules. That's the problem with dogma. That's the problem
with beliefs. This goes way beyond just doing good or
doing bad. This goes very, very deep to the very
root of what you think reality is and how reality
is structured. Your whole model of reality is tied in
with your model of morality. The rules you make are
actually made out of fear. We're now the stuff I'm
gonna be talking about right now is going to be
largely unconscious stuff, stuff that you probably haven't become aware
of yet. But keep in mind that everything I'm talking
about is something you can look at, investigate and see
for yourself, I'm not just giving you some theory of
mine about morality, I'm telling you what you will find,
if you just take it upon yourself to empirically investigate
how some of these things work in your day to
day life. This is not theory, it's not philosophy. Don't
confuse it with that. The rules, what I'm claiming is
that the rules that you set for what's right and
what's wrong, are actually mana fear. They're driven by your
ego. You have an insecure, neurotic ego, that acts defensively
to protect itself, and to protect its model of the
world and a reality and of life. And your identity,
your personal identity, who you actually believe you are, this
needs to be defended, right? Because your identity, what it
is, is it's a, it's a partial, partial, incomplete picture
of what you actually are in this world. Right? What
you've done is you fragmented a unified reality, you fragmented
it, and then you said, This is me, this is
how I have to be. And everything else is not
me. So by creating a strong, you strong identity, a
strong ego, that necessarily means that now you have to
be on the defensive, to protect this little pocket or
corner, partition of reality, from the rest of reality, from
encroaching on it, right, it's almost as though you've cut
a hole in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, nationalists,
you cut a hole in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean. And now you've cut it like a mile deep
to the very bottom of the ocean floor. If you
cut it, though, what happens you have to have like
walls, very, very strong walls, like reinforced with, with tons
of concrete and steel, to keep this thing from collapsing
in on itself, because that's the natural tendency, right? Because
the entire force of all the water on Earth, basically,
of all the oceans on Earth is crashing in the
sides of that hole that you've tried to cut out.
So you're going to need to work really, really hard
to cut out that hole. And if there's ever a
leak, you're going to be always on the defensive, you
know, plugging every little hole that you find within that
concrete structure that supports the space that you've carved out
of the ocean. That's basically what's going on with you,
with your ego. So this kind of ego now, because
it's very rigid, it's not flexible. And it's unwilling to
really investigate what the ego is, and what reality is,
because if it did, it would realize that this hole
is completely artificial and unnecessary, right? The reality is, is
that you're the entire ocean, you don't need to carve
out a hole in the ocean, you are the whole
ocean. But most people aren't aware of this takes a
lot of work to become aware of that. So what
they do now is they use morality as a tool
of the ego, to erect barriers, to reinforce his identity.
And this starts with you very, very young. So when
you were just a baby, when you were one year
old, already, your parents were using morality to manipulate you
to get you to do what they believed was right
and wrong. So from your very birth, you've basically been
imprinted and indoctrinated with a set of what's right and
what's wrong. And this went like straight, straight into the
very core of the operating system of your mind. So
deep in there that you cannot even fathom how foundational
that was, to the way you relate to the life
now, the way you relate to people to life to
yourself to situations in the world. All of that has
been skewed and distorted from the very beginning of your
birth by the manipulations that have happened to you, by
your parents, right? So when your parents said, Oh, don't
do that. Oh, good girl. Bad boy. This kind of
stuff, right? You shouldn't eat candy. And you know, you
should be good at church. And you know, you shouldn't
look at pornography. And you know, you shouldn't touch alcohol,
and you shouldn't watch so much TV and you should
do your homework, and you should do this and should
do that. That's moralization. Right, and notice that this is
where it starts completely irreligious so it's not religious. It's
a religious right. These kinds of things like don't eat
candy, don't watch too much TV. These are just rules.
laid down by your parents because, you know, you're being
a little brat, and they want to control you so
that you don't get on their nerves. It's just a
very simple thing like that. And then it starts that
it continues through your entire childhood into your teenage years,
when you become a teenager, you start to rebel against
all that stuff, you start to kind of form an
identity of your own. But still, largely, even if you
rebelled against some values, largely, you're still on board with
the majority of the values that your parents taught you
what you think is right and wrong. And for you,
those things are now a part of reality, you don't
see as just an opinion that stealing is wrong, you
think that that's actually true, it's true that stealing is
wrong, it's true, that murder is wrong. That's how your
mind thinks of it. The reason it thinks of it
that way is because it was imprinted into your mind
at a time when you had no rational capacities whatsoever.
So it's really deep in there. It's really deep in
there. Now, you might say, well, Leo, what's wrong with
you know, having some rules? You know, isn't it? Isn't
it good that my parents told me not to eat
too much candy? Yeah, maybe you know, some of these
rules can be useful. I'm not saying they aren't. But
notice, what they fundamentally are, is that there are manipulations
made by egos to get the outcomes they want. So
yeah, of course, these rules are very effective. In certain
contexts, the problem happens that when you grow up, and
you have a lot of these rules, and what starts
to happen is that your rules start to conflict and
contradict. And the force of that ocean crashing in the
size of this identity hole that you've created inside the
ocean, it starts to become painful, it creates suffering, and
it starts to ultimately crack and starts to leak through
there. And it becomes a full time job sometimes to
keep this structure from collapsing. So the other problem with
this is that a lot of these rules are external
rules. So they build within you a sense of extrinsic
motivation. So it's like, don't do this, otherwise, you're gonna
get spanked. Or otherwise, you're gonna go to hell. And
the problem with that is that you're now you're motivated.
Now, after a couple of decades of this kind of
talk. Now, your mind becomes motivated by native neurotic motivation.
You don't do things because you actually love them. Or
because you inherently care about doing them? You do them?
Because you have to. You do them, because you should
you do them because it's a law of God, or
a law of society or something like that. And what's
the problem there? Well, the problem there is that if
you're doing something, because you should notice that that necessarily
implies that you actually want to do something opposite to
that. So if you should not have sex, and you're
struggling with that, that means you actually want to have
sex. And if you should not eat candy, that means
there's actually a force within you a force within your
mind that wants to eat candy. So what's happening here
is that you're fragmenting yourself, you're creating this integrity, you're
out of integrity with yourself, because there's a complicated slew
of forces within you, that motivates the average human being.
There's good forces and bad forces, there's evil ones, there's
noble ones, there's petty ones, there's generous ones, they're selfish
ones, all sorts. You have all sorts of ideas floating
through your mind, you know, sometimes you have an idea
that you want to kill somebody. Now, you probably don't
want to follow through on that, and you probably won't,
but you still have the idea. Now, the problem happens
is that when you try to deny that you have
the idea that you want to kill someone, that's when
you get into neurosis, because what you're doing is you're
actually creating a shadow. So see, the ego, not only
is the ego a problem, but it gets worse, it
gets a lot worse, the ego has a shadow, the
shadow of the ego is all the stuff that you
deny about yourself. But that's actually inherent in your identity.
So stuff like I want to have sex. If you're
a religious person, you probably have a shadow of your
ego. Your ego believes that sex is wrong, or it's
somehow it's dirty. But then the shadow part of that
is that actually you want to have sex. And actually
because you deny yourself sex, you actually want it even
more. So it's kind of like the opposite side. Out
of the coin, if you create one rule, or if
you create one judgment, or if you say something is
good, that necessarily means that the opposite of that is
bad. See, people tend to think like, well, but it's
good to say the things are good. Because that allows
me then to not do the bad things. Now, the
problem is, is that when you say something is good,
that necessarily means you're gonna do bad things, or you're
gonna repress bad things, right? You have to repress them.
There has to be a denial of reality here. And
that's the real tragedy of all this is that moralization
leads to a denial of reality. And when you deny
reality, and you try to fight against reality, you always
lose. Always, you always lose. It's just a matter of
time. And that's a big problem. A big practical problem
in your life. Another interesting tidbit here is that the
moralist, the person who acts very moral, they derive a
secret pleasure out of doing so. And again, it's an
egoic pleasure. It's kind of like one of those dirty
little ego with pleasures. And that's the pleasure of feeling
self righteous. So when you condemn a terrorist, or when
you condemn Nazis, or when you can condemn a pedophile,
you know, these are very easy things to condemn. And
you might think, like, well, I'm being noble, you know,
I'm fighting against the Nazis and I'm fighting against the
communists. I'm fighting against the, the heathens, and I'm fighting
against the infidels and stuff. But, but see what you're
actually doing there is your ego is kind of like
gloating. It's, it's basking in its own eagerness. And then
of course, what that does is that just exacerbates all
the problems that come with ego. But this is a
subtle thing. It's a subtle thing, because the ego says
that this kind of gloating is actually good. It justifies
it by saying, well, but you know, I do good
in my life and look at those Nazis and look
at those terrorists, you know, look at what they do.
Look at me compared to them how much better I
am, see the egos whole game is to aggrandized itself
to feel powerful, and to feel alive. Because the fundamental
problem of the ego is that the ego is an
illusion. So it has to fight all the time to
create a sense of reality. If it stops fighting, then
it literally dies. So that's what's going on there to
very deep level, all the stuff I'm talking about is
extremely advanced stuff. I mean, it'll take you years, maybe
decades, to put all this stuff into practice to actually
see how it all works in your life. It's all
very, very subconscious, like buried deep in your mind. All
this stuff I'm telling you is is is stuff you're
not supposed to know about yourself. Right? It's the egos
job to prevent you from ever hearing what I'm saying
right now. So let's get back to the point of
the problem of morality or the problem of moralizing. Rather,
the other problem with moralizing is that it leads to
hypocrisy. So of course, and this is a you know,
very interesting phenomenon that you get to see with televangelists,
preachers and certain conservative politicians or radio show hosts is,
you know, they're very moralistic, and they tell you know,
you shouldn't do this, and you shouldn't do that. And
you shouldn't have sex and you shouldn't drink and you
you should be religious and pious and, and generous and
selfless. And then we discovered that this preacher has been
caught with a hooker doing cocaine, you know, and having
gay sex, this kind of thing. And that's not an
accident. That is actually hastened by his moralism. It's hastened
by it, because someone was a preacher and really preaches
against something and calls something evil, that person is denying
that aspect of reality and that aspect of himself kind
of interesting. So, one problem here is that leads to
hypocrisy and hypocrisy is a painful condition to be in.
It also backfires. So moralism backfires on you, and whatever
vices you have become intractable after you've moralized to other
people. So you know, if I'm greedy, and I publicly
announced how bad and evil greed is, then what's likely
to happen is that now I have to hide my
own vise of greed. And when I hide it, that
means I can't observe it, I can't be conscious of
it. That means I can't actually work through it and
outgrow it, and integrate it as I do self actualization
work. And so what's going to happen is that decades
will pass and that greed will just kind of rot
and fester, and it'll get worse and worse and worse,
rather than better. Also, what happens with moralism is a
lot of guilt, shame, hatred and judgment happen. So if
you're looking for a cure to your guilt, or to
your shame or to your hatred of other people or
yourself you know, I have a lot of episodes to
talk about the dangers of judgment and why judgment is
something you should think about letting go of. Here's the
key drop your moralism. Drop your moralism if you moralize,
you will, by necessity, feel guilty, shameful, angry and judgmental.
You cannot avoid that. And by moralizing here, I don't
just mean stop preaching to other people. You might say,
well, Leah, you know, I don't moralize to people. I
don't really go around and preach to people you know
about the evils of sex. That's a very gross example.
Now I'm talking about very subtle things, subtle ways in
which you moralize, like when you're telling yourself, you shouldn't
eat that doughnut at work. Or when you tell yourself,
you shouldn't be so lazy, with your schoolwork. Or when
you tell yourself, you know, you have to go to
the gym. You have to go to the gym, you
can't miss a single day at the gym. Or when
you tell yourself, you know, my girlfriend, my girlfriend, she
shouldn't be talking to other guys. She shouldn't that's not
right. Or, you know, you might say you know that
my friend, you know, my friend has been disrespectful, disrespectful
to his parents, he shouldn't be so disrespectful to his
parents, he should be more loyal, and more generous to
his parents. And you know, those politicians, you know, the
politicians, they should be more honest, they shouldn't be so
greedy. All of that is moralism. And you do it,
you do a lot of it, you do a fucking
ton of it. in ways you can't even imagine yet
how subtle This is. You do it externally. You also
do it internally, you do it to yourself. Every day
you wake up, I challenge you, from the moment you
wake up, your first thought when you wake up is
probably a moralization. You probably already telling yourself, oh, man,
I should have gotten up 10 minutes earlier. Oh, man,
you know, I should have done my homework yesterday. Or,
you know, oh, man, you know, that person should have
done something for me and he didn't do it. All
that is moralizing. And the problem with is that you're
going to feel guilty. But also you're gonna have low
self esteem, because you're gonna be out of integrity, which
necessarily leads to low self esteem. Also, it leads to
self hatred. Right, because there are facets of yourself that
you don't accept, also, at least a self sabotage. If
you wonder why you have difficulty motivating yourself to do
stuff, or why you do something, but then you kind
of do the opposite of it the next day, like
you go to the gym, but then you pick out
or you eat healthy, and then you pick out or
you do a lot of work, and then you get
lazy if you have all these kind of motivation problems.
Here's a really big reason why. And you're not going
to fix them until you drop your moralizing. Also, if
you have anxiety, anxiety, general fear. What do you think
that comes from that comes from moralizing. Also, if you
have stress, you feel overwhelmed all the time that also
comes from moralizing. So a lot of very painful stuff
comes from moralizing. moralizing basically is a perfect recipe for
disastrous suffering in your life. And then of course, all
this leads to the victim mentality if you feel like
a victim you moralize a lot. You moralize a lot.
What's interesting about moralizing not only can it be kind
of like it can take two forms basically. So one
form is the kind of form where you're the self
righteous moralizer And you tell yours you tell basically other
people what not to do. So you say you know
you tell that person who's having too much sex don't
do don't have so much sex Look at me I'm
I'm the perfect example of someone who doesn't have too
much sex and you you shouldn't drink so much. I'm
the perfect example of someone who doesn't drink so this
kind of ego it aggrandizing itself. The victim mentality ego
kind of does the opposite. It kind of uses this
moralizing guess itself so it tells itself something like Oh,
I should not have so much sex oh you know
I shouldn't be such a such a lazy person. You
know, I shouldn't be so careless in my relationship you
know, I should be more loving. You know, I I
should be a better at work. I shouldn't make mistakes
at work. I should get better grades at school. And
on and on and on. It goes Both of these
forms are moralization, even though they're kind of opposite on
the surface. And then of course, you know, if you've
ever wondered why human history is filled with all sorts
of math horrors, like the Holocaust, and the Spanish Inquisition,
and terrorism, and you know, like, suppression of minorities, racism,
slavery, exploitation, colonialism, eradication of the Native American populations of
the United States. Why is that? moralism largely because of
moralism. Because when you mechanically follow rules, what happens is
disaster, inevitably leads to disaster, because you're judging evil. And
when you judge evil, you unnecessarily demonize the other person
or situation, and then when you demonize them, you no
longer can treat them humanely, which means you cannot be
moral to them, see, judgment and moralization radicalizes, you and
when it radicalized as many people under a common ideology
that leads to the greatest horrors of human history. So
actually, morality is directly responsible for the greatest horrors and
evils of mankind. And the reason all of this happens
is because you deny and reject reality, that's your Achilles
heel, here. And this is the grave sin that you
commit against reality is that you deny and reject it.
This is what happens when you fragment a unified whole.
Shit starts to hit the fan very quickly. And it
leads to a very messy situation. Brad Blanton psychologist writes
a lot about this. And I liked the way he
puts it, he says that the opposite of moralism is
integrity. When you are whole, what you've done is you've
owned the light parts of you and the dark parts.
The ego in the shadow have been unified, and integrated.
And then you are free to act naturally, spontaneously, without
guilt or shame. Your actions are not good or bad.
You yourself are not a good or bad person, that
itself is an identity, that's an ego thing, to consider
yourself a good or a bad person. You're none of
those in reality, what you do is you transcend the
entire paradigm of good and bad. And you start to
see that this is a childish, immature game that you
play. And that it's time to put the game to
an end. And when you do that, you become an
emotionally mature adult. And then true morality comes effortlessly to
you. Pretty cool. So let's discuss true morality, or what
I call transcendent morality. For people who have been moralizing
themselves, their whole lives, this is a very counterintuitive notion.
It's a very unorthodox and a very threatening notion. Because
it's extremely radical. It's almost the exact opposite of everything
you think morality is. And by the way, what's really
fascinating about this, the whole irony of this is that
all religious morality, old traditional morality, is based and derived
from transcendent morality. So everything that Jesus taught that the
Buddha taught that Muhammad taught, that Moses or Abraham taught,
all these things, you know, the rules that they set
down, these rules were sort of designed for the unconscious
masses. But, you know, these, these rules were set down
very early in history. And these leaders who set these
rules down, they actually had access to some degrees of
transcendent morality, which I'm going to discuss here in a
second. What that is, but they had access to that.
See, and what they did is they history didn't go
far enough, yet. They didn't have the luxury of seeing
the horrors that unconscious masses would produce with mechanical rules,
right? They didn't have the wisdom of history. We have
it now. So which is why I would say that
someone like Moses or Abraham or Muhammad or the Buddha
or Jesus if they lived in modern times, and They
would denounce every single rule and law that has been
attributed to them if they saw the horrors that it
would produce. So, here's what these sages and saints actually
tapped into. And you can tap into this to transcendent
morality is really cool thing. Transcendent morality, what it is,
is it's, it's just a pure consciousness of what is
true of reality. So it's not morality at all, there
is no morality, it's just being fully open to reality.
existentially, if you ever open yourself fully to reality, if
you become the ocean, rather than the hole in the
ocean, what will happen is that the universe, you'll see,
the universe is totally free, totally free. What there is
in the universe is not a set of rules and
laws, these are human contrivances. These are egoic inventions designed
to manipulate people. What there really is, is there just
is what is there is being, that's all there is,
all of reality consists of being. And of course, also
the source of being, which is nothingness. But that's another
discussion for another time. So we'll just say that all
there is as being right being is basically you might
call that experience, raw, direct experience as you perceive it.
Let's call that being for now, it's a bit simplistic,
but let's just call that being. So that's what there
really is. And this being is completely neutral, it's so
utterly neutral, and lawless, that you can't even call it
neutral, to call it neutral, would already be putting a
charge on it. Right? The universe is totally free. So
the universe does whatever it wants to do. And every
actor in the universe is basically doing whatever they want
to do. And there are no rules as to what
is good, or what is evil. And in fact, these
categories of good and evil do not exist, these are
conceptual creations of the ego, you actually had to create
good and evil, you had to create this, when you
were a small child, this concept had to enter into
your mind. You created it, largely unconsciously, because you didn't
know what the hell you were doing. And it was
useful to you at the time. So you created it
because it served a certain utility for you. Right, but
the problem with fictions is the same problem as with
lies, you know, lies always come back to haunt you.
And so do fictions, and so do all your mental
creations. And the problem is, is that you've fragmented, like
I said, this unity when you realize this, and you
take efforts to stop doing that, and then you actually
become one with the unity of the universe as it
is, then what you realize is that there are no
shoulds at all, at all, like really at all. What
is, is what should be Let me repeat that. What
is, is exactly what should be, or what should be,
is exactly what is. Now this is the most bitter
pill, one of the most bitter pills I'm ever going
to ask you to swallow. But it's also so fucking
powerful. If you grasp this, and you understand what I'm
saying here. This is actually a concept that I got
from Byron, Katie, very, very foundational concept. My next episode
is going to be about this, I'll tell you more
about this, and how your shoulds how the should statements
that you create your life, you know, I should do
this, I should do that that person shouldn't do this.
These are all should statements, right? Normally, what happens is
that we say, well, you know, people shouldn't steal money
from other people. People shouldn't be feeds. And then but
what, what reality tells us is that people actually are
thieves. And also we tell us as well, people shouldn't
be Nazis. You know, Nazis shouldn't exist, and, you know,
pedophiles and rapists shouldn't exist. And, you know, Republicans shouldn't
exist and Democrats shouldn't exist. And you know, children shouldn't
eat candy that shouldn't exist, and people shouldn't have too
much sex that shouldn't exist, and people shouldn't be so
materialistic that shouldn't exist. People should be more spiritual, so
more spirituality should exist. So you have all these fucking
fantasies about what should and shouldn't exist. Do you see
the problem is that what you think should or shouldn't
exist has no fucking bearing on reality. Reality is, what
is it's what exists and what you feel should have
exist or shouldn't exist, is your own fucking problem. So
all that needs to happen is you need to drop
your fantasies about what reality should be like. And then
there are no more problems. And I mean this in
all of its ramifications in a very broad, very radical
sense. So I literally mean that there should be rape
and murder, and there should be pedophiles, and there should
be Nazis and there should be communists, and there should
be terrorists. And there should be all of this. Why?
Because they exist. When they stop existing, and they might,
we might reach a point in 10,000 years, where these
things no longer exists. If that happens, then that's what
should be at that time. Not now, at that time,
when it happens, but right now, if we have murderers,
and rapists and pedophiles and terrorists, that's what should be.
It's only the egos arrogance, that has the goal, to
say of reality. No, you know what, you know, you
know, wait a minute, let's stop all of the fucking
functioning of the whole universe. Because I am offended by
a pedophile. That's the that's the egos arrogance, right. So
to get to transcendent morality, what has to happen is
you have to let go surrender to what's actually real,
not to what you want, not to what you think
would be best for you or your loved ones or
humanity. But for what's actually real. You it's very simple,
but it's also very radical. Right? You just have to
come to this realization at some point where you notice
that Holy fuck, reality is exactly how it should be.
And when you can grasp that, that's when moralizing stops,
and transcendent morality begins. But that's a difficult place to
get to. Because one of the things you have to
recognize, to get to this place is that you can't
judge anyone anymore. If you ever accept and grasp what
I'm telling you, and it's not just something you accept
or believe, is something you have to grasp, you have
to see that this is real, that is true. You
cannot believe this, you have to see it to believe
it. It's unbelievable. But if you actually see it and
grasp it, what you'll discover is that shit, you can't
judge anyone anymore. You can't ever point your finger at
anyone anymore. Ever, no matter how evil you might want
them to be. You cannot look at a terrorist and
call him evil anymore. You can't. It's just like, it's,
it's, it's preposterous at that point. Right? Because clearly you're
looking at terrorists. I mean, he's real. He's right there,
he's chopping someone's head off. So you're looking at it.
So I mean, it's fucking real. So your only option
is to deny that you're either going to accept that
are you going to deny that now if you deny
it, you have to work a lot, you're gonna have
to bend over backwards to deny that you're gonna have
to do all sorts of mental gymnastics and rationalizations and
theories and cosmologies and religious scriptures that have to be
brought in and justifications and this and that, the whole
thing is gonna have you built up. And what you're
doing is you're just, you're digging a hole in the
middle of a fucking ocean. And the water's just going
to come and crash and collapse that thing. Because you're
fighting against reality. Your girl also have to admit that
there's no free will you understand this? There is no
free will. You got to admit that. Because if reality
is exactly as it should be, reality is one, one
unified flow. There's no, there's no possibility of any other
possibility of reality. Do you see this? It's not like,
oh, well, you know, we could live in a reality
where there were no terrorists. No, we couldn't. There's only
one reality. What you're talking about is a fantasy, not
a reality. Or you could say, well, I can imagine
a reality where I woke up yesterday, on time instead
of 10 minutes late. No, that's a fucking fantasy. That's
a fantasy. The reality is that you woke up 10
minutes late. And that's exactly what is and that's exactly
what should have been. Why? Because it happened. And there's
no alternate universes here. There's no Altar. The possibilities, what
reality is, in this exact moment is all that he
could ever have been. There is no other possibilities. That's
what total surrender of the Ego means. The whole purpose
of fighting to protect your ego is to maintain a
sense of limited control and freewill over reality, you see
this, that's the whole function of the illusion of the
ego is that you could say, Ah, but if I,
you know, if I just was a little bit more
motivated, if I were a little bit harder, I, you
know, I'd have a little bit more money in my
bank account, or I would have woken up on time
or, you know, if I was just a little bit
more religious than maybe I wouldn't have had sex with
that guy at the bar last night. The ego fights
for control over something, it has zero control over. And
that's where most of your suffering comes from. That's why
you're stressed. That's why you're guilty. That's why you're suffering.
That's why you're a victim. Is a very counterintuitive thing.
Because when people hear about this, they say, well, Leo,
so you're telling me to just be a victim of
life. It's like anything goes now anything goes and just
like, What, I can't do anything, you're telling me? How
can I even do personal development now. You can still
do everything. But whatever you do, whatever it is, whether
you do it or don't, it's how it should have
been. Right? And you're not really doing it. The whole
universe is doing it. It's doing you you're not doing
it. When you realize that what will happen is that
you'll have true compassion for people. Not just people but
animals, everything, everything. Because what happens when you melt the
ego into reality, everything becomes unified, is that there's just
universal all and appreciation for reality as it is, you
love reality so much that you see that what life
is is just reality loving itself. This is called universal
or divine love. This is what the religious scriptures talk
about as God's divine love this is it. This is
it. God is the universe. If you don't like the
label God and your scientifically minded person, call it fucking
nature. Call it universe call it quarks call it atoms,
it doesn't matter what you call it. What you're experiencing
right now is it? Not some bearded man and clouds
kind of deal. That's a fantasy. What's happening right now,
as I'm speaking to you, this is reality. You're in
it right now. You're conscious? This is it? Now the
question is, are you going to love it? Are you
gonna hate it? Are you going to resist it? Are
you going to flow with it and surrender to it?
Are you going to be reality working with itself? Or
are you going to be the whole reality struggling against
itself? See, you might think that by giving up the
notion of free will, that this constrains you and takes
away all your freedom. Actually the exact opposite. Right now
you're constrained, you're constrained by this fruitless struggle for control
over something you have no control over. That's a recipe
for hell. And there's no freedom in that. What I'm
speaking about here is a complete paradigm shift a radical
freedom, totally radical freedom because there are no more rules.
That means anything goes anything you can go until your
neighbor if you want to anything fucking goes. And that's
so radical. That if you've been moralizing your whole life,
this is like poison to you this total poison, you're
probably calling me a devil right now. That's interesting, because
you know, mystics the people who have transcendent realities are
called mystics or saints or sages, these people throughout history,
they have been demonized and burned at the cross or
at the stake, or stoned to death or exiled out
of town. Why? Because of this. Why do you think
Jesus was nailed to fucking cross? Why was Muhammad's tribe
fighting with all the nearby neighboring tribes who tried to
kill them? Because of this, because of this. What religious
morality is is an aping of transcendent morality, it's an
aping. So when you're acting Moral, you're acting. True morality
is no morality. Now that's radical, that think about how
much responsibility that takes so much fucking responsibility, you have
to be conscious every second of your life. In that
case, because you have total freedom to do whatever you
want, you can go murder your children, there is no
buddy stopping you. And the desire to have somebody or
some thing Stop you is what an unconscious undeveloped immature
ego needs. See the immature ego reasons like this, it
says, Well, if there's no rules, stopping people from murdering
each other, then we're gonna go all murder each other.
And there's going to be anarchy. Yes, if you assume
that everyone is deeply unconscious, and are totally selfish bastards,
then yes, that will happen. So for unconscious people, they
need mechanical rules. In the same way that a herd
of cattle needs to be corralled by cowboys. And by
fences and posts and barbed wire. There might be usefulness
to that, if you're very, very unconscious. But if you're
watching my content, then probably you're a bit more conscious
than the average person. And also probably you're interested in
developing your consciousness a little bit more. And maybe you
even want to get to this transcendent morality stage, maybe
you actually want to tap into some of the higher
wisdom that sages and saints have taught throughout human history.
Maybe you want to tap into that maybe you care
about self actualizing. If you care about reality and truth,
in which case, you're going to be raising your consciousness,
and which case you're gonna be taking full responsibility for
your life anyways. And for the conscious person, they don't
need a rule. I don't need a rule not to
kill my children. Oh, or I don't even need a
rule not to kill someone who's stolen from me. I
don't need a rule for that. In fact, it's, it's
funny, you know, sometimes people will leave me comment and
be like, well, you know, but what's going to happen
without rules Leo. And you know, you're talking about you
know, dropping the ego and, and becoming this kind of
ascetic living this aesthetic minimalistic lifestyle, you know, what's gonna
happen, what's gonna happen to society, you know, what's gonna
happen to people doing evil stuff, and you know, all
these rules are gonna get broken. I'll just be very
honest with you. Since I was like, even before a
teenager, I had no morality. And I have no morality
now. I have nothing that I hold as sacred. There
is no belief or rule that I hold as sacred.
And in that time, you know, from being a young
teenager through my 20s and now into my 30s. I'm
not saying this is like some kind of self righteous
tooting my own horn, but I'm just saying that I'm
more moral and ethical than almost anyone that I'll meet.
And I have no fucking morality. Okay, if you go
into my mind, there are no, I mean, I do
moralize to myself. But I mean, like, I don't have
strict rules for like, I shouldn't murder somebody, or I
shouldn't steal somebody or shouldn't rape somebody, or I shouldn't
rip somebody off. Or I shouldn't lie to somebody. I
don't have those kinds of rules. I mean, I still
moralize to myself. I have a bunch of shoulds statements.
I'm working on those right? I'm working on that stuff.
I'm kind of eating my own dog food here. I'm
taking my own advice. All the advice I'm telling you
here I'm using myself. But I don't have rules for
like he's very severe things that I can't I don't
know, I don't have the 10 commandments in my mind.
Nor do I need it. I don't need it. It's
so much more freeing to be without it. And I
never have the temptation to rape somebody or to murder
somebody this this never comes to me. Not only that,
at this point, you know, I don't even get angry
at people like I don't even get angry at people
like something very radical would have like very severe would
have to happen for me to really get angry at
somebody. Whereas you know, the average person gets angry on
on the drop of a fucking dime. You know, I
see people I drive with friends or other people sometimes
in traffic, and I see them get pissed off at
fucking traffic at traffic. So, so yeah, this whole notion
that you need morality and a firm set of rules
to tell you to live some way and you know,
to keep keep evil at bay, this is this is
preposterous. This is what an immature, childish mind needs. Now,
you might wonder why then Leo, is this stuff not
more widespread? What you're talking about why is it not,
you know, being shouted from the rooftops? Why isn't everyone
following this kind of transcendent morality? The reason is, because
this requires massive development of consciousness, you need to see
reality for what it is. This is not a belief
systems, it's not a another set of rules. There's not
a dogma, you don't just take what I told you
and say, okay, so Leo told me now that I
shouldn't do this, and I shouldn't do, don't turn into
another set of rules. This takes massive self actualization work
years of a decades of it will take decades to
really embody this. So that's why it's not very widespread.
It's also incredibly threatening to the ego. credibly threatening, it's
incredibly counterintuitive. It requires a full commitment to truth and
reality versus your own self agenda, a full commitment which
is, by the way, true religion. That's what true religion
is, is this. But of course, like most things in
society, what is true, and what actually we have are
almost the opposite. Right? So religious people are the exact
opposite of truly religious. And another reason it's not more
widespread is because it's not politically viable. Could you imagine
someone in a, in a public political position coming out
with this kind of view, they would get crucified. Three
to 500 years ago, if I serve what I'm saying,
Now, I would have been burned at the stake, like
literally, right. So it's only by virtue of the fact
that we're living in a 21st century that that's even
possible. That's, if I said this, even 50 years ago,
I probably would have been called communist and fucking put
in jail. And all my videos would be taken down.
And like, it would just be the end of it,
right? The end of it. So you got to realize
that our society is not as advanced as you think
it is. So don't expect the things that I tell
you some of the deepest things I tell you, they
will not be reflected in mainstream society. In fact, it'll
be the opposite, the things I tell you will be
the exact opposite of what you see promoted in mainstream
society. Because this shit is scary. This shit is very
threatening. Now, let me just tackle a couple of final
objections. And then we'll wrap this up. So one very
common objection is something like but Leo, you know, you've
opened Pandora's box here. What is going to guarantee that
people do not commit evil under this system that you're
advocating? And the answer is nothing. Nothing will guarantee it.
But also recognize that nothing guarantees that people don't commit
evil anyways. And in fact, the more that you moralize
and preach, the more you embolden evil, this thing you
call evil, because the way to destroy evil is not
by fighting it. But by integrating it. A great quote
that I love is love your sins to death. That's
what's truly religious is to love your sins to death,
not to demonize your sins and to reject them. Because
the more you reject them, the more sinful you will
be when you love them to death. Eventually, you reach
the point where there are no more since there's only
love. So, again, very counterintuitively, in sort of paradoxically, integrating
evil. Integrating your shadow is the best strategy to minimize
evil if that's what your main concern is here. But
also, more fundamentally recognize that the thing you call evil
this thing is just it doesn't exist. It's an ego
judgment. It's pure arrogance to call something evil is pure
fucking arrogance, arrogance and delusion, there is no such thing.
Your mind creates it as a mental label. What evil
is the existential reality of evil is a thought that's
what literally evil is a thought. In your mind, not
out in the real world. And then another objection, you
might have some like polio, but you know, wouldn't you
get upset if I wait until your whole family when
you get upset by that? Seems like you're being very
hypocritical here? And the answer is interesting, the answer is
both yes and no. So of course, you know, if
you come and do harm to me, or to someone
I care about, or to my business, shall we get,
of course, on some level, I'm gonna get upset by
that. Because you're kind of harming myself agenda. And, of
course, my ego doesn't want to be harmed. I'm not
saying I, you know, I'm perfect here. Don't take it
that way. Don't take this, what I'm saying don't take
this as another moralization, don't frame it that way. This
is, this has nothing to do with with moralization. So
yeah, of course, I would be distraught to a certain
extent, but also, and this, this here now is going
to be a true measure of my emotional maturity and
development. My self actualization is the degree to which I
won't get distraught when you are me? Because and I
don't know, you know, I haven't put this to the
test. If someone killed my whole family, I don't know
how I feel about it. But I think I can.
I'm at the point now, trying to be accurate. I'm
at the point now where yes, I would be distressed.
And of course, I would have negative emotions and stuff.
But I wouldn't, I wouldn't be at the point where
I would be like demonizing that person. Right? I would
see this as a function of the entire motion of
the universe. And so the mature attitude would be, because
it is, that's how it shouldn't be. Now, that doesn't
mean I'm gonna be happy about it. But I don't
think I would be like, Oh, that person is evil.
And you know, he shouldn't have done that and all
that stuff. I'd like to think that I would be
that way. And if I can't be that way, right
now, because you know, I'm not perfect. I'm far from
perfect. I will get to that point. I don't know
how long will take me, maybe it'll take me a
couple of years, maybe five years, maybe 10 years. But
within 10 years, I could probably get to that point,
and I will find still alive. Just all I need
is just time to develop myself. Because every, every week,
every month, I'm growing by leaps and bounds by taking
my own advice. You think this should I talk about?
It's just for you know, it's mostly for me. It's
not for you, I'm, I'm doing this out of selfish
motive. So, so yeah, that's actually a very good litmus
test, to see how developed you are is, you know,
when someone really does harm to you, how accepting of
it are you? How loving of it are you? That's
a really good test. Really tough test, right? It really
means that you've grown yourself if you can pass such
a test. So in conclusion, my claim here is that
traditional morality is based on neurosis and that it does
more harm to us and good. So you've come to
the point hopefully in your life, that you are ready
to let go. And you're ready to become fully conscious.
And you're ready to open your mind to some radical
new counterintuitive, paradoxical seeming possibilities. And you recognize that what
has gotten you here will not get you there. What
has gotten you to your level of success now is
not going to be the same paradigm that will take
you to the self actualized life, you need to change
paradigms. And a lot of times changing paradigms is scary,
because it feels like you're taking a step backwards. And
yeah, you know, for a few months for a year,
maybe even it'll feel like a step backwards. But then
you'll see that it was a smart decision. The self
actualized person is at the same time, the most moral
and the least moral. Now, that's a paradox for you
to ponder. Think about how truly weak your morality is.
If you need a rule, or an external authority, or
God or the Bible, or some social contract or even
a principle, a logical reasonable principle like a Conte and
fucking principle, if you need something like that, to be
moral, how weak is your morality, really? Ask yourself that.
The true source of morality is reality. It's unconditional love
for absolutely everything, with no exceptions. And no arrogance from
yourself. All right, I'm signing off. Go ahead, please click

the self actualization journey. What's gonna come next week, I
think is I'm going to release a episode that's going
to fall be a follow up to this one, which
is going to specifically talk about how to take what
I talked about here, because here it was kind of,
I was pretty abstract and kind of lofty, you know,
to be me the very big picture, I'm going to
talk about how your should statements, how your practical moralizing
is creating guilt, shame and self hatred. And that's going
to be very practical episode was going to take everything
we talked about here and kind of be a part
two to that. And it's going to show you how
to implement it. And this one change right here could
be a significant significant change to the quality of your
life. This is such a huge such a foundational such
an important topic, and I haven't really covered it before.
