            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/GPPdWfoeGbs' target='_blank'>Curing Perfectionism - How To Stop Being A Perfectionist</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's realization towards his perfectionism</b>: Leo shares a significant personal development realization acquired during an enlightenment retreat. He became acutely aware of his persistent hypercritical nature and its connection to his perfectionism. This hypercritical tendency, which he sees threaded throughout his whole life, makes him critically observant of people, objects, situations and emotions. It reduces his joy, wastes mental energy, distracts him from essential matters, and impedes his self-actualization progress. 
</li><li><b>Perfectionism as an obstacle to success</b>: Leo identifies perfectionism as an anti-mastery mindset. Rather than focusing on the process, which is crucial to self-actualization, perfectionists overly emphasize the results. Due to their inherent demand for everything to be perfect in the initial stages, perfectionists may start procrastinating and abstain from starting or completing situations or projects. Such a mindset, Leo argues, hinders success and resembles an inability to accept reality, with a constant disappointment and quest for perfection robbing them of happiness. 
</li><li><b>Maximizers vs. Satisficers</b>: Drawing from Barry Schwartz's book "The Paradox of Choice," Leo contrasts Maximizers (or perfectionists) who extensively scrutinize and compare before choosing, constantly striving for the best, with Satisficers who quickly hone down options and choose based on simple satisfaction or contentment. Despite the initial assumption that Maximizers possess a more potential for happiness due to their detailed choices, they often end up unsatisfied due to never finding the 'perfect' choice. In contrast, Satisficers find happiness through acceptance and contentment with their choices. 
</li><li><b>An alternative approach to overcome perfectionism</b>: Leo implies that the real way towards happiness and self-actualization involves cultivating acceptance, even if it seems counterintuitive at first. When this perspective was brought up with him a couple of years ago, he had dismissed acceptance as a hippy notion. However, through introspection during his retreat, he understood that he won't attain happiness with his hypercritical posture. Oblivious to this, one keeps on forcing a square peg into a round hole, which never works. Leo mentions a quiz at the end of his video to help viewers determine if they're perfectionists.
</li><li><b>Realization About Perfectionism As Procrastination</b>: Leo identifies perfectionism as a subtle form of procrastination, where time spent being hypercritical could instead be used toward fulfilling life purposes. He reveals that this type of procrastination holds back personal progress by robbing time and energy needed to accomplish dreams.
</li><li><b>Misconception about Perfectionism and Excellence</b>: Leo dismantles the common belief that perfectionism and excellence are synonymous, arguing that the neurotic motivation from perfectionism may lead to initial success but is an obstacle to reaching full potential. 
</li><li><b>Shift from Perfectionism to Mastery Process</b>: Leo advocates for a shift from perfectionism (an obsession with outcomes) to a mastery process in our work, which emphasizes on enjoying the creation process, even its imperfect parts. This kind of shift can lead to a more productive and enjoyable life experience.
</li><li><b>Connection Between Self-Criticism and Criticizing Others</b>: Leo notes that a critical attitude towards others is often mirrored in self-criticism. He proposes that perfectionists not only critically assess the world around them but also berate themselves internally, leading to self-hatred and guilt. 
</li><li><b>Solution to Perfectionism</b>: To overcome perfectionism, Leo suggests cultivating awareness about the damage it causes and recognizing the potential to reach a higher level of life satisfaction by releasing this 'parking brake'. He emphasizes letting go of the faulty mindset and neurotic behaviors serving as obstacles.
</li><li><b>Realization of Perfectionism's Impact</b>: Leo emphasizes recognizing the extent of perfectionism's negative impacts on happiness and fulfillment. Take the perfectionism quiz and reflect on pervasive self-criticism. 
</li><li><b>Retraining the Mental Filter</b>: Leo suggests reframing your thought patterns. Replace criticism with acceptance and gratitude, accepting reality as it is, instead of being stuck with unrealistic standards.  
</li><li><b>Criticism Awareness Exercise</b>: He proposes a 30-day no criticism challenge involving wearing a rubber band around the wrist. This will remind you whenever you criticize, to replace it with acceptance by snapping the band and reaffirm the mantra, "When I criticize, I rob myself of my future."
</li><li><b>Studying Self-Actualization</b>: Leo stresses the practical importance of learning self-actualization concepts, which can influence thought patterns, moods, and daily habits. The understanding can lead to significant and exponential rewards, despite the challenging nature of the journey.
</li><li><b>Significance of Perseverance</b>: Staying committed is crucial as you start slow and build momentum. Actualized.org's mission is to help viewers stay on track for long-term self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Invitation to join the Journey</b>: Leo invites viewers to join him on the self-actualization journey, emphasizing the profound transformative potential that commitment and consistency bring.
