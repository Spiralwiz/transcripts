hey what's up this is Leo for actualize that already
and in this video what I want to talk about
is the idea of getting advice and this is an
interesting topic because I've always been fascinated about this idea
of advice being important and advice being something that you
can get a lot from from in your life and
it's a good way of improving your life but there's
also this problem with getting advice especially giving advice to
other people and there's also challenges to giving advice to
yourself but the challenge of giving advice to other people
is that a lot of times I'll see people trying
to give advice to others and it not registering in
fact it that almost backfiring so what's a good example
of this well for example a parent giving advice to
a child a lot of times what I'll see kind
of the the standard naive tendency is to be able
to say well I know what's best for that person
because I have more experience than they do and so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to give them
some advice and then you share that advice and you
see that it's not really working and so what you
tend to do is you're like okay well I'm gonna
get even more Stern with the advice it's like it's
they're not hearing it it's not registering so I'm gonna
even give that advice in a stronger way I'm gonna
feel I can really jam that advice down their throat
and when you do that you can almost see even
how to predict what's gonna happen is that there's almost
like a rebellion that happens there there's a tendency to
not want to take that advice or to take that
advice for granted I think what's important here is and
this especially important video for parents is that you have
to realize that it's one thing to understand something logically
it's a totally different thing to really integrate it and
understand it emotionally and so there's that aspect that you're
forgetting when you're trying to dram advice down someone's throat
when you're trying to give someone advice first of all
there's a couple of problems here one problem is that
their values are not identical to your values so and
there there could be quite a big disparity between the
values of a person you give an advice to and
your own values and their situation in your situation so
what you feel as being the right advice for them
might not actually be very good advice because advice is
not applicable at the same time to everybody there's specific
points in your life where certain advice is good and
certain advice is not good and there's specific advice that's
good for some people that's not good for other people
so just assuming that everyone has the same values as
you and wants the same things it wants to approach
things in the same way and learn in the same
fashion that you learned is already problem that person you're
giving advice to might be on a different wavelength and
that advice just might not register the other challenge here
is that you have to really take to heart and
think back and ask yourself how did you learn these
lessons right because there's a tendency especially for parents to
say well I struggled you know I had to make
these horrible mistakes I had to go through years of
pain and struggle to learn this valuable lesson and now
what I want to do is I want to kind
of distill that lesson after all that knowledge and I
want to hand down what kids know I said look
I spent I went through a horrible divorce I went
through through a horrible job I went through horrible medical
problems I went through through all these scenarios and I
learned these valuable lessons and I have these regrets I
you know if I knew everything that I know that
I know now I would have handled situations totally differently
and so why should I have why should I watch
my kid go through the same problems I don't want
you to go through the same pains so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna share these stories
with you and I'm gonna distill these golden nuggets and
hand them down to you and then what you're gonna
do is you gonna take that golden nugget and you're
gonna you're gonna say yeah that's that's an amazing insight
and then you're gonna go off and you're gonna live
your life perfectly without having to go through all these
challenges and these roadblocks that I went through and that
sounds really good the intention behind that is great except
the problem is that when you're when you're using that
kind of strategy what you're forgetting is that the way
that you learned those lessons is through the struggle and
your discounting and under estimating how important and how critical
that struggle was to you internalizing those lessons because those
lessons if you feel a need to really share those
lessons with others those are probably not lessons that you
learn in a book those are lessons that you got
because you went through hard knocks in your life an
experience has really emotionalized those lessons for you because what
happened was that you felt extreme pain or extreme pleasure
different sent a sense of joy elation when you went
through some of these through some of these experiences and
what that literally get is it seared it seared the
lessons in your brain whereas now if you take that
and you just take the logical bits of that lesson
and you hand it down to somebody it's not going
to be the same thing so you have to really
appreciate how much the experience of it and especially the
hard struggle how important that was to learning the lesson
and you know the best lessons in life as the
old saw goes our learned through experience they're not learned
through a book and they're not even learned from from
your religious leaders or from your parents or from your
teachers or from your mentors you can get some value
from that kind of advice but it's not going to
be nearly as powerful as when it's internalized and I
think that parents and other people that are trying to
give advice to other people need to recognize this really
important fact I don't person as myself as being a
life coach and being a student of personal development and
having read you know a literally hundreds of books and
got an expensive seminars on this stuff it's very easy
for me to see what somebody's doing in their life
and I had this tendency to say well you know
I've studied this stuff I know that you can get
a lot better result if you just did X or
he just did Y if you just tweaked your approach
this way and so there's a real drive on a
tendency and drive on my part to just give advice
to people and a lot of times that advice is
really good but I also have to recognize that just
because it is objectively good advice and the research supports
and the books supported my own experience supports it and
the experience my clients support it that doesn't mean that
this is the right advice for this person and doesn't
mean it's the right time for this person to hear
this advice and it also doesn't mean that I can
shortcut their learning process right that's the most important thing
is that you have to realize that some people just
need to struggle through things to really understand to internalize
them you can't just hand hand down advice and expect
it to be registered at the same level that it
did to you because of your experiences and so when
I think about that when I reflect on that I
I tend to calm down and say you know what
I don't need to be giving advice all the time
I can ask prodding questions that's what coaches tended to
do it's a tends to be a better approaches to
ask deep questions that make the other person think more
than just hand them down advice and a list of
things to do because when you ask them questions that
gets them thinking that gets them reevaluating what they're doing
with their life and in that case it tends to
be a better way to create a change because when
the person understands for themselves and generates the answer for
themselves they're more invested in it they have the motivation
to follow up with it to take action on it
rather than when you handed that thing down to them
so I think it's really important to watch out for
this this tendency to want to shortcut people people's learning
curves and to say that you don't want people to
struggle because the struggle is important it's a big part
of life and the way that we become rounded human
beings the way that we really learn and we gain
wisdom is by going through the struggle of life that's
what's really really rewarding so obviously that doesn't mean that
you want to let people do you know commit horrible
mistakes and do things that would that would really damage
them but as long as you're protecting your friends and
and your children or people that you're mentoring as long
as you're protecting them from like making just really stupid
decisions that are that have very drastic consequences then you
want to kind of give them the freedom to go
around there and explore for themselves and even when you
see that they're going down the wrong path maybe you
can question them on a little bit get them to
think about it because sometimes people go down the wrong
path because they're not even conscious they don't even know
what they're doing but a lot of times people just
choose to go down a path because they genuinely believe
that it's right for them and maybe it even is
at the time they need to explore they need to
see if it fits with them and so if that's
the case let them a little bit of that exploring
don't feel like you need to stop them and impart
your wisdom on to them let them do that exploring
and trust that they have resourcefulness and that they have
they have intellect and that they're gonna be able to
realize that if something is not working for them in
the long run I'm going to change their approach and
then that maybe they'll come back to you and say
you know what I've really gone down this path that
I thought would work well for me but it hasn't
and maybe you could share now some of your advice
about how you also struggle through the same problem and
and made it work for you and that is gonna
help because then you're not taking that kind of frame
where you're saying well I told you so you don't
want to you don't wanna really do that what you
want to do is you want to say yeah you
know what I knew that you were kind of going
down the wrong path but I didn't want to be
pushy about it because I realized that it's important for
you to to try out and make errors and that
errors are not bad errors are ways that we learn
this is how we build wisdom this is how we
build experience and so those are all valuable lessons that
you learn as you're going through life so if you
are someone who is very advice-giving if you are someone
who is working in advice-giving profession or if you have
children or if you have even parents little older parents
that you're getting advice to realize how advice works realize
that you have this tendency to want to shortcut people's
learning curves and then that's not always the best thing
all right so this is going to be it for
this video as always I look forward to your comments
hearing from you contact me let me know what kind
of content you like to you'd like me to make
for you and also let me know what you think
about this stuff and any question that you have and
what your experiences are with giving advice
