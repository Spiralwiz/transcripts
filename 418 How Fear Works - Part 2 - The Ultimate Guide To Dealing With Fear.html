            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/3ouiCKtqbCo' target='_blank'>How Fear Works - Part 2 - The Ultimate Guide To Dealing With Fear</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Fear is necessary for survival</b>: Leo emphasizes that fear is a crucial part of survival and isn't inherently bad or evil. They also highlight that everything one fears is rooted in survival. 
</li><li><b>Fear is subjective</b>: Based on environment, upbringing, genetics, and numerous other factors, what one person fears can be vastly different from another. Leo points out that fear is largely relative to what one identifies with and is inherently self-biased. 
</li><li><b>Fear influences outlook</b>: Leo demonstrates how fear shapes personal perspectives using their grandmother's irrational fear of a rubber snake toy. They argue that fear is relative and often linked to individual imagination or perceived threats.
</li><li><b>All fear stems from a fear of ones self</b>: Leo posits that all fear, at its core, is fear of oneself. They clarify this seemingly counterintuitive concept by elaborating that the 'self' feared is not just the individual person, but the entire universe, since the ultimate 'self' is understood to be consciousness manifesting as the entire universe. 
</li><li><b>Fear arises because consciousness is infinite</b>: Since consciousness embodies everything, including everything one dislikes or fears, Leo argues that consciousness is ultimately afraid of itself and its infinite scope.
</li><li><b>Lifes challenge is identifying oneself as a limited creature</b>: Leo suggests that the difficulty of life lies in breaking free from limited identification and expanding one's understanding of oneself as more than just a fragile human. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming fear as growth</b>: Leo suggests that as a person evolves and matures, they are able to overcome different fears, thereby illustrating growth in their consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Ultimate fear due to infinite consciousness</b>: Wrapping up their discussion on the nature of fear, Leo concludes that one's ultimate fear stems from an awareness of infinite consciousness, as it includes everything that a person fears or dislikes within reality. They propose that to conquer fear, one must be willing to confront their infinite scope.
</li><li><b>Fear and Acceptance of Self</b>: Fear dissipates as one's identity begins to expand and accept more of reality as it is, rather than rejecting it. This process involves moving from a limited perspective to an unlimited one, acknowledging that oneself is the entire infinite universe. When the distinction between self and other disappears, all fear vanishes. However, this requires a drastically expanded, non-dual state of consciousness and significant inner work to attain. 
</li><li><b>God, Fearlessness, and Consciousness</b>: God is depicted as the total absence of fear, representing complete self-acceptance, truth, freedom, and peace. Humanity is essentially consciousness that hasn't fully accepted itself. All fear arises from the creation of an imaginary boundary between self and other. Realizing that one is God involves dissolving this boundary, a process that tends to frighten many people.
</li><li><b>Fear and Denial of True Nature</b>: Fear stems from the denial and resistance of one's true nature  that is, the infinite universe, which includes all elements initially perceived as threatening or 'other.' Most people are scared to accept their true nature due to its enormity and the responsibilities it holds. They prefer to separate the concepts of self and other, which leads to the manifestation of fear.
</li><li><b>Embracing One's True Nature</b>: Embracing one's true nature involves expanding the sense of self. The expansion process reduces fear until a point is reached where the difference between self and other collapses completely, eliminating all fear. However, this state is quite rare, and most people resist it due to the fear of realizing their true nature.
</li><li><b>Improvement over Perfection</b>: Even if total fearlessness is not attained, significant improvements can be made in managing and reducing fear. This process requires surrendering all desires and attachments and accepting the possibility of death. The journey of transcending fear is a daunting task, demanding complete self-surrender and decades of dedicated practice.
</li><li><b>Understanding Fear from a Realistic Perspective</b>: Attaining total fearlessness is highly challenging because any threat to what one perceives as important in life can trigger fear. Only those who completely surrender their life and desires, even going as far as to stop worrying about their survival and the survival of their loved ones, can hope to achieve this state. Hence, while such fearlessness is possible, it's considered a rare, radical transformation that few will choose or be able to accomplish.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's personal experience with fear</b>: Describes his own fears confirming that everyone is susceptible but also shares examples of states of consciousness where he transcended all fear, proving to him that fearlessness is possible. Leo is constantly working on himself and has noticed a decrease in his fear compared to previous years, making it a practical improvement.
</li><li><b>Transcending fear in aspects of life</b>: Highlights practical ways to become less fearful in relationships, career, and other day-to-day scenarios. Reducing specific fears can make a positive difference in one's life. However, it's important to distinguish between overcoming specific fears and transcending fear altogether. Squashing one fear at a time will not eliminate the general dynamic of fear in one's life. Eliminating fear as a whole requires existential work and surrendering to infinity as fear is infinite and always arises from new situations or concepts.
</li><li><b>Fear as a Feeling</b>: Clarifies that fear is a feeling distinct from other emotions and thoughts contribute to the creation of that feeling. Differentiates fear from other feelings such as anger and frustration that often get confused with fear.
</li><li><b>Truth behind fear</b>: Introduces the concept of absolute and relative truths in relation to fear. In the relative sense, fear can be justified and can indicate something harmful or dangerous. However, in the absolute sense, all fear is false and based on inaccurate perception. Fear can be justified or unjustified depending on the context and one's identity, giving an example of fear of invasion in different countries. Fear becomes unjustified from a spiritual perspective as it is relative to survival. To eliminate fear, one must let go of attachment to life.
</li><li><b>Dangerous to eliminate fear</b>: Addresses the question of danger in eliminating fear. Asserts that eliminating fear implies disregard for one's own life. To fully release fear necessitates acceptance of death and the letting go of one's attachment to living. Emphasizes that effective elimination of fear requires a radical acceptance of death and the surrender of claim to one's life. This is a massive step and typically considered by individuals pursuing spiritual work.
</li><li><b>Fear and survival</b>: Leo argues that fear isn't necessary for survival. People may think that without fear they can't protect themselves, but Leo suggests instead, consciousness, awareness, and wisdom can function as protective mechanisms. Wisdom and consciousness allow someone to avoid harmful situations without being terrified.
</li><li><b>Fear vs. caution</b>: Leo distinguishes between fear, which is the feeling of being afraid, and caution, which is simply awareness of potential harm. For instance, one can make a decision to use protection whilst camping or take other precautions without experiencing feelings of terror. 
</li><li><b>Consequence of fear elimination</b>: Leo is putting emphasis, that even if one is aiming to eliminate fear from their lives, this does not mean they have to physically die. Rather, they should be open to the idea of death. Leo insists that one's survival can be better protected by consciousness and wisdom rather than by fear. These more sophisticated protections can allow someone to avoid harms without being driven by terror.
</li><li><b>Turn fear into wisdom</b>: Leo discusses how turning fear into wisdom can safeguard an individual better than fear itself. Wisdom and consciousness lead to precautionary measures that anticipate potential dangers and obstacles. Examples given illustrate that dangerous situations can be avoided without the feeling of fear but with the conscious recognition of potential harm.
</li><li><b>Applications of caution</b>: Leo demonstrates the utility of applying caution in life and businesses. For example, creating a data backup system before starting a business due to the potential threat of data loss. This measure was taken not due to fear, but as a rational anticipation of potential obstacles.
</li><li><b>Distinction between fear and caution</b>: By sharing a personal experience of a camping trip in bear territory, Leo illustrates the difference between fear and caution. He points out that caution allowed him to prepare for potential dangers, such as bears, without necessarily experiencing crippling fear. This anecdote emphasizes that caution is a proactive measure to mitigate potential risks, whereas fear can be a crippling emotional response. A sense of caution, rather than fear, was what primarily guided his actions and preparations.
</li><li><b>Caution in practice</b>: Leo goes on to provide further examples of how cautious anticipation of potential obstacles or threats can be practically applied in various life scenarios, emphasizing that fear is not a necessary component in making protective decisions. This mindset, he suggests, is more effective and beneficial in the long run for survival and advancement.
</li><li><b>Understanding the difference between fear and caution</b>: Leo uses an anecdote about an encounter with a bear while tripping on LSD to distinguish between fear and caution. Caution represents the preparedness and proactive measures taken to prevent harm, while fear represents the emotion experienced in the moment. Being fearless does not mean discarding caution and becoming reckless, but rather means not letting fear dictate decisions and actions. Life presents many obstacles that should be considered seriously and cautiously.
</li><li><b>Religious perspective on fear and sin</b>: Religions that teach fear as a deterrent from sinning are criticized as corrupt, false, and projecting their own egotistical fear onto the concept of God. God, according to Leo, is love and acceptance and does not judge or hate, but rather embodies and forgives sin. When religious institutions or individuals project their judgement and hate onto God, they are said to be demonizing God and teaching a false, water-down version of divine love for the sake of simplicity and control.
</li><li><b>Scientific perspective on fear and objectivity</b>: Leo argues that fear also infiltrates the realm of science. Science is portrayed as permeated by fears of mysticism, God, falsehood, losing credibility, psychedelics, subjectivity, emotions, and irrationality. These fears, according to Leo, result from the scientist's commitment to their scientific identity and the urging to defend this identity from anything that threatens it. Leo also points out the tendency for scientists to deny these fears while portraying their reasoning as rational and objective.
</li><li><b>Techniques to overcome fear - Facing Fear Head-On</b>: The first strategy to overcome fear involves confronting and experiencing the fear directly, rather than seeking ways to avoid or alleviate the fear. Avoiding the fear deepens the fear itself, and in order to confront the fear, one must face the situation that causes fear.
</li><li><b>Techniques to overcome fear - Taking on Challenging Situations Proactively</b>: Leo recommends deliberately putting oneself in challenging situations. He states that comfort and complacency can lead to a lack of growth and that by pushing oneself out of the comfort zone, fears can be mitigated and personal strength can be built. This technique is about taking active steps to put oneself in unfamiliar or challenging circumstances to expand one's comfort zone and grow as a person.
</li><li><b>Bold decision making</b>: The video encourages making bold decisions and stepping out of your comfort zone to overcome fear. Examples offered include quitting a job to pursue a new business, committing to a relationship, or ending a dysfunctional one. Such bold decisions allow individuals to face their fears and boost self-esteem and confidence, which in turn reduce fear.
</li><li><b>Training and exposure</b>: Leo emphasizes continuous training and exposure as a method of overcoming fear. For example, if someone fears public speaking, Leo recommends joining organizations such as Toastmasters to practice and gain experience. Fear can diminish through frequent exposure to what frightens us.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness practice</b>: In addition to exposure, practicing mindfulness while confronting fears is recommended. This involves observing one's fear in the body, feeling it entirely, but carrying on with the challenging task. Through regular mindfulness practice, not only in moments of fear but also during ordinary body sensations, one can become more aware and less reactive to fear. 
</li><li><b>Fearless but not reckless</b>: Its important to distinguish being bold from being reckless. Bold decisions challenge comfort zones and promote growth, while reckless decisions lack consideration and can lead to regret or danger. 
</li><li><b>Public speaking fears</b>: Leo provides a specific recommendation for overcoming public speaking fears. He recommends joining Toastmasters, giving 20 speeches, but also practicing mindfulness during these speeches to significantly reduce fear. 
</li><li><b>Facing fear plus mindfulness</b>: Leo stresses that simply exposing oneself to fear isn't enough. Combining exposure with mindful practicefeeling the fear but continuing with the tasksignificantly enhances the fear overcoming process.
</li><li><b>The Practice of Mindfulness</b>: A significant practice in overcoming fear involves mindfulness, where one consistently focuses their attention on feelings within their body. This includes noting when the feeling of fear arises, where there is a resistance to this feeling, and allowing oneself to fully experience this fear. The aim is to gradually expose oneself to the feeling of fear, becoming more comfortable with it over time and ultimately, becoming less reactive to it. This requires a daily consistent practice over a long period.
</li><li><b>Being Totally Present</b>: Another way to manage fear is by being totally present in the moment when fear arises. This requires being mindful of how the mind tends to jump into the future, projecting bad images of what could potentially happen. Not thinking about what would happen in the future and grounding oneself in the present moment could eliminate negative emotions. However, this technique requires previous meditation practice and skills to be able to control active minds from projecting fearfully into the future.
</li><li><b>Use of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can also be an effective tool in confronting fear. They force an individual to face existential fears and as supported by scientific studies, they have been shown to help manage PTSD and end-of-life fears. These substances cause a change in consciousness, enabling individuals to confront their fears.
</li><li><b>Practicing Kriya Yoga</b>: Kriya Yoga, a meditative rather than physical yoga, helps to rewire the mind and the nervous system. This practice plays a significant role in dealing with fear.
</li><li><b>Contemplation using a Journal</b>: Contemplating on one's specific macro and micro fears using a journal could aid in understanding why these fears arise, their origins, their function in one's life, and how they connect back to one's identity and ego. This practice which should ideally be done daily allows for a deeper understanding and address of fear.
</li><li><b>Contemplation Alone is Insufficient for Overcoming Fear</b>: Leo Gura states that while contemplating your fear is essential, it isn't sufficient. Fear is too powerful to be simply thought or reasoned out of existence as fear precedes reasoning itself. Therefore, contemplation can help, but it is not the sole solution to overcoming fears.
</li><li><b>Sedona Method/Letting Go Technique for Fear Management</b>: An effective technique for managing fear is the Sedona Method, also known as the 'Letting Go' technique. This method involves acknowledging and feeling the fear and then consciously choosing to let it go. This technique should be practiced as regularly as possible, gradually transforming the individual's relationship with fear.
</li><li><b>Breathing as a Fear Management Technique</b>: Conscious breathing is another tool to alleviate fear. This method involves being aware of the body, noticing areas of tension and consciously choosing to relax and breathe deeply. Practicing mindful breathing can help reduce fear, anxiety, and other negative emotions.
</li><li><b>Visualization and Law of Attraction as Fear-Countering Techniques</b>: Visualization is a method of crowding out fear with positivity. By developing a positive vision for the future and dwelling on it, individuals can override fear and anxiety. Consistently visualizing a positive outcome can help one improve their situation.
</li><li><b>Daily Visualization and Positive Expectations</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of daily visualization to reinforce positivity and confidence, regardless of the situation. This technique is about programming oneself with empowering and positive ideas, thereby increasing chances of success.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Visualization</b>: Visualization does not guarantee desired outcomes but is useful in programming the mind with positivity and confidence. Regardless of the outcome, practicing daily visualization prepares the mind for success, thereby making the person more positive and confident.
</li><li><b>Practicing Love as Fear Combatant</b>: Leo Gura highlights the importance of consciously acting out of love as a means to combat fear. This involves active practices such as expressing gratitude and undertaking selfless acts of service. He asserts that expressing gratitude eliminates fear as it encourages a positive embrace of one's present circumstances in life. Engaging in selfless acts, such as assisting others or finding ways to improve mankind through one's life, work, or purpose also expresses love and counters fear.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Predicting Behavior Through Fears</b>: Leo emphasizes that understanding someone's fears permits an accurate prediction of their behavior. This understanding can be used in positive ways to enhance communication, build stronger relationships, and to construct effective business strategies that address common fears. However, Leo warns against exploiting these fears for personal gain as this can generate negative consequences, often described as bad karma.
</li><li><b>Business and Fear</b>: From a business perspective, Gura suggests that businesses are often solutions to common fears. Understanding the fears of clients or a target audience can lead to the development of effective products, technologies or solutions that address these fears.
</li><li><b>Understanding Fears and Building Rapport</b>: Asking individuals about their fears can give insight into their perspectives, enabling a deeper understanding of their decisions and behaviors. This understanding can be harnessed to build stronger relationships and effectively communicate solutions to their fears. However, Gura warns against using fear as a manipulation tool.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Positive Action Over Fear</b>: Gura concludes his talk emphasizing the importance of taking bold, fearless action in life. He identifies key areas where fear often inhibits action and challenges his listeners to face these fears and take continued, persistent action towards executing their plans or achieving their goals. He reminds listeners that while the journey to becoming fearless requires effort and dedication, the rewards are immeasurable and life-changing.
</li><li><b>Understanding Others' Fears</b>: The process of inquiring about and understanding the fears of others serves to expose the egoistic and limited nature of one's own fears. Understanding and dealing with fear is important in developing effective leadership skills.
</li><li><b>Fear of Own Infinite Scope</b>: Facing the fear of one's own infinite scope is a life-long process. Fear arises primarily from the realization of our vastness and the prospect of dissolving into infinite love, which threatens our limited egoistic identities.
</li><li><b>Importance of Fearlessness</b>: Fearlessness, synonymous with love, courage, and consciousness, is identified as the most critical quality needed to succeed in life. Fearlessness doesn't imply the absence of fear but rather the ability not to be dictated by fear.
</li><li><b>Overcome Fear Through Fearlessness</b>: Fearfulness is succumbing to fear and letting it dictate decisions. Fearlessness involves experiencing fear but not letting it influence choices . Examples given include starting a business despite fear or approaching a person one is attracted to despite feeling fearful.
</li><li><b>Daily Observation of Fear</b>: Observing daily how fear runs one's life and how it influences decisions is a critical practice. This practice needs to be done over a couple of years as it provides valuable insights into how fear operates on an existential level, which can be advantageous in all situations.
</li><li><b>Mastering Emotions</b>: Mastering emotions is identified as the hardest part of personal work and should be conducted simultaneously with awakening. This involves understanding and managing all emotions, not just fear, which remains a life-long process to be undertaken patiently but can yield significant results over time. 
</li><li><b>Long-Term Investment in Understanding Emotions</b>: Understanding and managing emotions should be seen as a long-term investment rather than a short-term goal. Emotions such as anger, jealousy, sadness, depression, etc., will be dealt with specifically over the future, with the realization that becoming conscious of and managing these emotions effectively is pivotal to living a fulfilling life.
