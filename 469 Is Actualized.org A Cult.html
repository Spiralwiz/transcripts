            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/pecdXcIu1ZQ' target='_blank'>Is Actualized.org A Cult</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Is Actualized.org a cult?</b>:
</li><li>- Leo Gura is often accused of being a cult leader by critics. However, he explains these accusations are often rooted in the content of his teachings, which can be seen as radical or contradictory to mainstream thought.
</li><li>- Gura acknowledges that this can generate cognitive dissonance for those who are uncomfortable with ideas that challenge their pre-existing beliefs or worldviews.
</li><li>- Despite this, Gura emphasizes that Actualized.org is not a cult, and he does not seek to indoctrinate individuals into a specific belief system. He is more focused on engaging in a meta-level exploration of the mind and its mechanisms, rather than promoting specific teachings or ideologies.
</li><li>- He warns that mind constructs and perceives its reality based on the belief system it holds as true and tends to reject opposing views.
</li><li>- However, he also notes that opening the mind to new perspectives has its challenges, especially if these perspectives threaten personal beliefs, comfort, or survival.
</li><li>- Gura argues that this closed-mindedness and defensiveness is a widespread phenomenon not limited to religious, spiritual, or atheistic belief systems, but is a general feature of the human mind.
</li><li>- A cult, according to Gura, prioritizes indoctrination, absolutism, and puts value in creating a reality bubble for acquiring control, money, power, and providing a sense of purpose. In contrast, Actualized.org promotes understanding, self-awareness, and freedom of thought. 
</li><li><b>On avoiding cult dynamics</b>: 
</li><li>- To reduce the risk of his teachings turning into a cult, Gura stresses the importance of adopting clean epistemology, which involves understanding and analyzing how beliefs and theories are developed.
</li><li>- He also intentionally avoids creating a hierarchical organization and maintains the authenticity of his work by only selling a book list and a single course.
</li><li>- Leo recognizes the risk of spiritual teachings turning into business leading to cult-like behavior and exploitation. 
</li><li><b>On addressing accusations of Actualized.org being a cult</b>: 
</li><li>- Gura acknowledges that he makes some radical claims that can make people uncomfortable or skeptical. However, these claims are often misunderstood or taken out of context, leading to misjudgments.
</li><li>- He urges critics and listeners to not settle on quick judgments and labels, encouraging them instead to genuinely explore and understand these new concepts and ideas. 
</li><li>- His teachings aim to reveal the relativity of perspectives, promoting the exploration of diverse ways of seeing reality, even those that might seem radical to mainstream society. 
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's assertions about his work</b>:
</li><li>- Leo clarifies that the main objective of his work is not to accrue power, wealth, or influence. Instead, it is to share his deep understandings and insights about reality.
</li><li>- Though he acknowledges that his open-mindedness is quite rare in society, he sees it as a resource and uses it to educate others through his YouTube channel.
</li><li>- He emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and awareness of epistemology, and cautions listeners against blindly subscribing to belief systems and ideologies, which can potentially lead to cult dynamics. 
</li><li>- He also asserts that the bigger problem lies in the human mind's limited understanding of its self-deception mechanisms, which often lead to pervasive cult psychology within society.
</li><li>- Leo aims to help individuals gain a clearer understanding of themselves, the world, and the way their minds function through his teachings.
</li><li><b> Accusations of Actualized.org being a cult</b>: Leo Gura highlights that accusations of Actualized.org as a cult are usually defense mechanisms. He reminds people to distinguish between genuine accusations and knee-jerk responses. He advises watching his series "Cult Psychology Parts 1 and 2" to help distinguish between actual cults and wrongly accused entities.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of a cult</b>: A cult is a hierarchical organization created to serve a charismatic narcissistic leader who is interested in sex, money, and power. Cults strive to recruit others into their pyramid-like structures, brainwashing and manipulating them into a specific worldview which benefits the cult leaders. Cults exploit people, convincing them to donate money, surrender power, and sometimes even change their sexual behaviors. 
</li><li><b>Effects of a cult</b>: Cults lead people away from truth, consciousness, and genuine love. Cults often portray themselves as the good side against the mainstream and manipulate their members through isolation from friends and family. Cult members will defend the cult passionately due to their brainwashed perception of the world.
</li><li><b>Comparison to Actualized.org</b>: Contrary to a cult's objectives, Actualized.org aims to help members have a clearer perception of reality than conventionally possible. They focus on helping people understand self-deception mechanisms and avoid unintentional self-deceit. While survival requires a basic degree of power, sex, and money, the primary goal of Actualized.org is not any of those. It's about sharing deep understanding gained through extensive contemplation of reality. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of epistemology</b>: Epistemology, the study of knowledge, is often overlooked by many. Its perception as a technical and less practical subject may deter some people. However, Actualized.org places great importance on this area because of its foundational role in understanding reality. 
</li><li><b>Contemplation of reality</b>: Leo Gura's teachings stem from his deep, constant contemplation of reality. He argues that anyone can do this but recognizes that interest or fear usually prevent most people. Leo maintains that his teachings don't rely on him as a person, but on the insights anyone could arrive at through relentless contemplation. 
</li><li><b>Issues of ideology and epistemology</b>: With a strong awareness of the problems around ideology and epistemology, Leo started Actualized.org to provide accessible self-help content. Although these subjects may be deemed as nerdy and irrelevant, Leo was teaching them from the beginning due to their importance in effective self-help and growth.
</li><li><b>Measures to prevent Actualized.org from turning into a cult</b>: Leo Gura explains he has taken measures to prevent Actualized.org from becoming a cult. He emphasizes the importance of teaching clear epistemology and self-awareness of self-deception mechanisms. Acknowledging how the collective human mind can easily fall into ideologies and how minds that lack understanding of themselves can behave like cults, Leo's work primarily aims to rectify this. He has chosen not to create a hierarchical structure or a business out of Actualized.org, refusing to sell products or create schemes for personal gain. Instead, he only offers a book list and a single course for sale, focusing on enhancing the understanding of self, reality, and relationships to the world. His ultimate goal is to enhance the collective understanding of humanity, reducing suffering caused by ignorance and deception.
</li><li><b>The widespread influence of unconscious minds</b>: Leo highlights the negative influence unconscious minds can have when they form collective groups. These groups can unconsciously exhibit cult-like behaviors, such as groupthink and paradigm lock. This can occur in various facets of society, including academia, science, medicine, government, families, and corporations. The endeavor of actualized.org is to address this by increasing self-awareness and understanding of these self-deceptive mechanisms. Leo has devoted his career to alleviating this widespread issue, understanding that this lack of clear perception of self, world, and relationships to the world, has been causing human problems such as conflict, suffering, ignorance for thousands of years.
</li><li><b>Self-deception and the collective illusion of reality</b>: Leo points out the deep-rooted difficulty humans face when trying to break away from collective illusions about reality. This is due to the survival-based game the collective human mind plays, constructing and preserving illusions as this protects personal comfort, survival, and the ability to fulfill both the basic and higher needs in life. The illusion of reality feeds not only our basic needs for physical survival but also our needs for human interaction, creativity and self-actualization. The process of breaking free from these constructed illusions and mechanisms can be highly uncomfortable and even threatening to personal survival.
</li><li><b>The persistent attachment to survival mechanisms and constructs</b>: Leo elaborates on the ways societal survival mechanisms keep people trapped within our collectively constructed illusions of reality. While it may seem feasible to see reality without these constructs, the practical implications of such a deconstruction can cause discomfort and pose a threat to survival. Convincing the majority of people to abandon their survival agendas and personal biases, rooted in different religious, scientific, academic, or skeptical paradigms, is challenging due to the inherent need for survival and comfort.
</li><li><b>The sacrifice of personal success to maintain the integrity of Actualized.org</b>: For Actualized.org, Leo has purposely chosen to forgo personal financial gain and success to prevent the organization from becoming a traditional hierarchical structure resembling a cult. Despite having the potential to capitalize on the platform's popularity through creating merchandise, launching courses, and starting affiliate programs, Leo has refrained from doing so. The sole offerings of Actualized.org are a book list and a single course, aimed at enhancing understanding and self-awareness without a profit-making agenda.
</li><li><b>The threat posed by survival biases and agendas on understanding truth</b>: Leo insists that researchers, scholars, and academics are often limited in their understanding and pursuit of truth due to their dependence on larger organizations that have survival agendas. He emphasizes that the biases and survival agendas of corporations and institutions bear heavy influence on individuals' perspectives and consequently, the collective understanding of truth. He urges listeners to seek sources of information that prioritize understanding, truth, consciousness, and love over survival, power, or money.
</li><li><b>Monetization and the danger of turning teachings into businesses</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes his deliberate choice to keep his work on Actualized.org wholly focused on delivering valuable content rather than morphing it into a standard, large-scale business model. He currently has no employees and only sells a single course, limiting the breadth of monetization to focus on producing substantive work. He is wary of the dangers of growing a large team that could inadvertently transform into a cult-like structure, hence consciously refraining from building an organization. 
</li><li><b>Criticism of academia and universities</b>: Leo discusses the structural and financial issues plaguing academic institutions. He compares universities to pyramid schemes, focused more on student debt, fundraising, and maintaining reputations than delivering truthful education. Leo describes the imbalance in academia where tenured professors benefit from the system at the expense of their indebted students, asserting that the survival and growth of universities stem from these mechanisms that prioritize income and perceived prestige over teaching truth. 
</li><li><b>Organizations and collective ego</b>: Leo discusses the phenomenon of collective egos in corporations and organizations. He posits that entities like corporations develop life of their own, beyond the control of individual employees or CEOs, driven by survival instincts similar to those experienced in the natural world. Despite the perceived stability or authority of these entities, the collective ego inevitably brings potential for negative impacts.
</li><li><b>The importance of conscious organization leadership</b>: Leo underscores the need for mindful, responsible leadership in forming and leading organizations. He likens this to the conscious decisions someone should make before having children, highlighting the potential negative impacts that unconscious decisions can create in both scenarios. 
</li><li><b>The universal problem of cult psychology</b>: Concluding, Leo explains that all humans are susceptible to cult psychology, not just religious or spiritual people, and it's a deep-rooted issue in human behavior patterns. He encourages individuals to reflect on how they may be unwittingly contributing to this problem, noting that even knee-jerk accusations of something being a cult can ironically be an indicator of participation in mainstream societal cult-like behavior.
</li><li><b>Beliefs and Lenses of Reality</b>: Leo Gura highlights that every individual perceives the world through a unique lens formed by their beliefs and ideologies. He claims that it's possible to view reality without any lenses in an absolute manner which leads to truly radical and shocking insights. According to him, these radical interpretations can seem insane to most people, including scientists, academics, politicians, religious individuals, and those who subscribe to new age ideologies.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Reality without Lenses</b>: Gura explains that seeing reality without lenses is a remarkable discovery that can radically transform one's understanding of existence. However, he mentions the significant challenge he faces - how to share such understanding with people deeply ingrained in their cultural and ideological molasses. He aims to guide individuals toward realizing how their beliefs and worldviews can limit their perception and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Struggle to Convey Radical Truths</b>: Gura expresses his struggle to communicate the radical truths he has discovered, primarily because individuals are conditioned by societal and cultural norms, thereby making it difficult for them to accept unfamiliar concepts. He emphasizes that his purpose is to uncover the false narratives individuals have constructed about themselves and the world, and help them "jailbreak" their minds from these self-deceptive paradigms.
</li><li><b>The Constructed Nature of Reality and Human Life</b>: Gura maintains that reality and human life are constructs of the conscious mind. He argues that societal constructs like culture, academia, government, and even scientific concepts like atoms and molecules, only exist because the conscious mind projects them into reality. However, he recognizes the potential fear arising from realizing that reality is imaginary and depends on this constructive force.
</li><li><b>Identity with societal Constructs</b>: Gura asserts that individuals are usually more committed to the survival of societal constructs like family, business, academia, or religion, than to understanding the actual nature of reality. Because these societal institutions rely on the belief that they are real and not imaginary, individuals who are deeply attached to them might resist the realization that reality is merely a construct of the mind.
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Money</b>: Using money as an example, Gura illustrates how societal constructs are illusions. He suggests that money is just an empty symbol, whose value is a result of collective belief and agreement, and not based on any inherent truth. He maintains that our dependence and attachment to these societal illusions prevent us from seeing reality as it truly is.
</li><li><b>Reality & Survival Instinct</b>: All reality and value systems are likely created by the mind for survival, and people tend to perceive anything that threatens their survival as real. Even the fear of death, according to Leo Gura, is a result of the mind deceiving us into believing that death is a legitimate threat and not an illusion.
</li><li><b>Biography versus Existence</b>: Our constructed false identities or "egos" are based on personal life histories and experiences. The goal of spiritual work is to dissolve these constructed identities. This process can be challenging as our minds cling to certain beliefs and identities for survival, such as adhering to a specific culture or society.
</li><li><b>Taking care of the body</b>: A rule to maintain while engaging in spiritual activities is to not harm the body. Allowing the existential suffering and depression that might occur during spiritual journeys but taking care of the physical body at all times is vital. Intense existential crises might cause the ego to exert its power through bodily harm, but this process should be seen as a path towards ego death, not physical death.
</li><li><b>Understanding death</b>: Understanding that death is imaginary does not entail endorsing physical self-harm. People's fear of death influences their perception of reality and survival.
</li><li><b>Surviving through construction</b>: The act of constructing life narratives and realities often helps individuals to survive and avoid potential danger or perceived existential threats.
</li><li><b>Religion as comfort</b>: Different cultural and religious beliefs, from Islam to Christianity, often serve as survival strategies within specific cultural and historical contexts. Challenging these beliefs can be seen as threatening, which often leads to cries of heresy or accusations of leading a cult.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality and Self-deception</b>: Leo explains that our perceptions and beliefs are usually influenced by our upbringing, social backgrounds, and culture. This results in different "reality bubbles" that limit our worldview and lead to self-deception. He emphasizes that being aware of these dynamics and consistently questioning one's own beliefs can help combat this self-deception.
</li><li><b>Relativity in Perspectives</b>: Leo underscores the importance of relativity in perspectives to avoid becoming locked into any one perspective. He explains how everything, including science, religion, and spirituality, is relative, lifting caution against treating any one perspective or belief system as the absolute truth. This approach, he notes, protects against cult-like adherence to a single worldview.
</li><li><b>Distinction between Belief and Consciousness</b>: Leo highlights that consciousness should not be confused with belief systems or ideologies. Even concepts like truth, God, and self-deception can turn into ideologies when misunderstood or oversimplified. He emphasizes that learning about or discussing consciousness is not the same as actual conscious living, which involves a dynamic, experiential, and infinite reality.
</li><li><b>Role of Survival and Money</b>: Leo discusses the role of survival in shaping our actions and beliefs. He remarks that because survival is necessary, it is understandable to carry out certain routine tasks, like charging money for services, associating its purpose with being able to deliver valuable content to the audience within the constraints of social expectations and needs.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Action</b>: Leo points out that watching or teaching about consciousness is different from actively practicing consciousness. He emphasizes that consciousness requires active engagement and experience, somewhat akin to the difference between discussing surfing and physically riding the waves. Thus, he encourages listeners to actively participate and apply theories instead of just subscribing to them intellectually. 
</li><li><b>Teaching and Consciousness</b>: Leo acknowledges that his teaching might distract from his consciousness, as his primary focus while teaching is to communicate concepts effectively rather than being fully conscious. While teaching, he emphasizes that he is less conscious compared to when off-camera, demonstrating that consciousness cannot be fully expressed through verbal communication. This articulation is bound by relativity and is inherently prone to the limitations of Leo's current level of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Link between Financial Independence and Teaching</b>: Leo mentions the significance of financial independence, supporting his work on Actualized.org and teaching. It ensures that he can devote himself fully to creating valuable content without getting distracted by the need for basic survival. Equating this to the survival needs of scientists and academics, Leo implies the necessity for everyone to have financial security for productive engagement in their chosen field. 
</li><li><b>Debate on Materialistic Approach</b>: Lastly, Leo argues against the common critique of charging money for his work. He reiterates the importance of survival and the practical need to support oneself. In explaining this, he highlights the societal construct that requires everyone to engage in materialistic routines to assure their survival and enable them to deliver their services efficiently.
</li><li><b>Survival Mechanisms and Biases</b>: 
</li><li>- Everyone is surviving as per their unique means, whether by working at McDonald's or as a housewife. All humans have to abide by the physical and social world's rules for survival.
</li><li>- Spiritual teachers too need to survive and should not be expected to be above these rules. There is a balance to be struck between survival and personal growth or understanding.
</li><li>- Leo Gura prioritized financial independence to be able to do uncorrupted work and achieve deep understanding of reality. Being financially independent can lead to doing philosophy independently without conforming to anyone's standards or guidelines. 
</li><li><b>Academic and Organizational Survival Biases</b>: 
</li><li>- Academics, scholars, and organizations have strong survival biases which limit their understanding of reality. These biases come from their dependency on institutions with varying agendas. 
</li><li>- The survival agenda of any entity (individuals, corporations, organizations) greatly influences their actions and perspectives. For instance, if a religious organization prioritizes its survival over God, love, and consciousness, it reveals a lot about their biases.
</li><li>- To deeply understand reality, one must free oneself from any biases and agendas of mainstream society without necessarily becoming a recluse.
</li><li><b>The Pursuit of Truth vs Personal commitments</b>: 
</li><li>- One must prioritize truth over all else to genuinely seek it. Desire for personal comfort, money, or fame can act as distractions from seeking the truth.
</li><li>- For the selfish paradigm, seeking pure understanding or truth comes with the cost of personal comfort, which seems like suffering. It does not offer any selfish advantage.
</li><li>- However, the more selfish one becomes, the worse life gets. In contrast, the selfless paradigm is associated with genuine joy.
</li><li>- Universities and high-level institutions with survival priorities cannot be sources of truth as they have their own ideologies.
</li><li>- Gura concludes that one must transition from the selfish paradigm to the selfless paradigm to understand reality deeply, even though there is perceived suffering in the process.
</li><li><b>Dependence on financial independence for teaching</b>: Leo Gura discusses how his ability to share his teachings depends largely on his financial independence. He highlights how he doesn't ask for donations or for his followers to purchase his courses, merely emphasizing this point to reveal the nature of biases that can influence educational content due to financial dependencies. He also discusses how such biases can prevent institutions like leading universities from advancing beyond current paradigms of understanding, due to their survival agendas.
</li><li><b>Impact of societal norms on education and self-growth</b>: Leo criticizes the current education system, stating that it is far from teaching the truth and is currently in the 'dark ages'. He believes that the survival and thriving of government institutions, corporations, non-profits, etc. are based around the prevalent societal norms and culture. To achieve true self-growth, he insists that individuals need to embark on their own journey of self-discovery and not be bound by these dictated norms and societal impositions.
</li><li><b>Challenges of seeking higher levels of development</b>: Leo Gura speaks on the challenge of transcending and moving to higher states of development. He states that as individuals aim to rise above the common beliefs and limited perspectives of their environment, they may feel increasingly isolated. However, he encourages this process if one aims to break free from universal delusions and attain a clearer perception of reality.
</li><li><b>Modes of communication and its impact on reception</b>: Leo acknowledges his casual and at times obnoxious style of speaking, pointing out that this might create a perceived lack of seriousness around his work. However, he uses this style intentionally to appeal to the average person rather than academics already established in their fields of study. He stresses that despite his casual style, the work and teachings he shares are some of the most serious intellectual endeavors compared to what established institutions like Caltech and Harvard offer. 
</li><li><b>The importance of skepticism and avoiding blind belief</b>: Leo urges his viewers to start with skepticism when encountering radical ideas and emphasizes that his teachings need to be validated through personal experiences. He also acknowledges the complexity of people blindly following and defending his teachings without deep understanding, causing a situation that resembles cult mentality.
</li><li><b>Vision for future growth of actualize.org</b>: Leo concludes by sharing his aim to further evolve his teachings and his commitment to accepting constructive criticism. He plans on producing multiple books in the future to share deeper insights on consciousness, deconstruction, and holistic understanding. The focus of his teachings will continue to be about radical self-inquiry and understanding the architecture of the mind that often robs us of an authentic experience of reality.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on skepticism and self-validation</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the correct usage of skepticism to prevent his teachings from being mindlessly accepted or dismissed. Rather than blindly following his assertions, he encourages his audience to validate his claims through their own experiences. If listeners cannot validate his teachings in their own direct experiences, they are not true for them. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of 'fake it till you make it'</b>: Leo acknowledges that some of his teachings are high-level concepts that many in his audience may have not yet grasped. While these individuals may be tempted to "fake it till they make it", Leo warns of the dangers of self-deception and the importance of honesty about their current level of understanding. He encourages gradual and authentic progress in understanding his teachings.
</li><li><b>Deviation from cult-like behavior</b>: Leo explains that his followers who defend his work do so because of the value they have personally derived from it, not because they have been brainwashed. However, he acknowledges that some people may turn his teachings into an ideology, blindly defending it without deep introspection, creating a resemblance to cult dynamics. He stresses that this work should be about the ideas, not about him.
</li><li><b>Importance of personal experience and testing</b>: Leo reinforces the need for personal experiences in authenticating his teachings. He argues that each idea is independent of his authority and personality, and should be tested and validated by the individual. Furthermore, Leo makes it clear that his work is about sharing ideas, and these ideas exist independently of his personal traits or issues.
</li><li><b>Separating ideas from the person</b>: Leo states that while personal biases and limitations may affect his teachings, the validity of the ideas he shares is independent of his personal characteristics. He encourages his audience to look beyond him as an individual and instead focus on the ideas and concepts he presents. He underlines the importance of dissociating the messenger from the message for genuine understanding. 
</li><li><b>Future perspective</b>: Despite acknowledging personal limitations and biases, Leo expresses hope that the quality of his work would improve over time. His ultimate aim is to contribute to the personal development of his audience by sharing transformative ideas, regardless of his personal circumstances or character traits.
</li><li><b>Video's avoidance of cult dynamics</b>: In this section, Leo Gura explains his deliberate aim to prevent actualized.org from becoming a cult. Leo emphasizes that his teachings are not about him personally, and that he is irrelevant to the ideas being presented. He also clarifies that his disinterest in debates and reactionary content creation isn't due to inability to defend his ideas, but because he believes this type of content doesn't lead to deep understanding and distracts from delivering substantive material.
</li><li><b>The nature of actualized.org's content and audience</b>: Gura explains that he is more interested in developing original, constructive work, and contributing something new to the world rather than engaging in defensively reactionary discussions. He also admits that many of his followers are young and still at early stages of personal development, which can lead to misunderstandings and immature behaviors within the community. However, he hopes his work serves to guide these individuals throughout their developmental journey.
</li><li><b>The potential for changes in actualized.org community management</b>: Leo Gura mentions the possibility of shutting down the comment sections or closing the forums associated with his content in the future. He views these social elements as potential distractions and is concerned about preventing things from getting out of control.
</li><li><b>The commitment to maintaining focus on purpose and value creation</b>: Gura states his main goal is to focus on his purpose - which is helping people understand how their minds work. He dismisses common distractions like debates, criticisms, and arguments, viewing them as insignificant compared to his primary mission.
</li><li><b>The importance of individual validation and constructive work</b>: Leo encourages viewers to validate his lessons through their own experiences. He also advises his audience to commit to constructive, meaningful work that isn't something reactionary or derivative of someone else's work. He believes that these practices will enable them to avoid wasting their lives and to experience genuine happiness.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's personal growth and maturity</b>: Leo recognizes his rapid growth and increased maturity as a teacher over the past eight years. He feels a great responsibility not to mislead his audience and is aware of the influence his personal growth has on his followers. He continues to work on eliminating his own impurities and ego in order to improve and mature further. 
</li><li><b>Importance of serious critique</b>: Leo welcomes serious critiques of his work as they help him improve and grow. He rejects superficial criticisms but invites a serious deconstruction of his ideas, confident they withstand deep scrutiny.
</li><li><b>Deconstruction as part of Actualized.org</b>: Leo emphasizes that his work at Actualized.org is aimed at deconstructing all worldviews, including the idea of deconstruction itself. This approach is to achieve a clear and genuine perception of reality. According to Leo, all worldviews are illusions or constructs that can be analyzed, understood, and discarded, leading to absolute clarity and freedom.
</li><li><b>Being non-ideological</b>: Leo's ultimate teaching in epistemology is to be completely non-ideological about everything, including the state of being non-ideological. He advises not getting attached to any belief, idea, or worldview, thus obtaining absolute freedom without the need for defense or debates. This approach, as opposed to absolutist thinking, promotes open-mindedness and understanding.
</li><li><b>Addressing concerns about Actualized.org's work</b>: Leo hopes that his clarifications address any skepticism or doubts about the work of Actualized.org. His goal is to facilitate understanding and clarity, but he acknowledges that it may take time for followers to truly understand the nature of this work. 
</li><li><b>Future of Actualized.org</b>: Leo plans to write multiple books in the future, which he believes will contain his best work. He recognizes that his casual and sometimes obnoxious style might make his teachings seem less serious, but defends it as a means to reach a wider audience outside of academia.
