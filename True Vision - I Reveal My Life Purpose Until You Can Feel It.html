hey this is leo coming at you from actualized org
and in this video I really want to focus in
and talk about vision I want to give you a
very palpable understanding of what it means to have true
vision for your life okay welcome back so let's talk
about vision you might notice that I talk about vision
a lot in my videos I talk about vision as
it relates to generating motivation I talk about vision as
it's necessary to break through some of the bad habits
that you have in limiting beliefs and sticking with your
goals and creating a powerful life but even though I
talk about vision a lot I keep repeating myself and
I keep giving you the specifics but what you're getting
is you're getting the logic of it and that does
not do vision justice that is not what vision is
and I'm still convinced that you do not really have
a sense for what it means to have vision for
your life to create an amazing life I want you
to create an amazing life to do that you need
to go to the next level this is both a
combination of logic and subconscious thinking intuition tapping into your
highest self and emotion it's all of it it's all
of it combined rolled up into a ball and taken
to the enth degree that's what it really means to
have vision and to get this across to you to
get this idea across to you what I thought I
would do is I would show you my vision I
would share with you my vision for myself what inspires
me what motivates me what drives me why am i
doing the things that I'm doing what is it that
I see out there for myself I want to share
that with you and to do this properly it can't
come from the head it can't come from logic it
can't come from memory I can't rehearse a speech I
can't read off of any notes do this properly it
has to come from from my highest self so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
second to Center myself to see if I can tap
into my highest self and really connect with that vision
and share it with you the way that I feel
it inside so this is a little bit tricky which
is why I'm going to have to Center myself okay
here he goes okay what is my vision what am
I really after in this life what do I really
see out there for me what do I see what
gets me up in the morning what gets me working
well let's see I see myself completely financially independent I
see myself as a millionaire I see myself having so
much money that I don't care about money I see
myself traveling the world I see myself sitting on a
beach meditating somewhere tropical like Fiji or Hawaii or Bali
or the Philippines or one of those beaches and Thailand
that you see on the magazine covers I see myself
being an inspiration to other people not through any kind
of show or pretense or built up image but by
genuinely working on myself to such a degree that people
are inspired by what is possible for them I see
myself as having the opportunity to influence people I see
myself as being able to go out there and set
an example as being someone who is fairly ordinary turning
my life into the most that I can make of
it and sharing that and documenting it and sharing all
my insights and my all my knowledge but more importantly
showing people that it's possible and showing the arc that
I took so that someone who's coming from a similar
position that I was coming from where I didn't really
know much I wasn't particularly blessed with a lot of
money to start with I wasn't particularly blessed with with
with anything special in my life I just had a
pretty normal what you might call childhood and I just
picture myself I picture myself seeing that there's something wrong
with this world there's something wrong with it something wrong
when people are working boring lame nine-to-five jobs and what
they're doing at that job whether they're the grunt level
employee of that company or they're the top level CEO
the fact is that the whole point of that company
is working towards something that is wrong it's not honoring
anything good in life it's taking the life for granted
it's taking the miracle of this life for granted literally
everything in reality is a miracle there's no distinction between
a miracle and the ordinary thing it's all the same
but we are so conditioned we take everything so for
granted we take for granted the fact that our lives
are so short that we forget about all that I
see myself as having the opportunity if I really work
on myself if I really master my psychology and I
completely master it I have the opportunity to show the
world that this is possible for an ordinary person to
do and for me that's that's powerful I picture a
kid sitting there stumbling upon one of my videos or
something that I wrote a kid 500 years from now
that stumbles upon it who has no life trajectory he
stumbles upon and he sees what I'm communicating and more
importantly he sees what I'm demonstrating and he goes wow
I didn't even know that was possible that's possible you
can do that in this life there's more to life
than what there seems to be there's more to my
psychology to reality than what there seems to be like
I can actually master myself I can work on myself
to such a degree that I can transform my life
to such a level that I will not even recognize
where I came from it will be unbelievable to look
back and to see where I came from it just
will not it will just be a figment of my
imagination that's possible it's possible to do that it's amazing
that this is possible in reality and yet we all
take it for granted and I see myself as being
someone who can show this to other people because for
one reason or another I don't think that I'm special
but for some reason or another I'm tapping into this
and I see something there see like a spark I
see a spark amidst this big murky cloud this spark
of something greater something greater that we all should be
striving towards and we're not because we're all caught up
in the pettiness of life I see that and I
have the opportunity I have the opportunity to work on
myself to bring this out because right now I'm still
not there yet I see for myself an amazing life
personally I see that ultimately I stop even caring about
myself but before I get there I see the fact
that I get to travel the world I see the
fact that I get to live and have condos all
across the entire world I get to live in Sydney
I get to live in Dubai I get to live
in somewhere tropical I get to have a cabin somewhere
where it's cold in the mountains I get to go
and I get to apprentice with amazing people I get
to do an apprenticeship for Zen I get to do
an apprenticeship for consciousness work I get to do whatever
I want in my life I get to interact with
amazing people because I provide so much value that people
wanted amazing people want to be around me and they
want to provide me with value in return and I'm
completely happy to give value without needing anything back not
caring about money not caring about approval not needing any
kind of validation just because it makes me feel good
and I want that demonstrated for you and I want
that demonstrated for posterity for all the people that are
going to come and hopefully see these videos in the
future like that is powerful that's powerful I see myself
buying a nice house for my mom when she retires
because she will never be able to afford one for
herself I see myself being able to take care of
my family I see myself as being able to take
care of my health and health of my entire family
I see myself living super healthy I see myself with
an amazing body until I'm a hundred years old because
I take care of my health and my nutrition and
my fitness I see myself just be proud of being
an excellent human being I see myself having amazing sex
I see myself having sex in threesomes I see myself
having sex in four sons and five sons doing crazy
ridiculous things I see myself having sex casual sex I
see myself having deep intimate sex I see myself mastering
hypnosis I see myself doing amazing ridiculous things in the
bedroom I see myself having sex with that perfect ten
my perfect ten that beautiful girl that I want the
shape that I want the personality that I want that
perfect girl that I attracted that is completely in love
with me that I worked my ass off in order
to develop myself to get and I see myself her
somewhere in Fiji in a hut in the middle of
the lagoon there as where as we're and I see
myself just the out of her and her being so
enraptured with me and how good I know I can
her that she is having orgasm after orgasm after orgasm
and just squirting her juices all over me like I
imagine that that's something that I'm working towards this is
real for me this is my vision this is what
I want out of my life and I see myself
eventually having that amazing girlfriend that perfect girlfriend that understands
me that I understand so it's not just sex is
so much deeper than that but also ridiculous amazing sex
and I see myself having kids and I see myself
having kids that I know how to raise kids that
can be proud of what I have accomplished kids that
I can support kids who I can impart with knowledge
that can then go off and be successful and be
happy in their own lives and aside from my personal
life that's really not important what I really see is
the influence that I can potentially have on the world
that is what I see that is my vision that
is what I'm fighting for I picture myself writing books
I picture myself on television I to myself with a
million subscribers on YouTube I picture myself with millions of
dollars coming into my bank account every year without me
doing anything because I've already generated more value than people
could ever repay me for and I see myself getting
emails getting flooded with emails from people that want help
that give me feedback and give me testimonials based on
the videos that they've watched and the material for me
that they've read and that have that has had a
profound impact on their life and I I just imagine
myself talking to these people I imagine myself talking with
him on the phone I imagine myself meeting them in
person bumping into them randomly on the street or at
some seminar that I'm running and I see myself just
talking to this person I see this person standing in
front of me and breaking down in tears because of
how powerful some of these ideas were that I was
able to share and how much insight I was able
to get into my videos and that that insight was
able to trigger something that was not triggered by any
other human being in that person and for some reason
or another that did it that was the spark that
changed that person's life and maybe now they have started
an amazing profitable business or maybe now they're no longer
depressed or maybe now they're no longer having panic attacks
or maybe now they have that amazing relationship that they
want that they couldn't get before or now they just
feel good about themselves and they no longer beat themselves
up and they're no longer negative all the time and
they no longer see themselves as a victim like I
picture that in my mind for me this is very
real this is something that is worth fighting for this
is what's meaningful to me this is really my vision
I picture myself standing in front of an audience of
a thousand people 10,000 people delivering my message my material
my wisdom my thoughts without any filters without any exactly
the way that I wanted to live Ritt without selling
out without caring about who I offend without caring about
what kind of words I use or what kind of
mistakes I make while I'm speaking but deliver delivering that
speech so powerfully that that audience is moved to transform
their life that's what I picture that's what I'm fighting
for that's what I'm working for that's what gets me
juiced up that is my vision but I also think
about all this and I have flashes of this and
they're moments in my day moments in my week that
I am totally synched I'm totally on board I totally
see it I'm jazzed up I'm excited nothing worries me
at all but then there's all those other times all
those other times when I know that my greatest enemy
is me and I've done enough study I've seen enough
examples and then are interacting with enough amazing people out
there successful people that I know that I have no
excuses that I cannot play the victim anymore because I
know better I used to play the victim and I
still play the victim but I know that I can't
anymore because I know better I can but I know
that I'm lying to myself so I know that the
only true obstacle between me and getting there is me
my lowest self I know that I'm going to have
to give it my all I know that I'm out
to fight for it I know that I want to
bleed for it I know that I'm have to cry
and spill tears and blood for it because I cannot
do this with Who I am right now I can't
do it how can I do it I have too
many fears I'm a coward I fear about lack of
money I fear about getting rejected I about somebody posting
a stupid comment I fear about people not wanting to
hear my message I fear about not being able to
take care of my family and the obligations that I'm
not fulfilling their I fear about the fact that I'm
just preaching and that none of this will resonate with
anybody and that all I'm going to become is a
charlatan because I'm going to preach and I'm not going
to practice and then I'm not going to have the
courage to go out there and do the things that
I know I need to do because deep down I
know that who I am right now is not who
I need to be to be in line with that
vision not even close not even by a longshot I'm
not even 1% there and it's all about my psychology
it's all about how I have to grow and right
now I have way too many fears way too many
excuses holding me back I have to fight I have
to fight because the world will take my dream we'll
take my vision from me and tear it to little
pieces and it will laugh at me and it's not
even going to be the world but it's going to
be myself my lower self that's what's going to happen
that's what's going to happen if I don't stay vigilant
that's what's going to happen if I don't push myself
and my ego if I keep holding on to this
ego this massive ego that I have if I think
that I can get from here to there with this
ego there's no chance in hell it's like I'm trying
to fit through a little hole like this this big
and that little hole is far out there and I'm
trying to fit this huge ball of through that hole
that needs to come along with me and it's not
going to work and it's going to take a trial
by fire to burn that out of my system burn
all the impurities out of my system so that that's
all gone and layer by layer I'm going to peel
that ego off and I'm going to move closer and
closer and closer and closer and closer to my vision
and it's going to be hard because every time that
layer of ego is peeled off I'm going to feel
like quitting and I know I'm going to feel like
whatever's gonna feel like being lazy now waking up in
the morning not doing the work that I got to
do not following through on the principles that I need
to follow through on I'm going to be lazy I
don't bring my lower self and I'm going to sell
out and you know how I know this because I've
done this and I'm doing it right now I know
what it means to sell out selling your soul to
the devil this is what everyone is doing this is
what I'm fighting against but it's the same problem that
I'm facing I'm fighting against this problem first and foremost
myself I have to figure out how to stop selling
my soul to the devil I've done it for too
long the devil has taken so much for me I've
wasted so many years doing stupid petty when life is
so short the miracle of life I should be looking
towards the higher values I should be living up to
my full excellence why am I not doing that why
am I not doing that the world is going to
want to take my heart and it's going to want
to stomp all over my vision and it's not just
going to let me have it I am NOT going
to let me have it because right now that vision
is like this little this little sparkle in this giant
sea of that I have to wade through that sea
of I'm not going to let the devil take my
heart I'm not going to let my lower self dictate
the way I'm going to run my life I'm not
going to be a coward and I don't care what
it takes it doesn't matter what it takes I'm willing
to do whatever it takes tell me what it takes
I'm going to do it what do I need to
do do I need to work 24/7 do I need
to give up something in my life what do I
need to give up do you want to e to
give up shallow pretensions do I need to humble myself
in front of a crowd of in front of a
crowd I need to humiliate myself do I need to
subject myself to public humiliation do I need to make
myself bleed what do I need to do do I
need to give all my money wait I don't care
what it takes because I'm tired of living this mediocre
life where I'm living less than I know that I
should then I then I can I'm tired of that
and it's sad to me that I am doing the
exact same thing that I am fighting against I want
all of you to not do that in your life
I want you to stop selling out but I'm the
one that's selling out more than anyone I am too
petty to live up to my dreams right now too
petty and if I keep going on the trajectory that
I'm going at I'm not gonna get there there has
to be something more I have to give it everything
I have to be all in I'm not going to
allow myself to sell out again I'm not going to
sell out it's too painful it's too stupid why am
I doing this because I'm afraid because I'm afraid that
I'll get humiliated afraid that I'm gonna get rejected I'm
afraid that I'm going to end up or on the
street with no money this is my only chance it's
my only life and I've already lived 1/3 of it
if I'm lucky I only have about two thirds left
and the last third of it it's probably going to
be limited because of physical ailments so I'm really in
the second third right now and this is my chance
if I'm going to make it happen I have to
have make it happen now and this pettiness needs to
stop now this living for money needs to stop now
this living for approval and comfort needs to stop right
now this complaining and excuse making this victimized victimization mindset
blaming other people having a big ego not taking responsibility
for not taking the right action that I know that
I need to take not reading the books that I
know that I need to be reading not shooting as
many videos as I know I need to be shooting
not doing as much contemplation meditation as I know I
need to be doing not going out and giving enough
speeches on as I know I need to be doing
not doing the marketing work that I know I need
to be doing not going to the gym as regular
and consistently and as hard as I know I should
be doing not eating as clean as I should be
not going out and hitting on women the way I
need to to be a full man this needs to
stop I need to start doing this now I am
NOT going to let the world take my heart you
can take everything from me but you cannot take my
heart in fact you will take everything from me and
all that will remain is my heart and that heart
you cannot take from me until you kill me and
I don't care I will accomplish what I set out
to accomplish and the only way you can stop me
is if you kill me because everything else you do
is all going to make me stronger it's just going
to rip off layer after layer of that ego and
it's going to be closer to my heart and when
I get to the bottom of it when it gets
the bottom of it that's when I know that I'm
going to have the impact that I want to have
because I cannot have that impact the way that I
think right now the way that I live my life
right now it's not going to happen and I'm not
willing to tolerate that I've tolerated saladin settling for mediocrity
for far too long and I refuse to live the
rest of my life settling I will live the rest
of my life as an example and I will live
the rest of my life living up to values that
everyone should be living up to this is where humanity
is going it's going from pettiness to consciousness and I
need to be at the forefront of that this is
my time this is my chance this is my vision
and I'm willing to bleed for it I'm willing to
die for it I'm willing to do whatever it takes
this is Leo and this is my vision so I'm
adding this final appendix to the vision video because I
watched that video just now and what I recognized is
that even though I was able to tap into the
motion of my vision that I wanted to I had
this realization that it might actually be too much because
you might have watched this you might have might be
saying to yourself now like who is this guy what
what is going on with him whereas where's this coming
from and you might have this tendency to classify me
and to say that this is not this is not
a person that I can relate to so you might
say that this is not really me I don't know
people like this clearly he's tapping into something he was
born special or he has some sort of abilities that
I don't have which is the exact danger that I
want you to avoid here so be careful about immediately
classifying me and putting me into some special category I'm
not special I'm not cut from a different cloth I'm
very much like you the only difference is that I'm
a little bit more self-aware and I'm a little bit
more work on myself and I've started to tap into
and develop my life purpose this is what life purpose
work is about is finding out what your purpose really
is in life and when you find this out you
start to tap into these powers and to these emotions
that you were seeing just a few minutes ago so
that's that's something you can have if you want that
you can generate it and this is not something that
I was born with in fact this is something I've
really worked hard on over the last just last year
and I've really only got to these kinds of levels
of emotion just over the last year of the work
that I've done so I've had a lot of struggle
trying to figure out what my purpose is in life
what I really want to accomplish that can be a
difficult challenge it's hard to figure that out all by
yourself coaching really helps with that reading books helps with
that exploring traveling helps with that so there's a lot
of different ways you can go about finding out what
your life purpose is but just I want you to
be very careful here not just say that this guy
is some something weird something that I can't be because
this is you what I tapped into is something that
all of you have and the reason that you experience
any kind of social reaction here by watching that was
because it's happened to the higher part within you that
higher part is there it's just obscured by a lot
of grime and and dust and dirt and all the
pettiness of the world that has been heaped upon it
and the social conditioning just all of that right so
we have to start to work with work and uncover
that that's what I did and that's what I still
continue to do I'm not done with my work I'm
still doing my work on my purpose if you can
believe it or not there's still more I'm still not
at the core of it you can always go deeper
you can always go further but just realize that that
is that is what what is happening here and that
nothing I'm sharing with you is not something that you
can't achieve yourself you can achieve it and in fact
I've developed processes and I have a lot of ideas
that I would love to share with you guys through
my videos through my products through coaching if you really
want the most powerful effect it's through coaching about how
you can tap into this - and how you can
start to align your whole life to this because I
don't know if you've sensed this but it's powerful when
you do that yeah it's really powerful when you can
actually align your life with what your actual highest purpose
is and then you're actually living it you can move
mountains it's crazy what you can do it's so amazing
it's so powerful it's so fulfilling it's so rewarding this
is really what I want for everybody I want to
help people tap into this so go ahead check out
actualize org for more ideas about how to really tap
into your full life purpose you
