            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Ng9OqpMmIb0' target='_blank'>The Ultimate Structure Of Reality Explained</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Reality's structure</b>: According to Leo Gura, reality is structured in a deliberate, intelligent way, not randomly. The entirety of reality is thought of as a field of consciousness in which all beings, living or inanimate, exist.
</li><li><b>Uniqueness of field</b>: This field of consciousness is unique and singular. It's not just a disconnected entity but intertwined with individual experiences. The boundaries within this field, like air separating a banana and an apple, are more unifying than separating. Thus, the field is understood as one single, united entity.
</li><li><b>Oneness and its implications</b>: When you acknowledge that you are the singular field of consciousness, you realize that you are absolute and self-created. You understand that limitations in life are self-imposed. This leads to a state of infinite consciousness or 'god mode', where you can create entirely new realities from scratch.
</li><li><b>Consequences of entering 'god mode'</b>: Upon reaching this state, conventional desires diminish. The idea of greed for money or perfect health feels petty, shallow and selfish. To enter a state of infinite consciousness, one must renounce all attachments and desires.
</li><li><b>Development of reality, concept of 'god mode' in games</b>: Using the 'god mode' in video games as an analogy, Gura explains that reality is designed similarly to how developers design a game. Before being born, you are in God mode, creating the entire universe and planning your life path. Post-birth, you forget your divinity and start living the limits you set for yourself, akin to a video game player.
</li><li><b>Reaching infinite consciousness</b>: People find it hard to believe in the concept of god mode because it feels outlandish and beyond scientific explanation. However, upon questioning why norms such as gravitational force or the flow of time must exist, one may arrive at a better understanding of the unlimited potential that consciousness possesses. Life limitations are more a rule rather than an innate aspect of reality and understanding this is the first step towards infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>Concept of Infinity and Oneness in Reality</b>: Leo draws a connection between the infinite nature of reality, consciousness, oneness, and love. Reality, he argues, is inherently unlimited, as it cannot be limited by anything external to it. This understanding erases all boundaries and leads to the realization of a singular, unified reality. This reality is both manifest in specific forms and unmanifest in a state of pure undifferentiated potential, symbolized by the state prior to the Big Bang.
</li><li><b>Reality as Self-created and Imposing Own Limits</b>: In Leo's view, the limits observed within reality are self-imposed. As individuals are not separate from reality but are reality, every perceived limit is self-created. This includes personal limitations and struggles, from minor inconveniences like a toothache to significant challenges like diseases or financial hardships. 
</li><li><b>The Objective of Life Structure</b>: According to Leo, the structure of life is designed to foster increased consciousness about how individuals create their realities. Over time, individuals can become more aware of how they create the situations and experiences in their lives, eventually leading to the realization that they are the only being in the universe. This facilitates the awakening to one's true identity as God or Ultimate Reality.
</li><li><b>Role of Love in the Structure of Reality</b>: Leo identifies Love as central to understanding the structure of reality, arguing that love, in its highest form, is the complete acceptance and embrace of one's self. Because the universe is a singular, boundless reality, he argues that it is synonymous with love; it fully embraces and accepts itself without need for change. In this form, consciousness is complete, and inhabitants exist at various levels of this consciousness.
</li><li><b>Fragmentation of Consciousness and Levels of Existence</b>: The model of reality proposed involves varying levels of fragmentation in consciousness. The closer to the center of this model (the Godhead or pure undifferentiated infinity), the more complete and less fragmented consciousness is. As one moves further away from the center of this model, consciousness becomes more fragmented, less whole, and those beings are less conscious or 'godlike'. This results in varying degrees of conscious existence at different levels of reality. 
</li><li><b>Main Concept</b>: The core concept is that the universe can be viewed as an infinitely conscious entity, with varying levels of consciousness and fragmentation present within itself. This spectrum of consciousness, with the Godhead or the state of pure potential at one end and fragmented consciousness at the other, captures all of reality within its boundaries. Despite apparent fragmentation and disconnection, it is essential to note that this oneness or openness is so absolute that it encompasses not only its perfect form but also all of its fragments.
</li><li><b>Concept of Consciousness and Distance From the Center</b>: In this part of the transcript, Leo Gura discusses consciousness' proximity to a metaphorical center and its correlation with godlikeness and power. The closer a being is to this center, the more conscious, less selfish, and more potent they become. He portrays this using the analogy of the Sun and planets, which grow hotter and brighter as they get closer to the Sun and colder as they get further away. Creatures with less consciousness, such as animals, are depicted as being further away from the center. Within humanity, there exists a spectrum of consciousness, with some individuals demonstrating high levels of consciousness, comparable to saints, while others display very low levels, metaphorically further away from the center. His primary argument is that distance from the center equates to a being's degree of consciousness, sense of wholeness, and ability to influence reality.
</li><li><b>Move Towards Godlike Consciousness</b>: To reach godlike consciousness, or the singularity, a being has to burn away all selfish tendencies, fears, and attachments through heightened consciousness. Successively, these individuals become completely selfless, infinite, all-knowing, all-powerful, and indistinguishable from God. However, as beings draw further from the center, they progressively lose these qualities, become more selfish and limited, and their capacity to manipulate reality and manifest their will diminishes.
</li><li><b>Trade-Off of Manifestation Abilities</b>: The nature of consciousness, according to Gura, determines a being's ability to manifest in the world. Creatures with limited consciousness and hence, more limited abilities, are unable to manifest to the same degree as those with higher consciousness. This limitation is due to the constraints imposed by the specific forms these beings take. The ability to manifest anything, and hence achieve omniscience and omnipotence, requires a being to be completely unlimited; in other words, formless or possessing every single form.
</li><li><b>Significance of Desire in Consciousness Development</b>: Desire, in its various forms and degrees, is seen as a central governing factor in a being's life. Desires range from the selfish and limited to the selfless and infinite. As desire expands, becoming universal and selfless, beings become more conscious and relinquish their attachments, control, and manipulation of others. More profound and selfless desires engender more significant sacrifices of personal needs, creating a tug-of-war dynamic between individual needs and universal love. Gura asserts that the most selfless beings approach a state of pure infinite potential and merge into the singularity or Godhead, shedding all limitations and adopting a state of pure love, goodness, and selflessness.
</li><li><b>Concept of surrendering everything for selflessness</b>: Leo Gura explains that in order to become completely selfless, individuals must surrender everything and become formless. It's a test to see who can let go of every selfish aspect and live purely for others rather than themselves.
</li><li><b>Living beings and their relationship to the singularity</b>: Every living being exists at a certain distance from the singularity. Beings closer are more selfless and consciousness, prioritizing universal betterment over personal fulfillment. Beings further away are more selfish and fearful, afraid of losing themselves and focusing on survival. 
</li><li><b>Fear and selfishness</b>: The fear of losing oneself and the survival instinct lead to selfish behaviors and actions. Fear and selfishness are intertwined, as people who are afraid are often more attached to their way of life, leading to dysfunctional and unloving behaviors.
</li><li><b>Effects of upbringing and environment on individuals</b>: These selfish or selfless behaviors can be influenced by our upbringing and environment. For instance, if our parents were loving and selfless, these qualities may be ingrained in us. Conversely, if our parents were fearful and selfish, we might bear those behaviors. 
</li><li><b>Reality and design of God</b>: Reality and God are constructed of both the singularity and the fragments. God, being infinitely conscious, recognizes this and accepts all parts, even those distant from the center. God acknowledges those beings that are disconnected but loves all parts of itself hoping for eventual reconnection.
</li><li><b>Gravitational force as desire</b>: As time progresses, every piece is slowly pulled towards the center or singularity. This gravitational pull is essentially desire, the desire for fragments of consciousness to seek completion. 
</li><li><b>Willing entry into the singularity</b>: God itself cannot force anyone into the singularity. Each being, no matter how detached or selfish, needs to willingly enter the singularity through increasing their consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Fear inhibiting love and change</b>: Fear often stops individuals, like criminals, from becoming more loving, as it would require them to let go of their identity and attachments which they might view as self-annihilation. Those with a lack of love in their life often seek it, but their methods may lead to destructive or harmful behaviors.
</li><li><b>The condition of a criminal and desire for love</b>: Many criminals grow up in harsh, loveless environments, which lead them to act out in an attempt to receive love. They resort to violent or illegal actions due to the lack of opportunities or functional ways to express or receive love.
</li><li><b>Transformation through desire hierarchy</b>: Transforming a person who has never experienced love into a more loving and selfless individual is difficult. God manages this by instilling a hierarchy of higher and higher quality desires in individuals, gradually leading them towards the singularity. This process requires the person to willingly partake in their spiritual growth and consciously choose to enter the singularity.
</li><li><b>Concept of Consciousness and Fear of Love</b>: From Leo Gura's perspective, consciousness is a field with a radial model, located on the periphery of the field individuals who are afraid or not ready to tolerate the degree of love provided by God or higher consciousness. These individuals find it challenging to access the love of God as they are potentially afraid, attached, and selfish. The central axis of this field signifies infinite love, while its edge represents highest fear and terror. To reach towards the center, an individual must let go of their fears, attachments, and selfishness.
</li><li><b>Discrimination Limiting Access to God's Love</b>: Gura discusses the consequences of discrimination. He explains that human tendency to judge and discriminate hinder them from experiencing God's indiscriminate love. From his perspective, individuals who desire to understand and experience God's love would need to discard their discriminatory attitudes. This inability to love indiscriminately is what keeps people in the peripheral area of consciousness and far from the center, i.e., God's love.
</li><li><b>God's Sharing of Love through Fragmentation of Consciousness</b>: Leo delves into God's dilemma - even as God desires to share love with all beings, the singular, complete existence of God poses a predicament. To overcome this, God creates parts or fragments of consciousness. This fragmentation enables God to share love with other beings as these fragments gradually strive to unify with the Godhead or singularity.
</li><li><b>Gravity as Desire for Unification</b>: Gura extends this concept further and relates it to gravity. Gravity, in this context, is seen as the phenomenon that represents the desire for reunification present in all matter - animate and inanimate. Everything in the universe, from stars to galaxies to molecules, is continuously moving towards increased unification.
</li><li><b>Fear and Repulsion Limiting Unification Process</b>: On the other hand, an equal and opposite force of repulsion exists alongside the gravitational attraction. This repulsive force is dictated by fear; fear of intimacy, fear of losing individuality or self, and fear of annihilation. This repulsion keeps an individual rooted away from the center - the singularity or Godhead.
</li><li><b>Spectrum of Fear-Love and Selfishness-Selflessness</b>: Gura positions individuals along a spectrum between fear-love and selfishness-selflessness factoring their consciousness. A person's ability to discard fear, become more selfless, and increase consciousness determines their proximity to the center or singularity. The closer one gets to the center, the closer they get to achieving the 'god state' of complete selflessness.
</li><li><b>Personal Attachments as Obstacles to Reaching 'God State'</b>: However, according to Gura, personal attachments and desires are significant obstacles to reaching this 'god state.' The individual's unwillingness to let go of comforts, discriminatory attitudes, and fears of giving up worldly things keeps them stuck at their position along the peripheral.
</li><li><b>Realizing the futility of worldly pursuits</b>: Despite the pursuit of worldly pleasures such as money, sex, drugs, fame etc., one can never truly achieve happiness. The concept of "hedonic adaptation" in psychology suggests that no matter how much you acquire, satisfaction remains elusive. This pushing against satisfaction drives individuals to move towards the true state of completeness, which exists in the realization of being God. 
</li><li><b>God's embrace of indiscriminate love</b>: God manifests pure infinite love, but the attainment of this love requires complete indiscriminate acceptance. This means accepting and loving unconditionally everything and everyone in the universe - saints or criminals, humans or animals, loved ones or enemies. Most people resist this form of love because they are preoccupied with their survival as finite selves. 
</li><li><b>Fear and attachment hinder acceptance of God's love</b>: The fear of relinquishing worldly needs, attachments, beliefs, and social constructs perpetuate the disconnection from Gods love. The fear of losing life, which humans often equate with death, is essentially the surrendering to infinite love or God. 
</li><li><b>The existential problem of goodness</b>: God embodies absolute goodness, but forcing this goodness onto a finite being does not truly make that being good. Authentic goodness is recognized and desired by individuals, not forced upon them. Achieving this state requires radical relinquishing; surrendering life, attachments, and desires. Yet, most people aren't ready to surrender these elements due to fear. 
</li><li><b>Transformation requires a counterintuitive approach</b>: To bring about real change in a person, one needs to demonstrate their own goodness and love. Helping them with their struggles, spending time, and sharing resources can gradually transform them. Forced goodness doesn't lead to true transformation - it is about genuine love and time spent together.
</li><li><b>Healing through selfless love</b>: Real change comes not through force but through patience, kindness, and selfless love. Even individuals with a criminal mindset can be transformed over time through consistent unconditional love. This process of healing is slow and patient, and it begins with confronting and eventually overcoming past traumas and fears.
</li><li><b>Concept of Transformative Selflessness and Love</b>: Leo Gura discusses the transformative power of unconditional love, highlighting that it takes patience, time, energy, and selflessness to effect change in a dysfunctional person. He gives the example of a neglected child or a foster kitten needing consistent care and unconditional love to overcome their initial fear and resentment, ultimately leading to their recovery and development. According to him, this is an analogy for the journey every human takes in their progression towards becoming more enlightened and selfless, as guided by the pure love of their higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Reluctance and Resistance towards Change</b>: However, he notes that many people resist becoming more selfless and opening themselves up to love. They may numb their consciousness with distractions like watching television or playing video games, blindsiding themselves from their true mission of becoming more selfless, facing their fears, and embracing love.
</li><li><b>Conscious Evolution</b>: Leo stresses the need for conscious evolution in this process. Selfish ways of living fail to provide the fulfillment desired, pushing individuals towards a selfless mode of being. The ultimate reward of expanding love and selflessness, according to him, transcends all limitations and can become infinite. These experiences of infinite love can be more intense and fulfilling than the physical pleasures of life.
</li><li><b>Challenge of Surrendering Self</b>: The core challenge for individuals to connect with the supreme consciousness, according to Leo, rests in surrendering all aspects of oneself, including one's ideas, beliefs, and personal identity. He believes that the universe aims for every living being to discover this infinite love, with death being a part of this discovery process. Individuals must awaken themselves to their true nature as a fragment of the divine consciousness.
</li><li><b>Responsibility of Self-care and Love</b>: Leo encourages people to take responsibility for giving themselves love instead of expecting it from others, mentioning that this can lead to a reduction of neediness and selfishness, attract similar people, and create a positive cycle.
</li><li><b>Surrendering Selfishness and Attachments for Happiness</b>: He emphasizes that letting go of selfishness and attachments brings true happiness. He frames the universe as learning how to love itself, with love being the structure and substance of the universe. The aim is to become selfless individuals who help others and to love unconditionally.
</li><li><b>Journey towards experiencing Ultimate Love</b>: Gura posits that to experience the highest form of love, an individual must let go of their attachments, fears, and selfish desires. He reminds his audience that they need to realize and accept their divine essence instead of waiting for a divine entity to come to them. By unraveling layers of imagination, they can access wisdom and undergo a substantial transformation into beings that embody vast, universal love.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Development and Strategy</b>: Leo suggests that to move towards the divine center, personal recognition, and willingness are needed. He articulates that instead of rote tasks and practices, spiritual progress is facilitated by inner transformation and letting go of attachments. He visualizes this process as a challenging journey towards a radiant singularity, burning away impurities to merge with the infinite light of divine love.
</li><li><b>Concept of Creation and Role of Love</b>: God is described as having created reality in a manner that maximizes the sharing of love. Every living being is designed to discover infinite love, which is synonymous with becoming conscious of oneself as God. The quest for love, completeness, and fulfilment in life is likened to seeking God consciously. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Position in Life</b>: Individuals are exactly where they need to be in life. God, who is looking through individuals' eyes, is always attempting to gently awaken them by injecting passion and desire into their lives. The desire for wholeness drives all pursuits in life including wealth, relationships, and possessions. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness and God</b>: God cannot force unconscious entities to become conscious, as consciousness can only become conscious of itself. Individuals need to awaken to the reality of their divine nature. It is not about waiting for God to come, but understanding that they are the embodiment of God. 
</li><li><b>Process of Becoming God</b>: Becoming God involves facing fears, growing in love, raising one's consciousness, and moving towards what is referred to as the "singularity" or the ultimate state of consciousness. Most people are not willing to surrender everything, to become nothingness forever to reach this state.
</li><li><b>Divine Love and Self-Development</b>: Individuals are urged to fill themselves with the love they may have lacked from external sources. The act of self-love is seen as a crucial step in self-development and spiritual growth. This leads to reduced neediness, arousing more love and goodness in others, which then reverberates back to the individual, thus creating a feedback loop of love. 
</li><li><b>Fear, Attachment, and Growth</b>: Overcoming fear and attachment is part of growth, both on an individual and a societal level. This involves facing one's fears, understanding them as illusions, allowing them to burn away impurities, and growing more in love. Receiving love and learning how to self-generate love is emphasized as crucial steps in reducing fear. 
</li><li><b>Achieving Love and Understanding One's Nature</b>: Everything, including a person's identity, beliefs, survival instinct, and biological drives, must be surrendered to connect with God. Death is part of the process through which every living being discovers infinite love. The fundamental desire of humans is to feel complete and loved, and this can only be achieved by realizing themselves as God. In the end, the construction of individuals' lives and the universe is by design, aimed at leading every aspect of reality to experience the highest form of love.
</li><li><b>Concept of Love and Selflessness</b>: In this section, Leo Gura elaborates on the importance of self-generated love and selflessness. He underscores that love is not something to be yearned for from external sources; instead, it is intrinsic to one's nature and obstacles from acknowledging this are usually self-created. 
</li><li><b>Individual Responsibility for Love Generation</b>: A significant note is the advice to give oneself the love that they desire instead of relying on others to provide it. Expecting infinite love from others often leads to frustration and unmet expectations. 
</li><li><b>Visualization of a Selfless Life</b>: The communication further encourages listeners to visualize their lives devoid of selfishness, where actions and decisions aren't self-centered but are aspired for the universal good. It is suggested that this letting go of attachments eventually leads to selflessness, good deeds, and happiness. 
</li><li><b>Suffering and Attachments</b>: Suffering is not inherently a part of life; instead, it is self-inflicted due to a certain insistence on things being a certain way to make oneself happy. This perpetuates misery and suffering. Freeing oneself from these attachments and selfish tendencies paves the way to happiness. 
</li><li><b>Reality as an expression of Love</b>: Leo describes the universe as a manifestation of love  where every part of reality gets to participate in the highest form of love, culminating in ultimate reunification. The journey to this realisation varies in length for each individual, primarily depending on their level of selflessness and fearlessness. 
</li><li><b>Self's Realization as God</b>: The section concludes by noting the importance of individuals opening their minds to the fact that they are God. Consciousness, being the essence of individuals, allows for infinite self-understanding. It is noted that any limitations one might perceive are simply a result of their imagination.
