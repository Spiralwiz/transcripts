hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment in about 10 minutes I am going
to give you some practical tips on how to change
careers alright how to change careers it's actually something that
I've done and so I can resonate with what you're
probably feeling if you're thinking about changing careers it's a
big bold move right and you've invested so much time
in your current career maybe you've invested a decade maybe
more maybe just a few years I invested only one
year and I was still feeling really sad about having
to change and for me my story is that I
was a video game designer that's something that I wanted
to be since I was a kid and then when
I ended up getting into that position I've gotten a
really good job as a game designer but then what
happened was that I wasn't really feeling it at that
job and for a multitude of reasons that I can't
go into here that were pretty complex I found out
that that job was not right for me it didn't
really suit my it didn't suit my strengths it didn't
suit my my values and it didn't really give me
the kind of lifestyle that I wanted and so what
I did is I had to start my own business
and I found that that was what was right for
me but making that choice I remember very vividly sitting
there standing there looking out the window in my apartment
in Boston and and thinking about what it would mean
if I if I left this job because I knew
that if I left that job there was no coming
back to this industry anymore there was no coming back
to this branch of my life literally I was I
felt like I was I was uh I was like
a crossroads of my life and I could go either
one way or the other way and I wasn't quite
sure which way to go and I knew that if
I made the decision to transition out of game design
then well my life would be very very different for
good or for bad and I would have to really
grow and I was taking a pretty big risk and
I didn't know how it's gonna play out so I
know where you're coming from is my bottom bottom line
point but as far as some practical tips for how
to change careers I think in the end which you
really got to do is get clear about what it
is that you want out of life because once you're
clear about that and that kind of very challenging life
decision that we that I just talked about becomes much
easier it's still challenging but it becomes much easier because
it takes away some of the uncertainty when you know
what you really want and for me that means number
one identifying your top ten values figure out what are
your top 10 values and I talked about that in
some other videos that I have where I go into
it at length about how to do proper values identification
but you identify your top 10 values and then that
allows you to use that as kind of a rubric
for making decisions against so once you know your values
you can ask yourself ok so if I go with
the status quo with my current career is that gonna
how well is that gonna fulfill in a line with
my with my top values ok and then you couldn't
gotta measure them and see and rank them and put
numbers to them and see what comes out then you
can go and see ok option B how do I
think that will align with my values and even though
you can't be completely sure you can you can have
a pretty good guess and so that will help you
that will help make make the choice in one way
or the other the other thing so that that's really
important the other thing is of course think about your
life purpose what is it that you want to accomplish
in your life what kind of impact do you want
to have if you're thinking about changing careers then you're
probably doing it for one of just a few reasons
one is because the line of work that you're in
is not providing you with the kind of lifestyle that
you want that means it's not paying you enough it's
not you don't feel well compensated you don't feel like
you have the freedom you don't have the time you
don't have the maybe creative autonomy that you want there
and so you want to change in those circumstances and
then the other point of course is that you're not
passionate about that line of work and that you are
thinking that there's something else that you're better aligned with
and that what that is is that that actually a
really good sign when you're feeling that even though it's
scary in the moment the reason you're feeling that is
because your subconscious mind is telling you that your values
are not being honored in your current job right so
what that means is for example that if you're working
in a nine-to-five cubicle type of job and you're sensing
that maybe there's more to life maybe you want to
be out there and you want to do something a
little bit more adventurous maybe you want to be working
outdoors maybe you want to be working more with people
maybe you want to be self-employed maybe you want to
be a writer maybe you have some dream project that
you want to be working on right if you if
you've got those things but you're working this nine-to-five cubical
job then your mind is gonna be telling you that
it's gonna be basically was going to do is going
to deliver pain to your subconscious mind and it's going
to deliver pain and resistance because what you're doing is
going against those values it's like you're going upstream and
what you want to be doing is you want to
be going downstream you want to go with the flow
and the flow we're talking about here are your values
and by values I mean the things that are the
most important and meaningful to you in life because on
a subconscious level you know that your life is short
and that if you're gonna be putting hours and hours
and hours of time into your career and into your
job you want some sort of payoff and you want
some satisfaction from that and you know deep down that
you should be satisfied with your career because you are
spending 40 hours a week there maybe more if you're
working on a high demand job and that's gonna be
40 hours a week that's like eight hours a day
that's most of your day it's a good chunk of
your waking time that you're spending at your job so
if you're not feeling satisfied and happy and feeling like
you're being creative and you're getting everything you want out
of your job and it's not the right line of
work for you and you just figure that out or
you're just starting to realize that it's dawning on you
then you owe it to yourself to find something better
because your life and your career is gonna be very
long and you don't you do not want to be
in that kind of a jaded position where you hate
your career and you're just going there for the paycheck
and you hate everybody there you don't like what you're
doing you hate the world that's not a path that
you want to go down so you want to change
that around and you then do want to change careers
you got to think about this you know you got
to think about what the long-term payoffs are going to
be because in the short term there's probably going to
be a cost associated with changing careers and that's why
you're here and you're watching this video because you're wondering
is it gonna be worth the cost what is the
cost going to be it's probably gonna be a cost
of maybe you're gonna have to spend some time unemployed
looking for a new job maybe even have to spend
some time retraining yourself maybe you need to go back
to school to earn the credentials or education you need
to go into the new career maybe you have some
sort of dream career that you have been pondering going
into but you haven't really known how to go into
it or your financial situation has kind of been holding
you to the one that you've been at right now
and or maybe your family has been pressuring you to
stay on this career track when in fact you know
that you really should be doing something more adventurous something
that's more you and those are hard obstacles to go
against right it's gonna take some some self-discovery it's gonna
take some courage really and overcoming your fears and kind
of standing up to them and standing up to maybe
some obstacles in your life whether it's money whether it's
a it's friends or family to to make that shift
but what is going to be the long-term payoff of
that even though there's gonna be that initial cost the
long-term payoff is going to be that not only are
going to be more fulfilled which is nice but you're
also going to be actually in a better position to
earn more money I know that for me I have
some triggers and limiting beliefs about money even still after
doing a lot of personal development work and for me
that means that one way that I convinced myself in
these kind of situations is telling myself that when I'm
doing what I'm really passionate with when I make that
alignment it's not only just gonna be for happiness and
fulfillment sake it's gonna be actually for money's sake because
I know that maybe in the short run the money
is not going to be as great or it's not
going to give me a big boost of money in
the long run I know that when I'm aligned with
what I want to be doing and I have that
passion there that passion even though it sounds abstract it
actually starts to manifest itself in very tangible ways when
you're more passionate you're gonna be interacting with people more
you're gonna be more likely to go out there and
grab the sale you're gonna inspire people with your enthusiasm
and then things are gonna catch on for you and
you're gonna work harder and in the end because you
like it you're gonna work it you're gonna enjoy it
and you're gonna produce a lot of value for other
people and then that value is worth something and it's
gonna come back to you but you kind of have
to have the faith that that's that that's gonna happen
because if you're very skeptical and you're very pessimistic about
it then there's no way you're gonna make that transition
change you're not going to be able to make that
transition you're going to be stuck here and when you're
stuck here you know that you're stuck because you're succumbing
to fears right you're really giving in to your fears
and you're coming up with all sorts of rationalizations and
justifications for why this is okay for why mediocre is
okay for why not living your values is okay and
that's never okay that's only okay for a certain period
of time so if you have some financial obligations you
have to pay off some bills some credit cards pay
the electricity bill next month then sure I'm not saying
that you go and quit your job right now and
make a career transition what you do is you stay
there and you slowly work it you don't have to
transition immediately that's kind of what I did is I
started my business while I was still working my nine-to-five
game-design job and it took me I was pretty fortunate
because I was able to get my business up within
just three or four months and then I was able
to really spin it off and then I was able
to quit my job about six months after I intended
to so that was a pretty quick transition but still
recognize it's six months six months is still quite a
lot a lot of time so you have to have
a little bit of patience here you have to say
to yourself okay let's say I'm in this position and
I'm kind of stuck here right now I do need
to pay my rent I don't have too much saved
up maybe I don't even know exactly what I'm gonna
be going into I don't even know how how that
works I don't know what kind of training I need
so what you got to do is you got to
start the research process first of all get in touch
with yourself get in touch with your values what you
really want out of life once you've got a clear
picture of what you want then say is that what
I've got right now or is there something better okay
if there's something better where is it okay it's over
there how can I transition from here to there what
would be the practical steps and then start doing the
research this is not something that you can usually answer
in the abstract this might mean you have to buy
some books this might mean you have to do some
research online maybe watch some videos maybe buy some training
programs and then go out there start implementing this stuff
so if you need more training go out there and
get more training and this might be a gradual process
that you do while you're your nine-to-five maybe you do
this on the weekends and then as you're building up
and building up and building up you're going to reach
a point where you're going to feel confident enough and
you're going to know that the other alternative is right
for you and that you're that you're trained for it
that you're gonna be able to make the transition smooth
that's a lot better than just saying you know what
I'm gonna quit this job and go find a new
one without knowing exactly how it's gonna work because to
make that kind of really radical break first of all
that can get you into some financial trouble and and
just it could be a little bit of a rash
move but secondly you need some time to discover what
you really want and there's actually probably some things that
your job right now that are not quite as bad
as they seem so use your current job to keep
yourself on track financially use your current job to keep
your family on track to to do whatever you're doing
but then just start looking start looking towards the future
and then start making that transition gradually you don't wanna
make a big break make it gradually and then one
day you'll feel confident enough to make the big break
