hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about advanced tips for self
inquiry [Music] you I wanted to shoot an episode specifically
for people who are doing self inquiry but feel stuck
and feel discouraged and might benefit from some tips and
pointers that I could provide I have been doing something
choir II for over three years with mixed results and
so I know what it's like to be stuck I
know what it's like to feel confused and frustrated and
ready to tear your hair out in this process so
if this is your first time hearing about self inquiry
it is your first time hearing about enlightenment this episode
will do very little for you the tips that I'm
going to be providing here are for people who are
already in the process of doing self inquiry on a
regular basis if you're one of those people then this
could help you a lot to stop chasing your tail
because if you have the wrong conceptions or expectations about
how this process works a you'll be very very frustrated
with it and B you will waste years literally years
needlessly chasing your own tail and before I give you
my tips let me point out that I have a
lot of other older episodes which introduce you to enlightenment
if this is something you're new to so make sure
you go watch those and make sure you go to
my forum actualised org slash forum into the spirituality and
meditation sub forum and there you will find at the
top pinned Leo's practical guide to enlightenment that's a big
long post that I wrote up with step-by-step instructions for
how I do self inquiry and that also addresses a
lot of the stuff so this episode here will just
kind of add on top of that guide alright so
here are my lessons this is stuff that I learned
along the way through reading a bunch of books and
also practicing this stuff myself and I'll be presenting them
that in no particular order but we do need to
start with something very fundamental which is the following tip
when you sit down to do yourself inquiry every day
as you probably should be doing by now I want
you to really ask yourself what is it exactly that
you think that you're gonna find what are you looking
for exactly what form will the answer that you're seeking
take it's important to think about this conceptually before you
begin this process because a lot of the mistakes and
the tail-chasing begins right here it's because you just tend
to assume that well what I'm looking for is some
sort of thing called enlightenment whatever the hell that is
and that's probably like some kind of like mystical experience
so let me go chasing and finding this mystical experience
and if you have that expectation then you're gonna be
sorely disappointed what you're actually looking for is you're literally
looking for formlessness don't just say yes I know that
you don't know that that's why you're struggling with this
thing you're looking for formlessness now what the hell is
formlessness well it's basically the exact opposite of anything that
you've ever encountered in your life the only things you've
encountered in your life are forms physical objects people emotions
feelings ideas beliefs models scientific theories all these are forms
you have to understand this this is critical to understand
so take all of those lump them all together everything
you've ever experienced in child life lump it all together
and put it right here on this side right it's
on this side what you're looking for when you're self
inquiring is not that none of that that might seem
obvious but really get this you have to get this
and you have to get it repeatedly over and over
again every time you sit down to self inquire you
have to remind you because you're going to forget because
your mind is addicted to focusing on forms that in
fact is all of the mind can accesses forms so
what you're being asked to do here is to do
the impossible the impasse here is to attain formlessness on
this side we've got formlessness what that is you don't
really know you can't know it has no qualities so
the thing you're looking for it's not big it's not
special it's not bright it's not dark it's not small
it's not skinny it's not thin it's not a positive
emotion it's not an experience it's none of that so
literally right now try to imagine something that has absolutely
no qualities and already you've failed because by imagining it
you gave it some kind of quality see so the
point of me telling you this is just so you
keep us in the back of your mind so that
when you're sitting down your mind you're gonna notice your
mind is clinging to stuff it's clinging to ideas it's
clinging to sensations to feelings to some mystical state that
you think you might be pursuing which will be in
turned into enlightenment you have to keep reminding yourself that
it's none of that stuff and just keep detaching detaching
detaching detaching from every single quality you can until you
somehow magically reach a state of formlessness and you just
have to trust that as possible it is possible many
people have done it but it's not possible if you
keep clinging to formed to form things to formed ideas
you're not gonna get there a good analogy that I
like is its it says if I told you that
you are gonna find a needle in a haystack and
that's your job and so you're gonna spend a lot
of time looking through this haystack for this needle but
the needle in this case that you're looking for is
that there is no needle it's this paradoxical twist this
mindfuck if you will the needle doesn't really exist and
yet you still have to look for it that's the
paradox of this thing and so what you got a
see because this thing that you're looking for it's a
formless needle what's a formless needle it's nothing it's not
there you can't find it really but you can't have
the realization that oh the needle is no needle and
that's why this stuff is so paradoxical and why Zen
masters give you these mind twister colons which kind of
screw with your mind and don't make any logical sense
that's right because how do you find a needle which
is no needle and the mistake would be to think
that all well if it's no needle leo then I
shouldn't even look that's a mistake if you don't look
you're not gonna find the no needle and it is
possible to find the no Neil the no needle is
not the same thing as not looking not looking is
what everybody else is doing and they're not enlightened another
tip I have for you is to stop looking for
the answer from other people don't ask me for the
answer don't ask some guru for the answer don't go
posting on the forums questions like well what is awareness
or what is consciousness or what is God or what
is the truth or what is the true self don't
ask these questions because when you're asking that question you're
assuming that someone can give you a verbal logical answer
you need to conceptually really understand that there is no
verbal answer to this question enlightenment is not a verbal
answer when you're sitting down to do self inquiry you
are not trying to get a logical or a verbal
or even a a mental image answer those things are
not enlightenment I know it's tempting to ask for the
answer but you know what it's not like people are
holding the answer back from you it's not like the
gurus it's just some [ __ ] who's sitting up
there on a pedestal and who's you know who has
the answer and if only you would ask him enough
times he would just give it to you if it
was like that somebody would just write at a book
and then I would tell you to go buy that
book and that's it this whole process would be very
simple it would be over there would be no challenge
about it everyone in the world would be enlightened already
no problem but that's not how it works so you
have to understand the thing you're looking for is not
a verbal answer so don't bother asking about it what
is awareness what is consciousness what is God what is
the true-self you don't know nor can you know until
you become enlightened and the only way that will happen
is if you sit down and you do this stuff
inquiry for yourself no one can help you no book
can help you no guru can help you nothing can
help you but you sitting down and doing it and
anything else that you try to do to try to
get an answer from somebody a tip from somebody all
of that you have to recognize that's a distraction while
you're doing that you're not doing self inquiry and that's
why you're not getting enlightened it's really that simple but
it's tricky to actually execute on this principle in practice
you have to notice yourself distracting with trying to get
the verbal answers and then just stop yourself force yourself
to stop and to turn inwards and to do this
process there is no short cutting this process every shortcut
you look for is just gonna make your journey longer
and the quicker you can realize that the easier this
will go for you I also want you to notice
that all ideas and all perceptions that you have are
not the thing you're looking for now this might sound
like I'm saying the same thing like I said before
but again in this work you have to just come
back to the obvious things over and over and over
again it's not enough just to hear them once you
have to come back to it every single time because
the problem is you hear it but you don't really
get it so I want you to deeply grasp that
this thing that we're talking about enlightenment it cannot be
symbolized it cannot be captured as a mental image it
cannot be scientifically modelled ever I'm not saying that no-one's
done it yet and that maybe in the future it
will happen I'm saying it's never going to ever happen
not in a billion years that's what I'm saying now
whether you believe me or trust me or not that's
another story I'm just telling you the way that it
is if you don't want to believe me fine you
can go wish your own time trying to symbolize and
conceptualize and rationalize enlightenment in the end you'll discover you
can't do it and how do I know because I've
spent many years trying to do it and once you
discover it for yourself in the non symbolized on conceptualized
form but in its actual form you will understand why
it can't be symbolized but until then you won't understand
why you're just have to trust me on that anything
that you can imagine is not it that's a very
important principle that can help you to cut through a
lot of [ __ ] when you're sitting to self
inquire that means every single idea or feeling or emotional
state that you have that you think oh maybe this
is it that's not it that really helps to cut
through a lot of crap if you keep that principle
in mind but it's also difficult because your mind is
so addicted to all these ideas and things that you
have in there that it doesn't want to let them
go and see what the mind is trying to do
is it just it incessantly tries to conceptualize and symbolize
enlightenment but it doesn't really grasp that it can't do
that it's not going to succeed so it just tries
and tries and tries and tries and tries in Zen
they have you do that over and over again for
thousands of hours until finally your mind gives up its
surrenders and it says [ __ ] I've completely failed
it's impossible and then that's usually when the Enlightenment happens
if you're still on this path but a lot of
people quit long before then here's another tip for you
this is a very important guiding principle of this process
it's that nothing is hidden and a corollary of that
is that nothing is elsewhere this is a principle it
has served me very very well because one of the
tricks to this process that you're gonna face is that
you're gonna be tempted to look for enlightenment somewhere else
as some hidden object out there behind the scenes somewhere
you're gonna look for it as though you're looking for
some magical animal like a you corne or some hidden
dimension or some kind of alien or some some kind
of thing of the mind or that it's somewhere else
it's in it's in you seen another dimension out there
it's in you know a fifth dimension of 6th dimension
it's in outer space somewhere thinking about it like this
that's not what it is nothing in his hidden nothing
is elsewhere it means that right now if you just
become conscious as much as you possibly can of the
present moment just do it right now become conscious of
this present moment right now exactly whatever you're experiencing that
right there this right here this right here this is
right now this is it this is what you're looking
for it's not somewhere else and it's not something different
than this this is enlightenment right here this is absolute
infinity what you're looking at right now me my face
my voice this happening right now all the thoughts in
your head whatever feelings you're having this consciousness you have
right now this is absolute infinity you're inside of absolute
infinity absolute infinity is nothing other than what you're seeing
every single second of every moment of your life you're
in it is the problem you're too close to it
is the problem it's not far away from you it's
too close to you you see you're in so deep
inside it that you don't see it for what it
really is so rather than looking somewhere else out there
behind the curtain the best approach is to actually become
very present to this moment right now and not to
go chasing some kind of mystical state or some kind
of positive feeling enlightened is not a positive feeling it's
what's happening right this second it's the very fabric of
reality itself its existence existing itself right now right here
this is it right here you need to remind yourself
of this over and over and over again as you
sit down it's not enough just to hear me say
it once it's not enough for you to sit down
and to do it once this should be the beginning
about single one here sits is that you remind yourself
that nothing is hidden nothing is elsewhere this right here
right now is infinity your job is to just become
conscious of that fact by just staying as present and
as conscious of the the very fact of existence right
now and just hone your mind on that without a
lot of distracting thoughts and ideas that's the essence of
this self inquiry process there are different angles you can
come at it from they're different questions you can ask
you can ask the question Who am I you can
ask the question what am I you can ask the
question what is reality you can ask the question what
is existence or what is God you know all these
questions but they ultimately all point and boil down to
the same thing just you're kind of approaching it from
different angles and I do recommend that you experiment with
different questions some questions might resonate with you more than
others some approaches will just be easier for you than
other ones and sometimes you get tired you want to
switch things up that's fine you don't need to stick
with just one question but regardless of what your question
is the process is basically just you becoming present to
what is actually happening right now in this moment that's
all that it is another tip that I have for
TIA is that you are not the body and you
are not the mind now this seems obvious by now
if you've heard me talking about enlightenment or you've heard
other people talking about enlightenment or you've read books about
enlightenment this should be obvious by now and that's basically
what enlightenment means so what is enlightenment enlightenment means that
you that you that you've always thought you were the
body and the mind maybe you think that what I
am is this this body here in this mind in
here that's talking right down to you that that's not
actually me and that's not actually you that's what alignment
means enlightenment means that this is an illusion that these
constructs of ourselves that we have that these are just
illusions and that reality as a whole is an illusion
and really what this is right now with what's happening
right here is just a dream reality is no different
from a dream that you have when you go to
sleep it's just a little bit more solid feeling but
actually it's possible to see through that solidity until you
realize that actually there's nothing solid about this moment right
now at all you think this is solid is just
a dream you're inside of a dream right now I'm
speaking to you inside of a dream and it's possible
to awaken from this dream that's what enlightenment is in
a nutshell but even though you probably know that already
I have to stress this point for you again and
you need to stress it every single time you sit
down and self inquire because what I'm saying here is
so [ __ ] significant it's so significant that is
very easily overlooked you are not the body and you
are not the mind do you realize how [ __
] significant that statement is now maybe you think I'm
full of [ __ ] and then I'm deluded and
that I'm wrong that's fine if you think that but
one of us is right or wrong here either you
are the mind in the body or you're not and
if you are then basically reality works the way you
think it works and then I'm wrong and everything that
you believed is fine and that basically you've got all
reality figured out but if what I'm saying happens to
be true maybe just maybe if what I'm saying happens
to be true then everything you've ever thought about life
is dead wrong you see that this statement that you
are not the body and you are not the mind
is the most significant statement that could probably ever be
told to a human being and yet when people sit
down and do enlightenment work or when they are on
the forums talking about enlightenment I see that they don't
grass significance of what they're really pursuing you are pursuing
the literal dis identification of yourself from your body and
from your mind do you fathom how significant that is
if it's true if it's possible now maybe it's untrue
maybe it's impossible it may be I'm full of [
__ ] but your job here if you take me
seriously if you take this work seriously is to prove
yourself wrong and to prove me right which means you
have to sit there for hours until you realize that
you're not the body in the mind now the claim
that I'm making is that it's possible for you to
realize that and when you do you'll be shocked and
it will be the most significant discovery you've ever made
in your life and it will turn your completely around
so what we're really talking about here is literal immortality
literal immortality understand how significant that is understand also how
big of a of a discovery and how big of
an accomplishment that is that's no little thing so if
it takes you a few years and a few thousand
hours of grinding away of confusion of frustration of of
pain of emotional labor to realize something like this is
that worth it do you think are you willing to
trade that for immortality I mean after all you can
invest a couple thousand hours playing video games very easily
many of you have or chasing girls or doing work
a lot of people waste thousands of hours every single
year working at some shitty lame job and they think
that all that's a good investment of my time in
my life energy but then when it comes enlightenment and
they need to put in a couple thousand hours of
work oh all of a sudden Oh leo no no
work no I'm not supposed to work for these sorts
of things these sort of things are just supposed to
happen to me they're supposed to land on my lap
there shouldn't be any seeking involved no work involved give
me a [ __ ] break when you truly appreciate
the significance of what you're doing here you start to
take your yourself inquiry much more seriously and also your
expectations change your motivations change when you grasp this is
the most significant thing you could possibly do in your
life then there's no longer a question about like well
when will I become enlightened will I become enlightened this
year or next year Leah what if it doesn't happen
to me there's no such questions anymore because this is
the most [ __ ] important thing you can do
in your life that means you're gonna do it no
matter what you're gonna do it if it takes you
50 years you're gonna do it it doesn't matter that
kind of motivation and commitment to this path only comes
when you realize the significance of what you're pursuing I
see that way too many people pursue enlightenment as though
it's just like oh it's just other goal it's like
yeah it's pursuing enlightenment is sort of like me learning
how to type or me finishing a big reading a
big book or me learning a new piece of software
you know it's like it's this you're comparing to this
this Flint these flimsy goals you need to you need
to really grasp the significance of what you're doing here
and every time you sit down you to realize that
I'm sitting here and I believe I really believe I
really feel in the heart of my hearts I feel
that I am the body and the mind if I'm
not the body in the mind what could I possibly
be it's insane to think that I could be anything
else this is ludicrous you need to think that every
time you sit down and then you need to realize
and tell yourself that you're wrong I'm wrong for believing
this I'm sitting here I'm believing a bunch of horseshit
the society has sped me I'm believing utter delusions that
I'm this body in the smut and I'm sitting here
and I'm believing it like a sucker I am a
total ignorant sucker like those stupid Mormons are those religious
people those Scientologists or those those people who lived two
three hundred years ago who were doing the witch trials
I'm just as ignorant as those people even more ignorant
because I'm sitting here and I've been told that I'm
not the body in the mind and I'm suspecting that
it's true and yet still I'm so ignorant I'm so
[ __ ] ignorant that I can't shake this belief
that's how every self inquiry session you sit down and
do should run if you're using your thoughts during self
inquiry this is what you should be using them for
use them to question everything that you hold certain about
reality and about you being a body and a mind
the advanced stages of self inquiry is just you sitting
there silently as silently as possible not saying anything to
yourself in your mind you're just sitting there and you're
just focusing on the present moment but before you get
there it's helpful perhaps for a year or two in
this process to use your thoughts because your thoughts are
gonna be turning you know you got the monkey mind
rolling around in there so since that thing is on
you might as well use that monkey mind for something
good and the one good thing you can use it
for is to really start to question these things and
so these conversations that I'm having with you this is
sort of the conversations that I have inside my head
when I'm doing self inquiry I sit there and I
think like how [ __ ] stupid am I to
believe that I'm the body and the mind I'm sitting
you're not [ __ ] believing it I'm I'm just
an idiot for believing this now of course you don't
want to go overboard with that and turn this into
into some neurotic you know guilt trip that you put
on yourself but hey you know sometimes you got to
do that sometimes if you sit there for 10 days
in a long deep retreat setting and by the end
of those 10 days you're still sitting there believing that
you're the body in the mind I mean it's like
god damn it how could I be so stupid you
know sometimes that's what you got saying sometimes saying that
to yourself really kind of wakes you up and like
the why am I so stupid why do I believe
it I'm the body of the mind and then your
mind starts to kind of like open up a little
bit more and that's what you're trying to do I
don't tip I have for you is that the very
crux of this enlightenment work is to challenge your very
identity how do you know that you're you how can
you trust your bodily feelings as a signifier of yourself
so usually when you ask somebody how do you know
you're you they said well I'm me of course I'm
me cuz look I can feel myself I'm talking right
now I'm moving my hands I'm feeling the thoughts inside
my head and my emotion so I'm feeling stuff so
that's what proves that I mean what could be more
obvious but you got to look deeper than that a
ski an even more fundamental question which is like how
do you know that the feelings that are being felt
right now by you which you claim are evidence for
your existence that those ceilings actually are you how do
you know that how do you know that you are
made out of feelings that you may are made out
of body sensations and that you are made out of
thoughts thought thought ideas that you have in your head
cuz that's what you're presently identified with but how do
you know that those things are what you actually exist
as you never questioned it you were just born and
one day you just sort of woke up and you
said yeah I am I am this body and these
feelings and these thoughts and you never gave it a
second thought again you just took it completely for granted
here what I want you to do is I want
you to really question that so actually pick a sensation
in your body maybe like pinch yourself a little bit
you know like pinch your arm or something and then
ask yourself like that pinch is that me how do
I know that's me I mean yeah I can feel
some pain but that pain that's being felt how do
I know that that's actually me after all when I
look at a table I don't say that I am
the table just because I see it so when I
feel a pain equally following that analogy when I'm what
I'm feeling this pain that doesn't necessarily prove that I
am the pain when I'm feeling my foot that doesn't
prove that I am the foot in the same way
that when I see a bird doesn't prove I'm a
bird so what criteria are you using to identify with
things and even perhaps more fundamentally ask yourself the question
how is it that identity comes about in the first
place at all how is it that a thing becomes
a thing who is determining identity does God have like
a logbook and he says that well this this object
here is clearly a bird and therefore it's a bird
and that object over there is a tree so clearly
it must be a tree and these are discrete objects
the bird is separate from the tree do you think
it works like that you think the universe or reality
has this sort of list somewhere so who is determining
these identities could it be that your own mind is
concocting the identity on the fly mmm interesting and interesting
possibility quite the mindfuck that would turn out to be
so the tip here is to challenge your very identity
every single time you sit down don't just think about
what is reality and what is god those can be
good to think about but you always have to go
wait a minute what do I really think that I
am and you have to be very honest about that
and stop bullshitting yourself about all the theories that you've
read you know people I get car tol a and
maybe myself and other folks and things you've read in
books have told you that all you are a spirit
or you are nothingness or you are everything or your
unity or you are God we told you all these
things these are just ideas for you you have to
drop all those ideas and you have to be very
honest first and foremost about what is your present identification
a lot of people don't even know this if you
ask the average person what is your present identification they're
gonna look at you stupid and you ask them are
you the body they'll say yes I am the body
and then you ask them so are you the arm
they say well no I'm not quite the arm okay
so you don't identify with it with being an arm
you identify them with what with being a body but
then is the arm part of the body yes it
is but then why don't you identify with it well
I don't know okay well so then maybe you're not
the arm and you're not the body maybe identify with
being something else like the heart or the mind okay
so yeah maybe I'm more like the mind but then
what is the mind which part of the mind exactly
are you defying with are you identifying with an image
of mental image of your body so if that mental
image isn't present this I mean you don't want exist
anymore when that image isn't present okay so that means
you can't be the image because the image isn't always
in your mind it's only in your mind sometimes yet
you were supposed to exist all the time so then
what really are you what are you identified with what
do you believe you are don't just say oh yeah
I'm just a human being I'm just a body that's
not specific enough you need to really drill down on
it because which we'll discover is that actually you don't
have a clear sense of it and that's part of
the problem part of the reason why you keep spinning
your wheels in this mud of self-inquiry is because you're
not being precise enough with yourself your mind is playing
very loose it's it's fudging the numbers as you're doing
this inquiry what it really helps is for you to
to pick a specific concrete sensation or object in your
present experience that you identify with like do you identify
with in itch on your foot and then ask yourself
am i that itch am i literally an itch is
that what I am am i an itch and then
you'll say no no I can't be an itch and
then you can ask yourself okay what about like my
hair do I identify with my hair am i literally
my head is that what I am is that I'm
a hair that's what I exist as as hair no
that doesn't sound right either because like I could shave
my head and then I don't have any hair and
then then you're like me and then so what do
you if I would then beanball I guess you can
add that to see and then and then just keep
that process going and eventually you'll you'll kind of distill
it down to still it down and every that you
think you might be you'll realize no it can't be
it and this can't be it and that can't be
it and so none of it is it so then
what the hell am I what why do I even
believe I exist if I can't find myself you need
to go through that process be very careful not to
fall into the trap of saying like oh yeah Lia
okay yeah I know I'm not any of those things
so let me just go straight to to discovering that
I'm nothing no that doesn't work that doesn't work at
all because while you're doing that intellectually actually deep down
in your heart you're believing that you're the body or
that you're the mind or that you're a thought or
that you're your life story or that you're you're the
image of your face in your mind you need to
go through all those different facets systematically and eliminate those
and you have to actually go through the process of
elimination if you try to skip that because you want
to shortcut the process you're gonna do the exact opposite
it's gonna take you even longer because what you need
to do is you need to actually expose your mind
to the fact that you're all your identification czar false
which means you have to go through it like a
mathematical proof if you wanted to to be certain that
a mathematical proof is wrong you would have to go
through it point by point and actually isolate the exact
errors in the proof it wouldn't be enough to just
kind of give it a cursory overview and say oh
yeah this is wrong or yeah I already know the
answer I already know it's wrong so that's good enough
for me no that doesn't work if you do that
you're just gonna trick yourself and your old identification is
gonna still stay there this is why I'm really stressing
this point again the principle of this tip is challenge
the core of your very identity every single time you
sit down when you really do this not just intellectually
but really you're really challenging your very identity when you
sit down to self inquire you have to do it
with such gravity that if you if you keep doing
it you will literally cease to exist your very existence
is on the line which is not you just sitting
and philosophizing oh yeah maybe we're in the matrix maybe
I'm not the body maybe something maybe this maybe that
maybe I'm God no no no no it's like when
you're sitting down to do this inquiry I want you
to question the very floor you're sitting on with such
conviction that when you question it enough there's a possibility
that the [ __ ] floor can stop existing because
you're gonna ask yourself the question wait a minute is
there actually a floor under my feet and then you're
gonna actually think about that and really try to connect
with that floor and if you realize there is no
[ __ ] floor that floor is gone you fall
through same thing with your body I want you to
sit down and ask yourself am I really my body
with such seriousness that if it dawns on you that
there is no such thing as a body your body
literally disappears at that moment that's what we're talking about
we're talking about taking this questioning to an existential level
where the actual physical fabric of space and time and
your body is all called into question so in a
sense you're doing this inquiry but really you're doing physics
you see that you're doing physics I mean more accurately
you're doing metaphysics but the problem with calling in metaphysics
is that we think of metaphysics as just some theory
no no no no when you do metaphysics properly you're
actually going below physics and you're actually dissolving the physical
fabric of space-time I'm not [ __ ] with you
this is this is outrageous [ __ ] I know
it sounds outrageous it's outrageous what I'm saying is outrageous
if anything I'm saying here is true it's it's absolutely
outrageous I know I'm saying that I know it sounds
insane but hey this is what [ __ ] enlightenment
is about you got to do it seriously otherwise you're
not really doing it it's not enough just to sit
there to think about [ __ ] that's not gonna
do it not at all don't try to pretend that
you're nothing you've heard that you're nothing you've heard that
enlightenment is the truth of nothingness but here's a very
important tip for you the nothing that gurus talk about
when they talk about the nothingness of God or the
nothingness of enlightenment or the nothingness of the true self
that is not the nothing of the regular English term
nothing the regular English term nothing is not what we're
talking about this is a special you might call it
a technical term within the non-dual vocabulary it's called nothing
but it's not that nothing you're thinking of not at
all in fact if you ever happen to become conscious
of this nothing with a capital n the nothing that
is God it will feel to you like you were
deceived by these gurus it's not gonna feel to you
like nothing at all it's gonna feel to you like
everything the exact opposite of what you thought it was
is how it's gonna actually play out for you and
that will be a rude awakening because you'll wonder why
do they call it nothing they should have called it
everything and then of course you'll realize yeah they did
call it everything they also called it God and you'll
realize why that term is appropriate but you can't possibly
appreciate that now so this whole notion of you pretending
like you're nothing it's not working it's actually hurting you
just be honest about what you presently are attached to
being and then start questioning that and then whatever materializes
from that whatever the truth happens to be try to
track that truth and let it permeate you rather than
coming in here with a some concept of like I'm
God I'm nothing these are just ideas they mean absolutely
nothing and in fact they're they're really holding you back
the next very important tip I have for you is
focus on what is actual when you sit down to
self inquire again this sounds very simple but I want
you to try to do this right now you're sitting
here right now listening to me I would like you
to train your awareness right now train it on what
I'm gonna call actuality actuality this isn't actual actual actual
is right here try to make a conceptual distinction in
your mind between actual and everything else ideas about the
future about the past concept theories all this sort of
stuff that's not actual actual right here actual get actual
become conscious right now of actuality and you need to
do this every single time that you sit down to
self inquire remind yourself oh yeah I got to focus
on what's actual nothing in here actual actual is out
here actual is all this is salt actual what's happening
here that's not actual this right here actual these hands
as I'm feeling as I'm look this is actual actual
see that focus on that that's what you're focusing on
when your mind goes into fairytale land into concept land
bring it back to actual actual is not an idea
not a belief not a theory not a model not
a speculation not an intuition not an emotion not a
feeling not a state not a logical conclusion it's actual
actual get that to sit a little bit right now
to make sure you understand what actual means the next
tip I have for you is the distinction between content
versus existence itself so when you are lost and self
inquiry and you're struggling you're just spinning your wheels the
reason that's happening is because you're getting lost and attached
to various content within reality content within reality is pretty
much all forms we've already talked about this but let's
talk about it now as content content is the stuff
so if you think of reality as a giant screen
like a TV screen on the TV screen you have
all sorts of content you have an apple you have
a person you have a tree you have a car
you have a movie you have a girl crying you
have a car getting blown up you have some drama
you have some action you have all this stuff happening
that's the content the pixels of the screen itself represent
existence itself you see the pixels can take on any
number of colors and they can represent infinite content a
TV can display an infinite number of images and in
this self-inquiry process the whole trick of it is is
that when you're sitting out to do it you need
to focus on the pixels of the screen rather than
the content that's being displayed on the pixels and it's
very easy to get confused between those two so right
now try this just for a second I would like
you to train your awareness move it off of the
content of your consciousness and put it on existence itself
the very fact that there is existence happening right now
put your attention on that notice that the fat of
existence itself is not any piece of content it's not
an object it's not a tree it's not my face
it's not my voice it's not a feeling in your
body there is just the fact of existence itself try
to put your attention on that for a moment and
begin to wonder what the hell is that and you
should notice that it's a it's a sort of slippery
thing it's you can't really grasp but you can't really
what is it you can't really put your mind around
you put your arms around you can't really point to
what existences and yet nevertheless there's just this overwhelming sense
of existence there so try putting your attention on that
rather than the content of your mind or the content
of the external world around you and the more you
do that within self inquiry the better off your self
inquiry will be here's another tip that I have for
you this helps to Center you when you're getting lost
and in the midst of a flurry of activity mental
activity within self inquiry remind yourself that enlightenment is the
one and only one constant that is constant across every
single moment of life to me this is a very
helpful pointer and reminder which means that if I think
that enlightenment is something less some emotional state or all
yeah I have enlightened it's a state I have it
I have it right here if I think that then
this pointer helps me to realize no that can't be
it because I didn't have just a moment ago if
I have it now but I didn't have it a
moment ago that means it's not a constant in Lineman
doesn't change with time the thing you're looking for is
eternal it's ever-present it's the only one thing which is
invariable across all of time and all of space realize
how [ __ ] significant this is as well what
I am saying here in other words is that there
is a thing we'll call it a thing for now
but it's not really think there is a thing thing
in quotes there exists a thing which is constant and
which was there before the Big Bang it was there
before you were born it was there when you were
asleep tonight it will be there when you wake up
tomorrow and it will be there when you're lying in
a coma and it will be there after your body
and your mind died that thing is what you're looking
for the one constant across everything now that's pretty outrageous
for me to claim that there is such a thing
how could that be how could such a thing exist
and if it is there then why is this so
goddamn hard to find shouldn't it then be here why
is it not here well maybe it is here maybe
you're just not seeing it maybe here is exactly what
we're talking about maybe it's not hidden maybe it's not
elsewhere like I said before see so use this to
ground your inquiry and to cut out all the [
__ ] any kind of Smith's tickle state you have
that's not [ __ ] it because it comes and
it goes it comes and it goes that means it's
not enlightenment try this right now I would like you
to try blinking your eyes open and close your eyes
and notice that as you close your eyes everything in
front of you all the perceptions that were there they
all disappear all the objects any lights trees cars people
cats animals coffee tables bookshelves computers smartphones anything that was
there in your visual field it all disappears when you
close your eyes which should tell you based on this
principle that none of those objects can be the thing
you're looking for so I want you to again rapidly
try to close and open your eyes and as you
do that I want you to pay attention to the
fact that all these perceptions which are changing for you
right now as you're blinking your eyes that these are
all perceptions and every single perception always changes it comes
and goes perceptions were not there before you were born
that means what that means perceptions are not enlightenment ideas
did not exist before you were born that means what
ideas are not enlightenment your body did not exist before
you were born what does that mean that means it's
not enlightenment it's not you what you are is what
existed before you were born now I know that sounds
nonsensical but yeah that's the paradox of it that's just
because you've identified yourself with something that is temporary and
that's what this process is about is helping you to
change that identification you are misidentified with being a body
in a mind now try turning your head from left
to right to left to right notice as you're turning
your head like this objects are literally disappearing from your
visual field and reappearing as that is happening I want
you to ask yourself what's the one constant because all
your perceptions are changing all the time they're not constant
you don't have a single constant perception your perceptions of
your body are not constant you might think they are
but they're not your perceptions of your heart your mind
your body everything all all your bones and all the
organs you have everything you think that is truly deeply
you all those perceptions change all the time when you're
deep and sleep you don't feel any of those things
and when you're turning your head like this all these
objects are appearing and disappearing they're literally being created and
destroyed as you turn your head so none of them
can be you you are the one thing which is
not created or destroyed that's what enlightenment is about finding
that thing the next tip I have for you is
this distinction between observation versus trying to figure it out
I want you to make this distinction so when you're
sitting down to do your inquiry if you're like me
and you're very conceptually minded then you're gonna have a
strong desire to sit there to figure out this puzzle
of enlight how could it be and you ask yourself
all these questions you try to model everything together well
God is like this and like that and that means
this and you're trying to figure it out that's not
gonna work and I want you to understand that it
will never ever ever work you're not going to figure
it out and if there's an alternative that you could
be doing which is observation the difference between observation figuring
it out is that to figure something out you're sitting
there and you're you're sort of modeling it whereas observation
is you're just looking at the damn thing you're not
figuring anything out about it so what I would suggest
you do is to move your inquiry away from figuring
it out more towards observation and this is something that
will naturally happen as your self inquiry habit develops and
progresses over the years the first year you do it
there's gonna be a lot of you trying to figure
it out the mind is just not gonna be able
to stop he's gonna be trying to figure everything out
over time yeah you'll figure some stuff out but you're
not gonna get enlightenment so there's some use in doing
the figuring out because you get some conceptual understandings of
where you're going wrong maybe you figure out some aspect
of your psychology that was helpful to you to figure
out but um but really what's gonna happen naturally is
you're gonna drop the figuri now you're gonna move towards
observation where you just sit and just you observe what
are you observing are you observing physical objects no are
you observing your body no are you observing your mind
no you're just observing existence itself or in other words
awareness you're observing awareness it's awareness trained upon itself and
then you just continue with this very patient observation this
is a very important point that I don't want you
to overlook which is that you need to start to
trust in pure observation the power of pure observation is
remarkable but it's difficult to convey this to a newbie
who hasn't done a lot of observation because it's hard
for the mind to grasp like how good observation change
anything how good observation reveal anything monumental to me and
the secret missing ingredient is just time and focus with
a lot of focus and a lot of patience and
enough time you need to trust that pure observation will
produce huge for you but it will only happen slowly
and gradually and you need to you need to be
able to have that long-term perspective and to see that
yeah it's gonna take a while but let me just
keep observing I'm just gonna observe I'm just gonna be
I'm not gonna go figuring stuff I'm not gonna go
into monkey mind I'm not gonna go distract I'm just
gonna sit and observe and I'm gonna trust that it's
going to produce for me and eventually it will produce
for you this is such an important point that I
actually brought a little visual aid for you to show
you how this really works here's the power of pure
observation and here's why it requires so much patience what
I have here is I have a rock and what
I have here is I have a feather it's actually
a real ostrich feather so here's how pure observation and
self inquiry works it's like taking a rock and then
eroding it into nothingness using a so here's me mimicking
the process of self-inquiry ready like that until this rock
is completely gone so now you can see why this
is such a challenging process even though it's very simple
there's nothing very complicated about this but you can see
why so few people do it and succeed at it
because it requires enormous patience an enormous foresight to just
be able to sit there and just to observe and
just observe and observe existence for so long that eventually
everything your roads that's what's going on here I want
you to try to get an intuitive grasp of what
consciousness is versus thinking so there's thinking you can think
about consciousness which is different from consciousness itself and it's
really hard for me to communicate how to do this
and the best thing I can tell you is just
go take us some psychedelics and psychedelics will very quickly
show you the difference between thinking and between consciousness but
you can try to get a little bit of this
little taste of consciousness by just doing the following right
now I would like you to become conscious of the
fact that you exist do it and notice a subtle
difference a subtle shift that happened in you you were
just sitting there doing your regular stuff and now all
of a sudden you became a little bit conscious of
hey yeah this is existence and there's just a very
subtle very very faint shift in consciousness when you did
that so it's like that you want to get an
intuitive grasp or just how to go straight to consciousness
it's hard to do because really consciousness has no it
has no form and it's like you you can't talk
about it really and you can't you can't really point
to it so how do you tell a person to
just go straight to raising your consciousness they don't know
what to do they know how to raise their arm
you know how to raise their tongue or raise their
voice but they don't know how to raise their consciousness
and that's because they don't have much experience with different
degrees of conscious they're mostly in the same one degree
of consciousness their whole life so that they don't really
have anything to compare it to which is why psychedelics
are so powerful because they will boost your conscience and
you'll see they boost your conscience so quickly that just
within a matter of thirty minutes you'll be able to
see your consciousness kind of go hmm OOP and you
believe wait a minute where did that come from how
did my conscience just rise like that and then now
falls back down how did that happen and if you
do enough of those trips you start to get a
sort of an intuitive grasp for just what consciousness is
and you just could go straight to it and then
just sort of like you can actually just sit there
in corner and just tell yourself okay let me just
elevate my consciousness right now and just it sort of
starts to happen but that requires quite a bit of
training or some tripping another tip that I'll have for
you is make sure you challenge the naive realist paradigm
I have an episode about the I think it's called
a rant against naive realism naive realism basically is just
your belief that there is a physical reality which is
described by modern scientific physics and that there actually is
a physical world there's a universe this universe came out
of the Big Bang and there are physical objects that
exist and so on and so forth all this is
just not true but it feels true to you because
you're buying into this paradigm so besides just questioning yourself
what you really need to question you need a question
physics itself the tip I have for you here is
that stop thinking of reality as a physical system you
are not inside of a physical system you are inside
of a hallucination machine reality is not made of a
bunch of particles or physical objects reality is made out
of a collection of hallucinations what you're experiencing right now
is a loosen ation literally I'm not being cute or
poetic here I'm being literal everything you're seeing right now
and everything you've ever seen is a hallucination and in
fact there is nothing real within reality all it is
is just it's a set of hallucinations dreams this is
just a dream physics is a dream the brain is
a dream your birth is a dream your entire life
is a dream dream and hallucination are the exact same
thing the tactical definition of hallucination is a perception without
substance and that's exactly what you're experiencing right now that's
what this is perception with no substance there's no substance
to this right now whatsoever it's got exactly as much
substance as last night's dream it just feels a little
different part of this dream that you're in right now
is that it's physical that's part of the dream doing
physics that's doing physics in the dream believing you have
a brain which renders your consciousness that is just part
of the dream there is no brain there's just a
dream of a brain there is no birth of you
and your body and your mind there's just a dream
of a birth of you your body and your mind
see so start to replace this naive physicalist conception of
reality with instead this notion of of just dreams and
now you might wonder well Leo where are these dreams
taking place and what I'm telling you is that they're
not taking place anywhere literally nowhere they are not taking
place in a brain they are just dreams that's what
reality is is just dreams dreams without any infrastructure software
without any Hardware hallucinations with no substance behind them there
is no reality there is only illusion that's what you're
going to discover in this inquiry let me give you
some more quick tips one of them being that there
is no way or process towards enlightenment there is no
magic technique no technique actually we'll get you there techniques
increase your odds but there is no one way or
process to get to enlightenment enlightenment is an a process
thing there is no process to get to it it's
a discontinuous jump so just remember that as you're stressing
out over which process to use remember also as a
tip that enlightenment is totally outside of your rational mind
you will not be able to grasp it rationally I'm
sorry you're just not going to be able to do
it what you need to do is you need to
drop your expectations and demands for rationalism another tip for
you to remember that's very important is that the actual
moment of enlightenment is not up to you you cannot
will it you cannot make it happen it actually is
just a fortunate accident now it's a fortunate accident but
you can still increase your odds of having this fortunate
accident in the same way that if you wanted to
get struck by lightning you can go up on a
tall mountain with a big iron rod in the middle
of a lightning storm and your chances of getting struck
by lightning would be a lot higher than normal but
it would still be a fortunate accident if you actually
got struck there is nothing you could literally do to
force the lightning to strike you it has to come
to you but you can certainly increase the odds quite
a bit that's why we're doing the self inquiry in
the first place that's the equivalent of you standing up
there on a mountain with a giant iron rod another
tip I have for you is remember that no self
is equivalent to the true self so sometimes you'll hear
enlightenment teachers talking about the self doesn't exist don't exist
the truth of no self the buddha discovered the truth
of no self buddhism teaches the void the the fact
that there is no self and then you hear other
enlightenment teachers or gurus talking about the true self the
only thing that exists is the self the self is
the true self the Atman the Brahman you are it
you are God the I am and you hear both
these teaching and they seem like completely opposite how could
one people set of people claim that enlightenment as this
and another people say that its exact opposite how can
this be this is crazy why can't they agree with
each other actually they're in complete agreement they're talking about
the exact same thing they're just different sides of the
same coin you can look at enlightenment from these two
perspectives you can look at it as nothing or as
everything as no self as true self as you not
existing as you being the only thing that does exist
and both can be useful depending on the student you're
working with if we have a student who is really
attached to the idea of the true self then it
helps to tell him the exact opposite it helps to
tell him hey buddy you don't exist there is no
such thing as a self that really [ __ ]
with his notions of this true self because his notions
of true self are just ideas he has no [
__ ] idea what the true self is conversely if
someone keeps saying oh I don't exist I don't exist
I don't exist you can tell this person but what
about the true self notice that you are the only
thing that does exist and then that person's ideas of
no self get [ __ ] with see cuz in
both cases the problems that students get attached to the
ideas so we have different pointers oftentimes opposite pointers which
are pointing to the same thing so don't get lost
in the words don't get lost in the images you
have to be able to read between the lines and
to see what the teacher or the teaching is ultimately
trying to get you to see also keep in mind
as a pointer or as a tip that many valid
paths exist towards enlightenment there is not one path and
there's certainly not one best path it all depends on
you where you're at life your situation your circumstances and
all that sort of thing so follow your own path
whatever feels the most appropriate to you realistically there's no
way you can know which path will work the best
for you you just have to go through it through
trial and error and just see you'll notice after you
try a path for a while whether it's um it's
resonating with your personality or not and stop wasting your
time criticizing other paths this is a complete distractions totally
useless stop arguing about which path is the best path
who's right who's wrong my guru is better than your
guru this book is better than that book this teacher
is wrong this teacher is right stop all that [
__ ] that is just complete nonsense complete nonsense follow
your own path avoid all the traps and one of
the biggest traps is all the distractions that you create
for yourself another tip I have for you is be
careful with mechanical meditation end or inquiry you start to
develop this habit of meditation often times what it does
it just becomes mechanical after a few years you're just
sitting down you're doing it and actually the whole point
of meditation is to make you more conscious but when
you sit down and do it mechanically actually you're doing
it mindlessly and so actually it's making you less conscious
but because you call it meditation and you're actually sitting
down in a formal posture and you look like you're
meditating and you're calling it meditation then you make yourself
think that oh yeah I'm actually raising my awareness no
you're not the only time you're raising your awareness is
actually when you're aware be aware right now that is
what meditation is supposed to be about don't get lost
in the and the outer garments of what meditating is
it's not about the sitting it's not about any kind
of technique if you distill meditation down to its very
essence all it's trying to do is just to make
you as aware as humanly possible try it right now
with no techniques forget all techniques forget the word meditation
just for the next five seconds be as aware as
humanly possible go do it right now you got that
that's all that meditation is pointing you towards keep doing
that if you're doing that then you're meditating another tip
I have for you is that long stretches of focus
are required to make serious traction with this work if
you are meditating or self inquiring for 30 to 60
minutes every day that's good that's a good baseline but
that's not enough you need to be doing at least
a couple of retreats per year where you sit down
for 10 days straight 12 hours a days straight with
no stopping at all self inquiring or meditating you really
need that what you'll discover is that a 10-day retreat
like that is worth much more than a year of
one hour since much more because you're building momentum and
then your your focus just it becomes like a laser
beam and you're just you're breaking through all the mental
obstacles your quieting down the mind and that's when big
breakthroughs happen it's very unlikely that you'll just get a
breakthrough on a 30-minute sit it's just not mean it
can happen but it's not realistic and you know if
you really want to increase your odds then start doing
these retreats and in fact these retreats I would say
are more important than your daily sits although ideally you
should be doing both the daily sets and the retreats
another tip I have for you is that terror and
fear are a good sign if you're self inquiring and
you start to notice your heart pounding really quickly like
you're about to die don't stop that's enlightenment you're almost
there the terror is a sign that you're getting there
how do you work through this terror there's no there's
no magic way you are gonna have to die there
is no getting to enlightenment without the death of you
hate to break it to if that's how it's gonna
be so you don't have to just push push push
against that barrier of terror until finally you just get
it gather enough balls to break through it so it'll
and you know after 10 or 20 of those you
know terror-filled moments and then backing down and backing down
you're just gonna get tired of backing down and say
[ __ ] this I'm just gonna do it and
you just do it and then you see that there
was nothing really to be terrified about but it's gonna
feel very real it's gonna feel like death it's gonna
feel like a panic attack so be warned about that
don't don't think you're doing anything wrong if you're feeling
that very important tip for you that I have is
that a flash experience is not enlightenment if it passes
so if you have some sort of mystical breakthrough you
have a kind of glimpse maybe you have someone this
unifying moment that's great but then let's say the next
day you wake up and it's gone what do you
have you don't have it maybe you had it but
you lost it which means you don't have it so
it's nice I mean those breakthrough experiences are great nothing
wrong there that means you're making progress but it ain't
the end your job is to go until it never
leaves you you're after something that's constant this thing enlightenment
it survives death if what you've got doesn't survive death
and if it doesn't survive a night's sleep and if
it doesn't survive someone stepping on your toe or someone
no you know spinning on your car then it ain't
enlightenment enlightenment was there before you were born it'll be
there after you die so go for umm go for
the Big Cheese don't get fooled with an initial first
glimpse oftentimes on this path people encounter a first glimpse
then they close down their ego comes back and they
think oh that's it I must have gotten it or
even if they have some kind of permanent realization well
that's it I've got it I've got it I'm enlightened
no you have to realize that there are many degrees
of this thing called enlightenment you probably can't even fathom
the deepest degrees that are possible so to be safe
what I tell people and what what I follow myself
in my own life is that you don't know how
deep the rabbit-hole goes you don't know how many degrees
of depth there are to this thing called enlightenment so
every single glimpse you get is great you can celebrate
that you can be happy about that but always assume
that it goes deeper and that you are not done
with your work you keep doing the work you keep
doing the work you keep doing the work until you
have a breakthrough so big that your life is over
you'll know when you have a breakthrough so big that
life as you know it is over it's just [
__ ] over you're not there yet if you're there
you're gonna stop watching me so don't worry you're not
there yet you probably won't get there for your entire
life so keep chipping away at it I'm telling you
this thing goes much much deeper than you ever imagined
even if you had a few glimpses that's still not
as deep as it goes it goes [ __ ]
deep it goes infinitely deep until you've hit that deepest
infinity keep going don't stop I highly recommend as a
tip that you train up your mindfulness abilities with the
mindfulness with labeling technique that I talked about in my
mindfulness meditation episode go check out that episode a very
very powerful technique very powerful technique go do that technique
for a while do that technique it'll really build up
your mindfulness that will really help you with self inquiry
I really want to warn you again about watching out
for distractions on this path like a hawk what's gonna
be happening is that the more progress you make the
more distracted you will tend to want to become if
the ego is very tricky and for every big breakthrough
there's gonna be a flood of distractions and your ego
will come up with a very clever sneaky distractions very
good well justified distractions for why you should quit this
process your job is to never allow yourself to get
distracted for any significant length of time yeah you'll get
distracted here and there you might lose a few days
here you might lose a week there you might even
lose a month but then you [ __ ] come
back because you're watching for distractions like a hawk the
idea is not that you can prevent every distraction the
idea here is that you just commit to never letting
a distraction knock you off the path permanently so you're
always coming back always coming back always coming back even
if you're falling off and you're failing and if you
do that then eventually you'll succeed and eventually the distractions
will die down but especially at the beginning there will
be so many distractions you'll have so many urges that
have urges for sex for food for moving to a
new house for working on your business for finding a
new career for family for having children for for for
playing games I think it'll be infinite you'll have infinite
distractions you need to see through those distractions as just
part of the defense mechanism here of your psyche protecting
you from getting towards enlightenment I've already mentioned that psychedelics
are a very powerful tool I highly recommend that if
you're serious about self inquiry that you do them at
least a little bit just so that they can quickly
show you what you're actually after once you see it
a few times through psychedelics you don't even need to
take them anymore then you can self inquire and you
kind of know what you're shooting for until then you
can waste years chasing your tail so just a couple
of psychedelic sessions with mushrooms LSD or DMT or whatever
can can help you there a lot although of course
it's not necessary you don't need to do them so
don't feel like I'm pushing them on you if you
want to do it the old-school way go [ __
] do it the old-school way do it the Buddhist
way do it the Christian way do it whatever way
you want to do it you certainly don't need to
do psychedelics it's perfectly normal to feel stuck in this
process to feel confused to feel very very frustrated get
used to that it's gonna happen a lot this work
requires enormous patience just like the feather in the rock
remember and lastly the tip I have for you is
just keep reminding yourself at the end of every session
or maybe at the beginning of every session that you
do is that this will be worth it you're after
the big cheese here this is the answer to life
this is the answer to what is reality to what
is God to what is existence to why you were
born to why you will die or maybe why you
won't die this is the answer to everything this is
it it will be more worth it than I could
communicate to you if I had two hours to rave
about how worth it it is it'll be more worth
than that it is the single largest thing that could
possibly be it is absolute infinity it is everything possible
given to you all at once you will receive in
return for this investment of time and effort and frustration
and emotional labor you will receive the entirety of reality
all at once but you're gonna have to put in
the work before you get there and in a sense
that's what will make this whole gift of infinity all
the more sweeter because you had the vision you had
the wisdom you had the foresight to go out there
and to make it happen even though you didn't know
if it was really gonna pan out even though it
sounded way too good to be true even though it
sounded absurd and ridiculous you and out you did it
and you earned infinity through a true desire for truth
a true leap of faith and then following up on
a leap of faith with real challenging work the most
challenging work that a human being can do and that's
it those are my tips for yourself acquiring all right
I'm out of here please remember to click that like
button for me make sure you go to actualize or
go look at my forum check out the practical guide
to enlightenment that I have there you can ask questions
there people can help you there if you have any
kind of intelligent questions to ask check out my life
purpose course check out my book list a lot of
important books on my book less they can help you
with this journey just to get a conceptual understanding of
what we're talking about here with enlightenment and check out
my blog as well and I'll be adding more resources
in the future and the last thing I want to
tell you is that there is no such thing as
talking about enlightenment I don't like to talk about enlightenment
because there's really nothing to talk about either you're gonna
do this inquiry process or you're not if you're not
doing it then you're just bullshitting which is the exact
opposite of what enlightenment is about so if you're not
doing it just stop wasting your time stop talking about
it go play video games go pursue sex or money
or whatever you want to do go just do basic
personal development work if you want to do that and
stop wasting your [ __ ] time with this bullshitting
and mental masturbation and if you are doing it then
continue to do it or begin doing it right now
starting today or tomorrow and just keep doing it and
stop talking about it so much you don't need to
talk about it all the energy and time you're wasting
talking about it on the forum when you don't have
any legitimate questions to ask it's just waste it's just
a distraction there's no point to it and there's no
point just watching videos of gurus talking about and let
there's no point and there's no point in just reading
books and books and books about enlightenment enlightenment enlightenment is
just it's completely pointless you're doing this inquiry seriously or
you're not it's just that simple so I hope that
you are doing it seriously and I look forward to
bringing you more insights to come in future you
