Hey,this is Leo for actualized.org and in this episode, I'm
going to be talking about the meditation technique called Strong
Determination sitting and I'm gonna show you how to use
this one technique to supercharge your existing meditation practice Let's
talk about Strong Determination Sitting This is a technique that's
very, very simple but also incredibly powerful if you can
apply it in your life and I'm gonna show you
exactly how to apply it right here I learned this
technique from Shinzen Young,who's a Zen master but he's a
very interesting Zen master because he's a Westerner and in
the 1960's and 70's he went to Japan and he
actually became an ordained Buddhist monk and he was in
the Zen monasteries and he learned everything there and then
also what he did he started studying enlightenment and other
spiritual traditions around the whole world and he basically came
up with this model for mindfulness which is just amazing,you
can go learn it from him but anyways...what I wanna
talk about here is this Strong Determination Sitting which I
learned from him, and he's a proponent of this in
fact, the whole Zen tradition is a big proponent of
Strong Determination Sitting what I love about this technique is
that it shows you just how weak our minds are
in Western cultures So, in cultures that don't have any
strong spiritual or meditation traditions so, basically cultures outside of
China,India,Nepal,Japan and Southeast Asia, where meditation is very seriously practiced
cultures outside of that generally are extremely ignorant about what's
possible with the human mind what's possible with human consciousness,it's
incredible and...Shinzen Young, he likes to talk about the Marathon
Monks and there was actually a book written about this
in the late '80's, it's called 'The Marathon Monks of
Mount Hiei' and this is just incredible what these monks
can do these monks have endurance beyond what you would
think is humanly possible what these monks do is that
they isolate themselves for a period of twelve years on
this cold mountain near Kioto,it's called Mount Hiei this is
a process that you enter into, and you make a
lifelong vow of celibacy, so you abstain from sex and
you abstain from drinking and all that kind of stuff
but...that's just the beginning of it they enter this for
twelve years, for twelve years they live on that mountain
and they have pretty much no contact with anybody else
and all they do is they train hardcore Zen Buddhism
and, the things that these monks go through as a
training process is incredible the way that it works is
that every year that they're on that mountain they have
a 100-day cycle per year and what they have to
do, is they have to make a journey all the
way down the mountain they have to walk or run
down the mountain in these straw, wooden sandles that they're
wearing they walk for 30 to 60 kilometers in one
day, down the mountain, and then through the city and
into the temples and then they make like offerings in
the temples and as they're doing all this, they have
to be meditating towards enlightenment the whole time and then
they make that round trip down and then up the
mountain they have to do this in one day,they have
to walk like 30 to 60 kilometers it takes them
twenty hours to do this walk as they're walking...they're not
eating,they're not drinking, they're not resting,they're not sleeping they're in
a meditative enlightenment trance the whole way now that's one
day...they do that for a 100 days in a row
and then they do that each year,and then like during
one of the years they have to do it I
think for like 200 days,and they're doing like 60 kilometers
per day it's incredible, it's a feat that trained professional
athletes could not accomplish it's more than running one marathon,except
they do it 100 times in a row and sometimes
they do a double marathon not only that, but then
what else they have during these years is they have
these sits where they have to sit and what they
have to do is they have to sit motionless while
they're reciting a mantra and they're meditating and they have
to sit there and they have two monks who are
sitting next to the one monk who's doing this process
and they watch him and he has to sit there,
he can't eat,sleep,drink water, or move for 7 and a
half days imagine that...how long do we think we need
water before we die? 3 days?4 days?That's usually what they
tell you in the books These monks can sit for
7 and a half days without water,without sleep and without
food and basically without motion...they get up once at 2
am per day in order to travel 200 meters to
make some sort of ritual offering of water somewhere in
the fountain, and then they come back and they sit
back down and then 2 monks sit there and make
sure that this monk is not falling asleep during this
process not only do they do that,but they're not sitting
there and grinding through this but they're actually sitting there
with a smile on their face and enjoying this process
because they're completely in this otherworldy enlightenment trance they're just
trained so rigorously for this...they do this for 12 years
not only that...but as they're making that walk down and
up the mountain for 100 days they're given a knife,
a small knife that they carry with them and if
ever they should get the urge to quit or to
stop this walk then they're supposed to cut themselves open
and kill themselves So, those are the marathon monks Now...what
I like about hearing these kinds of stories is like
holy fuck,first of all it's incredible that it's even physically
and medically possible to do for a human body you
would think it pushes the limit of what science tells
us we can do by the way, you can actually
watch monks performing this ritual of sitting for 7 and
a half days So, it's not just some tall tale
that they tell you,like sometimes they'll tell you some tall
tails about Spiritual things that people have done like yogis
have done this or done that No this is actually
a public process you can actually watch them doing this
So...it's not just a tall tale but, what's great about
these kinds of stories is it tells you about how
serious you can be about this process of Enlightenment,also how
serious you can be about meditation and how far that
can take you So...let's talk about Strong Determination Sitting...what is
this? Well it's not quite as intense as what these
monks do but it's a little bit towards the intense
side of what you can do with meditation and this
right here can be a fast track path towards Enlightenment
if you're really interested in that,and you know,before...in my previous
episodes I've talked about how you can reach Enlightenment through
something called self Inquiry or what I call 'the looking
process', and I've done other videos on other meditation techniques
but here, Shinzen Young told me that this might be
the most quickest way that he knows for how to
get to Enlightenment,it's Strong Determination Sitting Here's the technique...very simple:You
get a timer You set it for something like 1
or 2 hours or more, you need a long chunk
of time You sit in a lotus like position,full lotus,half
lotus,whatever, kind of legs crossed... or, you know, if you're
just starting this process and you haven't gotten used to
sitting crossed legged,then you just might want to sit in
a chair that works as well, and you're sitting with
your eyes open Take one or two minutes now to
adjust yourself in your seat Just get into your meditative
bubble, so that you're sitting there "ok now I'm gonna
do meditation" And then what you do is...you do not
move For the full length of your meditation You don't
move at all... You don't move to reposition yourself... You
don't move to scratch an itch on your face... You
don't move to adjust your back if it gets tired...
You don't move if your legs fall asleep... You don't
move if you're in excruciating pain... You don't move if
you're about to claw your eyes out from boredom,or from
anxiety,or from frustration or from any physical ailments that your
body is producing... and,you know,if you ever try anything even
close to this, what you're gonna realize is Just how
incredibly difficult this is of a meditation So what you
have to do is you have to sit there,you sit
there for 1 hour,2 hours... 3 hours, 4 hours completely
motionless,for as long as you can and that's the entire
meditation pretty intense stuff If you've never even tried this
before,I really encourage you to try it at least once
in your life just to see what the hell I'm
talking about here... just to see what these monks are
doing and what they're putting themselves through because what you're
gonna discover very quickly if you try this even once
is that you can't even do 30 minutes of it...
let alone an hour, you can't do an hour at
all... two hours?Inconceivable that you could do two hours of
this without training 4 hours?That's like flying to the moon!
It's just crazy... The furthest that I've been able to
go, and I've been meditating for 2 and a half
years now consistently... and I've been meditating for one hour
a day and the most that I can do that
I've ever done so far with Strong Determination Sitting is
90 minutes straight and I actually did that just the
other week and it was an amazing 90 minutes,let me
tell you... The amount of concentration and calmness of mind
and focus that you get when you sit perfectly motionless
and still for 90 whole minutes and you sit through
all the aches and pains and itches and scratches and
all the boredom and all the tediousness and all that
crap you sit through all that Man...it's like you go
into a totally different world,it's incredible! Especially if you couple
this technique with some of the other techniques that I've
shown you, for example if you're doing the Self-Inquiry process
and you're investigating who it is that you actually are...and
you're looking into that Well, try doing that also while
you're sitting there perfectly motionless and you're doing this Strong
Determination Sit Or also what you could do is you
could combine this technique here with the technique that I
also describe called "Do nothing" So that you're sitting there
and you're practicing "do nothing" But you're sitting perfectly motionless
and you're sitting for a very long period of time
So I don't mean just do nothing for ten minutes
or 20 minutes For a Strong Determination Sit you need
at least an hour as your goal... and then try
90 minutes,try 2 hours and just try pushing and just
see how difficult it really is It's almost unimaginable before
you try this just how difficult it really is and
that's one of the things that I really love about
this technique is because it shows you just how rotten
your mind has become Just how low we set the
bar in Western societies and cultures... We really set the
bar so fucking low for our minds and for our
consciousness that it's really pathetic Your mind has just been
completely rotted away by modern culture By Television, by internet,
by your smartphone,by your friends By the way you do
business,by your career,by your family,by all of that And it
shows you that there's something deeply flawed within you If
you cannot sit still,perfectly still, for just one hour And
you're gonna notice real quick that there's something wrong with
you What you're gonna see is that actually you're incapable
of being happy I've talked about this before in some
of my other videos about happiness Deep and true happiness,the
true meaning of happiness is not what we in the
west think of it as It's not entertainment, that's not
happiness... It's not stimulation and it's not excitement And it's
not love What it is it's complete presence in the
moment right now It's being one with reality,it's being able
to be calm and peaceful with no matter what is
happening with your body or with your mind or with
the circumstances around you So, it's complete unconditional happiness And
this is the kind of happiness that very few people
have ever tasted And this is true happiness,we've really done
a disservice to the word 'happiness' by using it for
all sorts of crap that's not true happiness And,you know,since
the whole objective of your life and everything you do
in your life is basically to make yourself happy,that's why
you do everything you do There's nothing in your life
that you do that you don't think will make you
happy So,if that's true, and it is... yet,you're unhappy all
the time,and you are... I guarantee that you are... And
how can we prove this?Well...by having you sit for one
hour Can you sit for one hour,motionless,and be happy at
the same time? If you can't, you might think like
'well Leo,that's just uhh that's just some stupid monk stuff,
like they just sit there and they train their whole
lives,and that's very extreme They're torturing themselves and you know,what
does this have to do with happiness? It has nothing
to do with happiness'.Actually,it has everything to do with happiness...
Because,on a very deep level,what these monks are doing is
they're training themselves to be completely at ease and non-resistant
to what's happening in the present moment no matter what
that is Now,sometimes that's a very positive thing and you
can easily be happy with something very positive you know,if
I give you 100,000 dollars tomorrow,then you're gonna be very
happy just naturally...it's easy to be happy when you have
someone hand you a huge batch of money But...how are
you gonna feel when... your ass hurts?How are you gonna
feel when you have an ache in your back? How
are you gonna feel when you have arthritis? How are
you gonna feel when your cat dies?How are you gonna
feel when your kid breaks his leg? How are you
gonna feel when your girlfriend or boyfriend leaves you for
somebody more attractive than you? How are you gonna feel
when you lose your job? How are you gonna feel
when your business collapses with the bad turn in the
economy? How are you gonna feel when your competitors out-compete
you? How are you gonna feel when you're working on
that project and then your computer crashes and you lose
all the data on your hard drive that you've been
working on for two years? How are you gonna feel
then?happy? Probably not... one of the secrets to life is
to train yourself... to be happy in the moment regardless
of anything else and this is a discipline and this
is a training and this is basically what the aim
of all meditation is Someone once asked me in a
comment under one of my videos he said something like
'Leo...what's the goal and objective of meditation?' and that was
an interesting question...because there's different ways you can answer that...
and I thought about that and I was asking myself
like Well,yeah that's a good question,what is the essence of
meditation really? I mean...why are we sitting down and doing
this thing of just... removing ourselves from the world and...
focusing our minds and clearing our minds of thoughts,why are
we doing all this? and the aim of it is,my
answer is... that you wanna merge with reality, to me
that's the essence of meditation,it's merging into reality That's kind
of a funny answer... What does it mean to 'merge
into reality'?It sounds mystical... It sounds weird... Well,when you start
studying Enlightenment what you start discovering is that actually,that's a
real possibility... is for you to merge with reality and
I'm not going to go into the depth of all
the details that are involved with that umm...just wanted to
kind of share that insight with you,but also to connect
it with happiness,right? because when you're totally merged with reality
the funny thing is is that you become completely happy!
Levels of happiness are possible that you have never experienced
in your life You can just get 30 seconds of
this kind of happiness and it's not just happiness it's
really bliss It's pure bliss... I've been lucky to just
get like a little hit of it here and there
in my meditation practice... Man...this is not something you've ever
felt,this is not something an ordinary human being has ever
felt this is why people become monks You might wonder
like 'well why become a monk? why renounce sex and
alcohol and all this and live on a cold ass
mountain for 12 years and be beaten with sticks and
go through these crazy ordeals...why do all that? Because counter-intuitively
that makes you the happiest human being you could possibly
be Now that's fucked up! But what's even more fucked
up is that's true and what I encourage you to
do is I encourage you to... reconcile that with your
western worldview because your western worldview does not admit of
this truth It does not admit of this truth that...
'Oh shit...these people who are monks,they're actually onto something! These
people who meditate really hardcore they're actually happy human beings!
They're not neurotic human beings like most of us are
I mean they're not perfect They've got their issues,granted, but...
but they're doing this for happiness Now,you might say 'well
Leo, that's a crazy way to go about getting happiness!'
Well...they could say the same thing about what you're doing!
and you know what?They're gonna be more right because if
we take a look at your life... What are you
doing to get happiness?What have you been doing for the
last 20 years... In your life to get happiness? and
how well has it been working? Can you sit for
an hour and be happy? If you can't sit for
an hour and just be happy,with whatever's going on, and
if you go into monkey mind and you start getting
neurotic and crazy and your face starts itching and you
wanna claw your eyes out Well that just shows you
what psychological state you're in... That kind of psyche can
never be happy! And so you wonder,you know,'Well,gee why am
I depressed and why am I always anxious and why
do I worry and why do I have fears and
why does that job that I got didn't make me
happy? What about that money?I got that money that didn't
make me happy I bought a new house that didn't
make me happy My girlfriend doesn't make me happy,my husband
doesn't make me happy My kids,are supposed to make me
happy but they don't really make me happy... Why is
that? Well,I would submit to you that it's because you
have a rotten mind, you have a rotten psyche,and that
really what you are is you're a soft,lazy twat is
what you are... Here's a cool thing that I learned
from Shinzen Young also... is that... if you can sit
and be calm and happy this is actually a really
good litmus test for Enlightenment People sometimes ask me also
in the comment section 'Well Leo,how can you prove that
someone is Enlightened?' And while you can't conclusively prove that
someone is Enlightened... because it's an inner realization,an inner state...
and until you can go into someone's mind,you can't really
prove it... because you're not them,but...what you can do is
you can just give them a simple test If you're
Enlightened you should be able to sit at ease for
4 hours no problem Can you do that? Try it
yourself Try it tonight...set aside an hour and just see
can you sit even for one hour? and just be
happy and not need to move,not need to scratch yourself,not
need to think about anything,just sit there and be happy
What you're gonna notice is that you can't! Not even
close...like not even 1 percent In the first 5 minutes
you're already gonna be trying to claw your eyes out
That's what the average Westerner will notice This is a
very sobering realization which is why I want you to
actually try this at least once in your life even
if you don't turn it into a habit Try it
at least once...just to see how bad you are! and
just to get your mind to start to have to
reconcile this fact of like 'holy shit... I've really let
my mind rot away,there's something wrong with that and if
what I'm trying to do my whole life is trying
to pursue happiness... and I haven't gotten it... Could it
possibly be that the techniques and strategies that I've been
employing up till now... will never,ever,ever work? because I can't
even sit and be at peace for one hour...doing nothing
Now this might seem like self-torture... If you sit down
and you actually do this practice What you might discover
is like 'Holy shit...this is like torturing yourself!' 'Leo,why are
you making me torture myself?I don't like this!' 'I want
nice and comfy meditation...' It's not torturing you...what it's actually
doing is it's forcing your mind to reconcile to the
absolute present moment,which is reality you understand that reality is
what's happening in the present moment right now? Reality is
like this flowing concert...it's always changing and it's always shifting!
The problem,the fundamental problem of the human psyche is that
it resists this flowing reality... what it does is it
tries to cling and hold on to various facets of
reality and it tries to hold it so that it
doesn't change and flow away! We do this with our
family,we do this with our career,we do this in business...
We do this with everything, and in fact we do
it as we're sitting in a chair just...trying to enjoy
the present moment we do it! right?because what happens like
an itch goes on your face,and then you want to
scratch that itch... already you wanting to scratch that itch
is you resisting reality Now what happens if you prohibit
yourself,hold yourself back from scratching that itch? well actually what
this does is...it seems like it's maybe self-torture or it
seems like it's just some sort of like... you know...
harsh discipline that a monk would use for who knows
what kind of silly religious purposes... that's not what it
really is though,you have to understand why they do this...
they do this because they've discovered a very powerful law
of the psyche and this is also something that I've
learned from Shinzen Young and this law is like a
formula and what it says is the following: there's multiple
facets to this formula but one formulation of it is
like this: purification=pain * mindfulness purification equals pain multiplied by
mindfulness...what is purification? purification is the purification of your subconscious
mind... and your psyche...see... your subconscious mind is filled with
a bunch of garbage and from your very birth it's
been resisting the present moment! That's basically what your life
has been as an adult As a teenager and an
adult,is moving away from the present moment into your fantasy
land... and that's where you presently live because if the
mind goes into fantasy land,then it doesn't have to be
in reality and when you force the mind to actually
be in touch with what's happening in the present moment
with reality it doesn't like this because it finds the
fantasy land so much more comfortable so one way to
actually purify your subconscious mind is to endure pain! and
as you endure the pain,and you apply mindfulness to the
pain... and you don't try to run away from the
pain,but you kind of surrender to the pain... then what
you find is that it purifies your mind and purification
here is not in some sort of like moral sense
it's in a very,uhh... it's in a very like almost
physical sense! because your mind is this complex cybernetic system...
with a lot of feedback loops and triggers what has
to happen and what does happen with meditation is that
the mind is forced to sit still and as it
does that,the brainwaves in your mind have to go from
very fast... to slower and slower and slower so your
mind calms down! it gets in touch with the present
moment For this to happen,the psyche has to purge material
and basically what's happening when you meditate is it's like...
psychotherapy...but not on a macro level,but on a micro level!
So what is psychotherapy?Psychotherapy is basically you go into an
office... and you talk about some crap that happened to
you in your past maybe your mom was mean to
you when you were a kid,so you talk about it,you
get it out of your system You have an emotional
release, a catharsis the therapist kind of hears you out
and gives you some encouragement... and then what happens is
that the next day you feel better,you feel lighter because
you got that shit which was stuck in the back
of your mind,you got it out! and then maybe you
get enough of it out that you don't even have
to think about it anymore and you're just kind of
calm and cool with it Well...that's exactly what meditation does
except on a micro level not with like a big
event in the past,like your mom... being mean to you,now
it's in the present moment it forces your mind to
actually just release and surrender itself to the present moment
which your mind is very subtly resisting... 100 or a
1000 times a day,you don't even notice how much your
mind... resists the present moment until you start practicing some
more meditation! So...I encourage you to... change your opinions about
how you view monks How you view some of these
hardcore spiritual disciplines... they're really not religious disciplines... They're psychological
disciplines The reason that people take their spirituality so seriously
in the Eastern world is because they've actually developed techniques
that are more effective than psychotherapy in the west and
these techniques purify the subconscious mind in very powerful and
profound ways... and this is nothing hokey or New Age,you
can actually try this yourself tonight... You can try it
for a month and you'll see that it has... Very
practical, powerful effects It calms your mind down and makes
you happier! which is what you've been wanting in your
whole life all this time,except you didn't really know... a
real legitimate technique that would get you there,well...here it is...I'm
presenting it to you So... purification is pain times mindfulness...
also what you notice is that suffering is pain times
resistance! So,the amount of suffering you have in your life...
depends not just on the pain you have,but actually on
how much you resist the pain If you're able to
drop your resistance to 0... in a very incredible and
unbelievable way what happens... is that your pain drops to
zero! Now you might say 'Leo...well what about,you know,if I
break my leg?' 'Or my tooth hurts?I mean,are you saying
that that pain isn't real?' Well let me just tell
you a little anecdote that... Peter Ralston told me when
I was at his workshop and Peter Ralston's a... a
very Enlightened guy, a really,really hardcore Enlightened guy he's been
doing this for like 40 years... he's been Enlightened since
his 20's and he just kept going deeper and deeper
and deeper with it what he told us as we're
sitting there and he says 'well... one time what I
decided to do is I decided to go to the
dentist and get a root canal but I told the
dentist not to use any novocain as he was about
to drill and extract my root... do you understand what
a root canal is? If you've ever had a root
canal it's probably,even with novocain,it's the most disturbing process! I've
had one done... What they do is they drill your
tooth,but they don't just drill like a cavity... they drill
all the way down through the root and then what
they do is they take pliars and they pull the
root out of your tooth! they take the whole root
out... and then they kind of numb down,kind of grind
down your whole tooth and they put a crown on
it that's a root canal He had this done with
no novocain! Now,he told us that the dentist thought that...
Ralston was trying to be like macho and that he
was trying to sit there and just kind of like
prove his machoness,but that's not what was happening What was
happening was that he sat there with like a smile
on his face as this was happening he wasn't...holding in
the pain... and coping with the suffering,what he did is
he actually eliminated the suffering and the pain entirely sheerly
through mindfulness! imagine having such a...clear perception of the present
moment that what you or I would normally call physical
pain,excruciating physical pain... ceases to be excruciating physical pain... because
you become that pain so completely and thoroughly... that you
understand what it really is as a phenomenon... no worse
and no different than any other phenomenon no different than
the pressure of your ass sitting on your seat,which feels
kind of comfy...right? well,imagine that applied to a root canal!
People sometimes ask me like 'Well Leo,Enlightenment...like,you're talking about Enlightenment,what
does Enlightenment really mean?' 'can we even measure it?' 'It
seems like just some philosophy or some,you know,religious doctrine...' 'Some
belief system?' But see?no...it's none of that! What it is
it's the ability to be fully present in the moment
without resisting it It's the ability to have a complete
experience of reality without a self! because there is no
self experiencing reality... there is just reality BEING... reality just
BEING So,one,you know,way that you can test if you're Enlightened
is...go get a root canal without novocain...can you do it?
It shows you how Enlightened you are... See there's not
just one Enlightenment,there's actually degrees of Enlightenment... There's degrees of
mindfulness,and what's really incredible... is just how far you can
take your mindfulness! You think if you've been practicing mindfulness
for a few years that you've kind of like made
some big gains? Naw! Try...getting Enlightened and then practicing mindfulness
and getting further Enlightenments... for 40 fucking years! and then
see where you are,and what you can do It's incredible
what some of these people can practically do See if
you can sit there for 4 hours... See if you
can sit there for 8 hours... an Enlightened person really
should have no problems sitting there for 8 hours without
motion It just shows you how out of touch you
are with reality It's very sobering... very sobering...completely changes your
relationship to pain and to suffering Which is actually a
very important facet of spiritual work because you know what?How
can you be happy... if you can't tolerate pain and
suffering? you actually can't because what's gonna be happening is
you're gonna be running away all the time you're gonna
be in fear all the time! why do you think
you're anxious all the time? It's because you fear suffering
and pain It's because you're trying to run away from
it,and you are not able to surrender yourself to it!
What's incredible is that these people can not only do
these amazing feats... of just sitting there and getting a
root canal or something like that... but they can do
it with a smile on their face! They're actually happy
with it it's not like... YOU would do it...like if
I tell you to sit there for an hour maybe
you'll sit there for an hour,but what will happen to
you is you'll be like... grinding your teeth the whole
time,and you'll be like enduring it you're gonna be about
to scream at the top of your lungs! maybe you'll
make it,but that's not what these people are doing... These
people are sitting there and...they're not feeling the pain or
the suffering because what happens is that when you can
reduce your... resistance to 0...the suffering actually disappears and it
turns into pleasure! and this is something that I want
you to experience with this technique of... Strong Determination Sitting
So your assignment is to sit for an hour,or 2,or
3,or 4,however long do you want to... test yourself with...
Sit there and you're gonna have physical pains and discomforts,your
legs are gonna fall asleep... this is gonna be miserable...it's
gonna be the worst experience of your life and your
job is to sit there through all that suffering and
all that pain... and what you can do is you
can achieve this moment where you actually have this breakthrough...
where you have this intense intense suffering and then what
happens is that just instantaneously the suffering completely releases... because
your ego,your ego stops resisting and this is a very
magical moment if you can reach this moment with your
sit... because for the first time perhaps in your life
you'll get a new appreciation,and a new... understanding of...how pain
and suffering function they don't function the way we typically
think that they function The Western notions of pain and
suffering are completely... just factually false,really...factually false So that's your
job...is to sit there and endure that! and you know
what? if your legs fall asleep and you're afraid that
that's gonna hurt you somehow... Just remember the monks who
sit for 7 and a half days without food... without
water,without sleep,without moving! What the human body and the human
mind can do... is incredible! and it just shows you
how low we set the bar for ourselves as non-meditators...extremely
low... So this practice here will show you just how
low your bar is set... and maybe...it'll convince you that
hey... maybe my life would go better if I raised
the bar a few notches! you know...I'm probably not gonna
go become a marathon monk,but if I can just... train
myself maybe to sit for 2 hours... everyday,in silence,without moving,and
being happy,if I can reach that state... maybe that might
have some extraordinary and profound ramifications for the quality of
my life! maybe that's more worthwhile to pursue than pursuing...
that promotion at work...or pursuing that next... phase in my
business,or pursuing some more sex or going getting married or
having children,maybe this is what I gotta do first before
I do all that other stuff! So what I recommend
for you is to actually try this,start with an hour
if you're just new... You probably won't make it,but that's
ok you can fail at this,it's fine,I failed many times
at this... so how do you take it...to the next
level?How do you take your meditation to the next level?
Here's another practical suggestion... try to do a one hour
sit totally motionless... The other thing I recommend and this
is something that I've just been experimenting with in the
last couple weeks in my life and it's been giving
me...incredible gains! mindfulness-wise but also towards Enlightenment Do four one-hour
sits per day do that for a whole week that's
basically a retreat right there,you can do it in the
comfort of your own home... you don't need to go
anywhere fancy or pay a lot of money for it
Just try this,maybe try this on a weekend,try it for
just even 2 days,try it for one Saturday and one
Sunday what this is is you sit for one hour...
doing whatever technique you want meditation-wise,just sit there for an
hour... then you can get up and have your meal
and go to the bathroom and stuff...but then... sit for
another hour... get up do your stuff,sit for another hour,get
up do your stuff,sit for another hour,do that four times!
What you're gonna notice is that 'man...this just super-charges...' 'the
meditation that I've been doing!' If you've been only doing
20 minutes of meditation per day... try this for one
weekend... See how much you're missing...by not doing this more
consistently... it's incredible what you get with really long,concentrated meditation
sessions! Alright,that's it!That's my assignment for you,try some of these
techniques out... maybe combine this with some of the other
techniques that I've taught you... like 'do nothing' or 'self-inquiry',and
you will be... moving towards Enlightenment pretty quickly!Also... you will
be building your mindfulness muscles really quickly and that's gonna
help you in all the ordinary everyday situations in life!
