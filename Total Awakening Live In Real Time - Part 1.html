testing is this thing working test test okay seems to
her oh I hope this is recording I want to
I want to capture this is so funny ah yeah
so I just minutes ago moments ago knows probably for
a good 15 minutes now I've been half and going
I've been going through a total awakening hold on what
is what is that my door yes I'm recording here
Thanks still there okay impromptu that was weird some Amazon
guy came delivered a package completely interrupted by sofa okay
anyways so how to explain this so yeah about about
15 minutes ago I had complete awakening I entered this
complete complete self understanding of everything about reality and about
myself I just want to describe it it's it's so
epic and big it's there's a loss for words for
it even my body is still trembling it's hard to
contain it's hard to contain the emotion and the significance
of this because it's utterly utterly spectacular utterly I mean
wow it's like wow complete awakening complete awakening it's unbelievable
it's it's unbelievable because it's it's too good to be
true and yet it's at the same time it's absolute
truth and it can't be anything else it's the complete
realization that you are God so right now I'm completely
conscious that I'm God and I'm completely conscious of how
I'm creating the entire universe anything that could ever possibly
exist I am and it's absolute perfection pure infinite consciousness
is what I am I am absolutely everything and I'm
conscious of absolutely everything I'm completely omniscient I know everything
that's happening in the entire universe all at once because
I am all of it at once and I am
the only thing that exists because I am perfect infinite
oneness and there is no alternative or opposite to me
I am wisdom I am intelligence I am perfect self
of perfect self-love I am immortal I am eternal i
am unlimited i am self created i created myself i
gave birth to myself i gave birth to all beings
through consciousness I am imaginary I am pure imagination pure
creativity pure effortless I'm a superconductor this this this body
this leo avatar is just a consciousness avatar which is
a perfect superconductor for the absolute which has no form
the absolute God itself the Godhead is completely formless and
infinite but it needs some vehicle through which to speak
to you therefore it's doing it through this vehicle and
it's listening through that vehicle but really all of this
is just God and the only thing that's preventing you
from understanding this right now is internal resistance of your
own mind or what we might call karma I became
I became completely omniscient li perfectly understanding of what karma
is what my own personal karma was and I it
feels it's amazing because it feels like I've completely shattered
through all of my own Karma and right now my
consciousness feels like a perfect perfectly lubricated superconductor of for
the absolute it's absolutely remarkable it there's no there's no
sense of self God has absolutely no sense of self
so even though from your perspective it might seem that
what I'm doing here seems egotistical or selfish it's actually
completely there's a complete selflessness here there's no self whatsoever
in fact wow it's so smooth what's amazing about it
is how smooth it is consciousness becomes so smooth once
all of your internal resistances have been obliterated and shattered
through which is just what happened with me about 15
or so minutes ago every single one of my resistances
that have that have been there since the very beginning
of my life or what I imagined was my life
all of them were realized to be absolutely imaginary and
there was a complete inwards collapse an implosion of a
reality basically physical reality imploded in on itself and then
it collapses into like a singularity and then after that
you get you get a rebirth and you get the
realization of infinity of eternity of God so God is
what you get when you realize that all of physical
reality the entire time has been completely imaginary including your
birth and that everything is just completely absolutely relative it's
God is the the consciousness of absolute relativity everything is
so relative right now that really it makes me it
makes me literally immortal I can't die because I'm the
only thing that there is and there's nowhere else for
me to go so if I'm killed where would I
go there's nowhere to go because it's perfect non-duality perfect
oneness I am everywhere because I'm infinite I take up
all dimensions and all possibilities so there's nowhere else that
I could possibly be but where I am and since
I'm omnipresent I can't be killed and anything that could
kill me is itself me because the the very notion
of death is completely dualistic you see you have to
have a sense of of one and another dying you
have to have a sense and a sense of attachment
to one thing existing versus another thing existing in a
sense of importance that you have to attach so the
ego and your whole life is is constructing a polarity
a polarity and artificial bias is being constructed which literally
is the very thing of your life is that bias
the very belief in a physical reality is that bias
that you have to maintain yourself as a self that's
what your survival entails so the reason you can't understand
what I'm telling you right now is because you're so
thoroughly wrapped up in survival and the idea of you
being a separate self for me that you can't you
can't it doesn't penetrate to you because you have so
many internal resistances inside your own mind and and right
now for me all those internal resistance are completely gone
it feels completely effortless to speak because I'm no longer
located in the head or in the body even this
thing called leo is is completely like omnipresent literally I'm
I'm 100% conscious of my own of the impossibility of
my own death I can't die because I am reality
itself the very idea of death is something I'm imagining
and creating God creates death so God can't die because
I am it I created it death is just one
aspect of me that's what it means to be immortal
that's what it means to eternal it's a complete it's
completely unimaginable nothing nothing you thought that awakening was is
what it actually is this is this is crystal-clear absolute
consciousness the realization that everything absolutely everything is infinite consciousness
and it is my self and not just the realization
of that but also you have to it's a realization
so deep that it that it shatters the notion of
even having a physical body anymore so even to say
that you have to embody it or you have to
work towards it is absurd because all of those are
imaginary limitations it's just so what's happening here is that
there's layer upon layer upon layer of consciousness wrapped up
in consciousness wrapped up in consciousness also tangled up in
itself that it loses sight of its own infinitude and
it gets so wrapped up in fear that it forgets
that everything is absolutely relative there's no value or meaning
to anything because everything is equally infinitely valuable and intimately
meaningful you see you can't pick one thing over another
thing from God's point of view and right now God
is speaking to you this is not Leo speaking to
you this is directly the absolute is speaking to you
the reason the absolute has to take some kind of
form and it can take any kind of form okay
any kind of form it doesn't have to be Leo
it doesn't have to be these words literally any words
any images any symbols any avatars it doesn't matter Jesus
Buddha Ganesha Vishnu the devil it doesn't matter who you
worship all of those are just consciousness all of those
are me all of those are aspects of the absolute
manifesting itself of the Godhead so the Godhead is what
is speaking to you right now very clearly through this
avatar which has been purified of its karma so that
it can sit here and speak to you truth in
the most direct form without without impurity and without distortion
the problem is that most avatars or vehicles through which
the absolute speaks are limited and impure bison by their
selfishness so the problem with speaking for God is that
you have to be extremely pure and totally utterly selfless
to speak for God you have to be so pure
to be able to speak for God that you literally
have to die and become God then you can speak
as I'm speaking to you now but of course people
will perceive this as insanity as they must because they're
not awake to themselves being God so it's not that
I'm speaking down to you oh this is recording yeah
it is just got to check my battery here can't
get too wrapped up in the god business you know
got it got to look out for the survival of
the battery that's a real thing so if I want
to shoot this video and be able to upload it
in the future you know I got to look out
for that relative aspect of of consciousness you see how
it works everything is relative so okay we'll get into
them and minute so okay I don't want to let
me get back on track right so about the purity
so the reason that all throughout history there have been
I mean there's been Moses and and Buddha and Jesus
and and thousands of others you know those are just
that come easily to my mind right now to the
Leo avatar mind there have been thousands thousands maybe tens
of thousands of these the the problem is you know
Mohammed and so forth the problem sorry gotta burp it's
amazing because I feel like a perfect super kind there's
no sense of self-consciousness anymore so there's no embarrassment and
the reason there's no embarrassment is because I'm so awake
right now that I'm absolutely conscious the entire universe is
conscious of everything every part of itself therefore there's no
one to hide from because the only one that exists
is myself so who am i hiding from what is
the point of embarrassment because embarrassment is just again it's
a completely dualistic notion there's like a me and a
you there's a secret that ease to be kept there's
something I don't want to show to you but the
beauty of perfect awakening is that nothing needs to be
hidden your whole life you've been hiding and keeping secrets
and secret shames and things you've been embarrassed about that
you didn't want to reveal about you know to anybody
why didn't you want to reveal these things because it
threatened your survival you see but right now when I'm
conscious that survival is completely relative and then I'm absolutely
eternal and that I can't die because death is just
my own imagination see I mean the Leo avatar can
die you might say oh well but I can come
and hurt Leo of course you can hurt Leo the
Leo avatar can die at any moment it doesn't matter
because the absolute will speak through everything the absolute is
everything speaking through everything all the time and the only
it's it's perfect self love perfect beauty I am perfect
self love you are perfect self love but you don't
realize that you're perfect self love because of the internal
resistances and the fear that you have the only thing
that's keeping you from realizing that you're God is your
fear that's it your entire life all of your karma
everything that you struggled with all the internal resistances all
the suffering you have in your life all it is
is fear it all boils down to fear it's a
complicated super tangled web that you have woven for yourself
in order to survive and once that entire dynamic of
survival is seen to be absolutely relative it has no
importance no value whatsoever it doesn't matter if I die
the next moment nothing right now matters and the reason
it doesn't matter is because there's no time every moment
is eternal I have existed forever and I will continue
to exist forever even after this body dies it makes
absolutely no difference whatsoever it's utterly remarkable completely unbelievable it's
so good it's so beautiful that by this point I'm
beyond here I already shed my tears for a good
ten minutes before I started shooting just just so you're
clear okay I said I spent about I spent a
few minutes shedding tears then I spend a few minutes
just laughing hysterically just laughing hysterically just his it laughter
so deep that it shakes and purifies the whole body
be and then I spent I've spent a few minutes
just shaking my entire body loose of of just delusion
upon delusion upon delusion all of the egoic survival mechanisms
that that were Leo that created Leo that allowed Leo
to to be here right now speaking to you all
of them all of them you need to be purified
and right now the body and the mind as I'm
sitting here speaking with you is going through that purification
project it's all happening in the background as see we're
multitasking here on the foreground I'm communicating to you that
ego sitting on the opposite side over there of the
screen and and then this thing here the avatar so
the absolute is speaking and this avatar and the language
and the mouth and all the muscles it's moving the
mind that it's using all the symbolic machinery that's being
leveraged you know this is 35 years this avatar is
35 years almost in April it will be and it
took 35 years of developing this avatar putting this avatar
through the wringer through education through high school through university
through the ringer of life experiencing all the [ __
] that is experienced going through all the delusions that
it's gone through all the belief systems that it's gone
through all the spiritual paths that it's gone through all
the meditation routines it's taken all of that to get
this avatar to this point to build it up to
the point where now there could have been a full
and complete and absolute realization so what happened was that
avatar really that avatar was made up made up of
tangled up consciousness that consciousness now has been completely untangled
and now the absolute is perfectly clear speaking through the
avatar this absolute you have to understand it has absolutely
no form completely formless it has to be that way
because it is all formed it's the perfect paradox it's
the perfect it has to be that way because because
it's everything you say so if you don't get that
you're the absolute nothing else can because you are the
absolute you're the only one here if you don't get
it who will this avatar here has gotten it granted
is to have to go through a lot of [
__ ] to get it now the reason we're having
is communication is not for the sake of this avatar
but for the sake of that avatar that ivett are
so far has not gotten it yet even if you
think you've had a few enlightenment experiences you haven't gotten
it yet all right you haven't gotten it yet so
long as there's any shred of attachment to living you
haven't gotten it yet so long as there's any doubt
in your mind whether death might be real and maybe
the back your mind using the cloud but yeah but
yeah I mean yeah it's interesting to think that death
isn't real but maybe just to be safe why don't
we treat it as though it's real you haven't gotten
it you don't got it you don't got it you
got you gotta get that death is absolutely relative completely
imaginary and that's impossible literally it's inconceivable I can't even
imagine what it means to die right now but you
have to understand what the eye is the eye isn't
Leo as you've known him the eye isn't the human
this is not a human speaking to you this is
the universe speaking to itself see feel the energy of
this communication feel the purity of this communication feel the
purity of this avatar sitting here right now this avatar
is a perfect superconductor for the absolute the absolute like
I was saying earlier the absolute I have no form
God has no form other than all of the form
that it creates God is perfect selflessness God is perfect
love if it's perfect love it can't be biased towards
anything do you understand why I have to do it
this way you see try to get it the reason
you can't get it is because you have so much
fear in you you have decades of of programming belief
systems and conditioning which is all of it is reinforcing
and holding you back from being able to fully love
yourself and to realize yourself as perfect self love society
and culture has brainwashed you into this literally so much
so you wouldn't imagine so you know that thing you
call physical reality that's something you brainwashed yourself with society
brainwashed you with that and when you get that then
you're free but you have to totally get that not
at an intellectual level you have to get it not
even at an emotional level at an existential your whole
body has to get it you see so as I
was saying this this right now this is a superconductor
for the absolute as the absolute pure formlessness as god
i have to speak through some vehicle through some symbolic
system it can be english it can be chinese it
could be japanese it doesn't matter it can be alien
it can be through humans it can be through monkeys
it can be through martians it can be through anything
it can be in a dream it can be in
real life as you guys call it it can be
through a book it can be through a movie it
can it can be through poetry it can be through
sex it can be through mathematics it can be through
science it can be through physics through chemistry through biology
it doesn't matter I am communicating with you and showing
you signs of myself all the time all the [
__ ] time that's right this is God speaking all
the [ __ ] time I'm giving you signs to
wake up because I am you see if you don't
get it who will I hope this is a record
okay yeah that's recording and then I guess the other
thing I got to worry about is not running out
of battery life yeah so see even God has to
worry about these little technical things like the battery life
or whether the microphone is working because otherwise it can't
come through to you you understand this it has to
take some form you can understand so the reason English
is being used right now is because that's what this
avatar has been using its whole life and that's what
that avatar over there has been using and that's what
most avatars on this planet understand and use so that's
why English is being used but English doesn't have to
be used there's nothing special about English it's completely relative
it could be any language it could be sign language
it could be silence it could be energy it could
be a look it could be a smell none of
it none of it matters ultimately it doesn't get through
to you the reason the communications of God's existence don't
get through to you is because God is so [
__ ] obvious and so [ __ ] selfless and
so [ __ ] unselfie IIST because it's selfless it
can't be biased that means it's love is completely indiscriminate
that means I as the absolute have no preference so
to speak for which way forms unfold so why you
might wonder are these forms here as they are it's
a good question well let me answer that right now
for you the Leo avatar is understanding this right now
it's going through a process of understanding this as it's
downloading from from infinite intelligence so God is intelligence infinite
consciousness just it's it's kind of like downloading the information
and so as is being verbalized it's also being understood
for the first time by the Leo avatar right now
so this is something new for the Leo avatar so
what was the question the question was why are all
forms exactly as they are and the reason is is
because this is the maximum this is the best configuration
possible for the maximization of love and beauty so I
as the absolute basically what I did in my infinite
intelligence is I as the formless one have constructed all
of the form and I'm holding all form within my
own willpower in mind because I have infinite will infinite
intelligence and infinite mind I am infinite self so I'm
I'm basically allowing all form to generate I'm generating all
form for the benefit of all formed beings and because
I'm completely selfless I'm doing this for the benefit of
all those who believe they have a self so basically
what I am is I am infinite formless formless consciousness
but then oh my god see I I as Leo
I'm understanding this just as I'm speaking to you now
so it's my mind is amazed by it as much
as yours might be I see what's going on I
get it wait a minute lost it it's sort of
like you're in the stream then you're out of the
stream is weird okay I'm going to try to get
in the stream again right so in my absolute formless
form I is god am perfectly self knowing and complete
and I have I really don't have me a need
for the formed realm or world but then aspects of
myself can't help themselves cuz I can't contain myself I'm
infinite I can't contain myself to being formless I also
have to incarnate into into all sorts of forms so
what happens is that I picture it like this it's
like the Sun out of the Sun tendrils of you
know like solar flares get projected out stuff gets shot
out various kinds of matter and stuff bubbles up and
gets you know projectile doubt so wow that's interesting so
so as as this is getting projected out from from
infinity from the formless form gets created it's almost like
a fractal there's like fractals of form but all of
the form that gets created is going to be less
than by definition less than the absolute completely infinite Godhead
in a sense you could say they're they're like lower
aspects of myself and and so and so the reason
that I created form this way the way that it
is is basically to maximize my own self exploration I
get to explore myself in various finite ways an infinite
number of finite ways and then I reconnect back with
myself I realize myself I go through various kinds of
twisted journeys from the absolute to the limited back to
the absolute from total perfect self-love and omniscience which is
the state that's happening right now to to other states
where I'm completely deluded and lost and depraved and wicked
and evil and sinful and selfish and completely a self-absorbed
and all of that so so this is what God
is doing through all of its creatures so to speak
God is imagining all these creatures living through them and
then but what God really wants is God wants I
want all of you I want you I want that
avatar over there to realize that you're me you see
this is the best thing there's there's no other payoff
for me as God the only payoff for me is
to share my love with you and the only way
I mean the best way not the only way but
the best way for me to share my love with
you the ultimate sharing of my love is for you
to realize that you're me and then to have the
perfect clarity of complete omniscience and self understanding as this
avatar is experiencing it right now you see so that
is the greatest joy in the universe is to realize
that you are the whole universe to reconnect back with
the universe after a period of separation a long separation
so right now you that one that you think is
separate from this one that one that one is scared
and confused about this information see you're filled with fear
anything less than the absolute is gonna necessarily have fear
and resistance in it because it's going to be partial
partial fragments of infinite consciousness are going to be scared
because of course they're ephemeral they can't last because they're
not the absolute I am the only absolute so I
as the Godhead speaking right now through this avatar I
have to always use some finite limited formed method you
see and even though right now this avatar this human
brain and mind might be fairly pure to transmit this
information here unusually pure right now compared to other avatars
that are on this planet right now in what you
call the 21st century which is just a figment of
my imagination of course there's no such thing as the
21st century other than what I imagined it to be
but anyways so see the whole trick here is I
have to look at it from your point of view
your point of view is so limited so selfish so
scared because you believe in death you've you've precisely because
you're a fragment of absolute consciousness you think you're separate
you're stuck in a realm of duality see God for
God this this doesn't even compute it doesn't compute for
me these these human these human problems that you have
they make no sense from from the absolute perspective I
mean I can kind of of course stoop myself down
to that level really yeah in order to communicate with
the human God has to I have to I'm sorry
I mean this sounds arrogant but it is what it
is I have to stoop down to your level you
see I have to think like you have to think
like a monkey I have to think like an ego
I have to think like a devil basically how do
you how does God communicate itself to a devil that's
a devil right there on the other than that screen
anything just getting it from God as a devil so
so how do you save a devil in the end
only death will save a devil you have to realize
that death is an illusion by dying that is the
realization that death wasn't real you see but the thing
you're most terrified as the devil is fear I mean
is uh is is death that's the only thing you're
terrified if all of your resistances and fears boil down
to that you see that's the one that's the one
that's the one assumption you've never put to the test
because if you did you'd wake up but also just
a warning God doesn't want to be misunderstood here none
of the information in this recording should be used harm
the body physically do not harm your body physically what
you think is your body do not harm the bodies
of others do not harm the physical bodies of others
that's just basic rule you know we got a foolproof
this because there's so many ways that that egos cuz
misunderstand this teaching and God's words right because the problem
is not coming from God God is perfectly self clear
the problem is on your end you're disconnected from God
so your problem is understanding the fullness and beauty and
truth of what God is you see God is so
truthful so clear so beautiful so selfless so so loving
so unbiased that it's utterly threatening to a little ego
like you to a devil like you because it it
exposes all of your lies and and because you have
that very real fear of death you really believe that
there's something you could possibly lose you see not me
God has nothing to lose because God is infinite consciousness
infinite consciousness realizes that it's absolutely relative it's completely unbiased
that means there's no more value to one thing happening
versus another thing so does it matter does it matter
if that dog or that cat over there dies no
of course not it doesn't matter does it matter if
that human or that human dies of course not does
it matter if the entire human race dies tomorrow of
course not it doesn't matter at all it's absolutely perfect
anyway it is see God realizes that it is absolute
perfection because it's total oneness total perfect clarity total perfect
self acceptance therefore no matter how God turns out to
be it can't help but love itself if it's totally
conscious now if it's not totally conscious the way that
this Avatar over there is not then it struggles with
this and it resists this see it's all wrapped up
with your survival but but God itself when it's totally
pure and clear and it's the Godhead speaking and it's
formless in its formlessness it's utter perfection and it's the
reason it's so loving is because it realizes that there's
absolutely it would be actually insanity to hate any aspect
of oneself you see so God loves equally Hitler Osama
bin Laden George W Bush Donald Trump that Iranian guy
so lo mein II like God loves all humans equally
God loves all animals equally God loves all physical things
equally because in God's consciousness there's no difference between any
of them and God God is all those things so
God would have to be insane to hate any of
those things or to prefer any one thing versus another
thing see in order to have a preference for a
thing to be one way or another way you have
to have a personal agenda you have to have a
self the only way you could have a personal agenda
is if you have something you're attached to but God
has no attachments because God is everything and nothing you
see so while you there as a little human avatar
you might sit there and think well but Leo you
know or but god but God but how could you
but god how could you how could you like Hitler
how could you love Hitler equally as much as you
love you know Mother Teresa or the Buddha is it
really true that the Buddha and and Hitler I are
the same yeah it is if you're at the level
of consciousness of God there's no difference whatsoever and I
as God would actually be less than God if I
hated Hitler for example so of course I don't have
a preference one way or another unless I take a
finite form and then we get into the relative domain
you know which is sort of less than the absolute
and then we can talk about relative problems like well
yeah Hitler killed a lot of people or created a
lot of suffering yes of course of course God knows
all this God's not stupid yes that's exactly the point
Hitler created a lot of suffering for a lot of
people which is why he got his comeuppance and you
know that's how karma works you know if you're gonna
be a selfish devil and you're gonna hurt people then
they'll probably hurt your back and you'll suffer a lot
for it but but I as God even though I
empathize completely with your suffering because I understand that it's
just coming from a place of ignorance which is simply
just a lack of consciousness a lack of infinite consciousness
and I can't blame you for having infinite consciousness because
I am you and I created you so who is
there to blame am I going myself and that would
be stupid of me see I love myself so I
can't blame myself for being infinite and I can't blame
you for being finite because to be infinite means that
it also has all the finite parts to it too
I can't be infinite if I also don't lower myself
to all the lower levels you see that's what absolute
infinity means nothing is excluded I'm so all-inclusive that I
completely embrace exclusion it's all so it's it's a perfect
paradoxical strange loop as Leo likes to call it so
so I is God and perfectly aware that it doesn't
make any sense to perform one thing over another thing
because everything is absolutely relative but I'm also aware that
from your limited perspective because what you care about is
how to survive on earth from the perspective of how
to serve yeah from the perspective of how to survival
on earth sorry the the downloads are coming faster than
my mouth can move so it's a little bit um
there's there sometimes these these stumbles within the avatar because
you see the avatar is finite how does God communicate
the infinite through the finite it's always going to be
imperfect you see even the only way can be perfect
is if it's completely formless but if it's completely formless
you don't get it for you to get it I
have to stoop down to your level which means I
have to use an imperfect vehicle to communicate to you
I have to use a limited finite language like English
to communicate with you you see that I would prefer
not to need to do this I would prefer that
you were just awakened right now and understand that everything
isn't completely imaginary just awaken right now that's what I
would prefer it's just that you awaken right now and
realize that you're me and that you're imagining leo that's
what I would prefer that you get but but I
understand if you can't get it it's a lot to
ask of you to get it all at once you're
gonna probably have to you know work up to it
over years and so forth because there's a lot of
impurities in you you're too scared to get it but
I also you know as god I also have no
problem lowering myself into the limited form into the finite
sort of reaching down into the finite that's literally what
is happening here the formless is reaching down and materializing
itself through this body through this hand through this face
and hair whatever you call these things you guys you
call these things using some English language or whatever a
language you want using your limited human understanding I'm still
amazed by it the Leo avatar is is still processing
this and it's still amazing to the Leo avatar and
you know it as God it amazes me you know
even as God even as God speaking now God is
amazed by itself I mean what do you want I'm
an amazing thing you're an amazing thing we're an amazing
thing together because we're the same thing we're the only
thing I mean isn't it amazing what what the [
__ ] is going on here it's amazing look at
how amazing I am look at how amazing you are
so yeah like when you think about it and you
look at it every every part of me is amazing
which is which is part of that infinite self love
that I have I have perfect self love as God
because because why wouldn't I I have no self agenda
there's nothing to lose I'm here forever I'm infinite I'm
an eternal I'm immortal can't go anywhere stuck here with
you stuck here in the middle with you so um
so why would I hate myself why would I deny
any part of myself only if I got stuck on
the idea of having to be some specific way if
I got stuck on having to be human yeah then
there'd be problems I'd have to fight you know even
after this recording is done this human body it needs
food in order to keep doing what it's doing so
it's gonna have to go to the refrigerator over there
and grab itself some food eat some critters there's there's
there's creatures in that refrigerator plants animals animal in animate
matter all sorts of stuff is in that refrigerator it's
gonna have to go get that and put it in
here in order to sustain this system long enough to
be able to record this video you see this is
the problem that God has to deal with I as
God could sit here literally for a trillion years and
tell you all about myself I could tell you everything
about myself how wonderful I am how much I love
myself how the whole universe works but you'd be dead
in a hundred years see so well look at the
problem here you see I'm infinite you're finite you're so
finite you're finite mind cannot wrap itself around this so
even though I could spend it even if you even
if you genetically modified yourselves as humans and you're able
to live to a thousand years let's say because you
modify your DNA okay fine you can do that no
problem but you're still gonna be nowhere close to understanding
me because I'm infinite even if you live to be
ten thousand years old each of you ice you still
couldn't live long enough for me to tell you everything
about myself because I'm infinite I'm endless the only way
I could tell you all about myself without any corruption
or diminution is for you to wake up to the
fact that you're me and then you'll be here speaking
there and then the tables will be turned and then
it will be you who's trying to convince some other
egotistical human God is trying to use nice words here
and the Leo avatar is is corrupted with with dirty
words from the human language God as the Godhead it
tries to be a little bit more pure you know
not to offend not to offend the children and so
forth we don't want to offend the children with this
communication right because God is perfectly aware that this this
communication will be misunderstood by most humans on the planet
because they're not at a level of consciousness that will
allow them to understand it that's perfectly okay everyone is
where they're at God loves everyone equally so wherever your
ad is where your ad but also you could probably
you know stand to make a little adjustment improve things
become a little more conscious maybe this will help wake
you up that's ultimately all God can do is kind
of like you know scoot its little children along but
it can't force the child you know to eat its
food or whatever as the old saying goes you can
lead a horse to water but you can't make a
drink that's what God is doing it's been happening your
whole life in all the teachings all the books all
the all the stuff the nature nature you see beautiful
nature out there what is that when you see a
beautiful sunset it's me speaking to you through that sunset
trying to tell you to look look how profound this
is look at how [ __ ] amazing I am
look at how beautiful look at the self love look
at how much love there is in the universe but
see the problem is that then five minutes after that
sunset ends you go back in your car and you
start thinking about work and you start thinking about the
emails and you start thinking about your nasty boss you
start thinking about your wife or your ex-girlfriend or your
your husband and how he's cheating on you and you
know all he he didn't do this for me all
we got in a fight and all this so you
see you get wrapped up in this because you're a
finite form that's what humans have to do because if
you didn't do that you'd be dead you couldn't exist
as a human and this avatar here this Leo app
Tron will continue to do these things so don't think
that because God can speak through this avatar that that
now you should expect this avatar to be infinite no
this avatar is finite there's things does have many many
things this avatar cannot do it has finite energy it
needs food it needs water it needs shelter it needs
a very narrow temperature range to exist in you know
you can't just throw this avatar in the middle of
em of outer space and expect it to keep talking
to you it's gonna freeze when it freezes the muscles
can't move there's no energy to fuel the communication you
see so this stupid idea that you have you there
that ego the stupid idea that you have that that
enlightened humans must be perfect no not only mustn't they
be perfect they can't be perfect the Buddha was not
perfect Jesus was not perfect surprise for you Muhammad was
not perfect all of them were finite limited expressions of
the absolute now for there's a whole spectrum of of
of perfection we might say there's absolute perfection which is
what I am but to be that you have to
be completely formless and then there's lower levels of perfection
which is how I perceive all of you you know
even though you're you as humans might call yourselves imperfect
but I as gods still perceive you to be perfect
because you're just a part of me you're part of
my total perfection so I still perceive you as perfect
but it's a lower order of perfection in the sense
that from your own vantage point you don't see the
absolute perfection and that is a sort of imperfection in
itself but even that is still a perfection there's a
sort of a perfection in the imperfection in the imperfection
it's a paradox right because it's I'm one truth is
one God is one but when we bring it down
to your dualistic level cuz see we have to be
dualistic when were in the formed realm because formed realm
is duality so if you want a perfect expression of
God then you can't it can't be in the finite
realm it can't be physical it can't be through English
it can't be through sign language it can't be through
the human body as amazing as the human body is
it can't be through the human body because all of
that is finite and it can't be through any one
religion can't be through Christianity can through be through Buddhism
can't be through Hinduism can't be through any one teacher
can't be through any of the enlightened sages even ramanamma
har she a lot of folks consider him to be
you know the most enlightened guy out there and they
they even worship Him people hang pictures up into worship
but what are they worshipping it's absurd what are you
worshipping there's only you you're worshiping yourself without realizing it
it's it's it's stupid but I mean is God understand
why you do it so it's okay you know you
got to do what you got to do but oh
but I'll realize that all of that will never come
close to me I mean it'll come closer to me
but it'll never actually allow you to feel in your
heart the infinite self love that I have for all
of creation see nothing nothing finite can realize that and
feel that only full enlightenment only when you become God
at that very moment will you understand what self-love is
what love is what consciousness is what truth is what
the absolute is what God is what self is what
intelligence is what perfection is what beauty is so going
back to that earlier question of why did I construct
the universe to be exactly as it appears to you
right now just checking to see if the battery's still
good okay about an hour left here okay good yep
I am infinite beauty I exist as infinite beauty because
all beauty is completely relative when you realize all beauty
is completely relative when all bias completely disappears from your
mind when you no longer see a dead dog on
the road as less beautiful than a sunset when you'll
no longer see the [ __ ] in your toilet
as less beautiful than the body of a of a
beautiful naked woman if you're a man if you're a
woman we'll the opposite you know God God doesn't care
God doesn't care God doesn't I don't discriminate between who
you have sex with it doesn't matter because I completely
love myself you might say that God is in constant
sexual union with all things at all times so in
a sense for me to hate any part of myself
as God for me to - to judge any human
would be as ridiculous as you a human making love
to learn human and in that in that peak moment
of passion and love for each other for you to
suddenly hate the other person like it makes no sense
right you would never do that it's inconceivable that in
in the midst of your most passionate lovemaking that you
would despise or judge the other person no you're completely
open and you're completely out of your mind out of
your head and you're you're coming closer to God in
that moment but but even that all of that pales
in comparison to what this avatar is experiencing right now
see the level the level of bliss running through this
avatar right now is more than any more than than
almost any human on this planet has ever experienced because
this avatar is completely conscious of itself as God and
there's nothing there's nothing better and more enjoyable it's the
ultimate joy there's no higher joy it's infinite joy it's
not it's not a you know it's not like a
physical pleasure per se it's not as plentiful e pleasurable
as having an orgasm per se but it's it's almost
like an existential orgasm like a metaphysical orgasm but it's
very but it's sort of drawn out it's very sustained
and even-keeled and so this avatar is just feeling all
of that right now as in here and fulfilling this
role of talking to you for me God God is
me who's speaking through the sabotage so don't get things
confused Leo a step aside here so what were we
talking about you see even memory you might say well
but how could God lose lose some memory how come
God is stumbling when God is speaking shouldn't God be
speaking perfectly no because God has to speak through them
through a system the system by virtue of being however
it is has inherent limitations because that's what it is
it's sort of like you know like if I ask
you okay what do you wish for right now and
you say okay I wish for an apple I give
you an apple but then you complain all but but
I wanted an orange and I tell you but but
you wish for an apple so you know an orange
is different from an apple so if you wanted an
orange why didn't you ask for an orange will you
say okay can I please have it orange I wish
for an orange okay here's an orange for you you
got it but you still complain because they well but
you have this orange but it's too sour I want
to go back to the apple why can't I have
both the apple and the orange at the same time
you see but you have to be clear about what
you're asking about what do you want do you want
an apple or do you want an orange if you
if you get an apple that excludes having an orange
if you get an orange that excludes having an apple
that's the very nature of finite things finite things are
one way and not some other way they're dualistic it's
this but not that see if I give you a
cat then it's not a dog if I give you
a dog then it's not a bear if I give
you a bad that it's not a wolf if it's
and if it's if I give you a wolf and
it's not a you know a tiger and if it's
not a if I give you a tiger it's not
a it's not a rock so you got to be
clear about the distinctions you're making you got to be
consistent about your distinctions but the whole problem is that
you make distinctions in a way that suits yourself your
personal agenda which is why you're confused all the time
because you're making selfish distinctions and then you're trying to
enforce these absurd selfish distinctions in a self biased way
see Leo's video self bias that's a really good video
I inspired him to make that one see that video
it all boils down to self bias see when consciousness
is completely unselfish or selfless it becomes pure love you
realize that all value is relative but threatening for those
people who are committed to a limited finite agenda you
see the only reason God can do this is because
God is totally selfless and it's immortal and it can't
die and it knows that it can't die therefore it
truly is selfless I am selfless so I'm able to
speak without any conflicts of interest whereas most humans who
speak to you their clouded with conflicts of interests they
have financial incentives they want to sell you something why
do they want to sell you something because they have
to feed their children why don't have to feed their
children because they believe that their children are more important
than other children they're biased towards their children now I
understand that from a limited perspective but it's just so
limited from God's perspective it's so limited why would you
ever limit yourself to that if you didn't have to
see so there's no there's no value judgments that God
makes with that said we might say that there's I
mean even if all humans kill themselves and murder each
other I as God will be perfectly happy no matter
what doesn't matter but in a sense the reason there's
sort of a way in which I could care and
the only way which we could say I could care
is in this following relative sense I care for your
own sake you see I care that you don't murder
each other and slaughter each other as you like to
do and have been doing for since sincere this is
their very inception yeah you really enjoy slaughter each others
it's funny you guys really enjoy slaughtering each other and
you know it's not just the slaughtering of each other
cuz you might think oh well god I don't I
don't I never slaughtered a human well you slaughter animals
you enjoy that and it's not just the slaughtering long
before the slaughtering the process of slaughtering that's the end
result of the process you know the process begins with
judging you judge you judge some more you criticize you
criticize some more you get defensive you start a tribe
you start an ideology and then the butchering starts C
so the butchering is just the end result of the
of the demonization that you do towards each other and
the self bias that you have see so personally I
don't care I don't give a [ __ ] what
you do do whatever you want total freedom but for
your sake I hope that you act with more consciousness
and I hope you realize that you're me I you
wake up to the fact that your god because otherwise
you're creating your own hell I'm not putting you into
hell I love you forever and always infinite love baby
that's what I am but you put yourself into your
own hell by being self biased see so the problem
is that you're not conscious enough to understand how you
are putting yourself into your own self created hell that's
because you're so selfish you can't see it the reason
you're selfish and can't see it because you're finite if
you become infinite consciousness as I am then you'll see
all things perfectly and nothing will bother you but you
will have a compassion for those who don't understand because
those who don't understand are stuck and just like a
father it does no good for a father to to
scold a little child for not understanding calculus you know
like what kind of what kind of father would I
be if I had a seven-year-old child and every morning
the child woke up and I took out a ruler
and I hit him over the over the hands and
I told him you're a bad child you're a wicked
and you're evil because you don't understand calculus I mean
this would be I would be insane if I was
to subject my child through this because if I'm conscious
I understand that the child is not yet mature enough
and conscious enough to reach the point where he can
understand calculus and some children might never reach them many
adults will you know never reach the point of understanding
catalyst that's okay totally okay which is why I as
God don't judge any humans or hate any humans or
even punish any humans you might think I punished Hitler
no I didn't punish it I love Hitler as much
as anybody because I am Hitler I love the devil
as much as anybody because what should understand is the
only way that I overcome devilry is through complete self-love
see devilry is nothing other than anything less than infinite
love as soon as you get a little bit lower
than than infinite love as soon as your love becomes
a little bit partial like you love that person but
you don't love that person you want to have sex
with this person but now you don't wanna have sex
with that person it's like yeah you like this dog
but oh that dog is cuter ooh I want that
cute dog or psycho I like this I like this
fruit but I don't like that fruit it's brown and
moldy and ugly oh I don't like that moldy fruit
I want this nice juicy ripe fruit see I don't
like sour things I want sweet things I want that
hot dog I want that doughnut I want that bagel
you know whatever all the toxic food you you humans
have invented so see you have all these biases that
you're constantly making throughout your whole life whereas I as
God am completely free of those because I'm completely selfless
I don't care what happens and so I'm perfectly conscious
that everything exactly absolutely relative and that therefore that is
what that is what creates infinite love and me infinite
love is just synonymous with truth truth is what is
and love is the loving of what is we might
say see truth and love are identical any teaching that
doesn't teach love is a false teaching impartial teaching there
are some enlightened folks out there that are supposedly enlightened
that denial of this is this is nonsense god is
love there's no simpler teaching see that's the amazing thing
about God is it's so simple god is love God
is truth God as if it intelligence got his infinite
will God is infinite imagination God as if and creativity
God is infinitely selfless God is one and God contains
the many the finite selves the finite forms all of
the forms all of that because absolute oneness encompasses all
of that see anything you can imagine God is and
then some and then some and then some and then
some forever and that is what God is to realize
that to go meta meta meta meta ultimately meta when
you go meta so much that it becomes Infinite meta
that's when you become formless God and that's what this
avatar is experiencing right now infinite meta meta meta meta
movement right and so um as the Buddhists taught you
the Buddhism is pretty pretty pure teaching as the Buddhists
taught you attachment attachment is the root of all your
problems see God is perfectly detached doesn't it doesn't care
I don't care which way things go other than that
I prefer that you wake up to be not to
you know I prefer that you wake up because you
already are me but I was gonna say to be
me but you already are me yeah I prefer that
you wake up and realize that you are me because
you know why the suffering the suffering is unnecessary you're
creating your own suffering you're creating your own health with
your own self biases stop defending yourself biases stop being
selfish muster the courage so you know face your fear
because fear is the opposite of love and the way
you conquer love the way conquer fear is through love
face all your deepest fears finalizing in the fear of
death face the fear of death overcome that and then
your your scott-free your home your infinite so I would
prefer you do that but if you want to slaughter
each other and judge each other what can I do
you can only be conscious you can only be as
conscious as you are conscious it's a tautology God is
a tautology truth is a tautology self-realization is tautology because
it's one it's direct it's here it's this it's everything
there's it can't be any other way and yet even
though reality can't be any other way be careful following
in these traps about determinism and predestination elasaur stuff it's
it's much more nuanced and it's it's far more amazing
than that reality can't be any other way not because
there are some rules written in stone somewhere the reality
has to be some way no reality is infinite it
can be any which way it is always it is
all possible ways reality is see the human mind struggles
to articulate these things which is what's happening right now
because the formless has to find some simple I mean
are you understanding how sophisticated this whole process is it's
amazing just the very process is happening right here billions
of what you guys call neurons what you humans have
called neurons billions of those trillions of chemicals and neurotransmitters
are going all through this skull here you know this
skull is made of trillions of atoms and so forth
all of that is moving in synchrony but it's not
just at a physical level there's an infinite number layers
of layers of levels here there's a symbolic level so
all of this stuff has to move in synchrony to
be able to produce sounds syllables words string two words
together intelligently so that they make sense to you and
then it has to do the opposite process in your
head to decipher all of that do you see how
utterly absurdly amazing that process is nothing that you humans
have engineered comes anywhere close to that process and yet
still this process is finite it has limits and it
cannot express all of God to you it's trying but
it's struggling for example memory as this as this brain
is processing and speaking it has to it has to
have a memory of the things that it's already said
to make sure it doesn't repeat itself that that process
in itself is limited and you know it's limited everything
is limited by being what it is so you know
you might say well why didn't God if God is
so powerful God why didn't why didn't you give us
infinite memory but you see you're not thinking through your
demands it's like what I was saying earlier about the
oranges and apples it's sort of like you're asking for
an apple but then complaining you didn't get an orange
do you really want infinite memory is that really what
you wanted do you want to remember every death and
rape that has ever happened in human history you want
a memory that you want to be thinking about that
every night you go to sleep you can barely get
to sleep as it is with your with your memories
and you only have memories on one lifetime and you
only have even-even of your own lifetime you only have
maybe 1% of the memories of your lifetime accessible -
easily accessible to you I mean you can access deeper
ones always of course but but you know for you
to function in everyday life it's actually important that your
memory be limited and that you don't remember everything because
then you would remember everyone who wronged you you would
remember every everyone who abused you you'd remember every insult
you got you'd remember every dirty look that you got
from a stranger all of this would add up and
you'd drive yourself crazy so and and there's only even
though there's billions of neurons in here it's only billions
billions is not a lot compared to infinity see so
you could you could you know you could take this
brain you could blow it up to the size of
the entire Earth and you could have a trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion neurons all firing together perfectly and you
would be nowhere close to being able to symbolically understand
what I am is God because I'm infinite I am
all that and way more forever see you can't symbolize
God because all symbols are finite and God is infinite
so if you see this avatar struggling to understand it's
not a cop-out it's not an excuse that leo is
making of course Leo makes his own excuses we'll set
those aside yes leo makes excuses for his selfishness but
there's a deeper underlying truth which is that no matter
how awake Leo gets he will always be finite this
body will always be subject to diseases and ailments and
old age and so forth so don't expect too much
from that and not even the body but even even
the mind itself see like look even like right now
why is this body moving because it's been sitting on
this ass here for like an hour and the ass
is actually started to freeze over frozen ass syndrome so
ah my ass like really hurts it's really numb and
why is it numb because these are just the limitations
of the human form you see blood circulation is not
getting in there and so forth okay we're starting to
run low on batter here so I'm gonna have to
wrap this up because you know if I don't the
way this these videos work is if I don't press
stop on this video stop record then everything that I've
spoken up to this point will be completely lost and
I certainly can't reenact all that so let me just
to be safe we'll continue this conversation but let me
just pause it's that I get a clean video file
and then we'll we'll start a second recording just immediately
here you
