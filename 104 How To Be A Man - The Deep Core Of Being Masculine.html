            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/X6YM_WUP5ik' target='_blank'>How To Be A Man - The Deep Core Of Being Masculine</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo Gura's Concept of Masculinity</b>: Leo Gura believes that the essence of a man is measured by authenticity, truthfulness, the courage to self-express, emotional stability and knowledge of personal values and principles. 
</li><li><b>Masculinity and Emotional Stability</b>: A key attribute of masculinity, according to Leo, is a high level of unreactiveness and emotional stability. Men need to remain grounded and calm during emotional storms, acting as pillars, immovable despite external factors.
</li><li><b>Independence and Self-Happiness</b>: Leo highlights the importance of men being able to derive happiness from themselves, being independent and requiring no external validation, including from women.
</li><li><b>Connection with Sexuality</b>: For Leo, authentic masculinity involves men fully embracing and openly expressing their sexuality without feelings of shame or guilt. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Masculinity on Relationships</b>: Leo avows that women are drawn to men who are authentic, emotionally stable, and unapologetically sexual. Men should not need women, but appreciate them as additions to their already fulfilled lives.
</li><li><b>Role of Age in Masculinity</b>: According to Leo, older men often display more mature levels of masculinity. They've had time to develop a solid understanding of their identity and self-worth. This assurance and maturity are attractive to many women.   
</li><li><b>Meaning of Masculinity</b>: Leo Gura defines masculinity as the desire to impact the world in a positive and creative way. A masculine man is always looking to "give" to the world and share his unique gifts and energy.
</li><li><b>Exploration of Masculinity through Interactions</b> : Building masculinity involves interactions, particularly with women. A man's ability to navigate these relationships while remaining authentic and grounded is crucial to his growth and development.
</li><li><b>Penetrating the world as a man</b>: Leo Gura uses the metaphor of a man "penetrating" the world to discuss how men should embody their authentic selves, enthusiasms, and talents to make a positive contribution to society. This active part in society mirrors the active role that men play in sex, which he refers to as the man giving his "seed." 
</li><li><b>Importance of a life purpose for a man</b>: Gura believes that men find fulfilment through creation in their professional and personal pursuits, which he likens to their "seed." A man's life purpose, he argues, becomes his identity, acting as a cornerstone for his confidence, stability, and authenticity. 
</li><li><b>Women as secondary to a man's life purpose</b>: Asserting that women prefer men who are dedicated to their own goals and passions, Gura advises men never to prioritize their romantic relationships over their life purposes. He suggests that a woman's attraction is heightened when she sees her partner succeeding in his endeavors and staying true to his life purpose. 
</li><li><b>Requirement of Confidence and Overcoming Fear for Success</b>: A significant part of achieving life purpose and success in a career, according to Gura, is extreme self-confidence. Men need to set their fears and anxieties aside, which he refers to as "girly qualities," to progress. 
</li><li><b>Arriving at True Masculinity</b>: Gura highlights the importance of self-acceptance, pushing past personal barriers, and identifying your life purpose as vital steps to becoming a more authentic, attractive, confident man. He acknowledges that this journey towards becoming a mature, psychologically developed man, can take until one's late 30s and requires effort and time. 
</li><li><b>Masculinity for oneself</b>: Gura believes that men's endeavors to be more masculine should primarily be for themselves rather than to attract the opposite sex. He stresses the importance of finding fulfilment in embodying masculine characteristics and not seeking validation from others.
</li><li><b>Exploring Sexuality</b>: Leo encourages men, particularly young men, to actively engage in sexual relationships with multiple partners, as it presents an essential opportunity for growth and understanding oneself. By being with numerous women, men can learn about their own sexuality, become more confident, and develop skills such as flirting, maintaining emotional stability, and reacting to the various emotions women might express.
</li><li><b>Prioritizing Life Purpose</b>: Leo puts a sharp focus on the importance of men developing a strong career and an even stronger sense of purpose. Even if it takes many years and resources, figuring out one's life purpose should be a priority above other things, including relationships with women. Losing sight of it implies losing power and masculinity, according to Leo.
</li><li><b>Venturing Out of Comfort Zones</b>: To further cultivate masculinity, men should expand their tolerance and grow by regularly pushing their own comfort zones. This means exploring life, which includes trying out new foods, travelling, reading books, conversing with different people, and more. It's suggested that constant exploration and crossing personal boundaries ultimately instill confidence, a significant masculine trait.
</li><li><b>Opening up to New Experiences</b>: Leo advises men not to limit their lives to one domain but to diversify. Learning from different careers, relationships, and materials can contribute to a man's overall growth, aiding him in becoming a 'real man.' He endorses broadening horizons and being open to learning from various sources.
</li><li><b>Truth in Advice Despite Resistance</b>: Despite the controversial nature of his advice, Leo insists that his words are grounded in truth. While societal norms might push back against this perspective, countless men have found these tips effective. He urges listeners to keep an open mind and trust the process. 
</li><li><b>Subscriptions for Additional Content</b>: Leo promotes his platform, Actualized.org, sharing that it offers a broad range of content that can help men develop personal growth, confidence, and purpose in life indirectly. It includes bonuses like exclusive videos, a chance to win live coaching sessions, and more for its subscribers.
