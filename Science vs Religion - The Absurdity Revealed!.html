Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about science versus religion. And
what I see as the sheer absurdity of the modern
science versus religion debate. It's shocking to me how ignorant
modern rational thinkers are, about what spirituality actually is, and
how it works. And so here, I'm going to be
talking a lot about some of the fallacies that rational
thinkers very intelligent, scientifically minded people make when it comes
to this topic. In fact, my brother sent me this
book recently, which he wanted me to read. It's called
a universe from nothing. And it's a science slash physics
slash cosmology book written by a theoretical physicist, pretty popular
guy called Lawrence Krauss. And it was interesting, I was
reading this book. And you know, this book talks about
basically, how can you have a universe in the first
place? Where does it come from? What if it came
from nothing, literally nothing. And he talks about some of
the modern theoretical physics and relativity theory and quantum mechanics,
how all these theories different, different theories connect together, and
how they could explain that the universe could in theory,
materialize out of nothingness. And so it's kind of cool.
But what's interesting, what I found really baffling about his
arguments here is that the way he's arguing in the
book is like, he's kind of presenting the scientific paradigm
of like, rational thinking and analysis and fact based science,
basically. And then also, on the other hand, he's talking
about the religious, the Christian faith, or whatever faith you
want to take about God, and how, how the two
can be reconciled. And also, it's kind of like, well
look at how superior sciences to this religious stuff here.
And he basically tries to boil it all down into
science. And it's very fascinating to me, because of the
key fallacy that Lawrence Krauss makes here, which is something
that Ken Wilber identified very pointedly he talks about this
in many of his books. And it's called the pre
rational post rational fallacy. And so I'm gonna go into
a lot of depth as to what this is, because
this is a very important fallacy to understand, if you
want to be pursuing spirituality. And also if you just
really want a very high level, very accurate understanding of
what the hell is going on in life, and what
the hell is going on with societies over the last
couple 1000 years. Now, Lawrence Krauss is one example of
someone who has no idea that he's a rationalist, and
that he's missing out on something called post rationalism. There's
basically pre rational thinking, then that evolves into rational thinking,
and then that evolved into post rational thinking. Now, the
problem that rationalists make is that they take post rational
thinking, and they conflate it and confuse it with pre
rational thinking. Also, the pre rationalists make the same mistake
is that the pre rationalist looks at post rational thinking,
and then brings it down to his level and thinks
of it as a justification or a proof of pre
rationalism. And this whole thing is a big mess. So
we're going to sort this out right here. What's crazy
is that I see, not just this guy here making
this mistake, but I see a lot of good scientists,
in modern times making this mistake. For example, I was
reading a book by Martin Seligman, who's a PhD, and
he's one of the founding fathers of positive psychology. And
I really respect that guy for the research and the
work that he's done. He's got some great books, but
also, like, I was reading one of his latest books,
and he was also struggling with this problem. Well, how
do you reconcile God? And also, how do you reconcile
that with positive psychology and evolution and happiness? And, you
know, it seems like there's a certain directionality to evolution
in life, and how do you reconcile all this stuff?
And you know, I can just, I'm reading the pages
and knowing some perspective that I know now. It's just
so silly, looking at the way that this man is
thinking through this problem, because he's thinking and he's trying
to solve this problem on a level that the problem
can't be solved that he's trying to sell On a
rational level, where in fact it needs to be solved
at a post rational level. And you see this with
popular atheists, popular popular atheist writers and authors and scientists
and speakers. So for example, some other people would be
Richard Dawkins, who actually wrote the foreword, or I believe
the afterword for this book here. Also Christopher Hitchens. He
died recently, but he was a really popular and outspoken
critic of religion. And he had debates and stuff and
he wrote books about it, popular guy, he made the
same mistake, all these people are making the same mistake.
And even though their intentions are nice, and their intentions
are basically to, to evolve completely out of pre rational
and irrational and what they're trying to do is we're
trying to take pre rational people and convince them of
rationality. But the problem in doing that is that they're
not seeing the thing that they're missing, which is post
rationality, which is what I'll talk about in a minute
here. Also, Freud made this mistake. When Freud was studying
higher spiritual truths. What he ended up doing is he
ended up boiling them all down to infantile notions of
repressions. And in childhood fears and anxieties that we all
have. So he he really missed the mark on that
one. And also really, sadly, Joseph Campbell, Joseph Campbell, who
I really love, because he's very central to what we
do here at actualized. org, which is to promote, you
know, living a purposeful life, and mastering your own life.
And being on the hero's journey. He came up with
the concept of the hero's journey, he studied a lot
of mythologies around the world. And basically what he did
is he started boiling them all down, he started finding
the common thread between all these different mythologies from Western
and Eastern and other types of cultures, tribal cultures, and
what he discovered is there a common threads and elements.
The problem though, is that he didn't actually understand post
rational truths, he boiled them down into rational truths, because
he was at a rational place in his own life.
That's how his mind worked. That's how it's like he
was working. And also he basically turned it in like
a form of poetry and into this mythos, which is
nice. But that's not actually where these truths reside. That's
not where they came from. And what's really fascinating is
that all the religious truths that the common masses believe
in the pre rational mind, most of them, I would
say, 90% of them, if not more, come from actually
post rational visionaries from 1000s of years ago, and those
truths are still largely untouched by human beings, by the
masses and by society, largely completely misunderstood. Not just by
by the pre rationalist, but especially by the rationalists. And
this is something that we need to really dig into.
See, the problem is, is that the rational mind confuses
spiritual, spiritual truths with religious myths. But that's not what
they are. Not at all. The pre rational mind confuses
spiritual truths with religion. But that's not also correct. To
the rational mind. Spiritual truths and religious myths both smell
the same, they seem very similar. And so what happens
is that there's like a, an overreaction that happens. And
we basically think about it, you know, rational person in
modern times says, well, there's all these religions, and they
saw all they say all these, you know, things that
don't really seem apparent, and a lot of them contradict
each other. And historically, we know that there's there's been
war and violence in the name of religion, and nobody
agrees with nobody else. And so it must be all
nonsense. And that religion is somehow used as like, maybe
a control mechanism or something is deeply flawed there. It's
basically irrational. And wouldn't it be nice if we could
erase that, especially on a societal level, if we could
fix that would not really advance society to the next
stage of evolution. And on the surface, you know, that
sounds very reasonable. It sounds very nice. But there's more
to the story than that. A lot more to the
story. The problem here and the reason that I really
want to discuss this issue in a lot of depth
is because I'm releasing videos now about spirituality, and about,
about enlightenment And the problem that creates for me is
that it, it makes me look like a new age
wacko. And that's how I look in the rational person's
mind. Because again, when I'm talking about this stuff, it
almost seems now as though I'm going to be making
an argument for religion. And for pre rationalism, it's also
going to seem to you, if you're in the rational
stage of conscious evolution, it's going to seem to you
that I'm either making apologies for religion, or that what
I'm going to be saying is going to be like,
a new form of religion or a way to kind
of like mollify religion and to save religion. But that's
not what I'm saying at all. Right, my point is
a lot more subtle, and a lot more nuanced. So
stay with me, don't just cast me into the pre
rational category. Don't cast me off as a new age
wacko, until you hear me out. So what's the problem
here with rational thinkers? Well, the problem really is that
enlightenment gets labeled as religious nonsense. And enlightened enlightenment is
a real thing, which is accessible to every human being,
every normal, well functioning human being, it's accessible, and enlightenment,
simply the truth of no self. And I'm not going
to go into a lot of detail about what that
really means. I've got many videos on that. So you
might want to check out my spiritual alignment intro video
for what that really is. But basically, it means that
this entity that you think that you are, who's running
the show in your life doesn't actually exist? It's a
fiction. The ego is a fiction, your self concept is
a fiction. Now, the rational mind might listen to that
and say, okay, that kind of makes maybe some plausible
sense. But see, the problem is that the rational mind
stays rational. And you actually can't access the truth of
enlightenment. By staying in the rational mind, you have to
let the rational mind go and evolved into the post
rational. But this can seem a little bit like regressing
into the pre rational. And so there's going to be
resistance from the rational standpoint, for doing this. And that's
the biggest problem. The problem here is that when you're
entrenched in rationalism, you prevent yourself from growing to higher
levels, you prevent yourself from self actualizing, you prevent yourself
from tasting some of the most beautiful and profound truths
in life. You cut that off for yourself as a
possibility. And that's a shame. And I want to convince
you that there's a little more out there for it
than you think. There's a big difference between voodoo and
shamanism, if we put that in one category. And then
let's say, priests preaching to you at the pulpit, and
churches and cathedrals, and mosques and the typical fundamentalist Christian
or Islamic believer, put that in, let's say, second category.
And then the third category, which is Zen masters and
Yogi's. These, to the rational mind all seem similar. And
in fact, you might lump them all together and say,
Oh, it's all religious, jibber jabber. It's all mythology. It's
all kind of wishful thinking. And it's all delusion of
the masses. And none of it is rational. None of
it is scientific. So let's just throw that out. But
what you don't see is that these three categories are
functioning at completely different paradigms of psychic development and conscious
development. And in fact, you as the scientific rational thinker
that you think that you are, are not above the
Zen master yogi, you're way below him. You may be
above in your mental development of a priest or fundamentalist
believer, and you're certainly above voodoo and shamanism, but you're
way behind. The more advanced than master yogi, and the
Zen master and Yogi know something that you don't know.
And it's not just a fairy tale. It's a real
facet of reality. And it's a facet of reality that
science and the rational mind has a lot of difficulty
grappling with exactly because of the inherent limitations of rationalism.
So let's talk a little bit about that. The rational
mind creates a problem for itself. And this is a
classic problem that has been well known in philosophy Be
for 1000s of years, but especially 500 years ago, with
Rene Descartes, it became very poignant. And that's the mind
body problem. The mind body problem, it's a deep topic,
I can't cover all of it here. But just to
gloss over it. What the mind body problem says is,
well, if we look around at reality, what we see
is that there's really two fundamental substances, it seems like
there's first person phenomenon, which we call the mind, tastes,
and sounds and thoughts and feelings and emotions and colors.
This is all found kind of in the internal world,
in the mind. And then there's also the external world
of matter and energy, and people and cars, and societies
and outer space, and galaxies, and so on, and so
forth. And that's the body. Okay? The problem, though, is
that this creates a dualism. And basically, it's not clear
how the mind affects the body, or how the body
affects the mind how these two things causally interact with
each other, if they're totally different substances. Doesn't make a
lot of sense. Now, a lot of smart people have
made a lot of different arguments and claims about how
to resolve the mind body problem. You know, entire books
have been written about it for hundreds of years. But
really, the problem has not been resolved in modern times
by science. And in fact, science does an interesting thing.
And what modern, academic, strict science does, is it really
does away with first person phenomenon altogether. It pretty much
denies that it exists. And it just kind of skirts,
this whole mind body problem entirely, leaving it to philosophers
and metaphysicians. And saying, Oh, it's not really important. And
the way it does this is either by denying first
person phenomenon completely, or by reducing it to third person
phenomenon, which is, you know, reduction of mind into body.
So what is the mind? Well, it's just neurons in
the brain. It's just, ultimately atoms and molecules and quarks
and whatever else. Physical matters composed of. And that's all
there is to the story. Sometimes the very hardcore, just
blatant reductionism, sometimes scientists do it in a very subtle,
sneaky way. But almost across the board, some kind of
reductionism is going on. Or, if not reductionism, then the
mind body problem is just there. It's the elephant in
the room, and no one's looking at it. And this
creates a problem, because really, science has not reconciled how
matter and mind function together. It's a big mystery. And
the problem is that science will never resolve this. It
seems like well, if we just do more neuroscience will
resolve it, actually, we won't. Because the problem goes beyond
the rational paradigm. The rational mind doesn't like to admit
that the rational perspective is actually a perspective. And that
it has limits. Like every perspective, sometimes being hyper rational,
it just seems like oh, well, you know, rationality is
the thing. It's the thing. It's the tool, or instrument
through which we get to understand how the universe is.
And we get to understand the very fundamental workings of
the universe, using our rational mind by modeling it and
experimenting with its sign scientifically. But actually, that's not really
how it works. Rationalism is a perspective, in the same
sense that religious thinking, pre rational thinking is a perspective
to let's talk a little bit about this, because it
is very important. A man by the name of Clare
graves, did some brilliant research in the last century, and
following him and even preceding him. There's been a lot
of research done in the last 100 years about the
stages of development of the human psyche. And this research
has been done by serious hardcore scientists. And what's shocking
is that they develop models of psychic evolution, which are
extremely consistent and explain a whole hell Have a lot.
In fact, when you understand one of these models, the
entire world opens up to you, in a sense, you
start to have an understanding of how you fit into
the world, and how societies evolve and how they work
and why people behave the way they do. And a
lot of stuff that hadn't made sense to you previously,
all of a sudden starts to make a hell of
a lot of hope, a whole lot, a lot of
sense. So let me explain, take some time to explain
this graves model. And it's such a deep concept that
I'm gonna shoot more videos on this in the future.
But this is going to be, you know, an introduction
here. So basically, what graves did is he interviewed a
lot of human beings. And he was looking at what
they valued the most. And what he found out is
that what a human being values actually depends on his
level of development. Development here, think of it in the
sense that if you take a take a chicken, first,
it's it starts out as an egg, then it hatches,
it's a little chick, then it grows up until bigger
chick, then all of a sudden, his feathers, which were
yellow, for, you know, start becoming whiteness or scrolling up,
and it becomes a real, you know, adult chicken. And
then if supposedly, if you'll know, you'll let it live
for a long time, usually, we don't eat them. But
if you let it live for a long time, it
will become kind of old and decrepit. And so you've
got stages of which stages through which this organism passes
through. And what's interesting is that it's not just that
one chicken does it this way, every chicken does it
this way. And it turns out to be the same
for human beings. But what's interesting for human beings is
we're not just talking about physical development, through, you know,
childhood, teenage years, early adulthood, midlife and then late, elderly
adulthood. That's obvious. But also there's cyclic development. And this
is something that most people miss. In the grace model,
he had stages. And to each stage, he gave colors,
and he gave numbers and various labels. What's really interesting
is that not only the the stages, but I'm just
going to tell you right now, they not only apply
to you and to your potential psychic development, but also
to the development of societies, because societies reflect the individuals
that constitute those societies. And so that has huge ramifications.
So basically, one of the earliest levels, I'm not going
to go to the very basic levels, because they're so
basic for our purposes, like level two or three is
called Purple, in the graves model. And purple is what
he calls magic thinking. This is where human beings come
together. We're talking about society here, and they form a
tribe. And they count as a tribe and live together
as a tribe. And they're very tribal. So you can
still find these kinds of tribal societies living in the
Amazon and other, you know, underdeveloped, places, wild places, still
left on Earth, so you can find them. And what
is characterized here is a lot of Magical Thinking, because
the mind is pre rational. It doesn't have scientific paradigms,
it doesn't know how to do empirical observations, it doesn't
really understand how the universe works. And so the universe
seems very mysterious and kind of mystical. And so this
is where you get shamanism and voodoo and stories and
myths about spirits and dragons, and ghosts and all this
kind of stuff. Magic type thinking, what happens if you
take that and you evolve it to the next stage?
Then you go from purple to red. The red stage
is egocentric. egocentric, interestingly enough, is breaking away from tribalism.
And instead, it's asserting individuality. And now, actually, the society
in the tribe starts to break down. There's not a
society, there's a tribe. Society comes later, before you can
have a society what happens you have chaos and kind
of lawlessness. So what happens is that people within the
tribe realize, Hey, why am I behaving cooperatively in the
tribe when I can just become the king or the
ruler for monarch, and basically, dictate orders and take all
the women for myself, and all the money for myself
and all the food for myself? Seems a lot better
than what I've got now. And so that's exactly what
happens is that there's a vying for power. There's like
a power struggle, and then someone prevails and becomes the
dictator. So the tribe evolves into dictatorship. then, from that
stage, you can evolve higher into the next stage, which
is called Blue. Blue is the absolutist stage. Here, another
evolution happens. And what people realize as society is like,
wait a minute, we don't like living and working under
a dictator. It's quite brutal. Let's take his power back
and form now a society, not a tribe, but like
a real society with laws and a constitution, and a
lot of hierarchy, a lot of bureaucracy. And so here,
you have the creation of the modern civilizations, and even
the ancient civilizations. So think about Egypt, ancient China, Greece
and Rome. These were absolutist. Why absolutist? Well, because they
set a lot of rigid hierarchies and standards and cultural
norms. No longer could one individual just come in there
and dominate everybody. Now, there has to be laws, and
there has to be a constitution, there has to be
some sort of process for how to rule. And even
though sometimes, you know, people might come and seize power,
in the end, society takes it back. Because we're moving
on in our evolution. What's interesting is that the blue
stage here absolutist is where a lot of religions start
to happen. Why do religions happen here, because religions require
bureaucracy, and rigid rules. And also, in order to have
stability as a society, you need some, you know, something
like a cement holding it together. And a lot of
times that is religions job. And it functions very well.
The mind of a human being, psychologically speaking, who's at
this stage as an individual is the dogma, extreme dogma,
fundamentalism. That means this is my society. This is the
the unit of which I'm a citizen, I'm going to
fight to the death for it, and all my beliefs,
and all my cultural heritage and traditions, I'm going to
treat these with a lot of reverence. Because these are
absolutely correct. I don't see it any other way. I
don't acknowledge that there could be other cultures out there
somewhere. Beyond them, the mountains and beyond the ocean, that
could have a different culture, and a different set of
values and a different societal structure. No, I'm at the
point where I'm still blind to all that. So at
this stage, basically, what happens when you see this in
history, is that what the Europeans go and they start
conquering and colonizing the New World, right, and they start
converting all the heathens into Christians, and to Catholics, and
they start teaching them the language, and they start enforcing
their customs and habits in their system of government. Because
they're absolutist. And if you don't believe like I believe,
then basically, you're a heathen, and I should either convert
you or kill you. That's the level of thinking that
goes on there. But then, after a while of that,
we evolved to the next stage. And the next stage
is called Orange. Orange is a very interesting stage is
called individualistic, which is different than egocentric from before where
we had dictators. Orange is individualistic in the sense that
now it becomes again about the individual. It's not about
the society. Let's take power away from the society and
let's honor individual rights, liberty, and justice and freedom and
consumer culture. And also reason. At the orange stage is
where business flourishes and science flourishes and the individual flourishes.
This is the stage that American culture, a lot of
American culture right now is that also a lot of
European Western European cultures are also coming in to this
orange face. The orange face is all about the individual,
how do you make the individual's life better? How do
you improve yourself? How do you have a better business?
How do you have a better family? How do you
have more sex? How do you have more love? How
do you have a better marriage? How do you earn
more money? How do you have cool gadgets and technology?
This is why this is where and why science really
flourishes in this Phase, because this is getting into the
rational phase, right? Rational phase. And here, science is serving
business. And business is serving science. And science is empowering
the individual. So that's the stage here. This is probably
the stage that you're starting to see as Oh, yeah,
that that's pretty accurate as a description of me. But
then what happens is you can go beyond that stage,
you can go from orange to green. And green is
called relativistic. Green is what it sounds like. It's kind
of hippy, new age. It's that stereotype. What is the
hippy New Age stereotype? Well, it's people who are now
expanding their sphere of concern beyond themselves as individuals to
the environment, and the globe. So now I don't just
care about myself, and I don't just care about America,
and I don't just care about my country, or my
family, I care about everybody, I care about human beings,
I even care about animals, I want to go save
the whales. And I don't want, you know, polar bears
to go extinct from global warming. And so I care
about preserving the environment, I want to make sure that
we're all living in peace and in harmony. Notice that
if you're at the orange level, individualistic, this whole new
age hippie paradigm, it just, it makes you feel very
weird. It makes you feel kind of wrong. Like, what
do you what are you smoking? What do you smoke
it over there? That's kind of how you look at
it. Right? But nevertheless, there is this element in society
where people are expanding their sphere of influence, I mean,
the sphere of concern. And also very interestingly, the reason
it's called relativistic is that now they're taking into account
other people's perspectives. So it's no longer just me and
my absolute perspective. Now, it's like, hey, let's take that
culture into, into account too. And that culture, and this
culture, let's hear what the scientists have to say, and
what the religious people have to say, and this and
this, and we'll bring it all together. That's relativism. But
then, there's another level, yellow, the systemic thinking level. And
here, now I need to pause and make a few
comments about these different levels. Because once you move into
yellow, your entire worldview changes. There's a quantum leap from
green to yellow, in a sense, there's purple, red, blue,
orange, green. And then yellow is like an order of
magnitude above. It's a leap in development. And it's one
that very few human beings make. Here's why. One characteristic
of these levels, first of all, is that you actually
move through them, and you can't skip stages. So it's
not like you are just kind of born or you
just somehow happen to fall into one of these categories
based on around circumstance. No, there's actually a chain of,
of evolution that happens. And if you take a look
at history, this is how societies evolved. First, it was
very basic tribes, then from tribes to dictatorships, then from
that to societies, then from that to, you know, modern
governments. And then, you know, beyond and beyond and beyond,
this is what's happening, you must pass through every stage,
you can't just skip around, in the same way that
a chicken, that a chicken can't just go from an
egg to a full grown chicken, it has to pass
through the baby chicken phase. And this has been shown
by many studies. So all the stuff I'm telling you,
this has been verified by many studies. This model is
just one model. This is the graves model, there are
perhaps a dozen other models with slightly different categorizations and
labels and colors and distinctions. So the labels are somewhat
arbitrary. But there's certainly this sense of directionality to the
development of the psyche and also the society. So that's
interesting, because what you can do is you can take
a look at this spectrum and you can say, wait
a minute, where am I at? Where is my government
at? Where are my friends at? Where are my coworkers
at? And you can peg yourself on one of these
stages. The other interesting thing here is that each stage,
before yellow denies and doesn't understand this entire model. So
this model is completely opaque. You don't see this until
you get really high in your conscious development. Maybe it's
the first time you're hearing about this. And so now
your eyes are kind of opening. But before that you
didn't know where you were, why it was happening, what
was going on, you had no idea. Not only do
you not know, but you actively deny that there are
stages above you. So when you're in the magic, thinking
stage, that's all you know, you don't know rational thinking
you don't know higher levels of individualism and societies and
relativism, you don't know any of that. Magic is all
you know, you're completely bought into it. It's like a
perspective. It's like colored glasses through which you see the
whole world shades, everything you look at, then you move
up to the next level. And that level thinks now
oh, now I'm at the top, I've evolved. Look, I'm
so much better than those people down there. But this
stage still doesn't recognize it, there's a stage above it,
that it could evolve into, and so on with the
next one, and with the next one, and with the
next one, and with the next one, all the way
until you get to yellow, only at yellow, systemic thinking,
can you finally make the quantum leap. And you can
actually see this model for what it is. And it's
like, oh, it's almost like it was pre ordained, this
whole thing has been laid out. And this whole time,
I've been denying that I've been going through these stages.
And now I can see that I have gone through
all these stages. And now finally, I can actually reflectively
look in on myself and say all, that means there
must be an even higher stage than yellow. And in
fact there is in yellow is the first recognize that
there's something beyond it. Beyond itself. It's kind of like
a self consciousness that evolves. Very powerful. When you see
this all the sudden, it really opens you up. Another
really important facet of this whole model is that when
you're going from one stage to the next, it's not
that you're abandoning the stage and you're doing something totally
new. No, you're assimilating fully integrating, and then transcending that
stage to evolve to the next stage. And then again,
and then again, and then again, and then again. So
you're never abandoning, you're transcending. And this is very difficult
for the lower stages to accept. Because what they do
is that they cling to the stage that they're at,
and they don't want to transcend it. Because each stage,
and there's a lot of depth here that I won't
go into each stage has its own pros and cons.
There's some good stuff about it, but also some bad
stuff. And right now, this should be explaining a lot
to you about human history. Because if you're a student
of human history, and you look back at all the
wars that have been fought, all the religious struggles, all
the political and social and economic problems and scientific problems,
and agricultural problems, and ecological problems that have ever happened
in history, are all perfectly explained by this model. It's
really quite amazing. And what happens is that when you
get to yellow, you finally see, oh, all the struggle
and conflict in societies and with governments across the entire
globe has been happening because different people are stuck at
different stages. Each stage clings to its own position, and
then it fights with the stage below it or above
it. And none of the stages until they get to
yellow understand what the hell they're doing. They're completely unconscious
and blind to it. And this is an amazing realization
to have. It's also important to note that you can't
just pick a stage and then start to inhabit it.
So just because I told you about yellow and you
understand yellow logically doesn't mean that you have actually evolved
into yellow. If you're at Orange Juice first have to
pass through orange, learn everything Orange has to teach you.
Then you have to start to reconcile the limitations of
orange and start to see green, you have to move
into green, then you have to live through green, experience
that limit, see the limitations, start to accept the limitations,
and then start to transcend green into yellow. And that
is a process that will take you years. It's not
something you can just choose to do. And in fact,
graves himself, the guy who made this model, he himself
put himself pretty low on the on the hierarchy. He
said he was blue slash orange. He didn't put himself
at the very top. It's very interesting. So that's the
graves model. Now, why is this significant here? Well, first
of all, where are you on this model? Peg yourself.
Oh, also, I should mention that generally, what people do
when you ask them to peg themselves on this model,
is that they rate themselves to levels higher than they
actually are. So often, what happens is that if you're
at individualistic orange, you rate yourself at yellow systemic. If
you're at Green, relativistic, you rate yourself as even higher
than yellow. If you're at Blue, absolutist, ik very fundamentalist,
religious, you rate yourself as green relativistic. Pretty funny how,
how the ego plays these little games with us. So
you have to be very honest, when you rate yourself.
The problem we have with the modern science religion debate,
which is why we're talking about all this is that
what we have is we have orange people who are
individualistic, arguing with blue people who are absolutist IK. And
they're not seeing anything beyond. And that's the problem that
a lot of these very intelligent scientific thinkers make. And
the problem here is that you can't actually access spiritual
truths until you get to the very, very, very high
levels. The mind body problem cannot be resolved at the
rational level. On the other hand, the mind body problem
is perfectly resolved, completely resolved. It's been resolved for 1000s
of years, but only to those people who have evolved
to the very high levels. Do you admit that there
could be levels beyond you? Here's a verifiable claim that
I'm going to make. Because I know how much rationalists
love verifiable hardcore claims. You know, one of the arguments
that rationalists make against the pre rationalist is they say,
well, religion and myths and all this, you know, it's
so vague, you're not stating anything concrete, nothing, testable, nothing
empirical. But actually, the spiritual truths are perfectly testable and
empirical. But what you have to do is you have
to open your mind to this idea that actually there
are first person phenomenon, that stuff that you've been denying,
and that you've been reducing. That doesn't work when you
go higher. That is a limitation of the rational paradigm.
So here's my verifiable claim for you, because I know
how much you liked it. The self image what you
consider yourself as a human being, I mean, you consider
yourself a human being this ego that thinks it's there,
that I'm pointing at it right now, that this thing
is an illusion. It's not real. It seems rational, that
it's real, but actually, it's not real. It's an illusion.
In the same way that Santa Claus is an illusion,
or in the same way that Luke Skywalker is a
fictional character. Well, you who I'm pointing to right now
is as well. And rationalism is a tool that keeps
that illusion alive. Transcending that is very difficult. Because this
tool is almost perfectly designed to keep itself stuck in
the status quo. The problem is, is that this can
be empirically verified. And I'll tell you how, in a
little bit. An additional point is that all the models
that you have about reality how the world works, including
the self model, because you have a model about how
reality works. But you also have a model of how
you work and the fact that there even is a
you. That's not a real thing. That's a model. And
the famous statement comes to mind here, which is very
appropriate, is that the map is not the territory. And
the mistake you're making as a rationalist is that you're
always confusing the map for the territory. And then, in
fact, all your models are rather arbitrary. You think they're
very powerful, because you can make technology with them. And
you can fly to the moon. And seems like you
can predict particle physics and all this kind of cool
stuff. And you can. And I'm not saying there's anything
bad about that. That's great. Science is useful. I'm not
saying science is wrong. But I'm saying that the models
that science builds are based on a language system. And
they're based on human rationality, which kind of seems like,
Well, what else is there but human rationality? Well, there's
something else, there's something else, don't mistake the model for
the territory. That's what you're doing. And this can be
discovered that you're doing this, this is verifiable empirically. Beliefs
are not what they appear to be. And even though
you like to think of yourself as scientific and empirical,
actually, the whole of science is belief systems. And one
of the things you really don't like, is admitting that
you hold beliefs, really no different than the pre rational
mind. So one of the arguments that atheists like to
make is that they don't actually hold any beliefs. But
that's not actually true. They're not being self honest and
aware enough yet, to understand how many beliefs they are
holding, you are holding 1000s of beliefs. And what's fascinating,
and this is something you can discover if you evolve
to higher stages, is that all beliefs are false, because
all beliefs are just models. And models can just be
whatever you want them to be, in a sense, I
mean, not anything goes. But you can adjust your models
to fit whatever reality you want them to fit within
limits. And as much as religious people do that, and
you hate that religious people do that. Right? How Wofully
and Weasley they are, we'd have a debate with them.
While you do that, too, as a rational scientific person.
The boundaries and categories that you create for life. And
the most fundamental boundary that you create is the boundary
between self mean here and not self, everything out there.
That's a false boundary. It's a pure fiction, even though
it feels very real. It's a fiction. And if you
go and you scientifically, empirically investigate it, really, from the
first person phenomenological perspective, you're gonna discover that there are
an illusion. And when you do that, you can become
enlightened. And when you do that, your entire reality changes
completely, just like you could not imagine how much your
reality will change. Once that happens, once you actually see
that the barrier between what's me and what's not me
is a fiction. Imagine that for a second, that there's
not actually a barrier between who's talking to you right
now. And who's looking at me. You What if that
barrier wasn't real? So these are some of the verifiable
claims that I'm making. I'm not asking you to believe
me. In fact, they won't help to believe me. Because
to advance beyond this stage, the rational stage, you have
to start to transcend beliefs. And this is something that
you've never done before. You might think you've done this
before. But you've never done this before. This is a
whole new ballgame, here. And it's extremely tricky. And it's
extremely difficult. Because what you have to do is you
have to start to study your psyche, and all the
traps and pitfalls that come with the ego. And that's
a really big hornet's nest to study. So, the reason
I say all of this is basically that you know,
the modern debate that goes on between science and religion
and It is ridiculous. Because really, we've evolved way past
that debate, not as society, you know, society is still
very uninvolved. In fact, there are no societies that are
yellow. And they're not even are any societies that are
green. Most societies are blue or orange. And in fact,
if you want to take a look at the Middle
East crisis, and the problems that the US in the
Western world has with Islamic terrorists and other countries in
the Middle East, what do you think that is? What
that is, is that blue societies fighting with orange societies
and not understanding what they're doing? So illuminating? But the
reason the debate between science and religion is ridiculous, is
because what I see scientists doing is saying, Well, okay,
so, God, the religious, pre rational people say that there's
a God, well, clearly, there is no God, because we
haven't proven it. In fact, it makes no sense, scientifically,
what that would even mean. And so God is taken
to be like the old man in the clouds, sitting
above judging you with the big white beard. But that's
the pre rational understanding of God. Not the post rational.
And now, right here is the, the place where I'm
gonna start to sound like a, like a hippie, or
a new agers, though I'm making excuses for the pre
rationalist. But actually, this is, this is the case. Right?
When you take God to be an old man in
the sky, what you're not understanding is that what God
actually is, is the removing of your self concept. Not
an old man in the sky, there's no old man
in the sky. But if you actually go through and
remove yourself concept, who you think you are, and you
remove the boundary between me, not me? What does that
do? You realize how profound that is. What that does,
is that actually merges you with the rest of the
world. Not just as a belief, not in terms of
faith, but as reality, you become the entirety of reality
when you do that. And that's what post rational people
mean, when they say God, they don't mean old man
in the sky. That's just the metaphor. What they mean
is all of reality, as you see it, is you,
you are it. And that takes a lot of conscious
development to see. That's not easy to get to, because
you have to abandon and pass through all these different
stages. And so what happens is that the pre rational
post rational fallacy gets committed. So the scientific rational person,
how does he commit the fallacy? Well, he takes everything
I'm saying and says, Oh, Leo, you're just being religious,
or spiritual or hippie ish, you're not very being very
rational or scientific need more evidence, you need proof, you
need this, and that double, double blind experiments, and yada,
yada, yada, right. And so he basically just ignores what
I'm saying, because what he does is he loves the
post rational, I'm giving you a very high level right
now, post rational truth that your mind is probably not
primed to understand or accept. Because this is not a
truth that I want you to believe. This is a
treat, I want you to go discover for yourself. There's
an invitation here for you to do that discovery process.
But see, if you take what I'm saying, you reduce
it down to the pre rational, then you commit the
fallacy. And the rationalist likes to ignore and deny the
post rational stages. Notice that you don't just value rationality,
but that you actually cling to it. And the way
you can actually prove this to yourself, and you can
actually see this in debates between religious people, and atheist,
you can see that the religious people are dogmatic and
our claim to beliefs. But actually, what you also see
is that the atheist is doing the same thing. But
the atheist is lying to himself about the fact that
he's doing it. And in fact, what the atheist does,
he points the finger at the religious person says, Hey,
you're being dogmatic. How can you be so closed minded
and short sighted, but from the higher perspectives here from
yellow and beyond? When I look for example, at at
the atheist, I see him making the exact same mistake,
just the content Just different, different content. Same exact mistake.
So the similarity between the pre rational and the rational
is actually much closer than the post rational, and the
pre rational, very freaky. And you can notice this in
yourself. So for example, if you're having a debate, for
example, you're an atheist, or rational, scientific minded person, and
you're having a debate with a religious person. If you're
very careful, and you wash your ego, in that debate,
what you'll notice is that actually, what you're doing is
you are debating that person, which means that you're trying
to prevail, and spread your beliefs on to that person.
Because you actually believe that your beliefs and models of
reality was a map, you believe that the map is
real, you've confused the map for the territory. And now,
this is why you get excited you get passionate in
that moment. It's also why if that other person makes
a clever remark, or somehow makes a point that kind
of shakes your foundations a little bit, that you have
difficulty rebutting, you're going to actually feel tension and fear
in your body. Why is that? Because your self image
is getting eroded. When that happens, and you start to
sense that oh, shit. I'm being dogmatic, just like he
is. But let me quickly cover that up and ignore
it and get it out of my consciousness. And the
way that I do that is by projecting onto him
onto that other person onto religious person, all the problems
with religion. And so by doing that, it's a very
sneaky subterfuge, by which I deceive myself and keep myself
in the dark. And this is that contraction that you
feel when you're being dogmatic. And you know what I'm
talking about, you felt this before, if you've ever engaged
other people in, you know, intellectual conversations or arguments or
debates, you get that contraction, when you start to do
your lawyering. And you try to try to win arguments
through lawyering. Well, what you're really doing there is you're
trying to not convince the other person trying to convince
yourself and you're doing that because your ego is on
the line, not the truth. The truth is never on
the line, even though you tell yourself the truth is
online, no, your ego and your self image is on
the line. Why? Because it's bullshit. It's an illusion. So
fiction, truth can never be on the line, the only
thing that can be on the line is fiction, especially
fiction masquerading as truth. See, what we're doing here is
we're doing very careful observation of how our psyche is
working. Because if you want to advance the higher stages,
you have to really start to understand how the psyche
works. The mechanism by which you're exploring understanding reality, the
thing you call rationalism, the thing you take for granted?
Well, you can't take it for granted anymore. You have
to question every foundation of your rationalism, you have to
question every model and every belief that you hold. And
you have to start seeing that the world is A.
C, seeing from perspectives, always from perspectives. And that even
as I'm talking to you, right now, I'm talking from
a perspective, not from some absolute position, but from a
perspective. When you start to see that, you start getting
towards yellow, when you start tasting yellow, your attitude towards
the whole science versus religion debate changes very radically. Why?
Once you get to yellow, the yellow person sees what's
going on at each stage. He's been through all the
stages, he doesn't deny the stages, he's assimilated and fully
and now transcended them. So when the yellow person systemically
in person looks at this science, religion debate, he clearly
sees that both people are being dogmatic. And he understands
that he himself is dogmatic, and he sees that oh,
that's happening because of the way the psyche works. And
what this does, very practically is it creates tolerance. One
thing you notice about the higher stages is that as
you evolve up this ladder, you get more and more
tolerant, especially when you start getting past green and into
yellow and beyond. Why is that? Because all of a
sudden, you actually understand the conditions and you have sympathy
and understanding because you have conscious awareness of different stages,
which you didn't have before. And so you don't actually
get fired up because you don't have to clean into
anything anymore the way you did in the past. Right,
so whereas an atom an atheist who's very rational, stuck
in rational, irrational paradigm, he can get very fired up
and maybe even pissed off and angry, start yelling at
this religious person, the yellow person who's evolved beyond that,
he just sits there. And he just watched the whole
thing that he's had, I just, hey, that's cool. It's
normal. Color it because he understands what's going on at
a higher level. Be careful about interpreting what I'm telling
you here, as a descent into pre rationality, what I'm
encouraging you to do is to transcend your rationality. And
to transcend typical science, mainstream academic science is actually a
very narrow science. It needs to be broadened to also
include post rational truths. And also first person phenomenon which
has been reduced or denied or suppressed or just ignored
for a long, long time. Right? The post rational person
still uses science, and can think scientifically and logically. They
don't abandon that they transcend and include that. In fact,
science exists at the post rational levels. And you might
wonder, well, what's post rational? What does that actually mean?
Well, one thing that means is increased use of intuition.
Not just formal rationality, and logic and proofs, but intuitive
thinking. And if you're a student of scientific history, one
thing you realize is that some of the best scientists
that have ever lived, that have made the best breakthroughs,
they were actually very intuitive thinkers. And they didn't just
arrive there through pure rational thinking, you know, Einstein comes
to mind, Richard Fineman comes to mind. And many, many
others. So it's interesting how that works. They call it
vision logic. At the rational stage, you have logic. Next
comes vision logic, and there's stuff beyond stuff way beyond.
Be careful about holding on to your rationality, like a
child holds on to a baby blanket. You know, after
a while, you have to outgrow it. And be careful
also about overreacting against religion, and saying something like, Well,
you know, religion has been the cause of wars and
genocide and famine and problems for 1000s of years, so
we just want to abandon all of it, you're doing
yourself a disservice. Yes, we want to abandon that stuff.
But we do that by moving beyond even beyond rationalism.
See, the core problem here, especially with all the lower
stages, is that dogma runs rampant. Clinging to beliefs. This
is perhaps the biggest problem in the world, for individuals
and societies right now is how much people cling to
beliefs. Take a look at it. politically, religiously, scientifically. Doing
personal development. improving yourself you cling to beliefs. You cling
to beliefs within your business, how you think you should
run your business. You cling to every belief imaginable. Because
your self image is largely composed of beliefs. If we
remove all the beliefs, you unravel, literally, you unravel, not
metaphorically, not politically, but literally, you unravel. Because you are
a dogma you yourself, you think you're a human being,
you're not really a human being. What you are, is
you're a dogma, who believes it's a human being. The
problem here is that you refuse to investigate this matter
for yourself. Because it seems silly. But I assure you,
it's very real. If you want to go investigate. How
do you investigate? Well, I have a lot of videos
about spiritual alignment and go check those out. And other
videos tell you how to do some investigating. But basically,
you have to investigate first person phenomenon. You're not gonna
be doing scientific studies. And you're not going to be
reading textbooks. Because in the end, all that stuff is
just hearsay. Anyways, what you need to investigate is actually
what's really true, which is First Person phenomenon, the stuff
you actually know. colors, sounds, smells, tastes, thoughts and emotion.
Since in your own self image, who can investigate that
for you, nobody can only you can investigate it for
yourself. Right? So why are we talking about the mind
body problem? Well, if you don't actually admit first person
phenomenon that prevents you from doing the first investigation necessary
to arrive at some of these empirical understandings that are
much higher than just rational. And no one can investigate
your mental space for you what's going on in your
mind, you understand that everything you know, from the moment
you were born has been filtered through your psyche, you
understand how pap, how how significant that is? Everything, everything
you learn, every book, you read everything you believed me,
even the fact that you think that you're a human
being, which would be the most, you know, taken, taken
for granted assumption. Maybe second, only to the fact that
you think you exists in the first place. You know,
all these assumptions were just taken on by you not
really questioned in exactly the same way that religious people
take on their religious dogmas. No different, you're no different
than them. So you think it's silly that, and you
also think it's sad, right? Is it is sad that,
you know, a child could be raised, for example, somewhere,
you know, in the Middle East in a very fundamentalist
community, where he's just like, beaten with sticks and taught
the Koran. And then he grows up, really believing in
the Koran and then becomes like a suicide bomber. And
you think that that's sad? Like, how can he not
see what's going on, you are in exactly the same
situation. Exactly the same. Now what the Qur'an within our
society, really not much different than that kid, that's you.
And you have no idea what's going on, you're completely
blind to it. And you're so blind, that you refuse
to investigate this for yourself, in the same way that
the kid refuses to investigate other religions, other belief systems,
other schools of thought, science, etc, you know, you just
totally bought into it. You are to that that's the,
that's a that's a real shocking, that's a real shocker
of a truth right there, when you actually get a
taste of that. Man that really opens your eyes, really
opens your eyes. No longer can you have one of
these silly scientific, religious debates, like in this book here.
You can't have this after you've had one of those
insights, you know, your awareness is too wide open. too
wide open, because you see yourself as being dogmatic. And
the worst thing about is that, you know, you're dogmatic
and you are so weak and powerless to stop it.
It's like a tidal wave. It's like a tsunami hitting
you. You can't stop it. And you're, you're drowning in
it? How do you get yourself out? tough to do.
But it can't be done. requires an open mind, though,
requires that you start to accept some of the limitations
of rationalism and you start to open your mind to
the possibility that there could be something beyond it the
next stage that you might want to ascend to. But
will you very, very few people do. less than 1%
of people, even within Western countries are yellow, systemic thinkers.
Less than 1%. And that's just yellow, in yellow doesn't
get you into the truths of enlightenment, you have to
go beyond that several stages. Yellow just get you to
the point where you can actually see some of the
structures that I was describing here doesn't get you to
actual truth and understanding of enlightenment. That's, that's way over
your head right now. What's interesting is that there's a
shocking amount of agreement between post rational people who are
up here between what enlightenment actually is shocking agreement. There's
no fighting going on over there. Not really. If you
start to do all studying, sniffing around, dig into this
topic. You're gonna start see shocking similarities. And these similarities
and these, these understandings go back throughout literally 1000s of
years. 1000s of years, but see the dogmatic mind misconstrues
them so easily in the same way that the pre
rational mind misconstrues it, the rational mind misconstrues it because
the truths are just so beyond you. So beyond your
awareness, and your awareness is the bottleneck, the biggest bottleneck
in life is awareness. Because everything you call life has
to come through awareness. That is the ultimate bottleneck. So
if you don't understand what awareness is and how it
works, and you don't, then you've got a lot of
work to do. Here's a good analogy from Ken Wilber.
Imagine the plagorism theorem. Now, if we take the Pythagorean
Theorem, which basically states that if you have a right
angle triangle, that this side squared plus this side squared
will equal the diagonal squared. Pretty basic, algebraic or geometric
proof. But now, what if we take someone who doesn't
know algebra or arithmetic or geometry, and we try to
teach them the Pythagorean Theorem? What's going to happen? We
a problem. Because we can just tell him about the
theorem. And we can tell Hey, believe it. But that
doesn't quite sit, right. Because it's not like we're just
saying, hey, just believe it, because it's my opinion that
the Pythagorean theorem is this way. It's more than that.
What we want to convince them of is, hey, come
actually do the math here. Take a look at how
these things add up. You'll see the Pythagorean Theorem, you'll
have this insight which millions of other people have had
who have learned arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, and algebra. Come take
a look. But now what happens if that person says,
Well, you mean, you want me to spend 10 years
learning arithmetic, and then another five years learning algebra, and
another couple of years learning geometry, I had to spend
15 years sitting in a classroom reading books to understand
your stupid truth here. Fuck that. I don't believe you.
Chris prob. Now what you're doing right now as a
rationalist is you're doing exactly this thing with the higher
spiritual truth. Exact same thing. Because all the post rational
people have gone and have seen the birth algorithm theorem.
I mean, not all of them. But enough of them
have, that you can see the consensus is there, it's
obvious that they see it once they get there. The
problem, though, is is that you have to go and
get there. You can't just understand it from where you're
at. You have to evolve yourself there. But you can't
evolve yourself there if your mind is so closed, and
you're so dogmatic about staying where you are, just like
this guy here with not wanting to learn arithmetic. So
that's on you, that burden of proof is on you.
Because there's a lot of consensus about what you'll see
up there, and you will see it if you want
to. Will you be open minded enough? Can you see
that you need to grow yourself? Can you acknowledge yourself
that there is stuff beyond where you're currently at that
you can grow to? Do you have the courage to
admit that you were wrong in the past, and that
you may be wrong right now about a great many
things, you're going to have to relinquish many beliefs and
models that you're going to have to release your hold
over. Let go of that baby blanket. Hmm. Remains to
be seen if you'll actually do that, you know, because
if you want to evolve yourself to the point that
I'm talking about to the very highest stages, we actually
see what enlightenment is where you can remove this distinction
between you and reality itself. That might require five or
10 years of real serious work, serious introspection, contemplation, meditation,
really looking inward, dissecting all of your beliefs in a
way that you've never done before your entire life. And
if you think you know, you're a scientist, and you've
done this kind of work, no, you haven't done this
kind of work. This is work that almost no one
on earth has done. Because it's the scariest work that
you can do. In fact, your entire life is designed
to prevent you from doing this work. Because yourself in
your life as you know it is a lie. You
understand this? And this lie needs to be protected. Why
be because you will unravel in doing this work, you
will, you will unravel yourself completely. That's a very scary
notion. And also, the forces allied against you in doing
that are overwhelming. Overwhelming, it is like a tsunami heading
right towards you. And you need to swim right through
it to the other side. And that's not easy to
do. And that's why so few people have ever gone
up here. Takes a lot of balls to get there.
Tough, right? But you're well on your way with this
information. So I'm going to wrap it up here, a
lot of information here, a lot of stuff to digest.
And there's so much more I could still say, but
I'll pause it here. So this gives you some perspective
on the science, religion debate, I hope, I hope that
from now on, you're gonna see it from my clo
level systemic thinking perspective. And you're not gonna get caught
into the petty stages below that are bickering and arguing
with each other. If you really want to understand the
science, religion debate, stop debating and go develop yourself in
consciousness to the highest stages, where you will actually become
it. You won't even know it, you will become it.
Which is fucking cool. Alright, this is Leo, I'm signing
off. Go ahead, post me your comments down below, click
the like button, please share this video with a friend,
a very, very open minded friend. And lastly, come sign
up to my newsletter right here, actualize that org. It's
a free newsletter, I release new videos, every single week
on self actualization. I want to help you to develop
your understanding of life and your awareness to the highest
levels possible. And that's not just book smarts. I'm not
really interested in coming up here and giving you theories
and beliefs and stuff. What I'm interested in doing is
actually giving you very stripped down versions of the stuff
you need to start doing in your life and also
some motivation to get you to do it. But basically,
I want to motivate you and give you the techniques
you need to go out and do it and see
it for yourself, achieve it for yourself. I mean, if
you want the spiritual stuff, that's real powerful. But if
you want some smaller, more practical stuff, like better business,
better relationships, better psychology. Maybe we start there and I
have a lot of videos that I'll still keep releasing
on those topics. So check it out, and I'll see
you soon
