Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video,
I'm going to show you how to study extremely effectively
I want to turn you into a studying machine, I
want to make you such an effective study or that
studying is going to be a skill that you have
you possess, it's going to be a strength of yours
that you're gonna feel proud of. And that's going to
carry you through your entire life, not just your schooling
days and your college days. Studying is very near and
dear to my heart. Because this is a skill that's
actually developed and acquired. And I didn't always have this
skill, I wasn't always an effective study, or I struggled
through much of elementary school and middle school, I was
a pretty below average. And even after I started below
average of study, or then I improved, I became kind
of average. And then what happened is that when I
got into the first year and a half of high
school, something clicked in me, which made me take studying
very seriously. And then the last three years of high
school, I became just like an ACE study, or just
amazing one of the top in the school. And then
also, when I went to college, because I was such
a good study in high school, that translated into making
college really easy for me, and I was also one
of the top students in college. So I want to
tell you a little bit about this, because I feel
like this is one of my top strengths that I
developed. And I know how it can be developed. So
it's not just something that comes naturally to you. So
let me show you how to develop amazing study skills.
And it's not just going to be about technique, but
also about some very important mindsets, you're going to want
to know. So the first thing you got to really
understand about studying is that studying is a skill. And
it's something that's acquired and developed through practice. It's not
something you're born with, this is the worst mindset you
could have is to believe that, oh, well, you know,
I'm just not as smart as all the other kids,
I don't get it as fast as them. I'm not
as good of a study or I'm not as quick
as a reader. I'm not really good at math, I'm
not good at science. This is all complete horseshit. Alright,
complete, utter nonsense. This is not the kind of mindset
that you want when you're approaching studying. Instead, what I
want you to approach starting with is a growth mindset.
That was a fixed mindset. Here's what the growth mindset
is the growth mindset, it says that, basically, you're just
as good as anybody else, inherently. And what it all
boils down to is just practice, practice, practice, repetition, repetition,
repetition, lots of hard work, lots of hard work. And
eventually you get those amazing studying skills, and you become
the best in the class, or you really understand a
topic so deeply, just from that one mindset, just apply
it over and over and over again. So it's really
important not to limit yourself into this fixed mindset, thinking
that somehow you're learning disabled, you got something wrong with
you. There may be learning disabled people that are very,
that's a very small percentage, don't assume that you are
that even if you've been told that you're learning disabled,
that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Because usually what they do
is they try to find that stuff out through tests.
And when I was actually in ninth grade, when I
entered the ninth grade, because I didn't do too well
on my reading test. In my eighth grade, when they
put me in high school in ninth grade, they put
me into a remedial reading class. So I was sitting
with all the dumb kids in class reading books, and
I felt like I was a dumb kid too, because
they put me in that class. So don't let that
let that kind of stuff limit you. Schools are notoriously
like stupid and bureaucratic, filled with red tape. So just
because someone puts you in some position, or in some
class, or gives you some label doesn't mean anything about
your learning abilities, you can learn. And we're going to,
we're going to show you how to do that right
here. So the first thing you got to realize is
that it's not about the grades, you got to stop
focusing on the grades, the grades are not important. And
in fact, this opens up the larger topic of intrinsic
versus extrinsic motivation. A lot of kids, a lot of
young people, young adults in college or whatever, basically through
that phase from high school, and college between those two,
between those two stages of your life. A lot of
times you get hooked on this kind of need to
impress others with your grades, or to do well because
your parents want you to do well. Or to do
well because you're competing against other kids in your class,
or because there's a certain trophy that you want, or
because you want to go to some amazing Ivy League
school. And so there's this real damaging social conditioning going
on, which is pressuring you to follow and get amazing
grades, and to play that whole rat race. And look,
I was in that rat race. I was really motivated
by competing with others and getting really good grades and
I was always inspired had to see that list of
all the top students in the school or in the
class and see that I was in the top that
always inspired me. But that's not ultimately what fueled me
as a student. What fueled me as a student is
an intrinsic drive. Intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic means that it's coming
from inside you, you naturally authentically want it. Rather than
chasing after some sort of approval or validation from your
principal, from your professor or from your parents. That is
total nonsense, you cannot be effective students, if you are
going off with extrinsic motivation. So the solution here is
that any extrinsic motivations you have, what you got to
do is you got to literally just put them off
to the side and your brain off to the side,
stop thinking about them, stop caring about them, stop putting
any value into that kind of stuff, you don't need
it, it doesn't matter what your grades are. What's important
is, why are you trying to become a great student,
you want to become a great student, you want to
learn how to study, because this is a critical life
skill. This is something that literally is going to set
up your entire life. And this will mean the difference
between being happy and being miserable. This will mean the
difference between being rich and being poor. This will be
the difference between being neurotic and being calm, and even
keeled in your life. This will be the difference between
having an amazing marriage and amazing relationship and horrible marriage
and horrible relationship. This will be the difference between having
an amazing successful business and a disastrous business that goes
into bankruptcy. So literally every area of your life that
you want to have success in or you want to
be happy in will require study, it will require it.
Personal Development is all about studying how you work how
your psychology works. This is not something that you just
get spontaneously through osmosis, this is something that has to
be you have to sit down, open lots of books,
study lots of stuff, take lots of notes. So this
is proper studying. To me, what's exciting about studying is
not that I'm gonna get some grades, or I'm gonna
say that, Oh, I know, some trivial facts, like I
know, when the war of 1812 started and why it
started. And I know all the causes of this, and
I know how the physics of that works. That's not
important at all. To me, it's all about understanding life.
Life is so fascinating, I want to understand it. To
me, this is one of the most important missions that
I have as a human being living here. Like as
a life form. This goes really deep for me as
a life form. This is the most important thing that
I'm doing, through my short time on this earth in
this universe is that I'm learning how the universe works.
I'm observing it with my senses, and then I'm dissecting
it and analyzing with my mind, that's basically the foundation
of all study. This is how every effective study or
every effective scientist mathematician approaches this problem, right? They don't
just sit down to study stuff. They're genuinely curious and
interested and fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, because
this is a mysterious and amazing thing. And this brings
us to the key mindset number one, that you really
need to become an effective student, which is to get
in touch with the fact that life is deeply fascinating.
I don't care what you're studying, you could be studying
how to cook, you could be studying physics, or math,
or history, or psychology or personal development, or how to
go skydiving, or how to do an underwater dive, or
how to make a dress, how to do makeup, whatever
your area of interest in, that's cool. It doesn't matter.
There's no judgement here. All of this is just life.
This is the universe and you're learning how this stuff
works. And there's a lot to be learned about every
single one of these topics. And don't think that you're
somehow above learning about these things. You're not at all,
every one of these things deserves lots of study. And
what you'll find the more you learn, and you look
into each one of these topics, you'll discover that there's
Wow, there's so much amazing stuff. There's so much depth
in every little nook and cranny of life. There's so
much depth, you can literally spend a lifetime at this
point, studying the most minut the most esoteric, the most
technical things, if you want. You can also spend an
entire lifetime piecing everything together. If you want to go
broader sort of deep, you can spend whole lifetime piecing
all the all the little pieces together, which is personally
one of my fascinations and missions in life is to
piece together the big picture. So that's what really fuels
me. I'm not so much about the trivia the technicalities
of life. But you know, some people do like the
technicalities, so you got to decide which one of those
people you are. You got to get really in touch
with what you find deeply fascinating about life. It's not
about cracking open a book and acing a test. This
is such a human, like social construct is so stupid,
this whole idea of test taking and stuff and I
mean it has value. But it's so limited. You can't
be fueled by that. You got to like put all
that aside. That's the bullshit of studying that's like the
politics of study. The politics are nonsense. What you got
to look at is you got to look at like,
what's the Thought Foundation, like the fundamental core of it.
And that is like, wow, I want to really understand
life. I want understand this thing here. It's so fascinating.
Or this thing, the way it works is so cool.
Like, how can it work this way? How does technology
work? How does science work? how humans behave in all
these irrational and weird ways? How can we have geniuses?
And we also have disastrous people through history? How does
history work? How to wars? What kind of politics work
has? How do economies work? How does money work? There's
so much to study, I want you to really get
in touch with first of all the fact that you
are interested in all of it. And that you could
be interested in any one of these topics, genuinely. But
this is something you have to kind of like pause
and admit to yourself, you have to say to yourself,
Okay, wait a minute. What's really going on here? Sure,
maybe there's a subject that I do like a little
bit more than another subject, like maybe math, I don't
really like math, but like, let's say history, I really,
I'm really fascinated by people in history. That's cool. You
can have those preferences, but also don't be so closed
minded to say, well, you know what, I'm just bad
at math, I just hate math. If you say that,
what I want you to do is actually I want
you to ask yourself, pause and ask yourself, Wait a
minute, why do I hate this thing called math isn't
a part of reality? Isn't it fascinating that, that we
can use mental concepts and numbers and these numbers seem
to have certain patterns to them, they work in certain
very logical and interesting ways. And we can use this
math, to do science, we can use this map to
do advanced technology, isn't that fascinating to you, it shouldn't
be fascinates you, no matter who you are. And even
if it's not your like, forte, and your most passionate
thing, this is important, because in school, you're gonna have
a diversity of subjects, some of these subjects will be
mandatory, you're not always gonna be able to pick. But
also, as you advance through school, you're gonna get more
options to pick. So one of the secrets to school
is, of course, try to pick the stuff that you
are really fascinated about. So as much control as you
do have tried to exercise that and pointed in a
direction to stuff that really fascinates you and lights you
up. And if there's stuff that you're not fascinated about,
what you have to do, is you have to just
kind of trick yourself in your brain and say, Oh,
well, what could I find fascinating about this? What could
be interesting about this? Why is this important? Maybe I
haven't opened my mind to the subject yet. If you
do that, you'll find that actually, your mind can open
up and you can find satisfaction in learning almost about
anything. It's kind of cool. What I want you to
do right now is I want you to pause this
video. And I want you to write down a list
of 20 areas of life that you're deeply fascinated by
and that you want to research and you want to
learn more about. You're fascinated about how it works. You're
fascinated about the questions that might be coming up in
that field of study. So what is that for you?
And it can literally be anything. So right now pause
the video and come up with those. It could be
math, science history, or if you prefer, it could be
stuff like, well, you know, I'm really passionate about surfing,
I want to learn how surfing works, or I'm really
fast and about tennis, let me learn about how tennis
works. Or I'm really fascinated about how technology works. Maybe
I want to learn about how they programmed computers, or
how they make websites, or how they construct factories, or
how they make cell phones. There's literally so much stuff.
So pause right now and come up with a list.
Okay, you've done that. I hope you did. So that's
gonna be a good starter for you. That right there
is all the stuff that you really want to be
focusing your attention on. And I will focus a lot
of my discretionary time I'm actually studying the stuff that
I find fascinating, outside of the stuff that I just
find fascinating for school. So that's going to serve you
well. The next key mindset that I want to share
with you is really the secret to all learning and
the secret to all study. It's so, so simple. You
want to know the secret. It's really this learning equals
repetition. It's just repetition. That's all learning is. People think
that well, oh, I'm not as smart as this guy.
I'm not as smart as that guy. There's little smarts
that are actually required for learning. Learning is really dumb.
Learning is just repetition. Brute force repetition. Again, and again
and again and again. And again. If you repeat something
enough times, your brain is gonna learn it no matter
what even if you're the worst student. This was the
key thing that I discovered. Early in 10th grade, I
discovered this right when my results just totally skyrocketed with
my grades and my studying habits and everything. Because I
discovered really this one secret to all of learning. It's
just repetition. I literally discovered that my brain can learn
anything. I can memorize anything, any quantity of things, any
complexity of things I could memorize just through study. And
now, study is not something that you just do. Who
to memorize stuff. So it's not about memorization. To me,
I don't really care about memorizing things, that's not important.
But what is important is, first of all, you are
testing a lot of memorization skills in school. So that's
just part of the school system, as imperfect as it
is. So that will help you with getting amazing grades.
But also, when you do repeat stuff over and over
and over again, what happens is that yes, you memorize
stuff. But also you get these deeper interconnections, your mind
starts connecting the dots, and it does all this stuff,
mostly unconsciously, you're not consciously sitting down coming up with
really, like crafty clever techniques and ideas, what's happening is
that you're just immersing yourself in the field of study,
and you're repeating things again, and again, and again, and
again and again. And your mind just can't help making
those interconnections for you. And that process is actually really
enjoyable. So this video, it's about making you a powerful
student, but it's also about making you enjoy the activity
of study, you have to enjoy it, if you don't
enjoy it, you're not going to be a good student.
And that's the most important thing that I did in
my own, in my own education is that I really
convinced myself to enjoy a lot of the studying that
I did, I was very intrinsically motivated. And so that
just worked out really well for me. And then I
took this principle of repetition. And when I saw that,
oh, man, I can literally program anything, I want it
to my mind. It's just so dumb. It's so simple,
the way that it works, there's nothing fancy behind it,
there's no magic behind it, then I'm like, Oh, damn,
I have the tool, I have all the tools, I
need to learn whatever I want. And at that point,
it just becomes a matter of discipline and practice, discipline
and practice, discipline and practice. So at this point, what
I want to do is I want to give you
the actual study procedure that I used through most of
high school and most of college to achieve some amazing
results, it's really quite simple. But I want to give
you all the steps that I went through. So these
are like the tips of my studying procedure. So number
one is that you want to create a quiet place
free of distractions where you can study effectively. For me,
this was my bedroom, my bedroom had a lock on
it, I could close it, I could lock everyone out,
I could stare for hours and just study you need
a study room. Try to make like literally a little
enclosure somewhere where you can go off hibernate and study
so that nobody is bothering you. And if you want,
you can close the door, shut the windows, turn off
the TV, no distractions, total silence, you want to have
as much control over that space as possible, and you
want to organize it well. So that's the first thing.
The second thing is you have to schedule your time.
Don't just stuff studying in two cracks in your schedule,
your schedule should be built around studying. If you're in
high school, and you're in college, think about it this
way. You're not working. Maybe some of you're working. But
I'm assuming that for the average student who's got a
pretty decent family, then he's not working or she's not
working during this time. So in this case, you really
have a cool thing happening. Basically, your full time job
in life right now, from high school to college is
to just study and absorb and learn as much about
life as you can, there's actually a really cool phase
in your life. Don't dread this phase, it's actually the
coolest phase. Because most of your life is going to
be spent working, you're going to be working for 30
To 40 to 50 years of your life, you only
get 15 or 20 years of study. So use that
right now. And high school and college. That's four and
four years. So that's only eight years right there. That's
not a lot it pass passes really fast. And actually,
when you get out of college, if you're an effective
student and you love learning, you're going to miss it,
which is what happened to me. So anyways, the idea
here is to schedule your time. What does this mean?
This means have an exact set time during the day
when you start to study for me, I remember it
was about 6pm I would always say to myself, Okay,
6pm I get back from school, I rest a little
bit and then at 6pm That's my study time it
starts, how long does it go? Well, that depends on
how much assignment and homework I have. But it would
go for at least an hour or two. And sometimes
we'd go for four or five or six hours. And
it was started six, and you'd usually end like around
nine or 10 or or after that. And it would
vary. But I think what's really important is to have
that starting time six, no matter what, six, sit down
and study, open the books, sit down study. It doesn't
have to be six for you just come up with
your own time. And you're doing this every single day.
And then I will take one day off for the
weekend. So the way it would work is Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, I would study actually Friday, I wouldn't study
Friday would be cut Friday night would be my kind
of night off. And then Saturday I wouldn't study either.
So that's actually two days and then Sunday I would
because Sunday usually you have homework for the for the
upcoming Monday. So that was my schedule. What's important about
this is that it leads us to the next point,
which is you have to get comfortable and you have
to slow yourself down out in order to study effectively,
you can't rush the studying process. And one of the
secrets that I use is simply brute force, right? A
lot of the issues as a student that I dealt
with the things that I couldn't understand, I just brute
force them through repetition. And this repetition can take time.
Also, you know, you have to be patient with yourself,
sometimes you're not gonna understand the problem right off the
bat. So you just kind of repeat it, repeat it,
mull it over, mull it over. And that means sometimes
it takes you longer. So instead of finishing a quick
little math assignment in an hour, it might take you
three hours. But that's worth it. If you calm yourself
down, get comfortable, slow yourself down, kind of open yourself
to absorbing this information. Right. This is where the love
that comes in, if you don't love it, and what
you're doing is you're just kind of rushed studying through
stuff just to learn it, like cramming for an exam.
That's just horrible. That's horrible. Because all you're trying to
do is you're jumping, you're like a dog jumping through
hoops. That's basically what you are when you're doing that.
Because you're saying yourself, well, I got to pass this
exam in order to get into college to get good
grades. So my parents like me, that's just hoops like
a dog you're jumping through. Don't do that. Instead, what
you think about is like this. This subject matter is
really fascinating. Let me study more. Let me learn more.
I want to know how math interconnects with with history.
And I want to know how to history and connects
with science. And I want to know how this In
this connection, and I want to know more depth about
this thing here. That's how you got to think. So
that's the getting curious. Part Two, you got to get
really curious when you actually sit down at 6pm to
study and you open that book up. Instead of thinking,
Okay, how do I get this done faster, so that
I can go watch some TV or play some video
games? No, you sit down and you say, Oh, this
is a fascinating thing here that I'm studying about life.
This is so much more rewarding, and has so much
more value than watching TV or playing a video game.
Look, I watched a lot of TV during my school
years, and I want to play a lot of video
games during my school years. So I know how that
goes. I mean, those things can be exciting in the
short term. But there's so much value and richness in
the studying. You got to connect yourself to that, right?
It's not like adults are just telling you to study
for study sake, that's a stupid reason. I can connect
inside to your own original motivations. As you read this
book, or however you're studying, you have to read for
understanding an excellence, rather than trivial memorization of facts. The
key is understanding. So when you're doing a math problem,
for example, you have to actually get insights into how
the math works. Which is a very different thing than
just turning out answers. It's very easy in your mind
just to become a calculating machine and just calculate stuff,
calculate, Calculate, calculate. Or if you're learning history, all you're
doing is you're memorizing dates and numbers and names. Or
if you're learning science, or physics or something, you're just
memorizing formulas, and you're understanding how the formulas work, where
they came from, why it is that they are the
way they are. It's a really huge thing. This is
where a lot of people become really good at actually
passing exams, but then they don't understand anything about the
subject matter, which is just a disgusting way. And a
travesty of study. Studying is about understanding stuff, right? You
have to really know how this stuff works, rather than
just memorizing or knowing some little trick technique or some
little shortcut to get the right answer. So don't fall
into that trap. I know I fell into that trap
a lot, especially with mathematics, that was my weakest subject.
And that's because I didn't take this understanding approach to
it, that I needed to, you need to also like
value excellence in the way that you study. Right? You
should have this standard that you set for yourself that,
for me, it's important to actually accurately understand how reality
works. I'm not happy with a half assed understanding of
mathematics. And I'm not happy with a half assed understanding
of history or science. Like I want to have deep
probing insights into these topics. Because that's interesting to me.
And also accuracy is important to me. I don't want
to be a person who half understands reality, or understands
it in all these misconceived ways. I want to really
understand reality, I want to know the truth of things.
This is a really important tenants and principle of, of
study. Taking notes, taking notes is very important. So if
you're in class, become a great note taker. If you're
reading stuff, learn to take notes, develop a habit of
taking notes, start to enjoy taking notes, and also keep
a repository of all your notes. So when I was
in school, it was all manual and paper, there was
no electronic note taking at that time. I don't know
how it is nowadays, probably a lot more iPads and
stuff. But I would literally have buckets like huge buckets
and plastic file cabinets full of files full of paper
all marked up. So this was really important to me
actually took a little pride in that having that because
that stack just grew bigger and bigger and bigger, like
these huge heavy boxes, of all the stuff that I
would learn every single year and I would cumulated you
don't need to be a packrat about it. But I
think that it's important that you value the process of
recording your insights, recording your understandings, not just for the
sake of school officials or grades, but just actually for
yourself, that's really important. That's going to the core, again,
really understanding the stuff you're studying. The other really important
technique that I discovered is this idea of self testing.
This is really important if you want to ace tests.
What this really is, is going back to that idea
of repetition, repetition, repetition. So if you're reading a chapter,
let's say, I can remember pretty vividly myself sitting down
and reading some chapter about molecular biology in my big
biology book. Well, if I read that whole chapter, usually,
at the end of the chapter, they'll have questions, still
have little tests that the book gives you. Or maybe
there's a test that your teacher gave you, like as
a homework homework assignment. So you've got questions there? Well,
what you got to do is you got to like,
go through the material you've studied, and then just test
yourself. And as you're testing yourself, the key is that
you have to check if your answer is correct. So
if your answer is not correct, you have to go
back and find the right answer. Now, this is a
process that takes time and it slows you down. This
is why I feel most people don't do this. Most
students, they want to get done with the assignment so
quickly, that they don't actually go and bother to look
up the right answer. And then after you come up
with the right answer, what you got to do is
you got to drill into your mind, but ask yourself
the question again, and then allow your mind to do
a recall. So this is really critical for memory. And
all learning happens when what you do is you do
a successful recall, this is very important. This idea right
here will literally make or break your whole studying career
and all your tests. Recall. Right? What do I mean
by recall, you have to understand how this actually works
in your mind. So if you're sitting there, and you're
just reading stuff, or somebody tells you some facts, that's
good. But don't assume that, that means you've memorized it,
for you to actually commit it to memory, you have
to recall it successfully. So if someone tells you a
fact about, let's say, when some war started 500 years
ago, and they tell you the exact date, you hear
it, but you don't recall it, usually, what you have
to do is you have to force the recall in
your own mind. So when did such a warm start?
It started in 1555, or something like that, you recall
it? And if you can't recall it, if you're struggling,
and you're like, Well, I just don't remember what you
gotta do. You gotta go back and look up that
number. When you look up the number you see Oh,
5055. Okay, cool. That's still not good enough. Now you
have to recall it again. So what you got to
do is you got to ask yourself that same question
again. And then try to recall it and see, are
you able to, if you're not able to you go
back and look at that number again. And then you
ask the question again, and you see if you can
recall it again. And only when you are successfully able
to recall it have you actually learned it. And what
I usually do is I will loop through a couple
of times like that, until I'm able to recall successfully.
And then even after I recall, successfully, usually the first
or two recalls are a bit of a struggle. They're
not like quick and smooth and silky. So what I
do is I'll ask myself the question again a couple
of times, and then by like the fifth or 10th
time. By that point, I'm able to recall it like
really, really fast, because I've trained my brain literally through
the recalls. So your brain gets built and trained through
this recalling process. That's very important, if what you're trying
to do is memorize stuff. And memorization is, is going
to be just a fact of life for you as
a student. So remember that one. The other thing you
got to understand about studying is that if you're not
a good student, now, you're not just going to go
and become a great student tomorrow by watching this video,
it's gonna take time for you to build momentum, building
momentum, you have to do it over the course of
the day as you're studying. But then also over the
course of weeks and months really, it took me about,
I would say six months to really build up a
lot of momentum when I was transitioning from ninth grade
to 10th grade, to become a really much more powerful
student. And then even after that it took a year
or two more, and I really hit my stride in
school when I was in 12th grade. By the time
I got to 12th grade, I had built up like
two and a half years of momentum. From the other
grades. I was really studying very hard. And I developed
a lot of good habits. And at this point I
integrated all the stuff we talked about into my mind.
So it became so easy that it was just like
coasting through coasting through really easy to study at that
point. Because I built up that momentum. I built up
these positive habits, this process of building up the habits.
It's not an easy process. It's going to be a
little bit painful. It's going to require some discipline from
you. Right? But this is going to be an important
skill that you're learning because you're gonna be able to
apply this discipline, and these habits that you learn now,
in high school and in college, you're gonna apply that
to the rest of your life. To me, the whole
point of high school and college studying, is just to
set the foundation. And then to carry that, that studying
through into the rest of your life. And remember why
you're doing all this. So as you're sitting down, and
you know, you're in your comfortable place, you're comfortable, you're
slowing yourself down, you're open, you're curious, you're studying something,
you've got something open, you're really fascinated by it. So
that's the basic process, right? Pricing procedure. And now remember
why you're doing this in the long run. In the
long run, you're doing this because you really care about
understanding reality. Also, because of all the cool things that
this will do for you, this will allow you to
have an amazing business and amazing relationship, allow you have
an amazing career. This will allow you to basically design
the kind of life that you want, any kind of
life that you want. And it's also going to fascinate
you, as a human being, because one of the things
you're going to learn as you grow up is that
wow, learning about how life works, compared to just grinding
it out at a nine to five job, or compared
to, to partying or compared to watching movies or the
planet compared to playing video games. Like learning how reality
works. That's one of the higher consciousness values of life.
It's one of the greatest fulfillment and joys that you
can find in life. It's certainly nothing as exciting as
playing a video game. Like playing a video game is
very exciting in the moment. But studying it's kind of
this like longer term, more kind of like smooth and
mellow sort of excitement. It's a really cool thing. And
I want you to develop a love for that, as
you're going through your school and college days. So remember
that this is something that you're building is something that
you're cultivating, you don't have a vision for why you're
studying so hard. Because you're going to be working really
hard when you study. Some nights, you're gonna be working
really hard getting really exhausted, you have to keep the
ultimate vision in mind of why you're doing all this
stuff. Never lose sight of that that's really important. So
that's my basic procedure. I think I've covered a lot
of stuff already here. I'm just going to cover a
couple of last remaining points. So one point that needs
to be covered is that if you're studying really hard,
you have to rest properly, you have to sleep properly.
Throughout high school and college, I never once pulled an
all nighter, this all nighter thing. This is ridiculous to
me. You don't need any all nighters, just schedule your
time properly. And you don't need any all nighters. Sleep,
well rest well, when you're learning stuff, and your brain
is churning all the time, you're gonna literally be feeling
like your brain rewiring itself, neurons are going to be
growing in your brain, you're gonna feel this is a
really cool, exciting feeling. But it also is exhausting to
you. And so what that means is you need to
be able to take naps, you need to be able
to get your full eight or 10 hours of sleep.
I remember on weekends, I would sleep for like 12
hours. Because I was so exhausted from this week of
studying on the weekend, I really give myself time to
sleep well. So that was important. And then during the
during the weekdays, I was still take naps, I would
take one or two hour naps almost every single day
because I was studying so much it would exhaust my
whole brain. So make sure that you account for that.
No cramming, don't do this cramming thing, just cramming is
just ridiculous and stupid. Cramming is all about jumping through
hoops for somebody else. Remember that it's not about you.
When you're cramming for something, I want you to pause,
ask yourself, Wait a minute, what the hell is going
on here? Why am I doing this, I'm like a
slave jumping through hoops. I'm like a dog, I don't
want to be that. And then read ground yourself, bring
yourself back to the core principle of why you want
to be studying. When you're actually enjoying studying, and you
like it and you're fascinated by by topics that we've
been talking about, then you know what cramming because cramming
is painful, it's stressful, you're not calm, you're not relaxed,
not comfortable. Instead, what you want to do is you
want to actually give yourself more time to study, you
want to slow the whole process down, draw it all
out, extend it out, so that you're enjoying it right
physically, you have to enjoy it in your body if
enjoyed in your brain, cramming isn't enjoyable. And finally, if
you are struggling with just buckling down and putting these
positive habits into place, getting really disciplined about your study,
then I really want you to take a look at
the fact the pain of avoiding study is much worse
than the study itself. There's nothing really painful about studying,
studying is enjoyable, picking up a book sitting on a
couch and reading it or snuggling in your bed like
when you're studying. What's cool is that you can set
up the environment however you want. So you can literally
be sitting there you can have a nice coffee or
a drink or a soda next to you. You can
have some nice food you can have some nice music
playing. Like you can really set up a really comfortable
learning environment. And then they're sitting reading a book or
jotting some notes or listen watching a video that you've
been told to watch or do some some math problems.
If you slow yourself down, you just get conscious about
the fact that oh, this is actually a, like a
cool, comfortable environment scenario that I'm sitting in, it's actually
quite enjoyable. My brain is learning new stuff that's pretty
enjoyable. Don't fall into this trap of just resisting studying,
just because people are telling you to study. This is
one problem is that because everyone's telling you to study
all the time, your parents, your teachers, grades, and everything's
so important that you're getting stressed out about it, when
in fact, it's a very relaxing activity. This is why
it's very important to transition away from extrinsic motivation, and
get connected to why you want to study so much.
All right, those are my tips for how to be
a really effective study, er, this stuff served me really
well. Throughout my days, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA
in high school, and then college, it was like 3.9,
or something around that. So it's pretty damn high. Anyways,
if you adopt all these principles, all these mindsets and
some of these techniques, you're going to be able to
get a 4.0 GPA, and maybe even beyond. And the
most important thing is that you'll be able to translate
all this amazing wisdom that you learned in school, into
your adult life, which is where actualized org comes in.
