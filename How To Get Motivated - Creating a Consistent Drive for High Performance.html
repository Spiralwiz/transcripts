hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment we're going to talk about how to
get motivated alright motivation this is a favorite favorite topic
of mine so we're going to cover as much as
we can about 15 minutes I'm going to give you
the gist of what motivation is and how to get
yourself back in that kind of motivated energetic state that
I'm sure you found yourself at one point in your
life because if you're like me you found that there
are moments in your life where you feel very engaged
very motivated taking action is very easy you don't procrastinate
you don't have a lot of resistance and you feel
awesome you feel excited and energetic and you're getting a
lot done you're so productive and effective and then you've
got those other times in your life where you don't
feel like doing stuff you know you got to do
stuff but you don't really want to do it you
don't you're not engaged with it you don't have any
energy you feel sleepy you feel lethargic you feel tired
you just want to crash you want to lay it
and on a couch and be comfortable you don't really
know why you started the thing in the first place
and you're just kind of like meh right that's what
it feels like to not have motivation so of course
we all want to be here we all want to
be motivated and nobody really wants to be here which
is just lazy and comfortable and slacking so what is
the difference and how do we how do we get
more of the good nice strong motivation that we've had
in different times in our lives well first of all
it's important recognize that you're always going to tend to
have more of this than you are of this right
staying motivated and engaged really takes work it's not something
that just happens naturally to most people most people are
lazy most people don't really have a lot of Drive
in their life and they never figure out how to
develop that drive when I really got into into coaching
and I got into personal development five years ago I
was really interested in this idea of motivation how do
I motivate myself because at that time I just started
my own business it was the first time I started
a business and I was concerned because there was nobody
to motivate me but myself being a self-employed is challenging
in that respect because you have to be a real
go-getter you have to be ambitious you have to be
driven from the inside because nobody is going to be
kicking you in the ass nobody's going to be telling
you what to do and it's very easy to to
slack off and go watch the TV we'll play some
World of Warcraft or go pig out or do whatever
is your favorite way of distracting yourself from the work
that you got to do and then you see yourself
becoming lazy unproductive problems start to happen in your life
right so how do we avoid this how do we
get ourselves more engaged and how do we get ourselves
those moments in the past where what you felt really
connected so here's the scoop on this and I've studied
this a lot because this is such a fascinating topic
for me motivation basically boils down to vision vision creates
motivation there's really two types of motivation first there is
extrinsic motivation which is motivation from external incentives and then
there's intrinsic motivation which is motivation from within yourself it
should be pretty obvious which one of those you want
to have you don't want to rely too much on
external motivation and that means for example the financial rewards
that you get from your job or from your business
or the the rewards you get from your relationship the
external rewards you get from your relationship or anything basically
that is a carrot or even a stick that's causing
you to to do something right and this is typically
what happens in in school and in college and as
we're kids and we're growing up and in business is
that we're always incentivized externally so much by carrots and
sticks if you don't do this then you'll get punished
if you do do it you'll get an incentive that's
a very shallow form of motivation what you want is
you want intrinsic motivation that's motivation that comes from within
you it's like having a fire burning in your heart
and then that fire fuels you rather than being being
fueled by some fire that's out there because what's out
there is inconsistent what's in here can fuel you for
life and it can get you that consistency that you
don't get if you are coming from this place where
you have a lot of moments where you're not motivated
maybe once in a while you are motivated then you're
not again that's probably because you're relying on external motivation
rather than internal motivation so first of all recognize this
distinction and start to make a shift get yourself unhooked
from external sources of stimulation stop chasing after them stop
thirsting after them so much and stop being so concerned
that someone's going to punish you for doing something instead
reground it in yourself the way to do that practically
is to have something in your life that you're fighting
for do you see yourself as fighting for something I
do I see myself as a hero on a hero's
journey I have a mission to accomplish in my life
I have a purpose I have a calling and my
calling is important it's significant it's not significant in any
objective sense but it's significant in my mind and that's
all that matters because it's internal the motivation is internal
as long as I believe it it's good enough it's
good enough to get me up in the morning it's
good enough to get me excited in fact not only
is it good enough to do that but my motivation
is so strong that it's good enough to bust through
walls it's good enough to fight the hardest challenges to
overcome the most depressive episodes in my life my motivation
is so strong that it rubs off on other people
when that fire inside you burns so hot that other
people just by looking at you by hearing you get
a little bit of that fire kindled within them for
me that is my motivation I have a purpose in
my life I have a calling and most people I
see out there do not have it and therefore they
really are not motivated how can you be motivated you
can't you have nothing that you're fighting for you have
nothing that's meaningful to you in your life your life
basically has no meaning all that you're doing is you're
just floating floating along on the river of life and
you're taking it wherever it's going to take you and
you have no direction you have no sense of what
you want to create in your life you have no
sense of what's important to you you have no sense
of what's meaningful even if you do you're not really
living it and so you're not motivated because you might
have some murky ideal of maybe you want to pursue
some some higher value like truth or maybe you want
to pursue some higher value like contribution to society or
or you want to create beautiful things maybe you have
a few of these values but are you actually taking
action on it are you consistently taking action on it
because if you're not you're not an integrity with it
then you're not motivated to get motivated first of all
you've got to get clear about what it is that
you want to create in your life and I hope
there's something that you want to create it can be
something physical like a product it can be something physical
like a building a skyscraper that you want to build
it could be it could be more intangible like maybe
you want to you want to create an organization a
nonprofit organization that helps people or maybe you just want
to create an awesome life for yourself that's still a
creation or maybe you want to create amazing relationships or
maybe you want to have some sort of impact on
other people through sharing your wisdom and your knowledge and
your expertise so all of these are ways that you
can be having an impact out there and all of
these are possible purposes the question is what is yours
what kind of purpose do you want to have this
is the first time that you really seriously considered what
your purpose is then well this should be a rude
awakening for you and it should be no surprise that
you haven't been motivated so far because you have not
articulated your purpose you don't know really what your values
are you don't really know what you want out of
life you don't know what you want to create and
most importantly you do not have a purpose that is
outside yourself it's nice to have at least a purpose
that's grounded in you in the sense that maybe you
want to create something great in your life so maybe
you want to have a lot of money or maybe
you want to have a nice house or a nice
car or you want to have a good relationship those
are internal purposes that's like improving your own life that's
nice that's definitely better than having no purpose at all
that will get you motivated but what gets you super
motivated is when your purpose is outside yourself why am
i motivated I'm motivated because my purpose is not about
me my purpose is about you I'm trying to Kindle
a fire in you with what I'm doing with my
work I'm trying to go out there and create a
business going to influence the world I'm trying to influence
a large audience you think that's motivating for me you
think that gets me charged up in the morning it
does sometimes I'm so excited that I have a hard
time falling asleep because I'm so excited about the next
thing that I'm going to do I'm so excited about
the impact it's going to have on people to me
that's important to me that's meaningful you got to find
what that is for you what is meaningful for you
what do you want your life to be about what
are you willing to sacrifice for because this purpose that
I have it's not just an airy-fairy abstract notion this
is something that I think about every day this is
something I visualize on this is something I spend hundreds
of hours designing in my mind this is like a
giant blueprint as though I were building a skyscraper and
then I was designing every single girder and every single
screw that's going to go into every single beam that
skyscraper I'm designing it and that's really engaging because we
as human beings were organisms that are goal driven so
once you've got that vision of what you want to
create in your life or what you want to put
out there into the world then all of a sudden
your mind is going to click into gear and you're
going to feel yourself excited you're going to feel yourself
having visions of how you can improve this and how
you can prove that part of the vision and you're
going to start to develop this very rich vision and
it's going to feel so real for you and you
have so much fun going out there and trying to
make it into a reality because at first it starts
up here but then slowly through your action taking which
is why you want to be motivated to be taking
action then it will manifest in the real world and
of course how can you be motivated when you don't
have that that picture of what you're moving towards you
don't have a vision and maybe you have a vision
but your vision is not compelling enough or it's not
a vision that is significant enough to you maybe there's
something more significant but you're too afraid to pursue it
you're too scared to think about what it would take
to accomplish it you're too afraid to put yourself out
there or you're too afraid to drop your ego and
stop worrying about yourself and start worrying about the world
and thinking about what you could be putting out there
so for all of these reasons your vision might be
either feeble and too murky it might not be clear
maybe you don't have a vision at all which is
what I found with many people they just simply don't
have a vision and so as a result you're not
motivated so how do you get motivated well you create
that vision and you spend a lot of time building
it up in your mind and you have to do
that internal work and when you get that oh my
god the kind of motivation you get is inspiring you
would literally inspire people with your motivation it'll will rub
off on other people as I hope a little bit
of my motivation here has rubbed off on you okay
