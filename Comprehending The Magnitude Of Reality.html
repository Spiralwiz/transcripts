[Music] you this episode is going to be a little
different than most I don't want to fill your head
here with too much theory rather I want to take
you through an imagination exercise just purely a simple imagination
exercise to help you to connect with the magnitude of
this thing that we are inside of called reality people
really take reality for granted people fail to appreciate the
magnitude and awesomeness of what reality is even scientifically minded
people who supposedly study this stuff and should know better
still underestimate what reality really is and the reason that
happens to almost all of us is because through the
everyday grind of daily life we become numb to this
extraordinary miracle of reality we're so focused on just living
our lives and accomplishing practical goals to advance our own
agendas in life to survive and to reproduce that we
lose touch with the most important thing which is reality
itself so imagine along with me let's do this visualization
exercise you can close your eyes if you want to
or not just watch and listen so imagine if you
will that you go for a nice nature hike in
the forest in the mountains and there you are it's
a beautiful pine forest and you're walking through it then
you walk up on top of a small hill and
now you're on top of this hill and you're looking
around you and you see all these giant pine trees
and they are stretching out into the distance as far
as your eyes can see all the way to the
horizon you can see 50 miles all around you in
a circle now 50 miles is equivalent to 80 thousand
square miles and so what you do is you just
pick up one little pine needle off the ground and
you look at it real closely as you hold it
in your hand and you wonder this pine needle is
still green it's still fresh it just fell off the
tree next to you and you look up at this
tree to you and you wonder how many these pine
needles must there be on this tree maybe a hundred
thousand as a rough estimate that's pretty amazing in and
of itself a hundred thousand these living pine needles these
pine needles they're filled with chlorophyll and they're filled with
complicated cells and DNA and bacteria and little molecules and
mitochondria and all this source of stuff exists in there
not to mention all the little atoms that make up
each one of these organelles and cells and and all
of that and it's amazing and then you look out
far to the horizon 50 miles all around you and
you wonder how many of these pine trees must there
be five billion pine trees roughly fit into an area
of eight thousand square miles which is what you see
all around you and each one of them has a
hundred thousand tiny needles let's say that's five thousand billion
needles that you're looking at and then you look back
down at your hand and you look at the pine
needle in your hand a little bit closer and you
see little ant crawling over it hitching a ride on
the pine needle and then you wonder how many these
ants must there be on the entire planet ten thousand
trillion ants is one estimate and then you look a
little closer at the pine needle you see little grains
of sand stuck to the pine needle and you wonder
how many of these grains of sand must there be
on the entire planet seven million trillion grains of sand
on earth and then you wonder well what about all
the atoms that make up this one little grain of
sand that I'm holding in my hand 50 million trillion
atoms in one grain of sand multiplied by seven million
trillion grains of sand on the entire earth and then
you notice the sunlight shining down upon you from the
Sun and you wonder well what about this sunlight what
is the sunlight it's photons how many of those must
there be shining down upon me right now one thousand
trillion photons per second per square centimeter and this 8,000
square miles around you that's 80 million square centimeters that
you're looking at of sunshine multiplied by 1,000 trillion photons
per second per square centimeter and then you wonder about
the cosmos and you wonder about other planets besides Earth
in our solar system you wonder about Jupiter 1300 Earth's
fit into Jupiter and you wonder about the Sun itself
1,300,000 Earth's fit into the Sun and that's just our
solar system then you wonder how many these solar systems
are there out there how many stars 100,000 million stars
within the Milky Way galaxy and that's one galaxy and
how many galaxies are there 100 billion galaxies comprise our
universe and of course because you know Newtonian mechanics just
very basic physics not going into some sort of fancy
voodoo quantum mechanical stuff but just basic Newtonian mechanics you
know that every single atom and every single particle in
the entire universe is pulling on every single other one
that's basic gravitation nothing fancy basic gravitation tells you that
they're all infinitely interacting with each other every single pine-needle
that you see on every single tree is gravitating and
pulling on every other single pine needle determining the entire
outcome of what the forest looks like right now among
everything else every single star in the entire universe all
the hundreds of billions of them are all right now
exerting gravity upon that one little grain of sand that
you have in your hand determining its precise position and
behavior and then of course you realize well this is
just our universe why would there only be one universe
why wouldn't there be more than one how many could
there be well why would there be a limit why
couldn't there be infinite universes like ours or similar to
ours or vastly different from ours and then you notice
that all of this has just been five minutes of
you standing here looking out on these trees and thinking
about all this contemplating reality and that's just been five
minutes out of a time span of four billion years
just for our universe and all of this this this
marvelous organic machine which is reality runs perfectly without a
single glitch without a single frame drop without a single
moment of lag without any errors your computer craps out
and glitches out if it just stands idle running idly
for what a couple of weeks for a month it's
gonna crap out it's gonna crash this thing has been
running for 14 billion years without a glitch and so
you look back down at your hand looking at this
pine needle and you realize something even deeper beyond the
sheer numbers of what we're talking about here you actually
realize that reality itself has infinite resolution this pine needle
goes infinitely deep it has no end you can keep
zooming into this pine needle forever forever and ever and
ever it has no end and in fact what you're
holding in your hand right now this pine needle is
larger than the entire universe it's infinite it contains infinite
universes within it it doesn't stop and then the strange
loop hits you because you realize that this boundary between
subject and object you observing the pine-needle that there is
no such boundary and that actually what you're observing is
what your being and that this pine-needle literally is you
but of course not just the pine-needle all of it
everything you see and everything you contemplate and the entire
known universe and anything beyond it all of it is
infinite infinite in infinite degrees and it's alive the entire
universe is alive and self-aware of just as you are
because aliveness and self-awareness is not a property of human
beings or yourself it's a property of everything because there's
no boundary between you in the universe and anything else
and so there you stand smack-dab in the middle of
infinity infinity goes on infinitely far in every direction it
has no edge therefore you are always no matter where
you find yourself smack dab in the middle of infinity
why in the middle because no matter where you are
the edge is infinitely far away from you in every
direction in every dimension so by definition you are always
at the center in the very middle because infinity goes
on forever in every possible way in every possible direction
and as you realize all this you say to yourself
my god my god what am i involved with here
something much larger than myself is at work here this
is no ordinary clockwork universe this is no ordinary machine
as maybe science has led me to believe this is
no ordinary computer crunching numbers this is something way way
way beyond all that this is not something that's simply
big simply gargantuan simply mind-blowing this is something that is
on a on just on a different dimension or a
different scale its scale goes beyond quantity beyond number beyond
even an infinity of linear numbers this is an infinity
of infinity of infinity of infinity of infinity every pine-needle
is its own little infinity every pine-trees its own bigger
infinity every planet every star every universe and now it
all finally starts to make sense it starts to make
sense why science will never grasp this it starts to
make sense why symbols will never work here it starts
to make sense why Zen masters speak in riddles and
wink at you rather than giving you answers it makes
sense why there's so much confusion amongst religions and so
much debate between religion and science and it makes sense
why no one will ever believe you if you tell
them this this is a private insight that only you
can have only you can contemplate and fully grasp the
significance of what reality is because it's you because it's
not something you can read in a book it's something
you have to fathom for yourself and of course the
odd paradox or irony is is that while all of
that is you and all of that is true you
return back to your boring little mundane everyday life doing
whatever you usually do waking up and brushing your teeth
and going to work and taking care of the kids
and worrying about some problem chasing whatever you're chasing after
some practical material thing you know shopping for some new
shoes that you think are cool or new car whatever
whatever is important to you and that's your boring little
life and it seems like your boring little life has
nothing to do with this grand vision of what reality
is how do you connect the two that's the key
question because in this moment when you're fathoming the full
scope and divinity of reality it strikes you that this
is the most important thing to ground yourself with because
this is what reality is this is the truest thing
that there is this is the thing that you want
to be aligned with rather than the thing that you've
always been aligned with which is you're a mundane petty
little existence of course you're petty little existence is boring
which is why you go you look for four movies
and if video games and you're looking for sex and
relationships and and money and cars and clothes and all
this sort of course of course because deep down you
know that what's really possible for you is to be
connected to everything what's really possible for you is to
be connected to the divinity of all of reality but
what you struggle with is making that connection and before
you can even begin to make that connection you first
have to realize what the goal is of life cuz
most people don't even get this far this is alright
you're already beyond the point that 99% of human beings
get to is they never even get to this point
where they fathom that oh yeah the point of my
life is to is to connect myself to this to
this larger hole that I'm a part of and then
you can go about doing that then you can kind
of create a vision around that and it's challenging because
what'll happen is that everybody around you and the way
that society is structured all around used it's structured in
such a manner that it's gonna pull you back in
to your little boring ordinary mundane life because you're gonna
have problems at school you got to have homework assignments
or do you got to go to go to a
job gonna make a paycheck got to pay the mortgage
gotta take care of the kids got to do this
got to do that got to make your girlfriend happy
or boyfriend happy make your family happy fix all these
problems and by the time you're done for you're done
fixing all these problems you're dead your life is over
you've lived 80 years and the time is just flown
by like that and what have you got to show
for it all you were is you were just a
doing robot you were just like a little factory worker
you were born into this miraculous thing called reality but
you spent your whole life with the blinders on just
being practical being pragmatic because that's what you really cared
about you cared about being efficient and so that's what
she became you became very efficient at earning money you
became a very efficient at getting sex you became very
efficient at dealing with your kids such that you could
talk to them without even looking at them you became
efficient at dealing with your husband or wife such that
you don't even need to speak to them to even
know what they're thinking anymore so everything has become about
efficiency and in your business and even in the way
that you play video games or watch a movie it's
all hyper efficient so you are chasing efficiency without realizing
that really what you want is you want a connection
to as much as possible and what more is there
possible than reality itself in infinity which you're really looking
for is you're looking for a connection a deep profound
connection to infinity that is what the quality of your
life depends upon not any of the practical stuff that
you're chasing you can chase all that practical stuff all
you want but deep down you will always feel unsatisfied
because subconsciously your mind knows it's not stupid subconsciously and
knows that what's possible for it is infinity a connection
to infinity but you forget ah this is the leo
this is just a visualization exercise this isn't really real
this isn't real it's just an idea it's just a
fun little exercise I'm gonna turn off this video I'm
gonna go back and I'm gonna keep watching other videos
and just doing my stuff and clicking on the computer
and posting a little stupid comments and then going back
to work that's the really important stuff that's life and
then you wonder why you're not satisfied why everything that
you acquire never really scratches that itch whether it's knowledge
that you're acquiring or wealth or success or fame or
women or cars or houses or anything else see you're
never going to become infinite through this finite process that
you're using this materialistic process it's never going to work
to become infinite you need to realize that you already
are infinite that's something within you that you have to
turn inside and realize and that's where practices like meditation
come into play self inquiry psychedelics yoga some Zen practice
you know whatever there's a lot of different practices that
you can use to develop this connection but that's what
it's about but most people are so busy that they
will say Ollie I don't have time to meditate I'm
too busy to meditate too busy doing what the only
thing you should really be concerned about is building your
connection to infinity that's what really matters and you're not
doing that by building your career for example or by
getting into a relationship or buying the latest greatest video
game so you're sacrificing infinity for little finite pieces of
it you're chasing little crumbs when you could have the
whole but in order to do that you really need
to to become conscious to connect with the significance of
what's going on here that connection then grounds you and
sets the tone for the rest of your life and
what you're doing from that one highest strategic objective is
the pursuit of this connection that will inform everything else
you should be doing in your life on a regular
basis and if you set your life up that way
then you'll set yourself up for the ultimate success and
if you don't then what you could have you're just
gonna have little practical stuff without the deep connection and
what you really want is you want the deep connection
it doesn't matter how much you have or or what
kind of situation put yourself in life what matters to
you is how you feel it's an emotional thing it's
how deeply connected are you to reality so take this
you're sort of guiding principle and see what your life
will look like if you start to design your life
around this guiding principle start to align yourself with it
in little and sometimes big ways as much as you
can both in micro ways and in macro ways in
your life and then see how you feel and then
see maybe whether self-help will start to work for you
in ways that it never could before alright that's it
short and sweet come check out actualized already I got
some resources for you right there my blog the forum
life purpose course which will help you with some of
this stuff the book list where you can read more
about this stuff and convince yourself even more to pursue
this path and how to go about I'm actually kind
of filling in the details how to pursue this objective
in a practical way and stick around for more content
because what actualize org ultimately is about it's about how
to develop this connection and how to align yourself more
and more in your life with the amazing profundity that's
there how to live a really deep life not just
self-help to help you with some practical little problem because
that's not really gonna help you see people start doing
self-help like that but then they never really get satisfied
on the inside no matter how many self-help problems they
fix using traditional self-help techniques that's because they're not going
to the root of the issue and it's hard to
get people to go to the root of the issue
because the root of the issue is buried really deep
underneath a lot of stuff so we have to uncover
layers of it and it takes time it's it's profound
precisely because it's profound your journey has to be profound
but then people they don't want to go on a
profound journey what they want is they just want a
quick answer a quick five 10 minute video here and
they're explaining something solving some little problem for them but
that's not what you really want from life you want
to profile life so if you want to profound life
then you better expect that the teachings that you're listening
to also must be profound and therefore you must be
willing to put in the time and effort to go
on this profound journey you don't want a quick shout
a little journey you want a really profound a deep
one one that connects you with the entire cosmos with
all of reality and this is where self-help intersects with
religion but not really religion spirituality non-duality because we don't
want to we don't want to subscribe to all the
dogmas and problems that come with religion but there is
something at the core of religion which most self-help doesn't
properly convey to people and which most scientific and rationally
minded and materialistically minded people just don't get they're completely
missing out on that facet of reality well when you
miss out on that facet of reality that's the most
important facet of reality it doesn't matter what else you
do or what else you have or however much you
understand scientifically or or otherwise if you don't have that
connection what do you got you don't really have a
profound life so what actualize that organ is trying to
do and why some of my videos can be so
long and some of these topics that I talk about
can sometimes seem kind of woolly or lofty or metaphysical
yeah because you you need your life to become metaphysical
more the problem is that you lack you lack that
and that a physical component in your life because it's
that metaphysical component which connects you with the the the
source and and being of all the cosmos right that's
the kind of teaching that you should be looking for
that's in fact how you evaluate the quality of the
teachings at this point I can pick up a book
any book off off of a bookshelf in a bookstore
and just by skimming over and I can immediately see
the depth of the teaching that's there it's really clear
because if the teachings don't have a metaphysical component to
them or an epistemological component to them then they're gonna
be weak weaksauce teachings they're not gonna get you very
far they're just gonna be little little tricks to to
just change rearrange the you know the furniture on the
Titanic that's what most self-help boils down to so stick
around for more of the deep stuff you
