hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the amazing power
of psychedelics I'm going to share my experiences with magic
psilocybin mushrooms and I'm going to talk about the potential
of using psychedelic substances for self actualization warning the information
provided here is strictly for educational and harm-reduction purposes only
I am NOT responsible or liable for any damage that
you caused yourself while using psychedelics these substances can potentially
be very dangerous and even lethal so make sure that
if you do decide to experiment with them that you
do so very carefully and very responsibly so I've been
doing a lot of research on psychedelics this is a
very interesting field and it's something that's pretty new to
me I've been doing a lot of theoretical research but
also some practical research and I want to share my
results with you here now uh but you got to
understand where I'm coming at this from I'm not doing
this for recreational purposes you see my thing is self
actualization its consciousness work its enlightenment that's what I'm after
and so the reason I started to explore psychedelics is
for their potential to enable that in me and does
it work is the question can psychedelics really be used
for meaningful growth or is it just a fun experience
that people have so I'm going to address that more
towards the end of the episode after I share some
of the amazing experiences that I've had so you want
to stick with me I know this is gonna be
a long episode because I have a lot of stuff
to share but towards the end is where I'm going
to actually tie my experiences in with what this could
mean for your life and also I'm going to talk
about some of the pitfalls of using psychedelics so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to give you
aspects of my experience it's not going to be a
detailed step-by-step chronological trip report I just want to highlight
the aspects that are most interesting because I don't wanna
bore you with too many details so what does it
feel like to be on mushrooms it's a pretty amazing
experience one of the most amazing experiences of my life
for sure let me try to describe it and it's
really hard to do that with words as it is
with these types of mystical experiences so I've taken mushroom
several times and I'm going to do kind of compilation
of the several times that I took them the first
thing I notice when I took mushrooms and I took
about two grams of dried mushrooms worth and actually was
an alcohol extract which removes the nausea effects from typically
taking mushrooms it was great and what I immediately started
to notice about within 20 to 30 minutes of it
coming on sorry to come on pretty quickly is just
subtle effects changing in my awareness and the most important
thing I noticed was just how much more meditative and
aware I became it's like everything just popped as I
was sitting in my living room I was looking at
the plants that I have I just purchased a couple
of uh of kind of tall tree like plants they're
real plants and I was sitting there looking at them
and just like the three-dimensionality and the reality of the
plants as I was looking at them and this trip
was coming on was really palpable what immediately occurred for
me as a thought as this was happening is like
oh man this is like what I feel like after
ten days of the pisano retreat so you know if
you do a hard core of a pasta retreat where
you're meditating for like 12 hours a day for 10
days straight and nothing else that's all you're doing by
the end of that retreat your mind is in this
super hypersensitive hyper aware state where you're just like you're
walking through the world and it's like you're sort of
like neo in the matrix you know everything is kind
of like almost as though it's moving slowly because you're
just so hyper aware of everything right and even the
most mundane things like taking a footstep as you're walking
on the pavement becomes this kind of extraordinary expense because
you're so hyper aware of every footstep that you're taking
so it was like that here with me I'm sitting
on the couch in a meditative like position and I'm
just noticing the effects of this mushroom come on and
just like wow the awareness of it is amazing I
immediately just started to laugh and just have this huge
grin on my face because you know Here I am
in my everyday life spending hours and you know hundreds
of hours it's like wracking my mind to meditate more
effectively to kind of let go to surrender to become
more present to the moment and here it is it
just happens in like 30 minutes you know 30 minutes
and I'm there and that's just the beginning that's just
like the first little taste of what these mushrooms can
do then after about an hour into it what I
start to notice is how patterns are emerging on flat
surfaces so this is like what we'd call the classic
psychedelic effect and on mushrooms there's this really interesting vibe
that they have so what I notice is that everything
starts to become this kind of like rich saturated almost
like warm glowing color and sensation the lights in the
room actually start to dim but also kind of get
saturated and it's kind of like golden hue and it
just becomes like really really beautiful really beautiful really like
pleasant it's not scary in any sort of way at
least for me and and then what starts to happen
is that just the patterns start to emerge right like
if you're looking at a flat surface like a wall
or a ceiling or tiles on your bathroom bathtub area
or maybe like the carpet I really notice with this
with the carpet the carpet starts to just get filled
with these sort of floral patterns they're almost floral tribal
sort of patterns there's no particular like animal shapes in
there or anything like that it's just like tribal floral
patterns and they all kind of start to swirl and
animate and morph around and the entire carpet just becomes
a sea of these patterns more and more and more
as the trip comes on which is a really kind
of nifty experience if you never had that before which
was a totally new experience for me also the colors
of the carpet start to change and all these floral
detailed floral patterns they feel very organic and also the
colors are like shades of pink and yellow and green
and a little bit of blue and it's just like
this kind of like beautiful and very hypnotic and these
patterns when you look at them they just kind of
start to like suck your mind into them in this
very hypnotic sort of way and then you have to
like look away and look somewhere else and then it's
like oh okay I've I've kind of broken the spell
the hypnosis a little bit and then that other pattern
you're looking at now that one starts to hypnotize you
but it doesn't happen everywhere it only happens on these
large flat surfaces so if I'm just like looking at
a you know at an object then it looks pretty
much like a normal object but the mood of the
whole room starts to change and what I notice very
distinctively it acquires this sort of like Amazonian feel it's
almost I wit like I went back into the jungle
in ancient times all right like where our ancestors came
from in the Amazon or also like it's got these
vibes and feelings of like Africa like I'm in ancient
Africa or ancient India and it's just like it's really
cool effect that just like you just go wow this
is amazing and I'm sitting I just have a huge
smile on my face throughout my entire trip and all
the trips that I've taken it's been nothing but positive
experiences for me now that's just me I don't know
how it'll be for you and it's certainly not that
way for everybody you have to understand that my mind
is quite prepared for this stuff I've done years of
meditation daily meditation for hours I've taken many retreats I've
done a lot of consciousness work I've done a lot
of self inquiry I understand non duality I've studied psychology
for years I've studied and investigated metaphysics epistemology um science
history like I have really looked and been curious about
the nature of reality for pretty much my entire life
for decades right so when I take this substance it
it makes all my philosophical inquiries that I do in
everyday life it just actually makes them like real and
tangible and not just ideas in my head and because
I love it so much I feel like I can't
have a bad experience now I don't know maybe in
the future I will have a bad experience I'm sure
it's possible but right now it's hard for me to
imagine how I could possibly have a bad experience on
this stuff because it just kind of opens the gate
to take me to all the stuff that I love
about life exploring reality so take that into account you
know some people they don't want to explore reality and
I think that this is where bad trips can come
from is when you're resistant to that you're closed off
to that you're not really interested in knowing what's true
or looking at the world from radically different perspectives you
haven't studied psychology non-duality metaphysics epistemology history or any of
this kind of stuff uh and then you could be
in for some you know rude awakening and some horrific
experiences like some people report but anyway so I talked
about the patterns the lights I really love the lights
on mushrooms like it's just amazing it feels beautiful but
then oh probably the most like eerie and odd thing
that I've noticed on mushrooms is these trances these trances
that come upon me so after about an hour into
it the mushrooms really start to take effect and I
get just overwhelmed by what I would call a trance
now what is a trance it's almost like a wave
like if I'm swimming in the ocean I get a
giant wave that just kind of like crashes into me
and pulls me under it's so powerful that you can't
resist it but this is happening inside your mind your
basic sense of place and self and who you are
and where you are in the world all this basically
goes out the window and you go inside this trance
where I mean you basically lose consciousness you're not even
sure what the hell is happening in this trance until
you awaken from it five ten and 15 20 minutes
later you obviously lose sense of times you're not sure
how long the trans lasts but this transit just kind
of overwhelms you it's almost like you're looking at some
patterns right then it hypnotizes you so much that you
lose all sense of self and time and reality and
I don't even know where you go you go to
some like dimensionless void I don't know but also you
then come out of the trance and when you come
out of the trance all the sudden you become sort
of conscious of what was happening when you were in
the trance and it's this very weird feeling but personally
I love it I could see how it could freak
some people out but I love it because I love
getting my reality [ __ ] to it right so
I'm going to this trance and then I come out
of the trance like 15 minutes later and I don't
know what happened but I just have memories of being
in this trance and it's just memories of amazing deep
insights profound insight I don't know where these insights come
from but just just like it's like pure wisdom and
also I have memories of like going back maybe into
my past a little bit I have some memories of
almost like going back into childhood but then I come
out of this trance and I'm just floored it's like
wow I've been in this trance for the last 15
minutes I don't even know where I've been and now
only now my awareness is catching back up with it
and it's like now my awareness is filled with all
these amazing gifts and golden nuggets of like pure wisdom
and I'm not sure where they came from but I
mean they're here and I'm just kind of like struggling
to catch up with them it's like wow it's like
I woke up and it's like I've got all these
jewels you know jewels of wisdom and now I'm trying
to like scramble to understand these jewels of wisdom they're
so amazing they feel so beautiful and profound but then
the next wave of trance comes over me before I'm
even even able to make sense of all these jewels
this next trance comes over me and again I'm just
kind of like sucked under overwhelmed by it and again
I sort of lose consciousness I don't know where I
go until again I pop back out of the trance
another 15 20 minutes later and this process just kind
of repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats the first
time I took mushrooms I don't know I counted maybe
like five or six trances they they start kind of
strong then I think they get even stronger like the
second and third transfer like strongest and then they start
to kind of peter out every trans actor probably the
third one gets a little bit weaker and weaker and
weaker and then Peters out throughout the whole thing my
entire trip on mushrooms if you're taking an alcohol extract
of it lasted me about four to six hours after
four hours all the trance effects go away then you
just kind of have lingering patterns and interesting sensations another
thing that I noticed immediately on mushrooms when I was
really into the trip was that I started to behave
like a creature it was cool it really fit in
with the whole Amazonian ancient African vibe I felt like
I was back in the Amazon almost like I was
a savage you know a savage who had no language
and all he did it was like like imagine a
child who was raised by wolves in the Amazon for
his whole life and the way that he would behave
like put that kind of person into let's say a
corporate boardroom or a house in our everyday sub suburban
life or urban life and it's like the guy would
look like an animal right so that's what I start
to feel like uh but it wasn't in a negative
sense it just felt like my body became very loose
and very authentic and it felt like I was a
bit intoxicated in my body kind of like I had
a buzz but also it felt very animalistic and it
felt very natural because it felt like wow this is
what it's like to be a human being or even
not a human being but even something more basic than
that but like a creature an animal and I kind
of got back in touch with my sense of being
an animal and it was amazing and then I noticed
myself starting to kind of move like an animal starting
to walk in the sort of monkey like manner and
almost like when I was like for example sitting on
the on the counter I went to the bathroom and
I was sitting on the bathroom counter and I was
experiencing one of my deepest trances but during that whole
time it was like I was I was sitting this
very odd animal-like position on the counter it's like one
foot was up on the counter one foot was down
on the floor my arm was like stretched up over
here somewhere I was kind of hunched over and I
was in this like deep philosophical metaphysical trance experiencing these
profound insights but also totally like uninhibited and unconscious of
the position of my body and yet also my body
it seemed very graceful right it it moved in a
sort of asymmetrical but very graceful sort of way the
way that maybe if you look at monkeys swing through
tree branches you know it almost looks like they might
lose their grip and they might fall and they kind
of look funny like when they twist their head around
or when their arms are twisting around or their legs
or something like that like maybe you seen this on
the Discovery Channel or something right nature documentaries of monkeys
well that's kind of what I feel like and it
feels amazing it feels like wow why am I not
like this all the time this is what it feels
like to be disinhibited and authentic and I got a
really nice contrast between this animalistic way of being and
also my everyday normal way of being and using my
body which felt so much more reserved and artificial and
just kind of stifled so that was one of the
first important insights that I carried away with me from
this experience was that man I just need to be
much more authentic and especially in the way that I
physically use my body that's something I've been totally ignoring
in my life it feels so good to be authentic
and to not care about what you look like which
is normally what's going on it's going on to such
a degree that you're not even conscious of it until
you've got this nice contrast with the mushrooms at least
that's what it was like for me also what I
notice on the mushrooms is that there's a delusional element
to the mushrooms it's weird because simultaneously what happened to
me was that I was having these profound insights into
reality into my personal life into the direction that I
should take actualize Org into my relationships with people and
all this kind of stuff so these were genuine deep
sites but also there was delusion there how do I
characterize this delusion well first of all you just start
laughing and everything everything becomes funny because when you penetrate
something with your mind it's like wow it's so clear
and so obvious now I can't believe that I was
so asleep before so that just kind of uh produces
this kind of hysterical insane sort of looking laughter like
if you looked at me through a camera while I
was on my trip you just see me laughing with
a huge grin talking to myself like an insane person
um it would look kind of boring actually because most
the cool stuff is happening in my mind but I
would look very weird I would look like an insane
person like at one point I was sitting on my
couch I had a little handheld mirror I was looking
in the handheld mirror and just talking to myself in
that mirror and I was like wrapped up in a
blanket and I was just talking and laughing hysterically like
like an insane person so there's definitely this kind of
delusional quality but there's nothing bad about it you kind
of recognize that it's happening to you so like I
was pretty conscious that I was delusional uh it's very
weird because at the same time you feel more connected
to truth into reality than you've ever been in your
entire life but also you recognize that you know hey
I am hallucinating stuff here and also the insights you're
having you're becoming so uh like one and in the
moment with them that it almost feels like that's it
you know in that moment for example if if you're
feeling love for something you're feeling it fully it feels
like this love will never go away that's all that
there is this present moment and this love you're feeling
or if you're you know having some brilliant insight about
something it feels like this is the most brilliant insight
in the world you feel like Einstein or the Buddha
and then if you know thirty or sixty minutes later
you kind of look back on that episode that trance
and you're like wait a minute you know I wasn't
really having that profound of an insight yeah it was
an interesting insight but it wasn't like you know I
was Einstein or something so I was a little bit
delusional but you're also kind of aware of the delusion
ality it's an interesting phenomenon is really kind of eerie
and odd uh and it's jarring to your normal sense
of what reality is so um what's also really interesting
you know speaking about mirrors when I was looking at
the mirror when I went to the bathroom for the
first time and I just caught a glance of my
face in the mirror I was just amazed that I
even had a face or a body so I'm just
like looking at my body as though I'm looking at
my body and my face for the first time and
I'm just standing there and I just go into a
trance looking at my own face because it's like wow
I can't believe what I am see all these things
that you take for granted in regular life like that
you're a human being you have a face that you
have hands that you have a body at all you
can see things that you can smell things all this
stuff that you take totally for granted but remember that
when you were born and you were first experiencing life
when you were like five years old seven years old
those first memories you have all of life was foreign
to you it was all alien there was nothing familiar
so mushrooms take me back to that place it says
though I was born for the first time again like
I can look at my hands and I'm just floored
by the fact that I have hands and I'm like
what the [ __ ] is this hands I have
hands like they can move and do stuff like it's
amazing you're just standing here and you're just amazed by
this same thing with my face and so I was
looking at my face and then the coolest thing happened
I noticed those flower patterns that I saw on the
carpet now I notice the mess tattoos all over my
face and all over my head so my face and
head were just covered in these tattoos and these tattoos
if you're familiar with the Maori Aboriginal people of New
Zealand they sometimes paint their face in these kind of
black tribal art tattoos there's no animal patterns it's just
flower patterns sort of and little curlicues and stuff paisley
shapes and and that's all over my face except here
it's not like black ink it's pure light it's as
though a light was projected through a stencil on my
face with these patterns and it looks [ __ ]
cool like I'm looking at my face and I look
like I'm a native from the Amazon and like I
look like a [ __ ] badass to myself I'm
just thinking like wow I'm a [ __ ] badass
and then I see also these rays of light light
projecting out behind me in the mirror behind my head
sort of like almost like a halo effect but they
were just like straight rays of light and that was
a really cool experience so yeah you get all these
kind of nifty psychedelic sort of effects you get these
trances you can feel very good in your body like
my body felt amazing it felt like I was fully
in my body fully present and aware of my body
in ways that I haven't been since I was a
child really takes you back to childhood that kind of
fresh magical experience of just pure existence and pure reality
without all the kind of conceptualizing and all the stories
and all the baggage that comes with being an adult
takes you right back to that and of course you
get that amazing feeling of being a child again like
everything is new and fresh and magical it's quite amazing
so I was having these experiences but what I want
to really communicate to you is the deepest experience I
had which was was on my on my second trip
on my second trip I took four grams of mushrooms
which is double the first dose and what I had
was basically a really rapid onset everything I was just
talking about but it was happening twice as fast and
then I had a my deepest experience of all which
I can only describe as a full ontological orgasm an
ontological orgasm a metaphysical orgasm and existential orgasm and this
phrase actually I didn't invent this phrase this phrase came
to me as I was sitting on the couch and
I was entering this experience so I want to talk
about this one a little bit because this is the
really good stuff this is what you're really after if
you're taking a psychedelic so I take the mushrooms the
second time and I'm sitting on the couch and I
notice that they're starting to take effect really quickly the
second time I take them it's not as foreign as
the first time because I kind of know what to
expect and I'm basically getting very similar effects to the
first time so I'm just sitting there and I'm very
quiet this time I'm not filled with kind of like
hysterical laughter and talking to myself because I really want
to just I'm really interested in how the mushrooms will
overtake and overwhelm and replace my everyday sense of consciousness
that's really interesting me so I'm just sitting there and
I'm and I'm watching this mushroom just learning to kind
of creep in on me so to speak I'm seeing
the room starting to change colors change mood it starts
to kind of warp and twist and become this golden
brown earthy color right the entire vibe of the entire
room just completely changes and I'm noticing this kind of
like awareness it's almost as though awareness starts far ahead
of me in my visual field and it's sort of
creeping in closer and closer and closer and just kind
of like overwhelming my regular sense of self and my
identity and what I would call it is this kind
of creeping sense of ego loss until eventually what happens
is that it completely overtakes me and I basically realize
that my life story is a fiction so how do
I explain this right now you're sitting there listening to
me and you think that you're either a man or
a woman you're a certain age you were born to
a certain mother in a certain place in the country
and right now you're living in a other place in
a different country perhaps or a different state different city
and that you are where you are and right now
it's either noontime or it's evening time or it's morning
time you know whatever it is for you and maybe
you got work tomorrow and yesterday you did something else
so you got this whole sense of not just self
not just an identity or ego but like a whole
life narrative you have and you actually hold this entire
narrative as real it's like well what else could it
be I mean of course it's real I lived it
and I'm living it now like right now my narratives
that I'm standing here in front of you actually talking
to a camera I'm not even in front of you
I'm just talking to a camera and so that's my
life narrative but what most people are never conscious of
is that this entire narrative is complete [ __ ]
fiction and the mushrooms they'll prove that to you really
quickly because they just ripped that narrative right out of
your mind to me this is a profound and amazing
experience I love this because it's like a total mind
[ __ ] for some people I can imagine this
very scary because if you're very attached to your sense
of identity and to your ideology into your web of
beliefs and to your cosmology into your metaphysics then this
kind of [ __ ] shouldn't be possible right because
if you're really attached to your narrative and then what
happens is that you take some substance like a mushroom
and it rips the narrative away from you that tells
you that your narrative was uh was arbitrary you see
it's not so much that you take the mushrooms and
then you start to believe all the hallucinations that's not
the interesting part about the mushrooms what happens for me
is that I have my everyday life okay I'm well
aware of how that works and what it is then
I go into the mushroom state and then I have
this mushroom state and all the mushroom experiences and all
the hallucinations okay cool that's interesting and kind of nifty
but it's not that I buy this as the new
reality what happens with my mind is that my mind
goes meta so I have this now juxtaposed with this
and now my mind can say oh neither of these
are what's real you see that's the power I think
of psychedelics it's not that they take you into a
new world and a new dimension and then now you
believe oh that's the new reality if you do that
you're actually becoming delusional you have to stay aware enough
to see the meta what's the meta lessons that you
can draw from this that's what's really really interesting and
also perhaps very frightening to some people who aren't prepared
for it uh so uh what starts to happen is
that I lose my life narrative and then I just
start laughing hysterically because I realize that this idea that
I was ever born like I was a human being
who was actually born this idea is a total fiction
and I'm just at this point I jump off my
couch and I'm rolling around on my carpet floor in
my living room and I'm just floored I'm literally floored
by the idea that I was ever born and I'm
just laughing my ass off because I'm thinking like how
the hell am I going to explain this to my
mother that I was never born and that this idea
that I'm her son is just a fiction you can't
explain it which is why it's so funny so funny
when you realize it so I have that but then
I go into my full ontological orgasm so what is
this what I start to notice is that everything that
I've been studying throughout most of my life about reality
I'm talking about existential questions about reality what is reality
what is existence Who am I all the stuff that
I did with all my philosophy work when I was
in college you know all the ruminating I've done all
that kind of stuff so I would call that maybe
metaphysics epistemology on the mushrooms it becomes real so the
[ __ ] that I was thinking about and theorizing
about now is becoming real for me and it feels
so profound and amazing that the wisdom of these insights
into reality is the most beautiful thing you could ever
experience it's the most pleasureful thing you could ever experience
and so what happens to me is that I have
an epiphany this is what the word epiphany really means
is that I see with my mind's eye I see
that the distinction between real and unreal is groundless and
that it itself is not real because I'm as I'm
going into the mushroom experience I'm wondering like well what's
real is my normal reality real or is this reality
real and like I'm trying to understand my mind try
to understand but see the mushrooms open and expand your
awareness and consciousness so much that you get the wisdom
of like the gods just directly injected like imagine a
firehose of wisdom just being shot straight into your brain
that's what it feels like and so my mind just
like pierces through the veil of the distinction between real
and unreal and I realize that there's no such thing
there's no such [ __ ] thing and when that
happens to me I just go into like complete rapture
complete rapture and just I breakthrough into what you might
call divine bliss and divine love I just break through
until love like reality from this one insight reality just
like becomes seen I see the sort of infinite nature
of existence and that's so beautiful to me that there
is there is nothing that you can do but just
um have this profound divine love this is not a
romantic sort of love this is divine love this is
what the Sufis call devant the divine the experience of
the love of God right it's when you see what
reality actually is for the first time this is such
a powerful experience that it just brings me to tears
not like little watery eyes I'm talking about full-on just
tears of joy and bliss and love just pouring down
my face for just like minutes and minutes image just
tears pouring down my face and I'm just rolling at
this point on the floor of my living room and
just totally speechless totally speechless just cry my eyes out
pure love it's just like I'm enveloped in love there's
not even in me anymore it's like I am the
love the wisdom and the love are like two sides
of the same coin so one side is the wisdom
it's the insight that I have that there's no real
and unreal but then that is such a beautiful insight
it's so profound it's like you know when you're watching
some of my content and sometimes I tell you something
and it's like oh that was kind of interesting I
was in profound inside like aha I didn't know that
before it's kind of like that but multiply that by
a thousand and also mix it with the beauty that
you see when you look at a beautiful sunset and
multiply that by a thousand so it's like taking a
thousand beautiful sunsets plus the wisdom the insight of the
gods as I call it and you mix those together
you launch them you load them into a cannon and
you shoot those straight into your mind and ask the
experience right it just completely overwhelms you completely floors you
so I'm on the floor for like I don't know
how long it was 10 15 20 minutes 30 minutes
in a trance of divine love and rapture and I'm
understanding that I've had a breakthrough you know religious experience
that's what this is and it's just like just like
love pouring forth love pouring forth to give you an
idea of the indiscriminate nature of this love I have
a vomit bucket near me on the floor the vomit
bucket is for in case you're taking the the mushrooms
and you want to throw up because they can make
you nauseous I didn't have to throw up but I
took the bucket in the middle of my trance I
wasn't even conscious that I took it I just wake
up from my trance and all I'm doing is I'm
rolling around the floor just saying love love love love
love and tears and then I notice that I have
this bucket held around my chest really tight holding it
like this with my arms the bucket you know there's
a standard kind of like kitchen bucket that you would
use to like mop the floor with I have this
bucket and I'm just holding it and I'm loving it
so all my love is focused on this bucket I
love it so much that it's more love than you
would have for your child if you have children I
love it more than you love your children it's the
most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life so
I'm hugging this bucket rolling around on the floor with
it and I'm in complete rapture and then I take
this bucket I kind of like look at it I
examine I put it on my head there's some like
nasty stains inside the bucket I just put it on
my head I don't care I love it so much
it's completely indiscriminate love there is not anything amiss with
reality right every little piece of reality is completely loved
there is no rejection of anything at all but that's
just the start then as this is happening and coming
out of that trance starting to feel the need to
go to the bathroom again to pee and I look
at the clock I have a little clock on my
desk there I look at it and I see the
arrows spinning but I look at the clock and I
notice that there is no such thing as time time
is a joke I see the time is a fiction
because what I'm in now is I'm in absolute now
now is all that there is there's no future there's
no past there's just the now it's difficult to express
cribe this experience because you have to actually have it
if you become conscious of that right it's not merely
that you lose your sense of time like oh yeah
time goes by quickly no no the whole concept of
time is seen to be an illusion so I'm looking
at the clock I can see the arrows moving I
know that it's showing us time but I can also
just dismiss it as a joke it's like this is
a human invention there's no such thing as time so
that was a cool little insight I have that and
anyways I stumble my way somehow into the into the
bathroom and in the bathroom after I finished peeing I
have my second really really really deep profound trance so
I go into this one it hit me it hits
me so hard I don't know I just I just
remember opening my eyes and I'm sitting on the edge
of the bathroom tub and I'm looking at the floor
of my bathroom and it's pretty dirty I didn't wash
my bathroom for a while so there's this dirty pee
stain kind of soaked toilet there's a dirt dust and
lint and pubic hair on the floor on the edges
you know where the wall kind of meets the floor
there's all this kind of dirt that you're supposed to
wipe away so I'm looking at all this and at
this point I'm entering a full non-dual state non-dual perception
which basically means that my sense of self is completely
gone and I become the entire world so imagine that
rather than thinking that your your body which is what
you think you are now the entire world becomes your
body the entire world is like an eyeball experiencing itself
right there is nobody perceiving the world the world just
is being it's perceiving itself from no particular direction so
I'm entering into this state and I kneel down is
so profound that I kneel down on my knees on
the bathroom floor the dirty floor as I'm hugging the
toilet bowl the dirty toilet bowl I'm hugging it there's
no sense of impropriety here there's no qualms about dirt
or anything else I'm hugging the bath the the toilet
out of love pure love right I love it so
much and then I get down on my knees and
I see the dirt the lint dirt dust and pubic
hair in the corner of the of the bathroom and
I take my hands and I just I run it
slowly just like slowly and sensually I run it through
the dirt until I accumulate a large ball like about
this big of pubic hair and lint and dust and
like nasty pee dirt and I'm looking at this and
this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in
my life imagine that if there was a god like
a human God and he had a face and you
ever got to see the face of God the kind
of emotions you might experience and the kind of beauty
and profundity you might feel this clump of pubic hair
is the face of God and I'm looking at it
as though I'm looking at for the first time in
my life and all that there is is just feelings
of divine love and me and tears just tears pouring
down my face they can't stop just tears full-on tears
and I'm looking at this as though this is the
most beautiful thing I've ever seen it's more beautiful than
a thousand sunsets and then after a while I put
that thing down and I don't know what else to
do but I just like my body just kind of
gets possessed and all I want to do is I
just want to like pray so I take my head
I just bow it to the dirty bathroom floor by
a forehead to the bathroom floor and at that point
I look like a fanatical uh uh um you know
Islamic rabbi or I don't know what they call them
you know in the Islamic tradition it's like you've seen
have you seen those people you know if they show
you like documentaries of Mecca or something where they're just
like praying you know this kind of like full-on [
__ ] like prayer full-on [ __ ] prayer not
the kind of prayer where you're like asking God for
favors but like [ __ ] prayer as though like
God will kill you if you don't [ __ ]
pray to him it's like that but it's just it's
completely natural it's just like these feelings of of such
deep gratitude and reverence for the beauty of existence just
for the mere fact that existence is happening that you
just see the sacredness of it and so you naturally
feel the need to pray so all the religious language
all this stuff just becomes so crystal clear when you're
having one of these experience because this is a true
religious experience is what religion is about religion is not
about beliefs religion is not about you know certain practices
or going to church it's not about not not a
[ __ ] it's about what I'm experiencing in this
moment when I'm in the bathroom right it's about divine
love and wisdom so uh after that experience in the
bathroom I stumble out of there walk back to my
living room and then in my living room I proceeded
to just have maybe an hour of this very thick
non-dual awareness you it's so thick you could cut it
with a knife I'm just standing there and at that
point you know the delusional element kicks in and I'm
feeling like this it'll never end like I feel like
I'm fully enlightened you know like the wisdom of Jesus
and the Buddha and Mahavira and every [ __ ]
sage and Saint that you've ever heard of in history
just like oh yeah of course that's what they discuss
is it this is nirvana like I'm experiencing nirvana and
I know it I'm fully conscious of it and it
feels like well this is it you know I've reached
it there's no there's no deeper place to go this
is as enlightened as enlightened gets and so I'm just
I'm standing there in my living room just what I'm
like well what the [ __ ] do I do
now like I'm fully enlightened like this is that there's
no more like that's it there's nothing to do this
is complete perfection I could die at this point and
it wouldn't matter it would be perfect if I died
at this point you know my life would be completely
realized there's nothing else left except what also washes over
me is this this desire to share this this desire
to share this with the whole world this desire to
share this with you with my audience and it's like
it becomes crystal clear that this is my life purpose
that this is what I'm here to do is just
to share the deepest insights um that are possible in
existence with human beings and there's just as there's this
like deep compassion want to share all this but at
the same time the recognition that it's it's impossible to
communicate it's impossible to share how do you share something
like this how do you share something so powerful and
so ineffable with people who have no clue like no
clue at all not even an inkling of what I'm
experiencing how do I do that and so yeah so
I just kind of basked in this very thick non-duality
for an hour or so and then rather rapidly just
kind of um evaporated then my trip came to a
close and about four or five hours later I'm basically
dropping down back to baseline so that was my ontological
orgasm now what can you take away from this well
it's not just experiences don't mistake the psychedelic experience as
just an experience the most important thing I think here
is the insights that are possible one of the insights
that I had was that I need to be more
authentic and I was shown the way for how to
be more authentic another insight that I had in the
midst of all this is that there's nothing to achieve
in life like they're just the idea of achievement or
success is [ __ ] ridiculous it's a joke it's
a delusion there's nothing to achieve in life but that's
not an idea that's a palpable insight there's a big
difference between just having an idea when I'm telling this
to you or a belief and an actual honest-to-god insight
into the truth of this also I got insights about
the direction to take actualized org how to make it
more authentic how to take it to the deepest levels
possible so that was kind of like insights into my
life purpose also I had profound insights about ideas and
concepts that I want to share with you you know
uh a few episodes ago I shot an episode called
the 10 things you want but you don't know that
you want and that was inspired by by this mushroom
trip that I had so I I mean I have
these insights regularly I don't need to take mushrooms to
have these insights the majority of my episodes these days
are what I would say like divinely inspired I sit
around until I get hit from out of nowhere by
a [ __ ] idea for an episode right and
I get hit by these ideas you know ten twenty
thirty of them a week and I all I do
is I just scribble that [ __ ] down and
then I presented to you you know I develop it
a bit as well I develop it a little bit
intellectually but the source of the ideas is not me
it's not like I'm just sitting down and [ __
] coming up with [ __ ] to tell you
about how to improve your life like it's coming from
genuine insights so when I'm having the insight I'm as
surprised by it as you are when you hear for
the first time cuz I hear it for the first
time I'm not making it up you see so um
yeah if if you liked that episode about the 10
things you want in life but you don't know that
you want and you felt like there was something a
little bit different about that episode it's because it was
really coming from a very deep place it wasn't just
some [ __ ] that I made up um so
yeah so you can have these kinds of insights and
I mean this is just a sampling of what I
had you could probably have hundreds of various kinds of
insights about your life and about reality and so forth
and those linger those stay with you after the psychedelic
experience passes this [ __ ] stays with you so
that can be very valuable the lasting effects that I
felt from the mushrooms is generally a sense of being
calmer and more detached more grounded in my life my
mind is reaching new levels of deeper and deeper awareness
and also my my kind of like my resolve and
my motivation for my purpose in life is just getting
like supercharged and my resolve for enlightenment work is getting
supercharged and for meditative work is getting supercharged because I'm
seeing this is the only really meaningful thing to do
in life I mean whatever the [ __ ] you
think you've got going in life that's worth a [
__ ] your business your relationships your family your children
all that stuff it's not worth anything it's all meaningless
you see it's all meaningless it's just it's just a
lie that you're living in it's a story that you've
constructed because you have never actually experienced the beauty and
joy of existence itself nothing can compare to it whatsoever
it's completely off the [ __ ] chart it's off
the scale by orders of magnitude right so if you
actually have a taste of that then your priorities in
life will really [ __ ] and this is where
I think that the psychedelics can be quite useful for
the self-actualization journey is that they can get you a
glimpse a taste of all the most advanced stuff that
I've talked about now for years I've talked about this
stuff with you but the problem is is that you
don't really buy it you see when I talk about
enlightenment first of all half the [ __ ] people
just dismiss me right off the bat but even those
people that don't dismiss me even if you believe me
mad enlightenment even if you're pursuing some form of meditation
or self inquiry you're not doing it nearly vigorously enough
right you're doing it in a very weak half-hearted sort
of manner it's very difficult for you to mobilize yourself
to do this work because you're not really sure where
it's leading you to and you know in the back
of your mind you might even be thinking like well
maybe all this is just nonsense it's just [ __
] maybe leo is just making all this crap up
you know uh but even even worse than that what
you basically fail to realize is the significance of enlightenment
you fail to realize that this will throw your entire
way of life into the garbage can like when you
look at your life compared to an enlightened life your
life your regular life what you love right now the
thing that you're trying to self-actualize for your ego it
looks like a stinking pile of horseshit and this thing
here looks like beautiful heaven compared to what you're currently
living but even when I tell you this it's not
enough you see this is the thing that I realized
when I was having my Jesus moment it's like yeah
this is what Jesus felt but how the [ __
] am I supposed to communicate this to you cuz
you don't understand you have no frame of reference whatsoever
you can't even imagine what it's like to not have
a self you can't even fathom it because if you
did fathom it you would be doing the work it's
not enough to agree with me oh yeah leo enlightenment
is cool I like it that's not enough your entire
[ __ ] life is devoted to this because there
is nothing else there's literally nothing else everything else the
[ __ ] sham but see you don't like hearing
that because you're [ __ ] going about your everyday
life and you're running your business and you're running your
family you're doing all this stuff and you think that
that [ __ ] matters you think that stuff is
actually bringing you joy like it's bringing you joy and
happiness no you have no idea you have no idea
the only reason you think that is because you have
nothing else to contrast like literally nothing else to contrast
it with imagine that a human being a baby was
born and was you know raised in the prison cell
its entire life you could imagine that that baby would
actually have a fondness for his prison cell and when
the door was opened it would never want to leave
that prison cell because the baby to itself would say
but this is this is what's real the prison cell
is all that there is I don't want to go
outside and look at the trees and the Sun and
the moon and the stars and the beautiful mountains and
all this stuff I don't want to look at that
the prison cell is the best thing that there is
you see and the reason the baby does that or
this child that grew up in the cell does that
is because I mean what else can it no there
is no contrast when you have no contrast for something
you're clueless you're ignorant worse than that you're ignorant of
your ignorance the ignorance goes so deep in you that
I lack the language to communicate it to you I
don't know what I'd have to be a [ __
] poet to communicate your ignorance to you it's so
deep and that's generally my my whole challenge in life
with my work with actualised i doriga's how do I
communicate to you the deepest things that I know are
possible for you that if you experience them they would
be so profound that they would bring you to your
knees and tears and yet when I tell you about
these things you will not really listen to them you
will not grasp them and you will certainly not mobilize
yourself to achieve them and that you will die you
will live your whole life and you will die in
ignorance of the fact that you lived in a [
__ ] prison cell your whole life and that all
the beauty of life escaped you that's the reason that
I have the teaching style that I have it has
to be blunt it has to be obnoxious to a
degree because what else will rouse you from your [
__ ] ignorance what else this is the situation it
might seem like I'm exaggerating the situation it might seem
like I'm being blunt or that I'm being of bombastic
here and from a certain perspective I am I do
exaggerate and over dramatize some of this stuff but also
the actual reality of it is is that if you
did the work to achieve the things that I'm telling
you to achieve namely a permanent state of non-dual awareness
and the realization of absolute truth if you had that
every bombastic thing that I say to you would seem
like an understatement because that's the reality that's the depth
of your ignorance most people most teachers what they do
is they pussyfoot with you right they don't come out
and say that because when I come out and say
that what does that do that raises all your defense
mechanisms you get all up [ __ ] in a
you know get your panties in a twist about no
Leah you can't attack my life you know my family
how dare you talk about my and how dare you
talk about my business and my career how dare you
rob me of these things how dare you rob me
of the meaning of my life but see I mean
that's a [ __ ] farce that's a farce what
you call a meaningful life is a [ __ ]
joke and that's just the bottom line truth of it
um so I mean for someone to be honest about
these things they have to [ __ ] and talk
the way that I talk if they don't talk the
way that I talk they're not being honest like you
go to a Zen master and that Zen master you
know he's very silent he's very chill he's totally detached
he's experiencing the [ __ ] bliss and rapture of
[ __ ] existence but he's not gonna tell you
about that he's not gonna push it on you he's
not gonna make you aware of your [ __ ]
ignorant he's just gonna tell you that you sit just
sit just sit staring at a wall and and ask
yourself who or what you are that's all he'll tell
you from your perspective that's a complete understatement complete understatement
you know an enlightened person doesn't really want to go
sell enlightenment um which is I think in some ways
regrettable I mean on some level I understand exactly why
they do that but in other ways it's kind of
regrettable which is kind of where I come in which
is what my role is my role is to hit
you over the head with it in a very blunt
manner some people will like that some people hate that
but um I promise you that if you do the
work and then you look back upon what I've said
then you'll be like leo why didn't you kick me
in the ass even harder I mean my life I
actually believe my life meant something and then I got
enlightened and it's like all that [ __ ] was
just [ __ ] idiocy it was complete idiocy why
did nobody tell me well it's because you didn't want
to listen so nobody told you how can we tell
you if you don't want to [ __ ] listen
do you see that this is the this is the
challenge of all of humanity from the very beginning of
human civilization up till today humanity has basically had one
challenge and that challenge was ignorance ignorance of what the
truth is of enlightenment right there have been incredibly hardcore
sages and saints and Zen masters and Yogi's now for
for thousands of years this goes back five ten thousand
years ago these people have already knew all this stuff
but then when they come and they try to share
these insights with regular folks regular folks are so deeply
in a trance of what we call life that um
they can't comprehend what's being told to them right they
don't hear they don't grasp the communication they dismiss it
they put it off till later they distract themselves and
they go back into their ignorant trance that's it that's
all of human history in a nutshell all of it
even up till right now and this will still continue
for thousands of more years most likely unless we get
some breakthrough [ __ ] technology to fix this problem
so uh so yeah that's your situation now I know
that's a lot to put on your shoulders I know
you like little precious petty life but hey um I
got to tell you how it is and here's where
the psychedelics come in right the psychedelics can get you
a taste to this in a way that you cannot
foresee yourself because you have such limited vision because you
are my Opik you need to see it for real
to believe it you can't really believe it for me
personally actually psychedelics are not that important because I didn't
need psychic IVA noon I've been to enlightenment work for
three years now I don't [ __ ] need psychedelics
to get me interested in the truth of what existence
is but for most people you know most people they
don't care about metaphysics or epistemology or what reality is
or what existences they just want to live their petty
little life that's all they want that's all they know
for those people they need a wake-up call so that's
where psychedelics can come in and be useful there are
however problems with psychedelics I mean originally my stance on
psychedelics was a skeptical one and if you noticed me
before I would write comments you know some people asked
me comments under my videos like hey Leo what do
you think about LSD and mushrooms and other stuff and
what about that and usually I would tell them you
know that's a distraction because see everything I'm talking about
here it will work for you but only if you
have a well-prepared mind if you've laid the foundation which
is what I did in my life most people who
do the psychedelics do not lay any kind of foundation
at all and what happens is psychedelics are easily misused
and I don't just mean that they're misused in the
sense that well you know you can cause yourself some
physical damage by overdosing on a psychedelic that's not the
biggest misuse the biggest and most damaging misused is the
psychological misuse of psychedelics it's the using of a psychedelic
for a short cut to get somewhere or for entertainment
or recreation or to uh create false confirmation of your
existing spiritual [ __ ] dogmas that's all misuse of
psychedelics most people take a psychedelic they have some spiritual
sounding experience and then they get lost in that experience
and they take it as reality and then they go
into fairytale land and they get lost in the delusions
and the phenomena that comes with psychedelics that's not how
I use psychedelics that's not what you can achieve with
them if you really know how to use them so
I think that my stance on psychedelics is as follows
that they're very powerful tools for very responsible people who
are doing the self actualization work already and then the
psychedelics just open the gates and they take it to
a whole nother level that's great but how many people
are really like that how many people will actually understand
that psychedelics do not get you to enlightenment they won't
if you think you can take a psychedelic and become
enlightened then you are [ __ ] kidding yourself it's
a delusion have you noticed that any of your druggie
friends who do a bunch of drugs and psychedelics and
stuff that they are not very well developed people they're
not emotionally grounded they have all sorts of stupid problems
in their life that basically they're fools some of the
trip reports that I read from people I'm astounded at
the stupidity of what they do in these trip reports
the reason is because they just take a chemical substance
they think that this chemical will do something for them
and it really won't you need to do the heavy
lifting all the deep consciousness work you have to do
all the stuff I talked about with actualize that are
content that's the [ __ ] you should be doing
every single day and then you take a psychedelic once
in a while and maybe it opens the doors and
takes you even further but even though it can do
that don't mistake that for enlightenment nothing you see on
a psychedelic trip no visuals no sounds no thoughts no
emotions no matter how beautiful or amazing they are no
matter what kind of entities you see aliens [ __
] or dwarves mechanical elves or whatever the [ __
] any of that [ __ ] that you see
that's not the truth that's just phenomena all that's phenomena
but see you can't understand that unless you're doing the
self actualization stuff that I'm telling you to do first
to lay the foundation see so the power of psychedelics
is that they can really open your mind and most
people have such a closed mind they can get you
interested in reality and truth and most people are in
uninterested in reality or in truth psychedelics can also be
used for therapeutic purposes for healing and they can be
a deep source of insights about life what I'm going
to do in the future is I'm going to have
more episodes that share my experiences with psychedelics and all
the research that I'm doing there's some amazing research happening
now this is actually quite a cutting-edge field there's a
lot of science neuroscience getting involved there's a lot of
potential for using these substances to cure addictions so I
think that we're really turning the corner here on how
psychedelics are used in legitimate ways in this country and
around the world so there's a important stuff that I
want to share with you there and my own personal
experiences and deeper insights that I have so stick with
me offer for all app I hope this motivates you
to actually do the foundational work so that you can
then experience some of these things that I'm telling you
you can experience because if you don't do the foundational
work you can easily have a terrible trip you might
scare the [ __ ] out of yourself when all
your inner demons come pouring forth all those inner demons
that you've been sweeping under the rug for years avoiding
resisting not doing the work to fix well they're all
going to come out it's going to be a Pandora's
box that's open once you take those mushrooms see so
start doing the work and stick around for next week
for the next episode before you actually go and start
to experience psychedelics because I know now you've heard all
this stuff I've kind of gotten you excited and horny
to try some psychedelics wait up on that watch next
week's episode because next week's episode is going to be
about how to use psychedelics for personal growth I'm going
to share very practical tips all the tips and guidelines
and rules that I've discovered for how to create the
best trips that you can I'm going to talk about
various substances and the effects that they have that you
should use and ones that you shouldn't use and stay
away from so you want to stay tuned for that
don't run off and start buying up a bunch of
[ __ ] drugs from people stay tuned to do
this in a responsible way and keep your eye on
