hey this is Leo for actualised org and I'm super
pumped up about this video because this is a special
guest post video plus written article for goal-setting guide calm
and the owner of that log is arena hay arena
anyways the topic that we're covering here for her viewers
is are you prolific this is a question I been
thinking about lately how prolific are you and when I
think about that word prolific I always think about Pablo
Picasso because he was one of the most prolific artists
of all time it's estimated somewhere I've read in books
between 40,000 to 50,000 pieces of art he produced throughout
his whole life and he stayed productive as an artist
up through his 80s and I think maybe into his
90s basically until death he was that productive he was
so productive that you would call him prolific prolific means
that you produce exceptional quantity of output creative output work
what are you producing in your life and I've been
asking myself this question am i prolific and it's a
yes or no question it's a yes or no answer
and I feel like I've actually been barely prolific throughout
my life I've worked on a lot of different projects
I tend to be a creative type of person so
I always love to produce stuff and I get a
big thrill out of just making something and then putting
it out there or even not putting it out there
just making it I always feel like I need to
be working on something or my life is going to
waste and I'm just not fulfilled I'm not happy and
I noticed that my happiness is really correlated with my
level of productivity so when I'm productive my happiness shoots
up and when I'm not productive which I often am
not then my happiness drops and those two are like
those two needles go hand-in-hand with each other for me
for you maybe a little bit different but I think
that anyone can can get into that and can tap
into the creativity that they naturally have and the productivity
that they have I think that most people just never
never really take that on as a challenge never take
that on as a mission for themselves and so most
people are not prolific in fact I would say most
people are not even productive let alone prolific prolific I
really mean that you're producing a ton just like a
massive ton of output whatever that is for you and
your job this could mean that you know if you're
a professional athlete or a golfer that means for example
that you're going to be entering a lot of tournaments
it doesn't matter if you're winning them or not you're
just entering them you're entering termina mints all the time
you're doing that all the time like that's your that's
the air that you breathe and if you're a writer
if you're prolific writer that means you're writing stuff all
the time every single day you're sitting down to write
something every day you're putting out work you're putting out
pages you're putting out books you've got many books that
you put out not one book a prolific writer puts
out dozens of books maybe 50 books you know think
about someone like Stephen King think about someone like Isaac
Asimov the classic science fiction writer they literally have libraries
of books that they've put out they're really prolific people
and what ends to happen is that those people tend
to be also extremely successful because when you're that prolific
at something it's hard to suck at it it's hard
to suck at it the the Buddhists had a saying
that I heard once that if you read a book
a thousand times you're bound to understand it right and
there's something powerful about that there's something powerful about just
putting here sheer force behind your action and just breaking
barriers by but just be so persistent with whatever it
is that you're doing that you're gonna break through and
you're gonna master it you're gonna become the best of
the best that's how you become the best in the
world is by being extremely prolific whatever it is that
you're doing you know if your salesmen are you making
a ton of sales are you always like on the
phone making sales calls or going your door if you're
an entrepreneur are you a prolific entrepreneur that means you're
starting businesses all the time you love to start a
new business you love to start and of course manage
it and then maybe sell it off or move on
to the next one somehow fold it up and then
get it to work itself and then move on to
the next one in the next one you see this
in serial entrepreneurs and those are the ones that tend
to be like really good is that they have a
long streak a history of stuff and enterprises that they've
started and not all of them were necessarily successful it's
not about being prolific and putting out masterpieces all the
time all those 50,000 artworks that Picasso did many of
them were sketches many of them I'm sure you've never
heard of many of them were probably not masterpiece quality
but still he produced them the fact that he produced
them is what got him so good and this applies
to any area of your life so I want you
to really ask yourself this question are you prolific if
the answer is no how can you be and why
are you not and why do you not care about
that why do I care about being prolific but you
don't being prolific is going to give you two really
really big things in life this is how you create
a supercharged life one is that it's gonna make you
successful if you're worried about petty things right now like
money paying the bills credit cards you have to pay
off these types of things all that can be overcome
if you just give yourself in to being extremely productive
in something because what's gonna happen is that when you're
that productive you're gonna become so good that people can't
ignore you which is actually the title of a book
by Cal Newport so good that they can't ignore you
which makes a really good case for how to master
yourself in some career or profession I recommend you check
that out and I'm gonna have some videos on it
as well but the point here being is that you
want to become so good that you have a lot
enough career capital and leverage to demand high paycheck and
then you're comfortable not only that but you also besides
the money you get to demand creative autonomy and when
you have that creative autonomy then you get more leeway
to actually do the things you want to do when
you begin become more self expressive and then of course
because you're producing a lot you're becoming so good and
so masterful at the production process not only are you
producing world-class results eventually which is really rewarding for you
it's also rewarding for other people it's also going to
get you money like we talked about but ultimately when
you master that you get into that flow state you
get into that state of flow where when you're working
like you're enjoying it like I can picture Picasso being
in flow all the time because his life was basically
about art and sex and the sex part I'll leave
to some other video but the art is what I'm
talking about here and the art I can just picture
him there like waking up in the morning and just
going straight to his canvas and draw painting on it
or drawing on it and getting a lot of pleasure
from that and just doing it all the time it's
like it wasn't something he had to force himself to
do to get out of bed to do it I
just picture him like breathing that that's that's this thing
that's what he got his kicks out of it's kind
of like the way that maybe some of us will
go and like we'll want to go watch some TV
on the weekends and just like do a marathon session
it's like oh that's gonna be so pleasant well what
if that was like your work what if your work
was like that I think that's how it is for
prolific people it has to be how else can you
put out that much work whether you're a movie director
a writer an artist an entrepreneur whatever how else can
you beat a prolific unless you really really love it
and that's what I want for you and that's why
I always encourage you to think about your life purpose
and to find out what your life purpose is because
you need to know what your purpose is in life
and you really need to have a lot of self-awareness
before you can commit yourself to being that prolific it
takes a certain commitment to do that so I want
you to really think about this think about how you
can move yourself into that because this is a higher
level experience that you could have as a human being
that most people out there I don't see having most
people out there are just living an ordinary life humdrum
kind of life they're comfortable nine-to-five but it's not like
that supercharged excitement that you get I mean like the
excitement I get and I'm building it up now like
shooting these videos like I love it I love it
and you can feel that energy that energy like rubs
off on you it's electric it's magnetic I want that
to be happening for you and you work that's what's
gonna supercharge your work and then of course it's gonna
fix a lot of other problems in your life right
now that you're probably bemoaning you're by Mona in fact
you don't have enough money you could be more successful
you could have more time you wish you had more
more financial independence and you wish you had more creative
freedom well all of that you can get but you
have to work for a little bit and it's not
so much even about the work it's just that you're
gonna make the work so pleasant and it's gonna be
so just like so inspiring to you and to other
people that it's really a win-win everybody wins you just
got to get yourself on that track get yourself on
that track that's what I want for you alright this
