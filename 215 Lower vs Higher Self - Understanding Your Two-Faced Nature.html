            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/MZFty-eM6Rk' target='_blank'>Lower vs Higher Self - Understanding Your Two-Faced Nature</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Two Modes of Human Behavior</b>: Leo discusses the two modes of human behavior - lower self and higher self, with the lower self being characterized by fear, meanness, pettiness, untruthfulness, and selfishness and the higher self being characterized by calmness, kindness, nobility, truthfulness, and selflessness. A switch exists between these two modes that can flip at any time.
</li><li><b>Boundary Between Lower and Higher Self</b>: Leo highlights that a boundary exists between the lower and higher self which is threatened when a person feels threatened themselves. As a result, most people unconsciously transition into their lower self, which often leads to disastrous decisions, actions, and plans.
</li><li><b>Identifying Triggers</b>: Leo emphasizes the need to identify specific triggers that cause the switch from higher self to lower self. Examples of these triggers might be situations involving money, family, intimate relationships, career, or reputation. Being aware of these triggers can prevent bad decisions, actions, and plans.
</li><li><b>Keeping a Journal of Triggers</b>: Leo proposes keeping a journal of specific instances when one slips into their lower self as a way of creating awareness about these triggers. This practice can help in recognizing the point at which the switch from higher to lower self occurs.
</li><li><b>The Emotional Body and Mindfulness</b>: Leo introduces the concept of the 'emotional body,' and discusses the importance of mindfulness in becoming aware of when the emotional body 'revs up' and sends a person into their lower self. He argues that recognizing this process can prevent negative actions and decisions.
</li><li><b>Understanding Mindfulness and Emotional Reactions</b>: Leo Gura details a personal experience he had while meditating close to a wasp nest. He emphasizes how this circumstance became a perfect science experiment, showing him how his emotional body could switfly go from a calm state to heightened anxiety, triggered by the close proximity of wasps. He underlines that recognizing these subtle shifts in emotional states requires honing the muscle of mindfulness. 
</li><li><b>Emotional Reaction to Threats</b>: He highlights how threats혰even non-immediate ones such as wasps flying nearby혰can involuntarily trigger strong emotional reactions. The mind starts creating worst-case scenarios, further inflaming emotions and causing a physical response. 
</li><li><b>Mind, Body, and Emotional Awareness</b>: Leo mentions that awareness of emotional body's activation and relaxation is crucial. Noticing how emotional energy moves through different parts of the body and builds up to a significant level혰an avalanche, as he calls it혰can help prevent being overwhelmed by negative emotions.
</li><li><b>Importance of Meditation and Mindfulness</b>: He underscores the importance of regular meditation and mindfulness practices, which enable individuals to discern crucial distinctions, such as the calm state and heightened emotional state. The consistent practice of mindfulness can effectively help prevent the escalation of negative emotions. 
</li><li><b>Commitment to Awareness</b>: He advises viewers to make a lifelong commitment to avoid making decisions when in their 'lower self.' This suggests building the ability for self-awareness to recognize when one crosses into a heightened emotional state or the 'lower self.' He suggests using triggers and subsequent reactions to understand when this transition happens.
</li><li><b>Identifying and Managing Lower-Self Triggers</b>: Leo suggests retracing one's steps whenever one realizes a drop into the lower self occurred. He suggests keeping a journal as a log of all such instances. Additional methods to manage lower-self activation involve practicing more meditation or replicating the previously mentioned wasp experiment.
</li><li><b>Action Steps to Reduce Lower-Self Activation</b>: Leo underscores the importance of disengaging from people when in the lower self to prevent unkind and selfish behaviors. This can involve telling others that one is currently in the lower self and withdrawing from the situation or conversation temporarily until one regains calm and control.
</li><li><b>Mindful Practices</b>: Mindful practices such as briefly meditating after work can help one realize and reduce ongoing stress. Leo emphasizes the advantage of developing better mindfulness muscles through repeated practice, enabling one's awareness of the body's stress signals.
</li><li><b>Structural Changes</b>: Leo advises making changes to one's life structure to remove triggers leading to lower-self activation. This can involve relocating to safer neighborhoods or changing jobs if the current ones present constant triggers. Recognizing these triggers is crucial and might involve introspective activities or seeking professional help such as coaching or therapy.
</li><li><b>Unwiring Triggers</b>: An investment in self-help resources, therapy, or coaching is beneficial in unwiring deep-rooted triggers. While external help can provide an invaluable perspective, unwiring can also be self-led with determination.
</li><li><b>Personal Development</b>: Leo urges viewers to continuously engage in personal development activities, such as reading self-help content, watching instructional videos, and discussing their observations. He emphasizes that making personal growth a habit can lead to significant change over time.
