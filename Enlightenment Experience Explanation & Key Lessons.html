[Music] it's been a few days since since my enlightenment
experience that I released a video on that caused a
little bit of a stir so I want to talk
about that and I want to explain a little bit
of what was involved there what was learned there because
there's there's actually quite a bit to say about this
so first of all people have been asking me and
speculating about was this a trip was this psychedelically induced
and the answer is that I take psychedelics so yes
in this case I did take psychedelics now this requires
quite a bit of explanation though because this can be
a big source of confusion for people it can feel
like olio so you let me down you tricked us
because you made it look as though this was a
real enlightenment but really it was just a psychedelic trip
yeah I've had those two and then they just go
away and so it was just a fake in light
of fake enlightenment so let me address this point and
there's actually a lot in this point that needs to
be addressed where to begin I'm trying to be more
authentic from my experiences so I'll circle back to this
question about psychedelics in a second let me just tell
you what happened after that experience mm-hmm kind of wind
it down mm-hmm so what you have to understand is
that an awakening experience includes both knowing or understanding which
stays with you and it includes an emotional component and
it includes like a state component and this is not
just true of psychedelic trips this is true of all
awakening experiences and these awakening experiences have a broad range
of quality and also depth and different things can be
made aware to you in these different awakening experiences so
you can awaked awaken to different things you see so
if you're meditating on a meditation retreat let's say for
10 days straight and then you have an awakening experience
I've had that before without any psychedelics you have that
what happens well again you get some sort of emotional
state that comes along with it you get an in-the-moment
penetration into the truth or some facet of the truth
it's usually just a facet not the whole thing but
a facet of it and then you get an understanding
of like oh okay now I understand the bigger picture
of what the truth is and how it fits in
with my life and how it fits in with reality
and all of that you see and then what happens
is that that moment goes away of course you're not
constantly on that high for the rest of your life
this is where people really get confused is they assume
that all you're just gonna be on this high now
forever if it's a true enlightenment that's almost never how
it works almost never how it works there's different kinds
of awakenings you can have for example you can have
an awakening into some facet of the truth but it's
such a short glimpse it's like two seconds long or
a minute long and you're not quite sure what you're
really seeing like you're seeing the truth but you're not
sure what it really is because it's just like a
such a small facet of the larger thing that you
don't come away with a lot of understanding so that
that awakening experience sort of passes let's say it lasts
for an hour - then it passes and then you're
just kind of like well damn that that was really
weird that was very profound I'm not sure what the
hell that was and I'm not sure why it went
away or where it is now and I've had that
before as well and that can happen both on psychedelic
trips awakenings and it can also happen on non psychedelic
awakenings you know what you would call legit awakenings like
if you're in a Zen temple or something meditating so
it's important to keep that in mind you see in
a sense the most important part of an awakening is
not the state that you try to keep but it's
the the knowledge or the understanding that you carry away
with you and then how you apply that in your
life and also how much it transforms your relationship to
everyday mundane life because yeah you can do yoga you
could have a Kundalini awakening you can you can open
your heart chakra or you can open your your third
eye the sixth shock or you can open the crown
chakra or the seventh chakra you know you can open
all these chakras you can have all sorts of interesting
mystical experiences of infinite love or of oneness with other
people or just of directly experiencing the absolute as I've
done many times and as what happened in in my
experience that you saw there in this video so so
yeah you could have you could have all these but
the question is what do you carry away at the
end of the day and the reason that I decided
to post this rather provocative video was because for me
this was different than ordinary psychedelic trips I've taken quite
a few psychedelic trips on various substances at this point
and many of them are very profound you know like
five Meo DMT very profound I've had profound trips on
other substances beyond five Meo so by know me five
of the most profound substance I found many substances can
be equally profound if not even more profound but on
this on this occasion what happened for me was and
this is the only reason I recorded it because I
wouldn't record a standard trip and I have it in
the past because in this case there was something different
that was happening in this case everything for me was
coming together in in a remarkable way so it's like
many facets that I had previously become conscious of both
through my self inquiry through my meditation through my retreats
through my beep asana practice through my yoga practice and
through my psychedelic trips all of that was sort of
coming together all these different facets of the absolute we're
coming together the infinity aspect of it the aspect of
no self the aspect of infinite love the aspect of
Nandu ership having no free will the aspect of like
completely surrendering to it so all of these aspects came
together and also just this this very clear understanding not
just like a high but actual understanding of how all
these facets fit together and what they really mean and
that's the point at which I grab the camera and
that's the beginning of that episode is when I realized
what was happening to me and that this was something
that I felt I wanted to share with people in
a very genuine way and I knew that I would
get flack for it and I knew that it was
a kind of a risky and a ballsy sort of
thing to do and I was a little uncomfortable with
releasing the video and I'm a little uncomfortable with some
of the reactions that have come you know people speculating
about all sorts of things because see this is dangerous
territory because my reputation is on the line as a
teacher and of course I that people look up to
me I know that people project a lot of stuff
on to me they project their expectations in their hopes
and their own personal journey in life and in self-actualization
and with spirituality they sort of project that on to
me and and you know that it can't be avoided
it can't be able you do that with every teacher
this is it this is not something particular to me
this happens with every single teacher so take a look
at any teacher throughout history or any of the modern
teachers you know Eckhart Tolle a Rupert Spiro or Mooji
or anybody else and you see people projecting their ideas
onto these people that's the whole trouble with gurus you
see because a guru is someone that you traditionally surrender
yourself to and you trust this guru will deliver you
to enlightenment or to the promised land to Nirvana whatever
you want to call it and personally I'm very much
against this guru idea and this guru concept which is
why I don't have any one particular teacher that I
follow or overly praised because I think that there's a
real deep danger with holding a person as a guru
because then you you develop this attitude that they're somehow
above you or that they're somehow superhuman and that all
the sudden they're perfectly moral they can't have any sexual
problems they can't have any neuroses anymore they can't have
any addictions they have to be perfect in in their
manner right to fit that ideal of like the totally
fully enlightened Buddha or Jesus figure who is so perfect
that his farts don't stink and this becomes a real
big trap a real big trap so I know that
I'm running the risk of kind of playing into that
and instead what I want is I just want to
be completely open and completely authentic about what happened in
this situation and the reason I want to do this
because I think there's very valuable lessons here if you
can get over your own projections and expectations so you
have to be very careful with expectations here and actually
this gives us a great opportunity to talk about something
I wanted to talk about for a long time which
is the nuances and complexities of enlightenment and I've alluded
to this in the past but I really want to
address it more directly here because I've been personally studying
this a lot for myself and I think I've gotten
a lot a lot more understanding about this over over
the years I deliberately held off from talking about the
different stages of enlightenment that exist and the different degrees
of awakening that there are because it's a it's one
of the trickiest subject matters that I think that there
exists for human beings epistemic Lee speaking it's a real
can of worms it's real dangerous territory and the reason
that is is because people tend to naively assume that
enlightenment is just a simple on/off switch like a black
and white state shift that is psycho up you either
enlightened or you're not and maybe then they they get
a little bit more nuanced and then they say well
yeah you can have a little glimpse of it but
either the glimpse sticks or a doesn't if it doesn't
stick it's not real enlightenment if it does stick then
you're fully really enlightened but this is way too simplistic
of a conceptual understanding of how enlightened works it just
does not work this way and if you think about
it it would be rather silly to expect this very
complicated machine that you have here in your in your
skull the brain with its billions of neurons and all
the different modules in the brain and your psyche all
the software in the brain and how all that is
working in halt all that is interlinked and you think
that what just by flipping a switch that entire psyche
is going to get transformed in one instant and that
all those neurons are gonna rewire themselves no that's not
how it's going to work and this notion that enlightenment
is just the truth and you just you glimpse the
truth you now see the truth you know the truth
and now the truth is permeated throughout your whole life
and it informs everything you do and it transforms all
your neuroses it transforms your entire thinking process it transforms
your sexual proclivities and and it transforms your your food
addictions in and what other kind of addictions the Internet
addiction and other kind of stuff like that all in
one fell swoop that's way too convenient it just doesn't
work that way that's that's just a caricature of enlightenment
in reality and this is what very few spiritual teachers
talk about is that it's a lot more messy than
that people have awakenings of various degrees they glimpse different
facets of the truth there's different degrees of clarity to
what you're going to glimpse there's also degrees of how
long your glimpsing it you could glimpse it for a
few seconds you can glimpse it for a few minutes
you can glimpse it for a few days for a
few weeks I've read examples and I've researched this topic
a lot because I'm very careful about not deluding myself
here and making sure that I guide people properly as
well not to delude them as well because what you
don't want is you don't want to reach some sort
of places that say okay that's it I'm fully done
my journey is over I'm as developed as I can
be I know the full truth and that's it and
that's the end and now I'm gonna rest on my
laurels and now I'm gonna just like act as though
I'm as good as as anyone can ever be see
that's that's the whole thing we're trying to avoid I've
read examples of people who have had awakening experiences and
have been in a perpetual state of of like bliss
and rapture and this just like constant non-dual you know
state and they were there for a couple of years
and then they dropped out of it so that stuff
could happen so in reality this entire field is much
more complicated and there are many depths here and of
course I haven't a vagator all the depths so it's
difficult for me to talk about this stuff with total
authority because I don't feel like I've gone through all
the stages but then again be very careful here because
you might say oh well leo so then I don't
need to listen to you I'll just go listen to
somebody else well you see but be very careful whoever
else you go and listen to you still have to
take this point into consideration because how do you know
the depth of their attainment how do you know what
facets of the truth they have glimpsed and which ones
they haven't and how deeply did they glimpse them how
clear are they on them and then also how well
do they embody that in their own life personally not
just in their videos you see because it's easy to
shoot a video it's another thing how you actually embody
it when nobody's looking at you these are very different
things generally speaking what I've discovered through all my research
is that if you're talking about full complete utter enlightenment
where you have glimpsed all the facets of the truth
from different angles and all together at the same time
and you've integrated all of them and you embody them
let's say significantly within your own personal life and you've
had it rewire your entire mind your entire psyche and
your entire emotional system that's what I would call mastery
of this field mastery of non-duality if you set that
kind of expectation for what the word enlightenment means to
see the word enlightenment different people use it in different
ways and they never tell you what they mean by
the word enlightenment some people will mean utter complete mastery
moral perfection we'll see if you're using it in that
sense and very very few people meet that criteria including
many what you would consider masterful teachers they still fail
to meet that criteria there would be probably only a
handful of people in the whole world that would meet
that criteria and then of course so that might be
the most like the most strongest most difficult to satisfy
criteria for enlightenment or you could have much looser criteria
and just say well enlightenment is just like an awakening
experience and it comes it goes and then how much
of it you retain that varies too so that might
be the most like loosey-goosey definition of enlightenment and then
there's a whole spectrum in between so generally when I
say an enlightenment experience that's what I'm talking about I'm
talking about you becoming conscious of some facet of the
absolute truth different facets there's not a particular facet but
there's different facets and there's different depths and then you
know you could have a shallow enlightenment experience or a
deep in Limon experience it could be a temporary one
or it could be one that that sticks but still
see even the notion of its sticks you have to
question that as well because some people say all well
yeah leo so if it doesn't stick it's not real
but but see this assumes that sticking is again a
simple binary thing like it's stuck or it hasn't stuck
but if you just do the research into the literature
and you look at people who have these kinds of
experiences and you look at famous teachers and such you
see that it's not that simple either it's not just
that it's sticks or doesn't stick there's degrees of how
much it sticks how much it transforms you because what
you really mean by its sticks is that now it's
like permeating your entire life and they have different words
for this in different traditions like for example in in
Hindu traditions in Advaita Vedanta for example they have a
term called sahaja Samadhi and that might be the term
you would use for someone who is just so deeply
enlightened that it's like they're in a perpetual state of
it's like they're on a psychedelic 24/7 it's like everything
is Nandu all the time they're literally walking through the
world completely conscious that the entire thing is just an
illusion and this consciousness stays with them no matter what
they're doing you know it could be a it could
be running away from from a lion from a hungry
lion chasing them and they would supposedly still have this
this degree of consciousness so is that what I have
certainly not I don't make any you know I don't
I don't make any pretenses about that certainly not if
you want to reach something like that if that's what
you consider enlightenment then well you're looking at 20 30
40 years of of this journey of many many awakenings
of various degrees and just kind of blasting your mind
with these awakenings and just completely rewiring your entire psyche
everything such that you're in this like perpetual high all
the time you know and then there's like lower versions
of it as well there's different levels of Samadhi that
people talk about from different traditions you know in Zen
they have kensho they have Satori different levels of tensho
and Satori so at every every tradition has their own
way that they slice and dice and see that's what's
tricky about this is that it does depend on how
you slice and dice it in your own expectations in
your own definitions and most teachers when they talk about
these words like enlightenment or awakening or self-realization first of
all they just use these words the way that they
grew up using these words oftentimes they don't tell you
what their definitions are and then of course different teachers
use different definitions for precisely the same words so some
people might use the word enlightenment and awakening and so
realization interchangeably to mean the exact same thing without making
any finer distinctions and other teachers will say no no
no I make finer distinctions net I use the word
enlightenment for this thing here and I use the word
awakening for this slightly different version of enlightenment and I
use the word self-realization for like something like sahaja Samadhi
and most students because this is such a complicated topic
most students they come in very kind of simply simple
minded language they just assume Oh enlighten is just an
Enlightenment and then they just sort of buy these different
words and then they get confused or they they come
in and they're only coming in from one tradition or
one school so like they are only coming in from
Zen or they're only coming in from Buddhism or they're
only coming in from yoga or advisor and they don't
want to really study the broader field you don't want
to study other schools and so what happens and this
is a big danger that I see is that people
just develop a rather limited and narrow understanding of of
what this entire field is in reality this field is
much more complicated than it seems so what has happened
to me over the last couple of days after this
experience well of course the peak has come down you
even saw in the video towards the end of the
video already I wasn't really in any kind of peak
State it was just quite normal but of course that
continued to wind down and it was interesting for me
to see what would remain what would I keep from
the experience because sometimes you have these experiences and you
don't keep very much at all you lose all of
it which can be pretty depressing and sad in this
case it's interesting it was such a it was such
a deep experience that I felt like a lot of
the understanding that I got there um I still have
with me right now so for example if I just
stopped teaching for a second and if I just stand
here I can focus my mind on what I am
and my mind focuses in on sort of the nothingness
of empty space and I can focus in on that
and I'm I I know that I'm not the body
I know that I'm not this voice I also as
I'm looking at my physical surroundings there's not a shadow
of a doubt in my mind that I'm standing inside
of a physical universe this is clearly not a physical
universe and I know that without a shadow of a
doubt that this is consciousness I'm standing inside of consciousness
and that this entire thing is my self it's just
that see when you come down from the psychedelic what
happens in the psychedelic your consciousness is very fluid and
it's kind of wavy like this so it's easy to
see that the whole thing is consciousness when it's waving
like this for you but then as it congeals your
mind doesn't know how to connect that experience or that
knowing of the waviness of of all a physical reality
it doesn't understand how to how to ground that in
mundane experience like what then is mundane experience usually we
think of it as the physical world the universe but
see for me there's no physical world or physical universe
really it's a con that's just a concept there's no
physical brain within which psychedelics are acting there's no physical
brain within which these perceptions are getting rendered at least
to me these are these are silly ideas that I
can no longer subscribe to I've subscribed to them in
the past but you know the more conscious I become
the less I'm able to subscribe to them but still
you you can still get sucked into it like for
example over the last few days I've been especially careful
to be very mindful with everything that I'm doing because
one thing that this experience really taught me is that
everything is in the present moment everything that I need
all the lessons I need are right here I don't
need a trip to go somewhere to have an experience
of the absolute this is the absolute I'm inside the
absolute I just need to slow my mind down to
connect with it and of course I still have a
lot of habits old habits that are running inside of
me that I've been very mindful of over the last
couple of days where it's like you know if I'm
gonna go cook some dinner usually I you know I'm
very efficient I go quickly cook dinner right I'm not
really watching what I'm doing I'm just grabbing pans and
oil and this and that and cooking stuff up and
it is very quick and I'm I'm doing it mindlessly
and here over the last couple days I've been doing
it very slowly and very mindfully such that I'm able
to be conscious of the fact that that frying pan
is the absolute that oil is the absolute that knife
is the absolute this hand which is reaching for the
knife is me reaching for myself taking myself cutting an
onion or something the onion that I'm cutting is also
myself I'm cutting myself and if I'm like cutting an
apple I'm putting a piece of apple into my mouth
I'm being conscious of the fact that I'm I'm eating
myself literally literally so that was new to me and
that's something I've taken away and that's something that I'm
still maintaining Eve is even as I'm speaking right now
of course my entire mind and psyche didn't get completely
rewired and that was challenging so after you come down
from one of these Peaks of course usually your old
mind kicks in and this is gonna be true regardless
of whether you took a psychedelic or not your mind
is gonna kick back in and it's usually gonna have
the old loops that it had those grooves that you've
conditioned your mind with those are mostly still going to
be there so you'll notice your addictions coming up like
for example I was very conscious over the last few
days noticing my internet addictions coming up and I was
very mindful of that and very careful about that and
noticing my addictions to distract myself with with stimulation other
types of things with thoughts I like to think a
lot I'm very conceptual so I've been very mindful of
how conceptual I am and I've been noticing my mind
trying to conceptualize my experiences I've been trying to to
kind of let that go and trying to enter a
more about no mind state and I have noticed that
my ability to do that has increased but you know
some of those old addictions are still there and that
requires work and I've also been noticing my habitual emotional
reactions that I have both negative and positive ones I've
been noticing those as well and of course many of
those are still there and that's gonna require a lot
of work so if you're under the illusion that having
even a very deep and profound enlightenment experience while you're
meditating or self inquiring that that will change all of
your emotional reactions and turn you in some kind of
into some kind of Jesus like Saint in in one
day you're gonna be in a really in for a
rude awakening because that most likely is not going to
happen whatever kind of awakening experiences you have they will
require integration work and lots of follow-up work for the
full embodiment because the absolute is really independent of your
mind but your mind still has a lot of momentum
behind it it has a whole lifetime of all the
habitual stuff that you do so if you smoke if
you drink if you jerk off if you are addicted
to sex if you're addicted to the Internet if you're
addicted to food and you eat bad junk food chances
are even if you have a very deep enlightenment even
without psychedelics you're still gonna have those if you want
to get rid of those you're gonna have to work
very deliberately very mindfully to get rid of those of
course your awakening experience will help you a lot with
that and now sort of what I've been experienced the
last couple of days is that I've been using that
experience to help me reorganize my entire life to be
more mindful and more conscious and that's been very productive
I've been actually quite amazed at how productive that's been
and I want to continue to do that over the
next few weeks as I'm still integrating this now let
me get back to this point about psychedelics I've been
open and honest with you guys from the very beginning
since about a year and a half ago that my
intention with psychedelics was not just to to do one
or two trips and just have some fun the way
people do psychedelics no see what I'm doing is I
am a researcher and I'm a guinea pig I like
to test new ground that's sort of like I feel
like what I was born for is to blaze new
trails I don't like doing stuff that other people have
already done because I find it pointless if someone has
already written a book I don't want to rewrite the
same book if someone has already shot one kind of
video I don't want to shoot that same kind of
video so some people criticize me and say Olli oh
well you're so immature and you're so lacking in your
consciousness and in your mastery that why should I listen
to you when I can go and just like listen
to a Zen master because Leo you're talking about psychedelics
you know what it's like a Daleks you know that's
that's a corruption of enlightenment I want the traditional form
okay so here's the deal if you want a totally
traditional form of spirituality then by all means go join
a Zen monastery or go find yourself a yogi guru
in India or something like that you can find those
types of people there around and and and just follow
their path to the tea and that might work for
you but don't expect me to be offering you that
here that would just be redundant I'm not here to
be a traditional Zen master or a traditional yogi that's
not my role in this world my role is to
explore this field and to use my mind to discover
new things about this field that perhaps other people haven't
discovered before now you might say only oh that's so
arrogant of you because how how you know how deluded
must you be to think that you know something better
than the yogi or the Zen master well in my
experience I've already found and discovered things through my sort
of open-minded multi-perspective evil approach that that you're not gonna
learn from any Zen master or yogi because there are
pros and cons to every approach there are pros and
cons to just going doing strict traditionals and practice some
of the pros of it are that is it's very
well tested by time and there's not gonna be a
lot of surprises you kind of know what you're getting
into and if you stick with it to the tee
you've got a good chance of making some great progress
there on the other hand there's also a lot of
dangers ah you'll be shocked to discover that most people
who spend 10 20 years meditating in his end monastery
that they aren't enlightened I've actually been shocked to discover
that Zen teachers who have been ordained to teach and
have have have studied this stuff and practiced it for
ten twenty years that they have not yet become conscious
of some of the stuff that I've become conscious of
through my own unorthodox techniques what I offer is an
unorthodox way of doing personal development and spirituality my approach
is sort of a smorgasbord of everything you sample a
lot of stuff you experiment with yourself you don't take
any one perspective too seriously you don't put your eggs
all in one basket and there's pros and cons to
that one of the cons of that is that you
can easily just become a dabbler dabbling in a bunch
of stuff not going deep into anything but there's ways
to avoid that that danger you can you can both
do a smorgasbord of of the entire field and you
can also go deep into certain aspects and that's what
I've been doing lately I've been going deep into certain
things and and I've been getting some amazing results and
some of the things and techniques and methods that I
found and tools that I found have been really amazing
and I'm excited to share those with you because I
I don't see a lot of other teachers sharing them
because they teach usually Orthodox methods so if you want
Orthodox methods go go find those and stick with those
and find then you don't need actualize that org what
I offer is I offer something unorthodox and of course
there's rich risks to that but then again there's risks
to everything you run the risk of doing the standard
Zen traditional practice and never becoming enlightened in fact Mo's
n students will never become enlightened because quite frankly at
least in my opinion many of the Zen techniques are
not the best and most efficient techniques nor are they
appropriate for everybody for certain people Zen is perfect but
only for certain people how do you know if Xena
is perfect for you well in truth you don't know
not until you've invested a lot of time into it
which is why I like to dabble and stuff sample
a lot of stuff so that I can find what
will resonate with me what will resonate with my personality
what will resonate with my heart what will resonate with
the particular neuroses and problems that I have for example
a lot of people these days have a very particular
set of obstacles to enlightenment that teachers from 50 years
ago who are teaching today who grew up in in
a different generation don't really understand for example video games
television Internet addiction many teachers don't really understand the significance
of this these are new developments within culture which have
just come online in last 20 years which have rotted
out the minds of an entire generation of young people
so if you're in your 20s or 30s right now
your mind has been rotted out by video games television
and Internet to sense and smartphones too and Facebook and
all the social media stuff to such an extent that
you can't even sit down and enter access concentration on
the cushion so good luck doing your traditional vikas and
a retreat or some sort of Zen practice where they
expect you to be able to enter access concentration in
order to to achieve the results that you're trying to
achieve good luck getting a 20 year old kid who's
addicted to World of Warcraft or League of Legends to
succeed with that technique see but your traditional Zen master
he doesn't care about any of that he doesn't know
any of this and even if he does know about
it he's not gonna really alter his teaching because he's
committed to teaching Orthodox teaching so what I just wanted
to stress here is that there's a lot of nuance
and a lot of complexity to this field a lot
of pros and cons which should actually make total sense
if you think about it from the high level because
why are there so many spiritual traditions and why do
so many spiritual people disagree with each other precisely because
of this point because they are under estimating the depth
and breadth of this field they want this field to
just be simple the way there one little teaching or
tradition teaches them and that's just not the case the
fact is is that there are psychedelics the fact is
that there are there's technology you can use for enlightenment
there's a million different ways that you can trigger enlightenment
have different awakening experiences and different ways work for different
people and there's pros and cons to all these different
ways and what I've told you from from the beginning
is that with psychedelics my aim was to to research
this field not just a trip for fun once or
twice but to research this field because I'm always on
the lookout for new methods that can that can really
catalyze this process of personal development and spiritual development and
I think I found some great tools there and I'm
I'm just blown away personally at how effective these substances
have been in my own life for not just having
peak experiences but for for really transforming how I behave
on a daily basis I've been blown away at how
effective they are now that doesn't mean they're perfect for
you that doesn't mean they're perfect for everybody that doesn't
mean that my only path to enlightenment is through psychedelics
I also do yoga I also do Vipassana I also
do self inquiry I've done that over a thousand of
hours of this stuff I do meditation I do retreats
so I do a lot of stuff so my approach
is sort of hybrid I mix a lot of stuff
together and what I found personally in my own life
is that this produces an enormous results and it gets
you a level of understanding about this entire field and
about yourself and about human beings about personal development in
a way that you just can't get by sticking to
one orthodox tradition which is not to put down any
Orthodox traditions all right so I'm not trying to start
some non-duality wars here I'm not trying to say that
my way is better it's not better it's just a
different way and you have to decide which ways you
want to follow and personally I think the best way
you can make an informed decision is by sampling a
bunch of different things until you find something that really
resonates with you can psychedelics make you permanently enlightened that's
something of an open question that I'm still testing see
a lot of people will say no leo that's hogwash
it can't happen but when I listen to these people
what I'm hearing is I'm hearing Dogma I'm not hearing
them speaking from direct experience sure a lot of people
have tried psychedelics once or twice a couple of times
seven times whatever they've screwed around with it and they
say oh no it doesn't stick it doesn't work everybody
knows doesn't stick I don't buy that maybe that's true
but what I see is that there's a broad range
of a way that you can use psychedelics like any
tool you need to know how to use the tool
properly and what I've been sort of developing over the
last year is my own process for how to apply
psychedelics for massive growth within personal development and also within
enlightenment and I'm still testing that out and I'm not
fully sure where that's gonna lead me to maybe a
couple of years from now I'll come back and say
you know what that was a dead end guys doesn't
really work I wasted a lot of my time and
energy and I found that it's just it's not worth
it let's just go do traditional Zen instead maybe all
come away with that conclusion in the end but so
far that's not the conclusion that I'm being led towards
just the opposite I'm feeling like there's a lot of
potential in fact I'm I'm shocked at why nobody is
talking about the potential the true potential of these substances
I see that people use these substances in in very
childish ways they don't get anything that sticks they don't
understand what they're really experiencing they're not able to articulate
it for me what I experienced when I use these
substances when I use a real serious method for the
application of these substances what I find is that I'm
able to access levels of consciousness that I only see
a handful of the most enlightened of the most enlightened
of the most enlightened masters talking about and these masters
have dedicated 40 years of their life to accessing these
levels of consciousness I'm seeing that I can access those
on a weekly basis and to me that's a that's
a remarkable discovery which I wish someone told me about
ten years ago it certainly would have completely revolutionized my
life and so I feel like even though I run
some risks talking about this stuff I feel like this
is sort of like my role I stumbled upon it
and therefore I need to share it with people and
then how people interpret it and react to it well
that's really out of my hands I have to just
make sure that I'm trying to be honest and authentic
about it and and to to be truthful about both
the pros and the cons and the limitations and the
the potential here so am i deluded well you have
to judge for yourself this question of who is deluded
and who isn't that's not such an easy question to
answer don't be so quick to think that your Zen
master isn't deluded in some fashion don't be so quick
to think that you're not deluded for judging somebody else
for being deluded see this is a very tricky subject
the broader your research goes the more you will see
how tricky this subject is and just how non-trivial it
is to determine which teacher or teaching is diluted or
not diluted or which one is deeper than another one
so the reality here is that this stuff is very
nuanced and it's tricky so the key and really the
solution here is very simple if you want to boil
all this down to one simple solution in a nutshell
it's this don't go thinking you've got to the end
of the rainbow you have some deep experience whether it's
on psychedelics or not great but don't think you're done
it's not that simple it's never that simple I think
that even many people who follow the traditional paths to
enlightenment still get stuck they don't reach the highest levels
because they don't take all these points that I'm talking
about into consideration so if you want a fail-safe a
safety valve against delusion it's simply this pursue whatever method
you're gonna pursue whatever schools you want to pursue whatever
techniques you want to pursue have whatever experiences you're gonna
have but at the end of the day always be
open that there could be more and that's how I
am ensuring that I don't delude myself it's not that
I can guarantee that I will never delude myself it's
that I'm always continuing my journey which means that any
delusions that are here will get autocorrected over time because
I'm always reading a new book listening to a new
video considering a new possibility listening to a comment that
tells me that maybe a maybe you're missing some element
here that you didn't think of I'm thinking about that
I'm always keeping myself open to feedback and to new
perspectives see and I never tell myself okay I've made
it now it's it that's it I'm done that was
never I'm I was never under that illusion when I
began actualized that org my my assumption was that I'll
be continuing this journey for the rest of my life
it's never going to really end and that's still sort
of my expectation is that it just continues forever because
the best teachers that I've interacted with that I've studied
with I see them continuing to learn I see them
still reading books I see them still doing their practices
after 40 years I see them telling me hey keep
going there's more there's more there's more so that's really
it you just got to remember there's more and not
to rest on your laurels that's it that's the only
thing here so make sure you don't get the idea
that somehow I'm resting on my laurels and that now
Leo claims to be fully no I don't claim to
be enlightened at all I don't claim to be fully
enlightened or partially enlightened I don't want to play that
game that doesn't really interest me what interests me is
the profound experiences that I'm able to have how consistently
I'm able to have them and how much they're able
to transform my life that's what interests me and so
hopefully that gives you a little bit of a context
of where I was coming from with that last video
and so that you can interpret it a little bit
more properly it was amazing the day afterwards I felt
like my understanding of personal development had doubled because everything
I knew before was again recontextualized and concentrated I actually
felt like in that experience I was able to sort
a lot of the wheat from the chaff I was
able to see like okay what are the keys to
personal development the keys to enlightenment what are the keys
to living the kind of life that you want to
live the best kind of life possible and all of
those will reveal to me so I'll be talking a
lot more about them in the future I feel like
I'm able to guide people much better now and I'm
able to also I feel like motivate people into this
journey better as well because I know I know exactly
what you're missing I know exactly what you really want
in your life and why you're not getting it and
a lot of this was revealed to me in a
very deep way over the last couple of days I've
been integrating and thinking about this awakening experience that I
had a big component of this that's lacking in everybody's
life is authenticity this was really revealed to me in
a powerful way I felt like I broke through this
inauthenticity barrier and that's one of the reasons I felt
like I needed to publish also that video is because
that's helping me work through my own inauthenticity that's something
I faced my own life a lot is I felt
very inauthentic for most of my life I've acted very
and authentically lying to myself manipulating in subtle ways because
in the back of my mind I'm always afraid of
what people think of me and how people judge me
and how I look you know am i doing the
right things am I gonna get ostracized and all this
and one of the things I learned from this experience
is that what you really want in your life is
you want a hundred percent authenticity if you want to
boil all person development down to that you can that's
a good way to look at it move towards a
hundred percent authenticity whatever that means and then you have
to go face all the fears and challenges that come
along with becoming a hundred percent authentic in all your
relationships with all your communications with all your thoughts that
requires a complete a completely different orientation to life than
you've had before because generally our orientation is one of
protecting ourselves defending our ego which is what creates a
lot of inauthenticity but the reason I say you what
you really want is 107 authenticity is because it feels
so good people say what's the point of life what's
the point of personal the point is to feel good
feel good about I feel how amazing this is every
last couple of mornings that I've been waking up I
was just like opening my eyes are a little groggy
I get through the rockiness but then it's like it's
amazing I'm inside of a living miracle and my job
is to be conscious of that every single moment as
much as I can of course there's a lot of
obstacles to that there's work there's relationship there's emotional problems
all this sort of stuff your past neuroses and bad
habits so authenticity something I'll be talking more about in
the future and showing you how you can move towards
100% authenticity as I also try to do that and
demonstrate that in my own life another key element that
I became aware of is the significance of fear overcoming
fear as a core pillar of of all personal development
overcoming fear facing your fears head-on and using your heart
the power of love to break through all your fears
and that's a really powerful technique of which I'm gonna
be experimenting more with right now in my life and
I'll be sharing ways for how you can do that
for yourself in the future and we'll be talking a
lot more about fear we'll be talking a lot more
about the power of the heart and the power of
love and what what love really is we'll talk about
that I was also made aware of the power of
radical honesty how powerful honesty can be as a technique
for personal development we're very rarely honest with other people
and also with our own selves you're not even honest
with yourself it's hard for you to even look at
the truth because the truth disturbs you so much it
irritates you emotionally it makes you uncomfortable that's because that's
something that needs to be cultivated self honesty needs to
be cultivated in a radical way where every single day
you open yourself up a little bit more to the
truth too painful bitter stinging truths and you let those
sting you they sting your ego you see the only
thing being stung by the truth is your ego which
is that which is inauthentic within you so let it
sting you and slowly kill that ego every single day
and that's something that was a huge lesson for me
from this experience because for a long time I sort
of thought about this enlightenment journey as having these big
awakening experiences and it is about that that's very important
but also what was shown to me here is that
when you have this big awakening experience then you bring
it back down to your mundane level and reality and
you notice that there is no difference at all between
the two and that actually all these opportunities are being
presented to you every single day every single hour in
your life you're being presented with little opportunities for either
killing off your ego suffocating it or aggrandizing it and
expanding it and this is where this this very important
principle comes to mind of authentic suffering there's two types
of suffering there's authentic suffering and inauthentic suffering inauthentic suffering
is what most people do because they're trying to avoid
authentic suffering so think of it this way imagine a
diagram where we have one point over here one point
over here in a straight line going from point A
to point B point a is your birth point B
is your death the entire point of life is to
go from A to B and there's a straight line
going from A to B and that line is you
going straight towards truth death is truth I'm not talking
about your physical death of your body I'm talking about
the death of the self the shortest distance between being
born as a self and dying as a self is
truth that's the only thing that stands in the way
but do most people take that shortest route of course
not what do they do they take a very circuitous
spirally route like this see because they can't stand the
truth it burns them too much so what they do
instead is they come up with all sorts of excuses
for how not to suffer through the the legitimate suffering
of of opening yourself up more to truth that's legitimate
authentic suffering they find other ways to suffer like they
go have sex indiscriminately they go drink booze they go
you know they start chasing money they they have kids
even though they don't really want them but they have
kids anyways because you know they're having sex too much
and they're eating bad food so it's and they're suffering
through all that and then they wonder why does my
life suck so much why am I so depressed well
it's because you're not taking the straight direct path to
truth you're taking this long circuitous route and you're just
trying to stall out the clock until what until your
physical death comes so that when your physical death comes
you have no more time to be conscious your last
moments will be your death the death of the self
and your physical death for most people are going to
be the exact same point and that turns out to
be a terrible way to live it's gonna be a
terrible way to go out instead what you want is
you want to move this point up closer so that
you die the self dies long before the body dies
then what happens is that you live for the rest
of your life 30 40 50 years you can live
being conscious of infinity everywhere of the miracle of life
and then your life is a miracle it's a living
miracle it's amazing you're happy no matter what it's amazing
but to do that you need to stop this this
circling around you know eating buckets of ice cream and
and watching porn on the internet and doing all this
sorts of stuff which is a distraction and go head-on
into legitimate suffering legitimate suffering is the suffering that you
encounter when you face the truth in whatever way and
you can face the truth a little bit each day
in your life just face the truth with your relationship
face the truth with your own physical body how you
feel about it face the truth about your financial situation
face the truth about all the stuff you've been procrastinating
on see most people are procrastinating so much in their
life why is that because of this dynamic because procrastination
is not wanting to face some legitimate suffering and so
we invent distractions and that's where addictions come from this
is huge right here I hope you're taking mental notes
another key element that I was really made aware of
from this awakening experience is the importance of no mind
working towards a state of no-mind shutting off all your
thoughts as you're cooking as you're showering as you're sitting
and relaxing even as you're watching television you suppress your
thoughts your monkey chatter you suppress it suppress it suppress
it until you're getting into this state of no-mind that's
challenging to do that's basically what meditation is for but
I was really made aware of the importance of no
mind because ultimately you want to get to a state
where you're in no mind for most of the day
and if you think that enlightenment alone will make that
happen very unlikely very unlikely you have to work separately
additionally to your enlightenment experiences to get to this no
mind requires putting a lot of emphasis on minute by
minute mindfulness practice which is something I really am starting
to appreciate more and more I understand why the Buddhists
stress mindfulness so much even more so a lot of
times than having a big mind-blowing awakening experience they stress
mindfulness it seems very simple and boring and it is
until you have one of these huge awakening experiences and
then you realize oh this is the absolute if I'm
not mindful of the absolute right here then what the
hell am i doing I'm looking for it somewhere else
when it's right here another big thing that happened for
me personally during this awakening experience is that I had
a real powerful vision for how I want to live
my life and that is devoting myself to selfless living
I want to live selflessly that is the best kind
of life that's possible to live and so contrary to
what a lot of people say for me the more
awakening experiences I have the more my passion increases for
selfless living the more my passion increases for for sharing
these teachings with the world that's just me I don't
know how it is for you maybe for you you're
gonna become a nihilist and you're not gonna want to
do anything you lose all your passions that's possible but
personally I think that if your passion is grounded in
your heart to begin with that passion will not get
extinguished by these awakenings it'll actually get strengthened but if
your passion is grounded in ego then those certainly will
tend to get extinguished extinguished but that's actually what you
want that's what you call spiritual purification that's where your
deepest growth comes from your your passions need to transition
from being egoic hello passions to being deep divine passions
passions that are much larger than yourself that involve the
entire universe not just your little self your little family
your little group of friends or your little company or
something like that so what you're gonna see over the
next year is hopefully I'm gonna be able to follow
through on this vision and you should start to see
me embodying more of this living a selfless sort of
lifestyle that's what I'll be working on nandu ership was
another huge facet that was revealed to me what you
need to become more conscious of is the fact that
you're not actually in control of anything in this life
every single word coming out of your mouth every single
single thought you're having is completely inevitable and couldn't be
otherwise I am NOT in control of what I'm saying
here to you this is being fueled by a higher
source and what I need to do is just purify
myself of my own personal [ __ ] my own
personal lies and deceptions so that I can be a
better vehicle for this divine force working through me I'm
conscious right now that God is looking through my eyes
that's what it is that's what your entire visual field
is your visual field is God looking through your eyes
and every little motion you make it a little scratch
you make on your face all of that is God
working through you it's just a question of are you
conscious of it are you surrendering yourself to nandu ership
or are you struggling and fighting see what you really
want is you want your life to be effortless isn't
that true you want it to be completely as effortless
as possible how do you do that start practicing it
the way that you get effortless is by relinquishing do
ership this illusion that you really have a choice about
things you don't of course you could practice it a
little bit every day in your life that's good but
then you also need to have the big awaking experiences
to realize that all [ __ ] yeah you're this
isn't just a practice this is like absolute truth there's
no self to be doing any doer ship the universe
is acting of its own accord through itself without anybody
in control the more you start to notice that that's
the ultimate place that you want to be living from
life is so much easier when you're not tricking yourself
into thinking that it's all you know all the pressures
on you to be in control of everything the fact
is you don't have control but you're afraid to give
up control that's the egos whole agenda is to to
maintain this grip and control over your life because it
tells itself that hey if we don't if we don't
keep this control then everything is gonna fly apart and
everything the shit's gonna hit the fan that's not true
but it's a very very powerful fear and by no
means have I overcome that fear that's something I'm gonna
be working on on a daily basis another thing that
was made aware to me is the importance of slowing
down my life people these days including myself live such
fast paced lives why is that because they're unconscious it's
a sea it's a it's a self feeding feedback loop
you live a fast-paced life because you're unconscious to begin
with but then the fast pace at which you live
your life makes you even more unconscious it deepens your
unconsciousness which makes you think that all the problem with
my life is that I'm not accomplishing enough I'm not
doing enough fast enough so you live an even faster
paced life and see it becomes a vicious circle the
counterintuitive move is to simplify your life minimize your life
and to really slow down over the last few days
I've been slowing myself down in a sense doing less
work but what I've actually been achieving is is more
work and more satisfaction from my work because when I
slow myself down able to get into the into the
flow and into the zone whereas when I'm doing everything
quickly I'm just doing it to get to the next
thing to the next thing to the next thing and
I'm not really appreciating any of it such that really
I'm just living with one foot in the grave as
they say because I'm always like living in the future
now right now I'm not able to appreciate what's right
there so I've been slowing down my life and I
have to be very mindful not to speed it back
up because part of the problem with passion having all
this passion which I'm filled with passion these days more
and more but I had to be careful because if
I become so passion I start doing all this stuff
then I get disconnected with the truth and with my
authentic self so I have to just kind of like
put the brakes on very consciously and the last thing
that I'll mention here as far as insights that I
got is I got a lot of insight into why
people fail with enlightenment what their obstacles are like it
just becomes crystal clear to me why people are not
able to reach these degrees of consciousness and I'm not
just talking about people who take psychedelics I'm talking about
people who are hardcore meditators who've been meditating for 10
20 30 years or doing self inquiry for 20 years
and still haven't become conscious of some of the things
that I've become conscious of for example I understand why
and I'll be talking more about that in the future
but one very big obstacle is you actually think that
there is such a thing as a physical world a
physical universe and you think that in it is something
other than physical death very few enlightenment teachers tell you
just balls-to-the-wall flat-out that enlightenment is your physical death you
will physically die in this process that's what all spirituality
is about your physical death you're slowly moving towards your
physical death and if you make any kind of distinction
between ego death and physical death you ain't gonna experience
the deepest levels of enlightenment you ain't because at the
deepest levels of enlightenment there is no world there is
no universe there is no reality there are no other
people and there is no you and you're [ __
] dead and if that scares you good it should
if that gives you trepidation about whether this path is
for you good you need to face that trepidation that's
the thing you got to work through so that you
open yourself up to the the peak nosov awakening that
can happen a lot of people take psychedelics but they
don't experience the kinds of things that I experienced on
psychedelics and people take huge doses of psychedelics way more
than I take and I don't see them experiencing the
same things that I am experiencing on very small doses
why is that that's because they still have all these
concepts in the back of their mind of their being
a brain of their being a physical universe of their
being physical people of their being such things as time
and space and all this sort of stuff so yeah
when you have that as your context and then you
take a psychedelic then what do you get you just
get a cool hallucination it's nifty it's fun it's weird
it blows your mind for a couple hours then you
come back down and everything is back to normal because
the context hasn't changed of anything you didn't break down
the things that the psychedelic was supposed to you to
break down so this is just a tip of the
iceberg of all the stuff that I learned I don't
have time to go into all that I'll be sharing
more of those insights with you in in future episodes
I'll be sprinkling them in throughout in general I feel
like my entire understanding of personal development and enlightenment as
as these two fields has has really deepened and I'm
really excited about that I'm really happy that I have
this deeper understanding because now I feel like I can
I can teach better I can guide people better more
directly to what they're really after rather than just kind
of like leading them around in circles so what's next
for me well in a sense not much has changed
I'm still continuing with with creating videos every week I'm
still continuing with actualized or I'm still passionate about it
partially in my own life I'm gonna be adopting and
working hard every day to implement these different key pillars
that I that I mentioned here I'm gonna be working
really hard on my own authenticity I can already feel
that in this episode I'm being way more authentic than
I was ever able to be in in Prior episodes
because that was a real breakthrough moment that I had
on on that video it wasn't it wasn't acting it
wasn't me being overly dramatic something really shifted in me
more so than just having a trip I've had regular
trips that wasn't a regular trip and and the fact
that I filmed it in the process of filming it
and putting my own ass on the line something additional
shifted in me generally what I noticed is that the
more I'm able to share with people all these ideas
the more I open myself up to the truth and
to living the kind of lifestyle that I want to
live this this selfless lifestyle for me I don't this
is not true for everybody you know some people just
want to get enlightened and that's it and they don't
want to teacher share with other Seth that's totally cool
but for me personally I know deep down inside that
for me my own awakening is deeply connected to my
life purpose and to sharing in the contribution that I
have in the world these two things are very integrally
linked for me so it feels like almost as though
God is not letting me just go pursue my own
enlightenment by myself in a sense that would be simple
I could just go sit in the woods for a
few months and you know just work completely on myself
no cameras no nothing that would be in a sense
easier but what I'm feeling is like my mind is
not letting me do that what it's what it's like
it's what it's telling me is like you got to
share and bring other people along with you while you're
doing it and as you're sharing that's when everything is
going to open up within me for my own personal
awakening so the two will come together not separately at
least for me that's how it feels I might be
wrong about that but that's kind of like what it
feels like and so I'm going with it because that
feels that feels legitimate to me so what's next for
me is I actually have two solo meditation retreats already
planned and booked for the next couple of months I'm
actually doing two retreats in Hawaii they're gonna be an
eight day long retreat and like a ten day long
retreat one is coming in February another one is coming
in April I'm really excited about these two I will
take a camera with me and I will record those
just like I did with my Arizona solo retreat which
is quite a while it goes like eight eight or
nine months ago so I'm really excited about that I
actually will be doing a lot of solar retreats this
year I plan to do probably at least four of
them and cool location so I've got two locations in
Hawaii I've got cabins booked in the middle of the
rainforest it's gonna be pretty awesome I mean there all
by myself so I'm excited to show to show that
setting and to show myself really working hard on these
retreats I feel like I have a lot of material
to work on there and then later in the year
I will probably do two more solo retreats in cool
places maybe in Costa Rica maybe in in the Seattle
area I'm trying to pick locations with a lot of
beautiful nature and trees and rainforests and pine forest stuff
like that so um it's really nice and beautiful so
we'll see how that turns out I'm getting prepared for
these trips so stay tuned for those and regular videos
of course will still be coming out and what you'll
generally see over the next year is you're gonna see
a big transformation coming for me I can feel it
you should start to see me becoming more authentic you
should start to see me becoming more conscious there will
be many more awakening experiences happening this year I anticipate
dozens of them because I have found methods for creating
awakening experience very consistently and very deep and profound ways
so you'll be seeing that and and we'll see I
also have some plans on maybe doing a tour and
meeting people more face-to-face because one of the things that
I was shown actually in my previous awakening experience which
I didn't film I didn't tell anybody about it silently
in that one I also had a vision and in
that vision it showed me that really I need to
to test myself more in front of people it's one
thing to deliver these teachings in front of a camera
I've gotten pretty good at that and pretty comfortable with
that and the next level for me is interacting more
with people face to face and I feel like that's
kind of like where all this is pushing me towards
so this year in 2018 I will probably do at
least one or two or maybe more depending on how
it goes I've actualized that org videos with actual people
in the audience and then I'll record those maybe post
them on YouTube and I'll probably start with the west
coast of the United States and and then we'll see
where that goes from there so exciting stuff is happening
I'm really just a guinea pig I want to be
upfront that I'm I'm not a master I'm a student
and I'm always growing and learning and the whole point
of actualized org and the reason I started releasing that
video is because I keep getting this calling from the
universe to make myself more authentic make my videos more
authentic put myself out there on the line so I
have nothing to hide purify myself document what the real
journey of this work looks like not just the theory
of it but how it actually looks for a human
being to be going through this and that of course
means making mistakes sometimes getting deluded sometimes getting overly excited
about something sometimes you know going down a wrong road
guess what that's gonna happen to you too it probably
already has so I'm not here pretending like I'm perfect
I just want to document the journey for me what
really excites me is imagine if you took someone like
the Buddha before he became the Buddha before he even
left his palace you know he would he was a
total noob and he didn't even know about meditation take
him then when he was addicted to food and to
sex and all this stuff give him a camera and
then record him going through his whole seven-year journey or
however long it took him to get to his enlightenment
and then record even after his enlightenment record what's happening
with him that's real that's something that's that's more valuable
than just having scriptures because scriptures are idealized they don't
tell you all the dirty details all the delusions all
the dead ends all the problems all the all the
all the warts and all that happens throughout this process
this this spiritual process this the self-actualization process there really
wanted the same thing it's all about facing your own
inner demons facing your own neuroses and finding individualized solutions
to conquer that for every human being it's going to
be unique that's why I don't really resonate with these
schools or traditions these Orthodox Zen or yoga or Hindu
or vine or whatever type of tradition or Christianity because
that assumes that you're like a cookie cutter human being
that assumes that every human being has the same problems
the same inner demons to overcome not at all see
you need techniques and methods and teachings which go directly
to your inner demons to your own problems and limitations
which are unique to you because you know what when
you were a child you were abused in your unique
particular way you were bullied you were ridiculed you were
sexually abused you were you know beaten with a with
a with a stick or you were laughed at in
school or you know who knows what happened to you
which has made you defensive you have erected all this
armor against the world not allowing yourself to feel to
be authentic to express yourself not allowing yourself to connect
to your heart to be vulnerable and put yourself out
on the line and what this whole journey is about
is about breaking down all that armor all your personal
fears but your Zen master doesn't know what those are
your yogi and your guru doesn't know what those are
all that they can give you is they can give
you a sort of standardized mainstreamed method and you can
go try to apply that method and maybe it'll work
for you but chances are actually it won't it won't
be a good fit because that yogi or that guru
or that Zen master he had a different set of
problems he had a different personality type he had a
different brain type he grew up in a different era
in a different generation so he doesn't face your problems
you know a man faces very different problems on this
path than a woman which is not to say that
that we're totally separate and it's not to say that
you can't learn something as a woman from a man
teacher or as a man from a woman teacher you
certainly can it's just that you know there are there
are important differences there the feminine version of this path
is gonna be different than the masculine version of this
path the introverted version is gonna be different from the
extroverted version of this path people who are really into
love and emotions very emotional intuitive people your path is
gonna be very different from cold hard rational people and
I'm just excited about the whole thing I'm excited about
exploring the whole field so that no matter who comes
to me I can say oh you're this type of
person and you have to assign a problem okay then
this technique will be the best for you go give
it a shot it's like oh you're a different type
or you're a woman and you've got a sexual history
of sexual abuse and you've got and you're very emotional
and you're very intuitive and you're very love oriented okay
so you need a different this Zen technique is not
gonna work for you need this other technique go try
this technique here that'll probably work for you so I
hope you see where I'm coming from now all right
that's it I'm out of here please click the like
button for me and come check out actualize that org
as usual my website I got my blog I got
a forum where you can get help and emotional support
for this journey the life purpose course don't think the
life purpose course becomes irrelevant with enlightenment just the opposite
just the opposite you're in Lima is gonna be a
lot easier when you get your life purpose into shape
when you're working a dead-end job in a career that
makes enlightenment so much harder so much harder because it's
not authentic life purpose is all about how do you
create an authentic career if your career is really authentic
then enlightenment will not butt heads with your career but
if you're like a lawyer or some you know sleazy
politician or something good luck pursuing enlightenment while at the
same time you're using this inauthentic career to fund your
entire life probably ain't gonna go so well and the
Booklist make sure you check that as well alrighty I'm
out of here stay with me for more you
