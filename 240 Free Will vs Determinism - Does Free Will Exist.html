            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/fecQUZ-ehKQ' target='_blank'>Free Will vs Determinism - Does Free Will Exist</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Free Will vs. Determinism Debate</b>: The discussion about free will has been ongoing for thousands of years, with arguments from both the determinist side and the free will side. The determinist argument suggests that the universe operates in a mechanical, predictable manner, with everything happening due to preceding causes. On the other hand, the free will argument posits that individuals can make choices and decisions because it feels like they have the capability to do so. Gura claims that this debate is vital to address due to the deep territory surrounding topics like enlightenment, consciousness, and mindfulness on his platform, Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Claim of No Free Will</b>: Leo Gura asserts that free will does not exist and individuals do not have control over thoughts, actions, habits, desires, successes, failures, or emotions. He attributes this lack of control to the absence of a self that can have control. This claim challenges the latent assumption in the free will vs. determinism debate that there is a self who could have free will.
</li><li><b>Demonstration of No Free Will</b>: Gura emphasizes that his claim is not just belief, but an empirically verifiable fact that can be demonstrated. Through self-observation and experiential perception, individuals can witness that they have no control over their lives. Instead of control, everything in one's life operates in a mechanical, orderly manner. Gura cautions that understanding this concept is complex and listening to a part of the explanation could lead to misinterpretation.
</li><li><b>Self-Observation Practice</b>: Leo Gura explains that around two years ago, he changed his beliefs about free will after engaging in self-observation practices. Through observing his thoughts in real-time, he discovered that he could not stop his thoughts, which challenged the notion of free will. He suggests exercises like timed meditation or self-inquiry, where individuals ask themselves questions about their nature, reality, and thoughts. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Monkey Mind</b>: According to Leo, the minds incessant generation of thoughts is likened to a monkey mind." Acknowledging that the mind is constantly functioning and is challenging to halt can be a hint towards understanding the absence of free will. However, to fully grasp this concept, one needs to delve deeper into self-observation. 
</li><li><b>Ego as Illusion</b>: Through self-observation, one can realize that the self or the ego is an illusion. This eases understanding that free will does not exist since the egos assumed control over actions and thoughts is discredited. Importantly, Gura emphasizes that this realization should not be taken as a new dogma; instead, it should be personally explored and verified.
</li><li><b>Verifiable Fact about Free Will</b>: Leo insists that the absence of free will is not a mere belief or assumption, but a fact that can be empirically verified. Such verification requires dedicated self-observation and introspection to fully understand and accept this concept. He directs those interested in further exploration on enlightenment and no free will to his other videos and content on Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Absence of Free Will</b>: Even after personal examination and contemplation on thought processes, Leo asserts that humans have no control over their thoughts and actions. The concept of a self or ego is held to be an illusion. Instead, humans are believed to be complexly distributed systems without centralized control. What we perceive as the "self" is an intertwining of mental images, auditory labels, and bodily sensations. He suggests that thoughts do not rise from an internal source but appear out of nowhere due to a multitude of influences and external stimuli. This leads to the disquieting conclusion that humans do not exercise free will in their actions and decisions, but are results of highly complex, ordered systems.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness and Self-Observation</b>: Leo emphasizes the value of developing mindfulness, the ability to perceive and understand what is happening in the present moment with your thoughts, emotions, and body sensations. The technique involves careful and systematic self-observation, expected to reveal that actions do not originate from the "self" but occur automatically. However, overcoming the illusion of free will and the existence of the self requires persistence, as it involves extensive observation and can be emotionally challenging.
</li><li><b>Complex System and Illusion of Control</b>: Leo speaks of the human body and the brain as intricate systems far beyond simple mechanical entities. Consisting of around 37 trillion cells, the human body is not controlled by a centralized entity, further undermining the notion of free will. This signifies that our actions, behaviors, habits and preferences are not simple, conscious decisions made by us, but arise from a complex and highly ordered system. The understanding of one's existence needs to extend beyond our ego or sense of self and acknowledge the multifaceted nature of our body and mind.  
</li><li><b>Concept of Self</b>: When addressing the idea of the "self", Leo posits that it is largely imagined  a complex interplay of mental images, auditory labels, and body sensations. This mental construct of the self is what is attributed to have free will, even though it doesn't physically exist. To challenge this notion of self, one must commit to careful and persistent self-observation, breaking down the illusion of the self, and accepting that our thoughts and actions are not really under our own control.
</li><li><b>Understanding "Emergent Phenomenon" in the Context of Free Will</b>: Leo Gura discusses the complex functioning of the human body, consisting of around 37 trillion cells, as an example of an emergent phenomenon, where when individual units combine together, they can create unique, unexpected outcomes. He likens this to molecules of hydrogen and oxygen combining to create water that possess radically different properties than the individual elements. By deeper extension, he suggests that human beings, too, are complex high-order emergent phenomena.
</li><li><b>Implications for Decision-Making</b>: Gura posits that when we make decisions, all 37 trillion cells in our bodies participate in the process, contradicting the notion that an individual self within us is solely responsible for our choices. He emphasizes that we are inseparable from the rest of the natural world, indicating that every particle in the universe influences every cell in our bodies, even when deciding between simple choices, such as food.
</li><li><b>Role of Past Experiences and Environment</b>: Gura underscores the influence of one's past experiences, cultural exposure, genetics, health history, education, relationships, and more on the mind's preferences and decisions. He states that these factors collectively shape our choices, providing a nuanced perspective on decision-making.
</li><li><b>The Brain's Information Processing Capability</b>: Gura marvels at the staggering amount of information our brains can process, the large majority of which occurs outside our conscious awareness. He highlights this point using examples of automatic bodily functions, like the heart beating and the lungs breathing, which occur independently of our will.
</li><li><b>Intelligence and Creativity Without Free Will</b>: Gura suggests that high-level functionalities we typically credit to a self or free will, such as creativity or problem-solving, could just be complex outcomes of the intricate systems within us. He cites the intelligence displayed by the immune system in distinguishing harmful viruses and bacteria, suggesting that we need to question our assumption that nature lacks innate intelligence.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Need for Free Will</b>: Gura urges viewers to consider the possibility that the body and brain, on their own, are capable of executing extremely complex and smart actions without the guidance of an individual self wielding free will. He suggests this idea is contested because the self often takes credit for intelligent outcomes, while ascribing 'dumb' or unconscious processes to the body's automatic functioning.
</li><li><b>Concept of Free Will and Higher Order Decisions</b>: Leo Gura suggests the same system that is responsible for our intrinsic, automatic bodily functions, such as processing viruses or urine in kidneys, could be responsible for higher order decisions like who to marry, what to eat, or when to work out. This challenges the concept of free will and encourages observation of one's actions and behaviours.
</li><li><b>Emergence of Ego and Conscious Behaviours</b>: Leo suggests the ego, which we consider as 'us', is not an input into the system, but is an output. The illusion of control is created when a thought arises at the same time as an action (like moving a finger), leading to the perception of control. 
</li><li><b>Google as an Analogy for Ego</b>: The output of Google as a search engine does not create Google; rather, it is the product of thousands of employees working millions of hours. Similarly, the individual or ego does not produce the cells in the body, it is the cells in the body that produce the 'ego' or the high order decisions. 
</li><li><b>Addressing Objections about Spirituality and Machine-like Nature</b>: Leo argues that accepting one's machine-like nature can lead to a smoother life. He elaborates that spirituality and spirit are not negated by accepting oneself as a machine; instead, spirituality and enlightenment is the recognition that there is no free will.
</li><li><b>Challenges of Accepting the Absence of Free Will</b>: Significant challenges to accepting the concept of no free will include: strong illusion of free will, strong resistance from the ego, realizing being wrong one's entire life considering you had control, societal norms and beliefs refuting the concept of free will, and misunderstanding the implications of no free will.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Spirituality and Self Control</b>: Leo addresses the misconception that enlightened individuals possess a higher degree of self-control hence free will. Enlightened individuals have simply surrendered the 'self' and learnt to flow with life in harmony. The perceived self-control is an illusion stemming from misunderstanding.
</li><li><b>Zen Masters, Yogis, and the Absence of Free Will</b>: Zen masters and yogis have achieved enlightenment through self-observation, realizing that there is no such thing as a self and no such thing as control. This surrender to the idea of no free will eliminates internal suffering and struggle, allowing them to flow effortlessly with life, creating the appearance of immense self-discipline and rigor.
</li><li><b>Responsibility vs Free Will and the Journey of Personal Development</b>: Despite the lack of free will, personal development still requires taking 100% responsibility. This process, targeted at different audience levels, involves individuals initially developing a strong ego, taking full responsibility for their lives, and then to surrender control completely and transcend the ego.
</li><li><b>Creativity as an Appearance of Spontaneous Control</b>: Despite appearances of spontaneous control in creative activities, the creative process occurs without intervention from an individual's ego. The ideas and inspiration aren't coming from the individual, but appearing to them. These ideas seem almost magical in their spontaneity, highlighting a disconnect from the individual's control.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding Free Will through Success Story Misattribution</b>: Even in cases of drastic personal change and success such as remarkable weight loss, control and personal accomplishment are misattributed. The motivation and hard work that culminated in success did not originate from the individual's free will but occurred naturally. 
</li><li><b>The Flawed Notion of Stopping Effort due to Absence of Free Will</b>: A fundamental misconception is the thought that the absence of free will means one should stop trying. In fact, the actions we take, including ongoing efforts and work, are driven by the natural processes of our biology, not the exercise of free will.
</li><li><b>Free Will and Ambition</b>: Leo explains that whether someone decides to be lazy or to start a company and work hard, both paths are not chosen by the individuals themselves but by their bodies and brains. He argues that ambition can be relentless, driving individuals until they physically cannot continue, and this is a force, not free will at play. 
</li><li><b>Free Will and Enlightenment</b>: Leo discusses the misconception that enlightenment can be chosen, stating that as there is no individual "self" to become enlightened, there is no choice that can be made. Enlightenment is the realization of the absence of the self and free will.
</li><li><b>Free Will and Negative Reactions</b>: He acknowledges that the concept of no free will can initially seem depressing for the ego, likening it to a corrupt politician being held accountable for their actions. The ego, built on deception, is oppressed by the realization of no free will. Leo asserts that admitting to this false perception of the self requires courage and is essential for enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Free Will and Spirituality</b>: Leo addresses the misconception that the absence of free will is anti-spiritual, arguing that this realization actually forms the foundation of spirituality and religion. The central messages of religious traditions are surrender and humility, advocating for release from the illusion of control (ego) to align with the forces of nature, which is where true power lies.
</li><li><b>Free Will and Misconceptions</b>: Leo counters the common misconception that acknowledging the absence of free will equates to endorsing laziness or apathy. He clarifies that despite the lack of individual control over ones life, activities and ambitions can still be pursued, but their outcomes are inherently influenced by external forces.
</li><li><b>Ramifications of No Free Will</b>: In concluding this section, Leo discusses the realizations and changes that may occur upon understanding and accepting the absence of free will. The realization that control was an illusion can lead to the surrendering of the ego, and subsequently the cessation of self-interference, suffering, and internal struggles. Big decisions become less agonizing, and actions become more aligned with the flow of life.
</li><li><b>No Control Over Actions</b>: Leo argues that individuals have no control over their actions, habits, or decisions. These are predestined and occur on their own, with individuals having no real power over the course they take. He likened it to being in a car being driven by someone else but believing you are the one steering it. This illusion can lead to frustration and unhappiness. 
</li><li><b>Surrender and Enjoyment</b>: According to Leo, individuals need to surrender control and accept that they are not the ones driving their lives. This acceptance can lead to enjoyment of life's journey as individuals worry less about their actions and the consequences of their decisions. 
</li><li><b>Productivity and Success</b>: Leo claims that lack of control or free will does not equate to a lack of productivity or success in life. On the contrary, he suggests that enlightened people, who have realized and accepted the lack of free will, can be highly productive. He argues that these individuals become forces of nature due to their surrender and authentic desires. 
</li><li><b>Misconception of Control Over Life</b>: Individuals often believe that they require more control over their lives to achieve happiness and peace of mind. However, Leo believes this is a misconception. Trying to control life not only results in failure and disappointment but also obstructs peace of mind and happiness. Instead, he argues that surrendering control and accepting life's flow allows for genuine happiness and peace. 
</li><li><b>Demand for Control Results in Suffering</b>: The belief and need for control leads to suffering and unhappiness, according to Leo. Trying to exert control often results in failure, guilt, anger, and frustration. This ceaseless struggle stops when individuals choose to surrender to nature.
</li><li><b>Suggested Actions</b>: Leo recommends admitting the possibility of having been wrong about free will, self-verification rather than blind belief, self-observation practices, and learning more about enlightenment. This journey can be transformative and lead to profound life changes. However, initial feelings of being demotivated or sad at the onset are normal and transient.
</li><li><b>Long-Term Rewards</b>: The journey of accepting the lack of individual control might entail some emotional difficulty in the beginning. However, in the long run, it results in peace of mind, unconditional happiness, and oneness with life. Individuals yield themselves to the mighty impersonal forces of nature, leading to direct and powerful actions. Leo emphasizes that surrendering does not mean losing; instead, it paves the way for a radical transformation.
</li><li><b>Access to Learning</b>: Leo encourages viewers to explore multiple sources of enlightenment, including his own videos or suggested readings. Consistent engagement and deep contemplation of these ideas can lead to a significant transformation over time. The journey may start with negative feelings but ultimately leads to life-enriching realizations.
