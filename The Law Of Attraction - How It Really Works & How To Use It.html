hey this is Leo for actualised org and we are
going to talk about in this video the law of
attraction all right this would be a quick self-help segment
on the law of attraction we're gonna cover what the
law of attraction is how it works the profound effect
that it can have on your life some of the
common mistakes that people use in applying it and really
how you can use Law of Attraction very practically to
get some amazing results in your life create the kind
of success in the kind of fulfillment that you want
all right so let's go into this so law of
attraction this is a really deep topic but we're just
going to skim the surface but it'll still be very
useful for you just in the next 15 minutes you're
gonna get a lot so law of attraction what is
it basically it's a fancy term for the following thing
law of attraction the way that I define it very
simply is that instead of focusing on the things that
you do not want to happen in your life you
shift your focus and you think about the things that
you do want to have happen in your life so
what's an example of this well let's come up with
an example let's say that you're starting a business and
you're starting a new business and it's the first time
you've started a business so it's something new that you're
going into and now when you're starting it off you
naturally have some fears you naturally wonder whether you're gonna
be able to to launch this business you naturally wonder
whether you're going to be able to pay the bills
maybe you wonder about whether you should hire some employees
or not you have some reservations about that you don't
know if you can pay them and you just wonder
if the whole thing is even a good idea and
maybe you're gonna you're gonna risk losing a lot maybe
you're gonna lose and you're gonna invest some money you're
going to lose that and you've got all these reservations
and so as you're building this business and you're going
about your day-to-day actually implementing it creating it what's gonna
happen is your mind is gonna shift and it's gonna
focus on all these problems it's gonna focus on the
fact that well this business simply could fail and so
you're gonna be thinking about how do I make this
business not fail why don't I go and get another
client maybe that'll help me not fail maybe I should
go do do this thing over here that will help
me not fail and you're always thinking about how your
business could potentially fail trying to preempt or take some
sort of action against that and basically what you're doing
is you're planning against catastrophe that's what you're doing that
situation that is what 99% of us do in our
lives maybe not in such a dramatic clear-cut way as
with starting a business because not everyone starts a business
and even the people that do don't do it that
often so that's a very poignant example but in small
ways this is happening throughout your life right you're focusing
for example on the things that you don't like your
boyfriend or girlfriend doing in a relationship maybe you don't
like something very small you don't like the fact that
they that they pick their teeth at the dinner table
or you don't like the fact that they put their
their feet up on on the dinner table or just
something very small like that and you're always focusing on
that and you're saying you know why does he keep
doing it what does he keep picking us either the
dinner table why does he keep putting his feet up
and you're thinking about that and you're focusing on again
the thing that you do not like in your life
so this is happening everywhere in your life and most
people are going through life and they're focusing on the
things that they don't like I don't like the traffic
jams that I'm going into when I'm driving down to
work I don't like how much money I'm getting paid
at work I don't like the relationship that I'm in
or some aspect of it I don't like some aspect
of my health I don't like the fact that I
might have a bad hip I don't like the fact
that I have a toothache that's bothering me I don't
like the fact that I'm overstressed with appointments and I've
got too much on my schedule right now I don't
like the fact that I can't take a vacation for
another seven months when I need one right now so
all these issues right and more you've got all this
coming up but the problem is and this is what
Law of Attraction states is that the things that you
focus on the things that you put your attention to
are the things that you end up attracting more of
into your life and so this is this is a
deep this is actually much deeper than it seems on
the surface because with literally happening is that you are
focusing on these problems and that you are creating an
emotional vibration within you your thoughts are then soaked in
the negativity of the situation on the challenge on the
dick beyond the fear on the problem and then you
take on that vibration and basically it rubs off on
you and then when you're in that kind of state
of mind well it tends to attract those things to
you and it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy effect and this
is not some new-age concept this is not some whoo
idea that literally your thought is somehow pulling something negative
towards you although that is literally the effect but it's
not through some weird metaphysics as it's happening not through
magic this is happening because your thoughts generate the action
that you take in your life and so you are
not going to go out there and take resourceful action
you might not take any action at all when your
thoughts are soaked in all this negativity and are focusing
on all the problems because what that's doing is making
you anxious it's it's making you insecure it's making you
fearful and when you act from that position your actions
are feeble they are many times self-fulfilling and Cass traffic
a lot of times you'll worry about something so much
that you actually take the action that will lead to
that thing becoming true it's a very very freaky phenomenon
in nature and a very freaky phenomenon of human psychology
this is that this is actually the case so what's
the what's the solution well the solution is to adopt
what the law of attraction wants you to do and
the law of attraction states that since you are attracting
these negative things with negative thoughts you can attract positive
things with positive thoughts and so instead of worrying about
your money situation what you do is you think about
the awesome money situation that you're going to create for
yourself or instead of worrying about the problem little problem
area in your relationship you focus on the larger relationship
and you focus on how great that is or if
you want to eliminate that problem than what you focus
on is not eliminating the problem you focus on creating
something right it's about focusing shipping your focus on the
creation so what do you want to create your relationship
how about that why aren't you asking yourself that question
really what this is is a is a positive worry
worry is about thinking and projecting into the future all
the bad stuff that might happen and it's about putting
what-if scenarios in your mind well what if I get
fired what if I get abandoned what if I fail
at this business what if I get I make a
speech and I embarrass myself make a fool of myself
what if I walk into into the party with my
fly down and people are staring at me you know
what if these are like worst-case scenarios well here's one
for you what if instead of worrying about things in
the negative you started worrying about things in the positive
how would that look well what if I go and
in my job I actually get a promotion next year
what if I start making more money because I'm providing
more value what if I started doing better at school
because I'm actually studying what if I work on my
relationship and my relationship becomes really amazing better than most
relationships out there and I really flip it around what
if I go in to this this party and instead
of having my fly down I walk in there and
I'm the coolest guy there and everyone wants to be
my friend and I make a bunch of cool friends
and connections right it's the positive side of worry it's
about projecting positive images now this is very unnatural for
us to do and this is why 99% of us
are not obeying the law of attraction because we're always
worrying about stuff this is unnatural for the human brain
and what you got to do is you got to
recondition yourself and rewire yourself by making a mark in
your conscious awareness and putting it on these problem areas
in your life and saying okay I've worried about this
stuff long enough it's about time that maybe I should
try this law of attraction deal and see if it's
gonna really pan out the way people say it is
and when you do try it and you have to
try it with with faith and confidence and consistency what
you're gonna find is that it really works and the
reason that it works again is not through some metaphysical
mumbo-jumbo simply because you become confident you have faith in
your actions you're not insecure anymore you're excited about what
you're doing because you have these positive visions of what
you want to create eight and basically what you're doing
is you start to impose your reality on the world
rather than the world's reality mesmerizing you and when that
happens you start to feel really good and you're able
to go out there you're actually able to work on
your goals you're able to take action on your goals
you're not procrastinating anymore and so through that whole process
your thoughts shape your actions and then your actions attract
attract whatever it is that you want in your life
and that's basically Law of Attraction think about the things
that you want not the things that you don't want
now as simple as that sounds you're not going to
do it it's just it's really hard to recondition yourself
you have to be very persistent with it but if
you do if you undertake this initiative and you say
you know what I think there's something to this law
of attraction and I think I'm it's about time that
I try something new because I'm frustrated with the lack
of results that I've been getting and you really buy
into it and you really give it a good go
give it a good go for a month or two
where you're just constantly focusing on the things that you
want to create in your life and you're not focusing
at all on the things that you're worrying about or
that you typically would worry about you're gonna find that
you're gonna feel very good you're gonna start to develop
a good mood you're gonna start to be more cheerful
and happy and you're gonna get this sense of confidence
you have this sense that yeah I own my life
I'm in control of my life I can actually direct
my life because I'm creating some positive vision and then
I'm going out there taking action towards it and that
action seems to somehow smoother seems how somehow more effortless
than it was before and you're feeling good about yourself
and you just start to notice that it's almost like
magic things start to click and you start to see
that this is why some books or some authors or
just popular culture will say that law of attraction is
is this metaphysical thing where it's like you're literally your
thoughts are attracting things into your life that's almost what
it's like because if you take the action component out
of it and that's actually what it becomes is that
it's the quality of your thoughts are improved then the
quality of the things that you have in your life
will also improve but what some people do is they'll
discount the intermediary there which is action because your actions
are created by thoughts right your actions don't just happen
spontaneously and there's two sides to it there's I mean
two aspects there's the conscious loss that you have and
the subconscious thoughts and really what Law of Attraction is
really really powerful at is working on your subconscious because
once your subconscious starts to resonate with that feeling of
confidence that pride that you have that sense that everything's
okay in the world that calmness that happiness that you
have that joy when you start creating from that your
subconscious doesn't resist anymore you don't have those fears holding
you back you're out there you're taking bolder action and
you're you're fulfilling it you're not quitting you're not struggling
as much it's not as much as I cried it's
more pleasant and when that's happening how could you not
attract the things that you want this works for everything
this will work for wealth this will work for relationships
this will work for businesses this will work for your
health literally anything that you want in your life you
can attract by simply focusing on the fact that you
want it rather than the fact that you don't have
it all right so this is a quick little summary
of Law of Attraction this is a much deeper topic
there's a lot more nuances to this it takes more
than one exposure to this idea to really understand it
on a profound level and have it work in your
life so I cover that in more videos but here
