            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Jar8Pd5oo_s' target='_blank'>Understanding & Coping With Nihilism</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Origins and understanding of nihilism</b>: Nihilism is a philosophy expressing negation towards general aspects of life widely accepted within humanity as objectively real - such as knowledge, existence, and the meaning of life. Nihilistic positions maintain that human values are baseless, life is meaningless, knowledge is impossible, or that some set of entities do not exist. 
</li><li><b>Friedrich Nietzsche's views on nihilism</b>: German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche described the Western world's disintegration of traditional morality as part of nihilism. Nietzsche's nihilism was more about clearing away falsely constructed narratives and religious systems from the past, recognizing their limitations and artificiality, and then building an authentic life on that cleared space - embracing values that are not socially conditioned.
</li><li><b>The implications of Nietzsche's view on social conditioning</b>: Clearing out social conditioning may be beneficial for those involved in personal development work and self-actualization. However, it may be distressing and problematic to individuals who are attached to their traditionally conditioned religious orientations.
</li><li><b>Concept of nihilism as destruction</b>: The interpretation of nihilism as the belief that everything deserves to perish can be problematic. If one truly believes in absolute meaninglessness of everything, there is no inherent pursuit of destruction since this would involve attributing a negative meaning.
</li><li><b>Collapse of traditional values and beliefs</b>: Nihilism was considered a destructive force by Nietzsche as it would expose all revered beliefs and sacrosanct truths as symptoms of a defective Western mythos, leading to a collapse of values and purpose. This was particularly relevant during Nietzsche's time when traditional Judeo-Christian values and worldviews in the Western world started unraveling due to advancements in science and philosophy.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and societal belief in God</b>: A prevalent concern during Nietzsche's time revolved around what would occur if society stopped believing in God or if God was perceived as just a fairy tale from the past, outgrown by logic, rationality, and science. Some individuals believed this could lead to a society ripe for philosophical nihilism.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Modern Wars</b>: The wide-spread loss of faith towards conventional principles and institutions, promoted by nihilism, had a critical role behind World War I and World War II. These wars marked the pinnacle of uncertainties regarding human nature and existence.
</li><li><b>Contradictions within Nihilism</b>: Even though nihilism aims for total negation, it maintains faith in scientific findings and methods. This contradiction poses the question - if a true nihilist is supposed to reject and destroy everything, why does science remain unchallenged?
</li><li><b>Depth of Nihilism</b>: Not everyone is willing or able to embrace nihilism to its deepest extents because doing so undermines practical daily life and survival. However, some structures, belief systems, and social norms might need deconstruction for societal progress and the liberation of human consciousness.
</li><li><b>Shift from Christianity to Scientific Materialism</b>: After a period of questioning and devaluing conventional religious beliefs, especially Christianity, society moved towards scientific materialism. This transition from divine, mystical truths to logical, tangible facts filled the ideological gap left by a brief stint of nihilism.
</li><li><b>Dominance of Scientific Materialism</b>: Modern generations, raised in a world dominated by scientific materialism, often fail to recognize the importance and validity of previous worldviews and belief systems that were once taken seriously by intellectuals and societies. 
</li><li><b>Change in Life Perception</b>: With the decline in belief in higher order values and God, life shifted from religious worships and aspirations of beautiful afterlives towards pursuing practical, earthly goals.
</li><li><b>Emergence of Nihilistic Themes in 20th Century Philosophy and Science</b>: Leo Gura discusses that the 20th century saw nihilistic themes emerge in philosophy and science. Many long-standing assumptions and frameworks were questioned, including language, mathematics, and the nature of the universe, leading to a sense of uncertainty and loss of meaning and value.
</li><li><b>False Assumptions and Frameworks</b>: The belief that life can only be meaningful if structured around moral, ethical, and cultural norms was challenged, leaving individuals and society to face the challenges in determining a new direction in a world deemed nihilistic.
</li><li><b>Nihilistic Themes in Modern Living</b>: Modern living, focused on material acquisition, personal success, and pleasure, is argued to create a hollow existence. Traditional values and spiritual components, according to Jordan Peterson, are often missing, leading to a lack of direction in life and potential societal and individual dysfunction.
</li><li><b>Post-Modernity and the Questioning of Moral and Cultural Norms</b>: Post-modernity brought about more deep questioning of all morals and cultural norms, further undermining the remaining foundations of Western civilization. The authority of hard sciences was also questioned in this stage, leading to resistance and debate between hard scientists and post-modernists.
</li><li><b>Confusion as a Result of Multiple Perspectives</b>: The presence of seemingly equally valid yet contrasting perspectives can result in a state of 'perspectival madness'. This state can create feelings of being lost and confusion, making it difficult for people with traditional value systems to transition to this stage.
</li><li><b>Fear of Nihilism and the Awakening Process</b>: Given these uncertainties and uncertainties, fear of shifting to a nihilistic perspective is common. Both hard scientists and religious individuals can view nihilism as an existential threat. However, moving through this process and embracing nihilism is said to be essential to the awakening process. 
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Accepting Nihilism</b>: Accepting the basic tenets of nihilism - that everything is groundless and relative, the world is devoid of meaning, and all value is self-biased - is a significant challenge. That said, it is seen as an essential step in attaining higher spiritual understanding and liberation.
</li><li><b>Relative Truth versus Absolute Truth</b>: Navigating through relativism and nihilism can be achieved by studying various perspectives, being open-minded, honest with oneself about personal preferences and biases, and making decisions based on relative truths that align with personal values.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Defensive Ideologies by Being Truthful</b>: Being truthful can free individuals from defensive behaviors and ideologies. This allows for the creation of a good life based on personal preferences and desires. Studying various perspectives is highlighted as a key part of navigating relativity and nihilism effectively.
</li><li><b>Finding Happiness and Purpose</b>: Personal happiness and purpose can be discovered through trying different things and paying attention to personal feedback. This process can be compared to playing with Legos, building different structures, and realizing what one truly enjoys. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Openness to Different Perspectives</b>: Embracing confusion and being open to the vast array of different perspectives can lead to personal growth and enlightenment. Developing one's own criteria for judging perspectives can help in discerning which views are more beneficial and healthy. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Discerning Lower and Higher Perspectives</b>: Lower perspectives are marked by fear, hatred, judgment, violence, among others. Higher perspectives, in contrast, are open, non-monopolistic, interested in exploring more perspectives, and characterized by love, fearlessness, courage, and complexity.
</li><li><b>Living Life for Beauty, Love, and Truth</b>: Surrendering to love and aligning with it leads to a purposeful life that is free from nihilism. Guided indirectly by love, individuals can navigate their way effectively through life, even amidst confusion and uncertainties brought by the multi-faceted nature of truth and reality.
</li><li><b>Emergence of nihilism in science and philosophy</b>: The 20th century saw a questioning of long-standing frameworks like mathematics, science, language, and the nature of the universe, opening up themes of nihilism. This led to a sense of uncertainty, loss of meaning, and societal discomfort due to the scrutiny of traditional structures and beliefs.
</li><li><b>Understanding Nihilism's contradiction</b>: Nihilism, targeting destruction of everything, paradoxically asserts the reliance on science alone to solve all social issues. However, it's not fully embraced due to its practical limitation in everyday life. In addition, nihilism became prominent after Christianity's untenability for intellectuals but quickly morphed into scientific materialism.
</li><li><b>Shift predominantly towards personal pleasure and success</b>: Modern societal focus has gradually shifted from living life within the traditional religious framework to personal pleasure and achievement. While this transition seems to enable a better lifestyle, it unfortunately lacks the spiritual element, leaving it essentially hollow. Post-modernity and relativism further undermines the foundations of Western civilization by challenging the undisputed authority of religion and science. 
</li><li><b>Experiencing the "green" stage</b>: Transitioning to a holistic and pluralistic perspective can be mentally straining. This involves recognizing that all moral systems and standpoints are mere constructs and socially conditioned. It might lead individuals into nihilism but becoming a relativist, acknowledging multiple valid perspectives, can provide direction.
</li><li><b>Techniques on questioning core beliefs</b>: Leo recounts his experience of challenging the basic tenets of science and acknowledging scientific truths, eventually accepting evolution and atheism. The general societal backlash against deconstruction underlies society's need for survival and the ego's need for certainty in constructs like meaning and value. 
</li><li><b>Problematic living as a Nihilist</b>: Most people claim to be nihilists but do not live in accord with its principles. The survival instincts of humans usually override philosophical thoughts about nihilism, hence making it challenging to lead a truly nihilistic life. Questioning fundamental tenets that society relies on, can threaten societal structures and lead to common resistance against such questioning.
</li><li><b>Understanding relative and subjective identity-based meaning</b>: Leo suggests that all meaning and purpose, morality, values, perceptions are relative and tied to each individual's ego and identity. This realization can help in comprehending diverse interpretations of "good" across history leading to several conflicts.
</li><li><b>True Nihilism</b>: True Nihilism involves understanding that everything is absolutely meaningless. However, it doesnt advocate destruction and negativity towards social institutions or constructs but allows for individual choice in behavior. Instead of being used to destroy everything externally, it should be used inwardly to deconstruct the ego.
</li><li><b>Impact of Nihilism on Ego</b>: True Nihilism leads to deconstructing the ego, the realization that consciousness is the only real thing, and awakening to the interconnectedness with everything, a part of God. This provides a higher purpose - to help mankind awaken and realize that except for the awakening of consciousness itself, all meaning is a construct.
</li><li><b>Confronting defense mechanisms against Nihilism</b>: The rejection of Nihilism arises from defense mechanisms rooted in fear. True Nihilism leads to mysticism, a concept often misunderstood and unacceptable to traditional individuals. The path to realizing true Nihilism involves questioning and deconstructing social constructs to develop personal meaning and authenticity in beliefs which eventually leads to true spirituality.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Enlightenment</b>: Nihilism backed by a deep understanding can lead to love, joy, and truth while avoiding depression, negativity, and suffering. The misunderstanding of Nihilism reflects in one's fear of deconstructing personal worldview, ideas, and ideologies. 
</li><li><b>Deconstructing foundations</b>: Western civilization, built on unquestioned assumptions and survival biases, is resistant to deconstruction. However, deep skepticism in the form of Nihilism instigates the loss of illusions which challenges the ego-centric constructed identity leading to an existential crisis. The mind has an infinite capacity for denial and rationalization, defending itself from any critique resulting in an emotionally challenging process of deconstruction.
</li><li><b>Relative Truth versus Absolute Truth</b>: Although Leo Gura couldn't completely evaluate the absolute truth in certain conflicts, he made decisions based on relative truths that align with his personal values. Admitting ones selfishness and biases and not rationalizing them with objective truths or norms can lead to a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Discovering happiness and authentic purpose in life</b>: Trying different things leads to self-exploration and discovery of personal enjoyment. Embracing confusion as a part of this journey is encouraged. Furthermore, the concept of following one's bliss can lead to discovering life purpose. As a result, following personal preferences, and not letting societal expectations or fear limit personal joy and fulfillment is promoted.
</li><li><b>Criteria for judging perspectives</b>: Higher perspectives include attributes like openness, non-monopolistic, exploration inclined, fearless, courageous, selfless, loving, playful, self-aware while lower perspectives possess elements like fear, hatred, judgement, violence, and rejection of reality. The 'higher and lower labels' are ascertained based on the inclusivity, intellectual integrity and rigor of the perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Guidance from Actualized.org</b>: Leo Gura's website Actualized.org provides a practical and positive approach to understand and counter Nihilism and to discover one's authentic purpose. These approaches transform lives providing a sense of meaning and liberation resulting in personal growth and creative thinking. The ultimate goal steers towards self-awakening, realizing interconnectedness with everything as a part of God, and providing assistance to others to reach the same realization.
</li><li><b>Nihilism's truth about meaning and purpose</b>: According to nihilism, life has no inherent meaning and purpose; it is relative and completely subject to one's ego and identity. Events or objects are meaningful based on the significance attached to them by individuals, often for survival purposes. 
</li><li><b>Nihilism's stance on morality</b>: Nihilism argues that morality, like meaning, is relative. Mankind's interpretation of good and bad hinges on what one's ego perceives as beneficial or detrimental. Thus, what is moral in one context may be viewed as immoral in another.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and the concept of pain and suffering</b>: Nihilism challenges the conventional belief that pain and suffering are inherently bad. It highlights the role of human bias in perceiving these experiences as negative, as pain and suffering can serve evolutionary purposes, leading to survival.
</li><li><b>Relativity of philosophical concepts according to nihilism</b>: Nihilism posits that all of reality is relative, including the perception of physical reality. The universe is infinite, making full knowledge unattainable, hence leading to a form of epistemic nihilism.
</li><li><b>Self-serving nature of social institutions</b>: Nihilism states that social institutions and norms are grounded on self-preservation, not on absolute truths. These societal structures exist primarily to sustain themselves and those associated with them.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and belief systems</b>: According to nihilism, all beliefs are ultimately untrue. Belief systems are seen as subjective perspectives, not objective facts, and can significantly differ between individuals.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of nihilism's concept of meaninglessness</b>: A significant misunderstanding according to nihilism is giving meaninglessness a negative connotation. This perceived negativity can lead to depression and inactivity, which contradicts the concept of absolute meaninglessness that should not have any emotional impact.
</li><li><b>Negative Connotations of Nihilism</b>: Leo mentions that nihilism is often misinterpreted or only understood half-way. When taken to its deepest level, it leads to a realization of absolute meaninglessness which isn't negative or destructive. This is contrary to the perception that nihilism encourages destruction or devaluation of social institutions and other constructions. Leo argues that the bitterness, hatred, or desire to destroy associated with some nihilists is not a product of true nihilism but a negative meaning attached by the ego.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Ego</b>: Leo asserts that many nihilists fail to fully embrace the philosophy because it requires the deconstruction of the ego, something that can be very threatening to an individual. There is a tendency for the ego to co-opt nihilism and use it as a survival strategy, which Leo argues is not a functional or beneficial approach. Instead, the critique and scepticism that are integral to nihilism should be turned inward to challenge and dismantle one's own ego.
</li><li><b>Implications of True Nihilism</b>: True nihilism doesn't make any prescriptions about how one should live, thus implying that one is free to behave in any way they want. However, Leo points out that this freedom requires a deep understanding of one's desires and preferences. Furthermore, it's suggested that the deepest form of nihilism, taken to its endpoint, could lead to spiritual awakening and a realization of a divine, interconnected consciousness.
</li><li><b>Nihilism's Limitations</b>: Leo criticizes nihilism for often being stuck at the level of belief and concept, without actualizing or manifesting in practice. Also, the idea of nihilism being used as a political ideology, such as anarchism, is seen as a misappropriation of the philosophy. Leo argues that a truly nihilistic attitude would question all beliefs and systems, including one's own ego, leading to spiritual awakening.
</li><li><b>Impact of Nihilism Misunderstanding</b>: Misconceptions about nihilism, often leading to a fear-based rejection of the philosophy, likely stem from its potential threat to established norms, structures, and personal ideas. Leo argues for a deeper understanding and authentication of nihilism, which could lead to a more meaningful, purposeful existence, characterized by infinite love and an absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Truth</b>: If taken to its conclusion, nihilism offers the prospect of awakening to an absolute truth, or the interconnected consciousness of everything. Leo suggests that the concept of absolute truth being dismissed by rational, atheistic, or scientific views might stem from a failure to open their minds to the potential existence of such truths. Leo vouches for the existence of absolute truth, manifesting not as a concept or belief, but as the ultimate reality.
</li><li><b>Emergence of Nihilism</b>: Nihilism is seen as a threat because it exposes the relative and constructed nature of reality, leading to the loss of secure grounds for meaning, values, and identity. This realization, while initially disconcerting, is ultimately liberating as it deconditions individuals from societal beliefs and enables them to authentically construct their own meaning and values.
</li><li><b>Transcending Nihilism</b>: Nihilism itself becomes self-defeating as one realizes that its assumptions of meaninglessness and relativity are equally illusory. By recognizing the illusory nature of nihilism, the individual enters a deeper realm of understanding, characterized by infinite consciousness, love, and what is traditionally referred to as God.
</li><li><b>Advancing Beyond Conceptual Nihilism</b>: The process of embracing humility and self-reflection allows one to transition from philosophical or conceptual nihilism to corporeal or actualized nihilism. This is akin to becoming a mystic, a radical nihilist who goes beyond intellectual understanding and embodies the deep realization.
</li><li><b>Value of Nihilism</b>: Despite dismantling all previously held beliefs and structures of meaning, nihilism is valuable as it provides a clean slate for the individual to create personalized meanings, values, and purposes in life. This gives rise to individualized spirituality crafted independently of societal conditioning.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Spirituality</b>: Spirituality is aligned with nihilism in a sense that it involves a deep personal awakening and an embracing of life as an open-ended, playful, and non-attached experience. Spiritual people, having transcended societal conditioning, do not enforce their preferences on others or hold them as absolute truths.
</li><li><b>Illusion as Liberation</b>: Nihilism negates the substance of external reality, leaving one with the realization that life is nonetheless an illusory play. This understanding, far from being a source of despair, represents a liberating recognition that one can actively participate in the construction and enjoyment of this cosmic game from a place of love and freedom.
</li><li><b>Nihilism as a Catalyst for Personal Growth</b>: Transitioning from a traditional value system to nihilism, individuals dissolve their socially conditioned ego identities to become authentic beings. They draw upon their deep inner motivations fueled by consciousness, living presence, and love - an individual embodiment of spirituality that reflects Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch or Superman.
</li><li><b>True Nihilism and Awakening</b>: True nihilism, which involves a thorough deconstruction of all beliefs and values including those of nihilism itself, leads to awakening. This is a process of becoming spiritually actualized, leading to an understanding of infinite consciousness and god realization beyond ordinary human constructs.
</li><li><b>Nihilism in various societal institutions</b>: Leo Gura argues that many societal institutions such as art, science, academia, government, and religion are often misleading and rife with dishonesty. He suggests that openly questioning these institutions often leads to resistance and defensiveness.
</li><li><b>Nihilism and the hero's journey</b>: Gura connects nihilism with the concept of the hero's journey, a path of personal growth and self-discovery often depicted in mythology. He specifically references the "belly of the whale" stage in this journey, which is a point of profound self-reflection and confrontation of one's weaknesses. He argues that experiencing and overcoming nihilism is vital in one's hero's journey or path to spiritual enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Nihilism as a tool for spiritual work and enlightenment</b>: Gura views nihilism as a crucial tool for spiritual work, where the goal is to shut down the mind to reach spiritual enlightenment. He argues that effectively "actualized" nihilism can lead to enlightenment, sainthood, and a realization of one's true self, offering a joyful and loving life. Conversely, he considers conceptualized or theoretical nihilism leading to negativity, depression, and suffering.
</li><li><b>Irony of resistance to nihilism</b>: Gura points out that those who resist or reject nihilism, often tied to religious, scientific, or atheistic belief systems, are ironically the ones who are afraid of losing their constructs. He likens these individuals to devils, for they are driven by their ego, unable to give up their constructed beliefs.
</li><li><b>God as nothingness</b>: Gura posits that God, as conceived by various religions, represents nothingness or emptiness, aligning with the core of nihilism. He references different names associated with God such as "Shunyata" in Buddhism, "Einsof" in Judaism, and "Fana Alfana" in Sufism, all suggesting nothingness or the void.  
</li><li><b>Fear of deconstructing worldview</b>: He suggests that the fear and resistance to deconstructing worldview indicate a lack of confidence in its truth. Gura asserts that if a belief system was truly undeniable, it would not be threatened by any attempts to deconstruct it. He proposes that pursuing the ultimate truth requires burning everything metaphorically to the ground - a process that threatens the survival of ideologies and personal ideas.
</li><li><b>Challenges in Personal Growth</b>: Admitting that everything one knows and believes could potentially be wrong and subject to revision is a major hurdle in personal development and growth. This realization requires considerable humility and is often resisted due to attachment to personal beliefs.
</li><li><b>Arrogance vs Certainty</b>: Leo, Leo Gura, argues that speaking definitively or with conviction about his discoveries on truth and reality is not arrogance, but rather the result of extensive introspection, deconstruction of beliefs and pursuit of absolute truth. 
</li><li><b>Nihilism and Self-discovery</b>: To truly find oneself, one must lose oneself, delving deeply into the processes of nihilism and relativity. This can be terrifying for many, leading them to avoid the process and remain attached to their existing belief systems.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing Absolute and Relative Truth</b>: While absolute truth might be elusive, one can still base decisions on relative truths, which align with personal values and preferences. 
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Personal Preferences</b>: Embracing one's preferences and biases without seeking to justify them with objective truths or societal norms is crucial for authenticity. Instead of rationalizing decisions based on societal expectations, one should embrace personal desires and preferences as valid motivations.
</li><li><b>Navigating Relativity and Nihilism</b>: Gura recommends studying various perspectives, reading books, and learning from different sources to navigate the complexities of relativity and nihilism. Developing one's criteria for judging perspectives is crucial, which involves questioning everything. 
</li><li><b>Determining Higher and Lower Perspectives</b>: Lower quality perspectives are seen as fear-driven, judgmental, monopolistic, attached and rejecting of reality. In contrast, higher perspectives are seen to be open, fearless, loving, courageous, playful, self-aware and holistic. 
</li><li><b>Honesty in Self-perception</b>: Fully admitting that one's preferences and biases are the drivers of one's decisions is a step towards self-understanding and authenticity. Acknowledging these biases and desires can lead to a more fulfilling and genuine life, rather than trying to ground decisions in normative standards or objective truths. 
</li><li><b>Facing Confusion and Uncertainty</b>: Embracing states of not knowing and viewing confusion as a positive phase of the learning process can aid in the journey of self-discovery and development. Trust in the ongoing process and developing individual judgment criteria can facilitate finding personal direction, even amidst uncertainty.
</li><li><b>Emerging from nihilistic confusion</b>: Leo argues that an individual may be left confused and disillusioned during a period of nihilism as they are exposed to many different perspectives that challenge their own. This state can lead to a sense of relativity and randomness about one's choices and actions. 
</li><li><b>Play and exploration in nihilism</b>: To fight this confusion, Leo suggests exploring different perspectives through reading, watching videos, and learning from various teachers and traditions. He likens this exploration to a child playing with a dump truck load of Lego pieceswithout instructions, the child must experiment with building different things to understand what they truly enjoy.
</li><li><b>Perspective hierarchy</b>: In sorting through these perspectives, Leo posits that they are not all equal. He establishes an informal hierarchy of perspectives, with the highest quality perspectives being open, exploratory, selflessly compassionate, and interested in other perspectives. Lower quality perspectives, on the other hand, exhibit fear, hate, and a rigid monopoly on their viewpoint.  
</li><li><b>Navigating by quality of perspectives</b>: Leo argues that by learning to distinguish between higher and lower quality perspectives, individuals can successfully navigate relativity and nihilism. People must understand that neutrality or non-action is a choice in itself and that they are free to create their own lives based on their preferences and desires.
</li><li><b>Perspective on personal happiness</b>: Ultimately, Leo argues that the point of life is to create a good life and be happy. This involves experimenting with different perspectives, receiving and acting on feedback, and following our blissbuilding the life we truly enjoy while not limiting ourselves or believing that the choices are externally ordained. He emphasizes that this is a long process that involves acknowledging one's biases and learning from them. 
</li><li><b>Handling the inherent biases</b>: Leo encourages honesty and open-mindedness to handle inherent biases. Whether you have a preference for science or any other belief system, acknowledging that such a preference is a product of cultural conditioning can help you develop a healthier view of it and free you from pre-set ideologies.   
</li><li><b>Importance of exploring perspectives</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of exploring various perspectives before settling for any particular framework. He advises trying different ideologies, seeking different teachers, and embracing the confusion as a learning and exploratory process. By recognizing higher and lower quality perspectives, one can cultivate their own values and chart a course towards a meaningful and purposeful life.
</li><li><b>Embracing Not Knowing and Confusion</b>: Experiencing confusion during the process of questioning and exploring differing perspectives is considered positive. Studying a variety of perspectives and slowly developing a personal criterion for discerning betweens lower and higher perspectives is recommended, with the build-up of one's own epistemology considered vital.
</li><li><b>Signs of Lower and Higher Perspectives</b>: Lower perspectives are marked by fear, hatred, judgment, violence, rejection of certain facets of reality, and ideologically driven close-mindedness. Higher perspectives are open, non-monopolistic, interested in more perspectives, selfless, loving, fearless, courageous, playful, exploratory, nuanced, complex, systemic, holistic, and self-aware. 
</li><li><b>Science as a Locking Perspective</b>: Science is a perspective that can prevent individuals from exploring outside its realm, such as mystical, paranormal, or religious studies. 
</li><li><b>Intellectual Rigor and Honesty</b>: Higher perspectives often exhibit more intellectual rigor and honesty, with more inclusivity and understanding of lower perspectives. Lower perspectives often lack the ability to understand and appreciate higher perspectives. Lower perspectives often lack intellectual integrity, often found in distorted facts and narratives, and double standards.
</li><li><b>Fear versus Love to Distinguish Truth from Falsehood</b>: If a perspective is rooted in fear, it is false. If a perspective is rooted in love, it is true. Living for beauty, love, and truth, and surrendering to love is suggested for a purposeful life.
</li><li><b>Purposeful Life after Nihilism</b>: Upon navigating the phase of nihilism, individuals may find a purposeful life, based not on social conditioning, but unique, authentic expressions of love for life. Actualize.org aims to guide individuals through this journey in a practical and positive manner. 
</li><li><b>The Heros Journey</b>: The hero's journey is not just about overcoming obstacles; it represents an individual liberating their mind, awakening to God realization, experiencing infinite love, and embodying it in everyday life, leading to authentic meaning and personal growth. This journey aligns with true nihilism.
