[Music] you let's continue with our series on self-deception this
is part two make sure that you watched part 1
which gives context to part 2 and what I'm gonna
be talking about in this section is over 60 different
self-deception mechanisms which I've identified and categorized and studied and
I'll be presenting those to you and talking about them
in some length there's a lot of material but before
we get into that we need to do a little
quick recap of part one so what did we learn
in part one we basically learned that the mind is
a self-deception engine and why would it be that because
without illusion nothing can exist reality must be dreamed into
being and that's done with your mind and this dream
needs to be sustained and this dream is sustained through
self-deception your mind's job is to construct reality to create
this dream so that you can be alive and partake
in all the features of life and it is not
in your mind's interest to look inside at the machinery
which is constructing the dream because that actually punctures the
illusion of reality so how is this dream maintained its
maintained through a lack of self-awareness through a lack of
self reflection your mind keeps your attention riveted outwards externally
on all the stuff within the dreamscape so that you
don't turn inwards and really question deeply what's going on
behind the scenes because that would rupture the illusion and
in a sense you want to be in the spell
inside the dream unless maybe you get the bright idea
that you want to jailbreak your mind and see what
reality is like outside of the dream that's it in
a nutshell this entire topic I call epistemology and it's
really part of a book that I'm working on which
is gonna be all about the deceptive nature of the
mind I've been working on it for over a year
and really I've been collecting this material and thinking about
self-deception for at least 10 years I've assembled thousands of
pages of notes and quotes and my own analysis and
examples that I find throughout culture and in myself and
other people and throughout literature and throughout science and religion
and history and everywhere and I have hundreds of audios
that I recorded personally just for myself my own notes
and thinking about this topic that's a very deep topic
this is like my life's work here and what you're
getting here with this two-part series is you're getting just
like 1% of the research that I've done into this
topic of self-deception and the trickery of the mind so
this is some very very complicated and nuanced stuff which
is why I love to research it because it does
require a lot of nuance and that's something that my
mind loves speaking of which let's consider deception not just
within humans but also within nature at large I like
to always put everything into like a bigger context so
notice that nature and the animal kingdom actually loves to
employ deception for the purposes of survival a lot of
animals that you see on the Discovery Channel you see
their amazing camouflage how remarkable it is and how helpful
that is for them surviving their life depends on excellent
camouflage some animals even have active camouflage like mimic octopuses
and certain flounder fish and chameleons although chameleons use their
pigments actually for communications more so than for hiding for
predators but you can see that in nature there are
many examples very remarkable examples of deception at work and
one that I love perhaps the most is the cuckoo
bird this is one of nature's most devilish examples of
deception what the cuckoo bird will do is it will
find a nest of some other bird some smaller bird
because the cuckoo bird is pretty big so it finds
some kind of a small nest like sparrows or whatever
and it'll fly in there and it'll actually kick out
one of the eggs in the nest while the adult
birds are gone it kicks out one of the eggs
it sticks its own larger cuckoo egg in there and
the cuckoo egg is perfectly camouflaged so that it looks
exactly like the other eggs even though it is bigger
in size and then it flies away and then that
cuckoo egg will hatch it'll hatch sooner than all the
other eggs by design of course and this cuckoo bird
this little baby cuckoo chick is born with certain features
like it has little little hooks on the tip of
its of its beak and also it has the ability
to kick out the other eggs from the nest so
you can see pictures of these cuckoo chicks who don't
even have feathers yet they're completely naked they can't even
see and yet they have a mechanism hardwired into their
psychology that forces them to kick out all the other
eggs in the nest so that it's the only one
remaining and the adults the adult sparrows for example they
are tricked into feeding this cuckoo chick because it tricks
their mind into being so deceived that they actually think
that oh I'm now bonded with this chick and this
chick must be my child and so of course they're
not gonna kick it out of the nest even though
it's actually going to destroy all the other legitimate Sparrow
chicks and so these sparrows will actually feed this cuckoo
bird this large giant cuckoo bird which looks nothing like
them but it's this see the Cuckoo's is exploiting this
this sort of glitch in the sparrows psyche be sort
of bonding that happens between adult and child such that
they just keep feeding and feeding the cuckoo bird until
the cuckoo bird becomes fully mature and then flies away
to repeat this whole thing over again and you can
actually see pictures of this gigantic oversized cuckoo bird which
is almost bigger than the entire nest and it's the
only one that's in there all the other chicks have
been thrown out and it's being fed by these little
adult Sparrow birds or similar kinds of birds it's an
amazing and remarkable deception that Nature has thought up and
why did nature think this up well of course for
the purposes of self survival and now you might think
all this cuckoo bird is such an evil creature for
doing this but look at the situation a little bit
more objectively what is the cuckoo bird doing it's just
trying to survive this is how it survives and you
might say ah but why is it do it in
such an evil and selfish manner and that's precisely right
because see in this example which are being shown is
the sort of stark brutality of selfishness it doesn't care
it doesn't care about the other baby birds it doesn't
care about the adults it doesn't care about whether it
tricks someone or doesn't it doesn't care as long as
it works that's all it cares about and in this
example even though the cuckoo bird might seem very evil
for doing what it does but really it's doing nothing
different than what you're doing what all of us are
doing to be alive is to be evil is to
be selfish it's just that with this example of the
cuckoo bird it's easy to see because we're seeing it
out there in somebody else but when these cuckoo mechanisms
are pointed out within you that's something your mind does
not want you to see because you see what happened
in nature very interestingly is that there's a lot of
stuff there's a lot of deception just regular all deception
going on in nature but usually that deception is aurilla
- towards tricking other animals but nature with humans because
we have these advanced Minds which are able to conceptualize
has gone one step further and has allowed us to
turn this deception mechanism inside towards ourselves from the outside
in such that now we are deceiving ourselves more than
we're deceiving people out there although of course we still
deceive plenty of people out there but you see to
deceive other people out there can you see how it's
really helpful to be able to deceive yourself first because
once you've deceived yourself that means you can be extremely
selfish in deceiving everybody else and that lets you get
away with a lot of stuff that you normally wouldn't
be able to get away with for example this cuckoo
bird do you think this cuckoo bird would be able
to survive if it had a sense of morality and
if it had this sense of like oh well but
I'm do I'm being so evil by kicking these other
baby birds out of the nest no it doesn't have
that sense precisely because it's not in its interest to
have that sort of sense but human beings see we
are social creatures we live in large groups so we
need a sense of morality otherwise our large groups will
start to break apart but nevertheless we don't want to
be too honest with each other and with ourselves we
want to still be able to deceive so human beings
are some of the most deceptive creatures that exist for
this very reason because we need to be deceiving while
at the same time putting on the airs as if
nothing's going on and what better way to do that
than to deceive yourself in the process think of how
much more you'll be able to get away with think
of how sneaky you can be when you don't even
know that you're being sneaky that's what's happened and it's
really a work of genius its genius it's pure genius
it's amazing this is not something to get depressed about
this is something to marvel at it's really mind-blowing stuff
the basic form that all self-deception takes is as follows
you think you know things which you really do not
know every time that you take a firm position on
anything you open yourself up to self-deception so if you
take a firm position on God you're opening yourself up
to self-deception if you take a firm position on science
or on some political ideology or about some government policy
or about some sort of moralistic cause or principle or
value so you're taking a firm position you're believing in
it and then you're kind of staking your life on
that thing and that's when you're prone to self-deception because
if you didn't have any firm positions on anything well
then you could just kind of be loosey-goosey but see
having firm decisions or positions is actually very helpful for
for your ability to survive and it also plays into
your sense of identity so it's really hard to go
through life without taking firm positions that's what most people
do and that's precisely when they fall into all these
traps of self-deception so we're gonna be talking about a
lot of them now here they are in no particular
order I specifically didn't like categorize them in in any
like order of most to least important because this whole
field is so complex there just isn't a simple list
of like oh here's number one here's number two here's
number three there's just a whole lot of them and
of course different people will succumb to different self-deception mechanisms
depending on their situations the time that they're living in
the country they're living in and other factors like that
but let's begin with these very basic ones which are
common to to almost everybody number one thinking that you've
basically got reality figured out because hey if you got
reality figured out then why read books why listen to
teachers why look at diverse perspectives why go out of
your way to try psychedelics why go out of your
way to travel to different countries why go out of
your way to listen to diverse opinions there is no
reason because hey you've basically got reality figured out and
that's a huge self-deception that one right there basically cripples
your ability to learn new things which is a big
problem because then you get stuck with just being who
you are and that's it with no opportunity for growth
number two is believing that reality is just an objective
thing and that the mind plays little role in this
objective reality and that basically facts about the world exist
independent of interpretation such that yeah you admit that there
are certain opinions that people can have in certain interpretations
but then in the back of your mind you really
hold that there just are certain things which are just
objective brute facts and you would have to be crazy
or insane or mentally handicapped to not accept some of
these given facts but you see when your mind gets
it to by this line of reasoning then that means
that your mind can inject whatever kind of facts objective
facts it wants it can stick any thing under that
category of objective facts and then you're gonna actually hold
those as objective facts you see how convenient that is
for the mind because the mind can sneak in almost
anything it wants there it can sneak in God it
can sneak in aliens it can sneak in conspiracy theories
it can sneakin sneak in any kind of materialistic theories
about the world basically anything you want can be snuck
in there so that's a really tricky one the next
deception mechanism is assuming that self-deception isn't a significant factor
in your life it's like yeah Leo sure self-deception happens
and mostly it happens with other people and even if
it happens in me it happens like maybe 10% of
the time or like maybe 20% of maybe 30 of
the time it happens but that's about it it's not
very significant do we really need spend all this time
talking about it it's that kind of thinking that's the
self-deception under estimating self-deception thinking that self-deception is easy to
to spot and to uncover of course that makes self-deception
really difficult to spot and uncover when you assume it's
easy when you assume it's insignificant because then it can
be very significant in actual fact but you won't know
that because you're assuming it's not very significant the next
mechanism is thinking that you can avoid metaphysics some people
especially on a scientific people they poopoo metaphysics and they
say all metaphysics that's for the philosophers that's something science
to use to do 500 years ago but we've grown
up now we don't do any metaphysics we're metaphysics free
there's no such thing though as metaphysics free there is
either you're aware and you're constantly thinking about your metaphysical
assumptions and your metaphysical certain metaphysical facets of your worldview
or you're not thinking about them but it's not that
you don't have them just because you're not investigating metaphysics
or thinking about metaphysics doesn't mean you don't have a
latent defacto metaphysics everyone who thinks that they can just
avoid metaphysics because it's just abstract airy-fairy type of stuff
that doesn't really concern real-world life they're very wrong because
what happens with them is they just end up picking
up the de facto metaphysics of their culture of their
peer group of their family of their religion or of
their science and if you're a scientifically minded person if
you're a scientist an academic really watch out for this
one because I see a lot of very intelligent academically
minded people who tricked selves with this thinking that they're
not engaging in metaphysics because they're a part of the
scientific method and that the scientific method is metaphysics free
this is preposterous not at all there are many many
assumptions that the scientific method makes many of them completely
groundless and factually false and yet they are made nonetheless
and what makes them even more deceptive is that these
people are not aware that they are holding these metaphysical
assumptions the next self deception mechanism is conceptualization this is
huge this is a very broad category and I've spoken
about this in the past and I will in the
future but it's basically the mistake of confusing the map
for the territory and that seems like a very simple
mistake and it is a very simple mistake it's a
very obvious mistake and when most people are told that
hey you're confusing the map for the territory they will
say oh yeah of course yeah I know the map
is not the territory that's obvious dollie oh that's obvious
so what but see it's one thing to hear the
phrase the map is not the territory it's another thing
to actually understand that it this applies to a lot
of stuff you hold in your life you hold the
map as the territory and again a lot of scientifically
minded people make this mistake because science does a lot
of mapping and a lot of modeling but then because
science is always modeling modeling modeling modeling it's conceptualizing reality
so much all the time that it forgets that it's
conceptualizing and modeling reality and it forgets that there's the
model and there's a territory and these are two very
different things and in many ways the better your models
become the the more problematic this problem becomes because the
greater the the gap that builds up between the map
and the territory and then you're very juicy and successful
models are very easy to mistake for the territory and
what a lot of scientists and academics do is they
just forget about the territory entirely they get completely wrapped
up in their Maps and that happens be of a
lack of mindfulness over the entire thinking process in general
people are very poor in our culture and society these
days at distinguishing between a concept and direct experiences because
this takes practice a lot of mindfulness practice a lot
of meditation work hundreds and thousands of hours of mindfulness
practice is required to be able to separate out your
thoughts from your sensory perceptions and so that those things
are not constantly being fused in your mind which is
the problem that most people face most academic and intellectually
minded people face this problem and it's a really big
problem and this is why I say that for scientists
and academics one of the most important things you should
be doing if you really care about your career and
you really care about discovering the truth with your scientific
discoveries is you need to be meditating every single day
like your life depended on it like your entire career
depended on it because it does because if you don't
do this if you don't develop this mindfulness practice every
single day then you're guaranteed to get lost in your
conceptualizations and in your maps and in your models guaranteed
there's no way you're gonna avoid it it's just way
too tricky of it of a thing that's why this
is a really important habit but of course not just
for scientists or mathematicians or logicians but really for everybody
but for those of you who are in the in
these kind of hardcore scientific fields if you're a physicist
if you're a cosmologists if you're a molecular biologist if
you're a computer scientist you have to be developing mindfulness
over your thoughts because otherwise you're gonna get completely lost
and self-deceived with your conceptualizations precisely because you're the type
of person who has the personality and mind type which
loves to conceptualize which is why you went into those
fields in the first place and you set so many
years in school and in university and getting your PhD
and all of that the next self-deception mechanism is language
and labeling this one is huge and I'll shoot specific
episodes about language in the future and I already have
in the past but see the problem with language is
that it also is a sort of a component of
this conceptualizing problem and we think that when we attach
labels to objects in the world that we actually know
more about those objects than we really do and if
you notice scientists for example and academics they love to
use big flowery words and complicated language and they write
these papers and they write these books which are filled
with a lot of technical jargon and this language becomes
very tricky it's very easy to deceive yourself with it
and with all the labels because it's not that you're
just attaching a label to something the label also carries
with it an infinite number of connections and ancillary meanings
implicit meanings of other concepts that this labels attached to
so your mind isn't just attaching labels to things it's
forming these networks in your minds of meaning and then
this can create all sorts of labyrinths in your mind
that are very difficult to escape the next self-deception mechanism
is a very broad one belief and hearsay so many
people do not understand the distinction between a belief and
direct experience of a thing because this is not taught
in schools at all we're not taught to make this
distinction even in science you might think oh well but
in science everything is based on empirical evidence no it's
not most of science is built upon concepts and models
and beliefs size is a highly belief based system this
is a mistake that very many rational people make is
they think that science is immune to this problem of
beliefs making it differ from religion no science is just
as much for belief based as religion is because in
science you have to believe a lot of stuff most
of stuff you learned in high school and in college
about science about physics about biology about chemistry is completely
belief based you didn't derive any of it for yourself
you just accepted it as blind facts and what's worse
is that not only that but you also accepted the
meta belief that science is not belief based and that
these things are not beliefs that gravity is not a
belief that the earth being round is not a belief
that the Big Bang is not a belief that these
things are our truth when in fact you have to
be conscious that actually these are beliefs and how did
you get these beliefs did you get them through personally
deriving them through actually going and looking through a telescope
to seeing if there's actually a Mars out there if
there's a Venus out there if there's a Saturn or
a Jupiter out there with so many moons circling around
it did you actually and go and do that through
a telescope chances are you probably didn't and yet you
believe in these planets but what are these planets for
most people for 99% of people these planets are purely
beliefs hearsay information that you got secondhand from other people
sure you got them from respected academics and from textbooks
that have been written by PhDs and from Nobel Prize
winners and from the Discovery Science Channel and this sort
of stuff you got them from quote-unquote reputable sources you
think but that doesn't change the fact that it's just
hearsay and this blurs the line between belief and direct
experience and the problem with that is that then you
become very self deceived because when I start talking to
you about for example contemplation or meditation or self inquiry
deriving some fundamental truths about your own existence for yourself
people say ah Leo but where's the proof for that
where's the evidence and that just tells me right there
that they're not conscious of what evidence is evidence is
exactly what I'm pointing you to meditation is the evidence
you're looking for when you're talking about things within your
own psyche for example that is direct experience you can't
get more direct than your present experience the only way
you can make that mistake is by being so lost
in beliefs that you don't even differentiate anymore between what
is a belief versus what is a direct experience because
in point of fact and it's one of the shocking
things you can reveal to yourself is the 99% of
everything you hold to be true is purely secondhand information
passed down to you as beliefs and you just believe
in it and you believe in it mostly not because
you have direct evidence of it you don't have any
direct evidence of Jupiter you've ever seen any direct evidence
of Jupiter what you've got is you've got a sort
of a cohesive story a web of belief that you've
built belief propping up another belief propping up another belief
propping up another belief and then based on this you
get a sort of a sense of cohesion and then
you say oh well yeah it sort of makes sense
everything sort of fits together in my little world view
but then what you don't understand is that there are
many worldviews that can have cohesion but that doesn't make
them true it's possible to create an infinite number of
self consistent self cohesive worldviews it doesn't mean that they're
right and that's another self deception mechanism right there is
judging the correctness of your worldview based on how cohesive
it feels that's a false metric you can't do that
if you do that then riddle me this how will
you distinguish one cohesive worldview from another you see that's
the problem there if you have five different self-consistent cohesive
worldviews which one of those are you gonna choose how
are you gonna arbitrate between all of them you won't
be able to is the point in fact you'll just
pick the one that you grew up in the one
that's closest to your personal preferences and you'll just believe
that one and of course that's completely arbitrary but it
won't feel that way to you it'll feel completely cohesive
and that will be this sort of false sense of
reality which your mind is created see what reality really
boils down to is just a sense of reality a
sense of consistency a sense of solidity these are appearances
these aren't facts these are appearances and of course appearances
can be deceiving another mechanism is the unwillingness to admit
I don't know the human mind loves certainty and it
hates uncertainty and unless your mind is trained otherwise it
will always try to claim that it knows more than
it really does we hate to admit that we don't
really know when in fact we don't really know so
if I ask you where did the universe come from
are you gonna say I don't know probably not you're
gonna have some kind of story it came from the
Big Bang or Stephen Hawking says this or this guy
says that or I have this idea but you're not
gonna admit that you really don't know or if I
ask you well where did the dinosaurs come from you'll
say oh I know that when if they came from
evolution we can explain it all away but do you
really know and how did they die out oh we
can explain that one too it's you know big meteorite
came and it hits the earth and everything all the
time big dinosaurs died you think that you believe that
you've been told that it feels like that fits everything
else you've been told but in point of fact you
don't actually know these things there's a lot that you
don't know and you have to retrain yourself to start
to admit that if you want to make progress epistemic
ly and notice that people hate admitting that they don't
know because as an entire culture were conditioned to think
that if we admit that we don't know that means
we're deficient or stupid or there's something wrong with us
another self-deception mechanism is childhood imprinting and indoctrination this is
a huge one which bears a lot of conversation and
a lot of explanation I'll just cover it lightly here
I'll shoot I'll probably episode on in the future but
have you noticed that children get easily indoctrinated literally the
mind can get imprinted with ideas if you take a
young child and you raise this child in a racist
family that child has a almost 100% chance of growing
up being a racist why is that is that an
accident no because the mind gets programmed imprinted the mind
will believe whatever its environment leads it to believe whatever
the adults in the environment are talking about and saying
generally speaking the child's mind will just pick that up
adopt all those beliefs all those core assumptions and especially
what the mind will pick up is any kind of
religious beliefs or assumptions or metaphysical beliefs or assumptions so
a child growing up in an atheist household is very
likely to turn out to be an atheist and a
child growing up in a religious household is very likely
to hold the exact same religious views you're not gonna
get a Jewish child born in a in a Muslim
family it's not gonna happen and vice-versa it's not gonna
happen either why is that because of this imprinting factor
and this imprinting factor is so huge and significant that
it's it's almost impossible to to articulate how significant it
is you that I'm just talking about like other groups
of people who get imprinted with ideas no I'm talking
about you I'm talking about you and your family you
have been imprinted I'm not talking about some bad family
that abuses their children no I'm talking about you every
single family imprints their child with all sorts of assumptions
about reality and those assumptions are extremely difficult to break
because the way the mind works is that it's sort
of like a blank slate when it starts it can
get programmed with anything and so what it does is
it just accepts whatever worldviews are given to it it's
like the first stuff that you write on a piece
of paper you know if you write something on a
piece of paper it's completely blank you write something on
it it's very easy the first time because the paper
was blank now if you go back to it again
and you filled your whole page you want to write
on some more well now you got a problem because
you got to write over stuff that's already there and
you've been you've been writing in permanent ink in a
sharpie it's really difficult to erase that stuff so literally
what happens with most human beings is that they get
imprinted for the first 18 to 20 years of their
life from birth to 20 let's say they get imprinted
with all this stuff their little piece of paper gets
completely filled up and then when they get to me
and I have to talk to them like I'm talking
to you now about a lot of these concepts what
do you think happens it's impossible to get any of
these concepts to stick because anything that doesn't agree with
what's already written on that paper is not gonna get
accepted but you know the real trick is that the
stuff that got written on the paper in the first
place it got written there without any kind of evidence
or justification you see people don't get this about the
mind the mind isn't using any strong filters or logic
to filter out what's written on the paper the first
time around all this stuff written on the paper the
first time around is just anything that you want if
you want you can take a child and you could
you could teach him to become a racist you could
teach them to become a murderer you can teach them
to become an atheist you can teach them to become
a Jew a Christian a Muslim a radical a terrorist
you know a Nazi what you want all of it
is completely open and the child whatever you imprint him
with he's gonna actually believe that as if it's reality
and he's not gonna know any different because a child
doesn't know any better there's no filters this is such
a strong mechanism that societies and religions and even science
has exploited this for for millennia there's always a battle
going on within society about what are we going to
imprint the children with and that's a huge political battle
because another self-deception mechanism here which is related to this
one is what I call this the need for contrast
in order for the human mind to grasp something see
the human mind cannot grasp something unless it has something
else to contrast it against so for example if you're
born into poverty that's just like what your mind is
gonna take as reality your reality is gonna be a
poor impoverished reality and if you're born into richness and
wealth and luxury your mind is gonna accept that and
it's not gonna know any different you see if you're
growing grow if you were born into a society where
there's no racism around you like maybe you're in a
good neighborhood where there's no racism going on then because
of a lack of contrast you're gonna grow up believing
that there's no racism in the world whereas if you
grow up in the ghetto somewhere where there is a
lot of racism then your mind is gonna believe that
there's a lot of racism in the world you see
because you need the contrast and a lot of the
way that humans learn is through contrast so maybe you've
been living in a little bubble in your own little
country for a long time and then you decide to
go traveling to some other radically different country with a
different culture and you get this culture shock it's like
oh my god these people like eat with their hands
and they they wipe their ass with their hands and
then like they use chopsticks or they they speak this
thing or they have these kinds of manners or this
kind of etiquette like these people here bow to you
those people eat there food sloppily and make all sorts
of noises when they're eating you know all these different
things they're all contrasting with what you know from your
own culture and that contrast is what kind of shocks
you and wakes you up it's the same problem as
you know a fish not knowing that it's in water
because there's a lack of contrast you take oxygen for
granted why is that because most of the time you
have plenty of oxygen it's very rarely when you're running
out of oxygen like when you're locked into a small
closet and you have no way to get out that
all of a sudden you start worrying about oxygen and
you don't take it for granted anymore because the mind
requires contrast to be conscious of things and this is
a very effective way that your own mind can deceive
you because all it has to do is remove the
contrast and then you won't even know that that thing
is there for example if you don't have any contrast
to reality then whatever you're experiencing seems like reality another
mechanism is assumptions this is a huge very general category
and there's thousands of assumptions that we make that are
false and self-deceptive but the general mechanism of assumptions is
the following is that we make assumptions but we're not
conscious of the fact that we've made these assumptions so
they turn into subconscious or implicit or latent assumptions which
are just taken for granted taken as reality and based
on this a ton of self-deception gets created specifically I'll
point out a couple of really big assumptions that are
made that are very self deceptive the entire materialist paradigm
is an assumption that a lot of people in our
society hold a lot of scientific lean people minded people
hold the scientific method is also an assumption people take
the scientific method completely for granted they don't think about
what it is or why it works or what its
limitations are they just tend to assume that Oh scientific
method just is the way that we arrive at truth
without ever investigating that any deeper and there's a ton
of metaphysical and epistemic assumptions that every human being holds
and what's really scary is that they don't even know
most people don't even know what the word metaphysical or
epistemic means so when these words are brought up it's
aioli oh I don't have any metaphysical or epistemic assumptions
I don't even know what those words mean that does
not excuse you for having those assumptions though see this
is just the tip of the iceberg you talk about
assumptions for four hours there's so many assumptions that people
make that deceive them the next mechanism is self evidence
or a priori truths in Western philosophy if you've studied
it at all then you've heard this word a priori
this is a really toxic concept which has led to
so much self-deception within Western intellectual tradition but even if
you haven't heard the word nevertheless it's still a problem
what this means is that it just basically means that
there are certain truths that can be known because they're
so obvious and so self-evident that they need no empirical
investigation you might say that one plus one equals two
is an a priori truth because it doesn't even depend
on your ability to experience or your ability to run
a scientific experiment this is sort of like a logical
truth of the mind of course this is complete [
__ ] there are no such thing as a priori
truths nothing is known a priori a priori you are
completely clueless but the mind loves to attach this label
a priori or self evidence to things that it learns
later on through experience of course it likes to trick
itself by saying oh well that could have been a
priori this could have been a priori because that makes
it feel more real see when you say something is
self evidence that sort of means that it couldn't be
any other way and that it's actually obvious when in
fact in truth nothing is obvious even one plus one
equals two you might think oh that's leo that's so
obvious that's not obvious at all if you're very honest
and you look back at your life you actually have
to work really hard as a child to learn that
one plus one equals two and two times two equals
four and so on and so forth all that stuff
had to be learned and it was challenging to learn
and when you were learning it it didn't make sense
to you so there was nothing obvious about it when
you say something is obvious that actually makes you take
it for granted more which is a big problem and
this problem is rampant throughout all of science on their
self assumption mechanism is emotions emotions are extremely self deceptive
because what is an emotion trying to do it's trying
to look ii mote motion the word motion is in
emotion emotions are about putting you into motion and your
body uses emotions to get you moving to save your
ass that's why when you stick your hand in a
fire you feel some emotion some pain it gets you
to move your hand back and you might say well
that's kind of like a reflex right maybe that is
a reflex but you've got all these other emotions you've
got all sorts of fear you've got anger you've got
jealousy you've got boredom you got excitement all these emotions
are moving you they're manipulating you your minds job is
to use these emotions to manipulate you your mind doesn't
manipulate you primarily through logic and reason but through emotions
which are why emotions are some of the hardest things
to master you can become enlightened but you ain't gonna
master your emotions for another 40 years mastering emotions some
of the trickiest stuff because emotions are our very self
deceptive and because they have they have a real punch
behind them you see when you're afraid of something so
fear is an especially self-deceptive emotion when you're afraid of
something then it's very easy for your mind to get
you to avoid it so you see if your own
mind wanted to really trick you if there was some
truth that your mind didn't want you to see where
would that truth behind a wall of fear easiest thing
in the world take your fear of death you fear
death so much that I could hide a hundred billion
dollars behind your fear of death and you would never
access that money because you would do anything to avoid
dying see and your mind will tell you all but
that's because if you die that's it that's the end
see that's what your mind tells you but why do
you believe your mind that's how fear works all fear
is completely ilusory there's nothing to fear in life including
fear of death and you can discover that for yourself
but the only way you can discover that a fears
an illusion is by actually passing through it you can't
see it while you're on the other side so fear
anger boredom these three emotions are especially self-deceptive especially so
your mind uses them to manipulate you to avoid doing
self-reflection and they are extremely extremely effective have you noticed
that it's very hard to use reason to bust through
fear and boredom and anger and depression for example it's
very hard to reason your way out of fear if
you're afraid of snakes good luck handling a snake while
reassuring yourself through reason that this snake is not gonna
harm me if you're afraid of heights good luck standing
on the edge of a tall building all the while
telling yourself all this is okay so no it's no
big deal is that gonna work no of course not
because this is like your Minds primary way of controlling
you and it is damn sure that you're not gonna
screw that just with some simple reasoning that would be
way too easy that's why mastering emotions is so hard
because they have this charge despont when things get really
emotional all philosophy flies out the window for most people
all abstract considerations all notions of truth all notions of
morality propriety of kindness of love all that flies out
the window as soon as you're angry as soon as
you're fearful as soon as you're depressed or anything like
that have you noticed that not an accident that's how
your mind controls you another self-deception mechanism is not being
conscious of your own ego reactions this is closely related
to emotions but it's a slightly separate thing have you
noticed that your ego reacts in situations where your self
agenda is threatened anytime that there's a significant threat to
your self agenda your ego reacts with all kinds of
emotions it flares up it gets agitated it gets defensive
it gets hostile gets angry gets offended it gets upset
why is this well because your egos job is to
maintain itself and to maintain you as you are and
to not allow any kind of change and this doesn't
just pertain to physical threats to your survival so it's
not that if I just put a gun to your
head that you're gonna get angry and upset and afraid
of course that's obviously the case but it happens in
much more subtle ways for example you could be an
academic scientist and you could be working on a book
you could be writing a dissertation you could be doing
some very serious physical scientific like hard-nosed work maybe you're
a physicist and you're doing hard physical work not physical
work but I mean you know physicist work and and
then you go to a conference and that this conference
other physicists are talking some other physicist gets up on
stage he starts talking about a theory which conflicts with
your theory and all of a sudden you notice yourself
getting emotional you're getting heated up you're getting afraid you're
getting defensive you're starting to call him names in your
mind starting to judge and criticize him and maybe you
even want to stand up and shout this person how
dare you say these things it's ridiculous what you're saying
is ridiculous it's unscientific it's it's preposterous it's lunacy and
why do you sort of feel that way because his
model is threatening your model and you've been working on
this model for five years your entire career is riding
on it you've been writing a book for the last
three years what's gonna happen to your book if your
model gets disproven but of course your minds not gonna
make any of this apparent to you the way your
mind is gonna react is just with name-calling and criticizing
and projecting and demonizing so you're gonna demonize that guy
up on the stage even though he might be right
because what's your mind really cares about is not the
truth but defending your agenda and your agenda is to
pay the bills to feed your children to support your
wife or your husband with your career that's your primary
agenda it's not the truth you like to tell yourself
that you're the scientific person who loves the truth but
that's a big pile of [ __ ] what you
really care about is you care about defending your position
and you also care about your intellectual defence of your
intellectual positions so you've bought in as the scientist into
this theory and now you really think the world works
according to this theory so you're not just gonna give
that up in a sort of cool rational objective manner
not at all you're gonna be very emotional about it
and the deception here is that people aren't conscious of
this people do not generally acknowledge the egoic reactions which
influence everything they're doing and science is especially bad at
acknowledging these egoic reactions within science for example science doesn't
like to admit the influence of psychology and emotions upon
the entire reasoning process because that sort of admits that
the reasoning process is corrupt and that it's not the
primary process science likes to pretend that emotions in psychology
those are secondary factors and that really reason is the
primary process no reason is actually the secondary process psychology
and emotions and ego that's the primary process but how
many scientific books or how many philosophical books talk about
ego talk about psychology talk about emotions very few very
few and of course you should expect that because why
would the mind talk about these things the mind hides
all these things so that the mind can go about
fulfilling its agenda using size to fulfill its agenda size
not about truth size is about advancing humanity first and
foremost truth secondarily another deception mechanism is projection this is
a huge one projection is what you do when there
is something within yourself that you don't want to admit
to yourself so what you do is you deny that
it's in yourself and you project it out onto others
and therefore you demonize those other people for having that
so for example people love to project onto terrorists and
say all those terrorists look how evil and selfish they
are but what about you how evil and selfish are
you see you don't want to admit it within yourself
so you project it Alun on to the terrorists or
you project it out on to the Muslims or you
project it out on to some other group of people
or you project out on to me as the teacher
as a teacher I've been really amazed to see how
much projection happens on to me because I interact with
thousands of people people write me comments and you send
me emails and I read many of them I've read
probably over ten thousand comments and pieces of feedback throughout
my entire career so far and and wow it's amazing
because I see people projecting all their own personal problems
and issues on to me because that's what the mine
does the mind tends to kind of work off of
its own assumptions and its own issues so if you're
afraid you're gonna project that fear onto me or if
you're angry about something gonna project that onto me or
if you're worried about some problem you're gonna project that
onto me of course that's a huge self-deception trap especially
when it comes to learning about spirituality or about personal
development there's gonna be a lot of projecting that happens
and you've got to be very careful about being conscious
of that or you will not grow properly you're not
gonna learn the lessons another mechanism is distraction and red
herrings I actually have shot a whole episode about this
go check out my episode about distraction and the subtitle
for that episode was actually the egos favorite defense mechanism
distraction that's right because distraction is so powerful all the
ego has to do or the mind has to do
is just to to dangle a red herring in front
of you and you're gonna go chasing that red herring
for five or ten years ignoring the truth ignoring self-reflection
it's a very powerful mechanism and there's just so much
to be said about it go go watch that episode
it's a pretty in-depth episode about distraction crusading is another
sub deception mechanism and it also has to do with
projection and with distraction have you noticed these people who
go on Crusades they love to be defenders of things
like morality or religion or science or atheism or rationalism
or whatever they're crusading for this they build a whole
career around crusading for some kind of cause what is
this but a self-deception what is this but a distraction
from doing what from self reflecting from doing inner work
because when you're crusading against those evil people over there
or those deluded people over there what are you not
doing you're not looking inwards at your own delusions it's
a very sneaky mechanism how about addiction as a mechanism
of self-deception a huge one I have a whole episode
about addictions called overcoming addiction go check that one out
it's also very in-depth episode about all the may can
except addiction the real root causes of it and how
addiction is basically just a form of distraction and there
I talked about drug addiction and porn addiction and sex
addiction and TV addiction or an addiction food addiction all
these addictions and these are actually the least deceptive of
them the most deceptive addictions are the subtle addictions and
I actually have a separate episode about subtle addictions which
most people don't even realize are addictions the psychological addictions
which our society holds as just normal cuz see it's
obvious when you're addicted to heroin it's obvious you're a
heroin addict when you're due to alcohol it's pretty obvious
we're addicted to porn it's also sort of obvious but
what's not obvious is when you're addicted to overthinking when
you're dictated daydreaming when you're addicted to judging and criticizing
when you're addicted to resenting people for their success this
sort of stuff very subtle addictions so check out my
episode about that for more on that another mechanism is
believing that science has figured it all out or that
science will figure everything out if given enough time this
is a huge one I see these days you know
people just tend to say oh well science will figure
it out or science has figured it out or you
know size is just the best that we can do
so Lea what do you expect for me science people
just all have science science is the answer to all
these questions to all these psychological issues no it's not
there are certain things that science doesn't cover at all
it's not within the domain of science design it's a
limited domain thing it's not all encompassing and then the
most important aspects of life science doesn't tackle at all
like personal development I mean it can tackle it there's
certain fields of psychology and cognitive science that do tackle
some of these things but generally not nearly enough that
you can actually use that information to actually grow yourself
that's a that's a whole another level of of thing
that we're talking about another mechanism of deception is having
pet theories like that scientist I was talking about pet
theories are a really dangerous thing because we overtime as
we grow we develop these worldviews and then we tend
to want our worldviews to stay the same it's actually
uncomfortable for the mind to change worldviews so once I
have a theory like evolution once I have a theory
like the Big Bang once I have a theory about
like quantum mechanics or some molecular thing or I have
this thing or what is my pet theories I want
them to be that way you know I want it
to be true and it seems like it's true but
then contrary evidence can come about with more research that
starts to disprove these pet theories but of course I
like my pet theory more than I care about truth
or reality so I'm gonna stick with my pet theory
and I'm gonna use rare various kinds of rationalizations to
to cling to my pet theory this becomes a huge
sticking point for many people a huge source of self-deception
and of course not just scientific people do this but
religious people do this people in government do this have
you noticed how ideological politicians get and they have their
pet theories about Oh raising taxes will do this or
lowering taxes will do this or gun control will do
this or not controlling guns will do that or helping
out there you know starting this war is gonna do
this and they they don't test any of that scientifically
those are just all their pet theories and they just
believe in them regardless of any evidence and then of
course what they do is they give their own theories
special treatment they criticize all the other theories but they
don't subject their own pet theories to nearly the same
level of rigor or critique and then that leads to
self-deception which brings us to confirmation bias as the next
soft deception mechanism confirmation bias cherry-picking evidence and also narrative
making in general the way the mind works is that
it it tends to assume a thing and then build
a narrative to fit the assumptions and then it tends
to cherry-pick evidence the kind that it wants not the
disconcerning kind but the confirming kind to bolster this narrative
and this is the classic cognitive bias called confirmation bias
this is a huge huge thing I'll talk about it
in a dedicated episode the next mechanism is under estimating
paradigms and what I call paradigm blindness most people don't
appreciate what a paradigm is and I have a whole
episode about under staring parrot or how paradigms work go
check that one out which goes into great length about
the various kinds of paradigms that exist and this phenomenon
called paradigm lock or paradigm blindness where you are stuck
inside of a paradigm and you're not able to look
at evidence outside the paradigm because you don't recognize that
you're stuck inside of a paradigm this is a big
problem for science a big problem for religion it's a
big problem for for all ideologies the next mechanism is
taking basic things for granted things like existence life matter
energy space time government money people take these things for
granted people just assume that oh well these things just
are the way reality is couldn't be any other way
what is there to know about these things they don't
really question them very deeply but actually is questioning of
these very most basic things that's that least of some
of the most profound insights you could have about reality
and it's within these taken for granted very fundamental building
blocks of reality that the mind deceives you the most
because it can hide so much stuff in these basic
elements because it knows that you're not going to question
it you're not going to question time you're going to
question matter or energy or government or life or existence
you're gonna question any of these things that's how your
mind gets away with so much another mechanism is question
begging this is huge huge and it's really obvious with
religious people when they beg question question begins reasoning in
a circle it's it's posing a question about something but
then answering it and assuming the thing you're trying to
actually investigate but it's also a very big problem for
philosophy is a very big proper science for example try
to get a scientifically minded person to question whether the
brain actually is real they will tend to beg the
question in that situation because you'll say well what if
the brain isn't real and they say well Leo how
can it not be real after all we can cut
open your skull and we see some some neurons in
there so there's the brain there we go proof that
the brain is real but that's not proof of the
brain is being real that's begging the question I'm asking
you those neurons you're looking at as you're looking at
them where are they themselves located are the neurons of
the brain located and get another brain where are they
located you will say oh they're located in a universe
and where does how do you know there's a universe
because it's in your brain because it's in your mind
see it's just it's completely circular logic this is just
one example of many other examples I could cite of
how people beg the question it's a it's really quite
a disgusting and very self biased way of reasoning and
it's extremely self deceptive basically your mind is able to
get away with with with murder with this sort of
question bag and you can construct an entire reality from
scratch through question begging the next mechanism is judgment criticism
and name-calling this is huge it's not even possible to
speak with most people about many of these concepts because
they'll immediately judge criticize name call demonize and completely shut
down their mind to having this conversation because most people
are addicted to judgment and to criticism and our society
reinforces that with everything you see on the news with
all the political criticism you see around and all the
people around you who are so critical and this leads
to to the self-deception of closed-mindedness so people so many
people are so closed-minded to new ideas that that's why
I had to talk about radical open-mindedness so much when
I was starting actualised org because like I knew that
the idea is that I wanted to present to you
guys were just not going to be accepted if it
wasn't pointed out to you how closed mindedness works how
open lioness works and how important open mindedness is actually
being able to do investigation because you see if you're
closed minded to something that means you can't seriously go
and read a book about it or have a conversation
about it or invest $1,000 to do a research experiment
into it how are you going to do research if
you're already closed minded to the results of the research
to be a effective researcher and to be really in
for the scientific method to really work it has to
be approached with radical radical open mindedness which most people
are not able to do if you're a scientific person
radical with- is critical for you that's how all new
discoveries are made within science and mathematics and logic and
these sorts of hard fields it's the most open-minded people
who make these discoveries despite all the closed-minded people that
try to convince them that they're wrong have you noticed
that that's how the history of science works and closely
related to that is the next self deception mechanism which
I call New Age bias this is the aversion that
rational and scientific people have towards whoo New Age seeming
ideas or concepts or religious type stuff it's like someone
starts talking about chakras and immediately you're like ah chakras
ah why are you talking about this stuff it's so
on scientific it's and you get so judgmental about it
oh it's so new agey oh that's so wishy-washy oh
that's such a hippie thing to say that's just a
particular form of closed-mindedness which a lot of people have
these days and it really keeps them from advancing and
growing to the highest levels of personal development you can't
really get into spirituality unless you're willing to open yourself
up to some of these woowoo New Age concepts because
you know what some of them are actually true and
some of them are actually really important they've just been
sort of ridiculed so much in popular culture because our
popular culture is at a very low level of consciousness
our popular culture is extremely materialistic and very gross it
doesn't talk about subtle stuff that's why when you hear
subtle concepts but you're coming from this gross materialistic culture
then it sounds like hippy new-age womb stuff and then
you just dismiss it as oh it's just nonsense when
in fact it's not nonsense you could really benefit from
some of those ideas now I'm not saying all of
them are true I'm not saying there's not [ __
] in there there's some [ __ ] mixed in
there as well but in general you have to be
radically open-minded here if you want to not be self
deceived so a lot of people to see themselves because
they react against the new-age quality of certain teachings and
another sub component of this mechanism is dismissing the occult
and mystical and paranormal phenomena it's almost impossible for me
to talk about paranormal phenomena with you guys because I
will be immediately criticized for it and labeled a hippy
and I'll be questioned and torn apart with logic and
reason and arguments and all the asking for proof all
of this as if this sort of phenomena is subject
to that kind of gross arguing and this is sort
of armchair philosophy that these so-called skeptics like to do
doesn't work that way at all the fact is is
that there is some validity to the occult and to
mystical and paranormal phenomena again I'm not saying all of
it is true but there's some validity there and it's
worthwhile for you to be open-minded to that otherwise you're
gonna deceive yourself how about the next mechanism blaming scapegoating
and demonizing this is very common you see scapegoating done
by societies throughout history someone is always blamed for society's
problems it's usually a smaller group of people who can't
defend themselves some minority group that's how the Nazis did
it with the Jews and it was done back in
the in the Greek and Roman Roman times and of
course it's done to this very day what you're seeing
in politics today is a lot of it is just
plain scapegoating and that's because the mind hates to take
responsibility for its own problems it hates to admit itself
that it is the cause of all of its suffering
it doesn't like to admit that so a low conscious
mind will deceive itself and project outwards and find a
scapegoat and then it will blame that scapegoat it will
demonize that scapegoat and it will attack that scapegoat and
that becomes a huge distraction from doing what turning inwards
to investigate how am i the cause of this see
and a subcomponent of this is also playing victim so
if you're not scapegoating others and blaming others then your
victim your playing victim yourself you're thinking of yourself as
the victims like oh poor me why was I born
with these bad genetics with this bad physical appearance with
this low intellect with this problem here with that problem
they're such a bad family and this and that I'm
not able to do anything I'm not able to grow
I'm not able to meditate I can't focus I have
this problem I have that problem and then you're stuck
and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and it's extremely self
deceptive once you buy into all these victim narratives that
you tell yourself and then your mind will use confirmation
bias to cherry-pick all the evidence that's around you it'll
scan all the disconfirming evidence it'll find all the confirming
evidence to confirm all of your victim narratives to yourself
the next self-deception mechanism is arguing and debating this one
is a huge distraction in part one of this series
I talked about the problem with arguing and debating so
I won't cover it much here but just to point
out to you that so many people distract themselves with
arguing and debating that they never it never even occurs
to them that they need to be doing work on
themselves introspecting contemplating really looking inwards on themselves rather than
going out there and debating other people that's the same
problem as crusading the next mechanism is false skepticism and
debunking a lot of people take on the identity of
the skeptic the cynic or the debunker and so what
they do is they play the hyper rationalist and they
go around and they point out all the stuff that
hasn't been a hundred percent conclusively proven with double-blind clinical
studies and this so they said oh chakras debunked it's
like oh vac you know vaccinations and autism run all
debunked and this is debunked and that's a bug in
so they just go around debunking everything and it's like
acupuncture has been debunked and and meditations been debunked and
this thing's been debunked and nothing's been debunked and they
think that by doing this at they're defending truth but
of course that's all in exteriorization of projection while they're
doing that what are they not doing they're not debunking
their own minds constructions they're not self reflecting see my
episode called true versus false skepticism I cover that a
lot of depth there the next mechanism is human species
bias this is a this is a very profound self-deception
trap then almost everybody commits and especially science prone to
this human species bias is basically taking the human perspective
of reality as though it were Universal and the only
one for example many scientists believe that mathematics is a
universal language and that if we can communicate with other
alien species let's say there's an alien species some on
some distant galaxy or star system we're not going to
communicate with it with it in English we're gonna use
mathematics and supposedly we can send it some mathematical formulas
and we'll be able to figure it out because mathematics
is universal there's nothing Universal about mathematics there's nothing Universal
about science there's nothing Universal about physics all of this
is a human species specific way of understanding reality it's
highly contingent upon our neuro chemistry it's highly contingent upon
our cultural assumptions our metaphysical assumptions and not only is
human understanding not universal it's not even global humans can't
even agree with themselves on what reality is and why
it is the way that it is and what we
should do about it even scientists don't agree with each
other about everything so to say that this is universal
knowledge there's no such thing as universal knowledge this is
a complete taking for granted the only reason that that
we tend to assume that our knowledge is universal is
because we have it interacted with any other intelligent species
in the universe yet and so because we have that
long lack of contrast we have nothing to contrast our
own opinions and models with we think that we're so
great and it's so it's all universal well here's one
prediction that I'll make if we ever discover aliens out
there intelligent aliens in the distant stars and we make
contact with them what we will be learning from them
and we'll be shocked to learn is that almost everything
we think we know about the universe and nature and
reality is highly dependent on our human understanding our human
biology psychology and our predispositions it's not at all going
to be what those other intelligent aliens come up with
their understanding is gonna be completely dependent on their brain
chemistry on their culture and a lot of other factors
and it will be completely different from us they will
have another way of doing science they'll have another way
of doing mathematics they'll have completely different ways of interacting
with reality like ways you can't even imagine which are
gonna be of course dependent on their physiology people don't
grasp the significance of this people also sometimes say like
Ollie oh but if if everybody in the world just
becomes enlightened all the humans there will have peace on
earth that's a complete self-deception based on the human species
bias because notice what you're assuming there you're assuming that
the only thing that really matters is the human species
and that as long as everybody becomes enlightened and every
human is is peaceful to themselves that that brings peace
to the whole earth but what about the hundreds of
millions of other species that exist on this planet that
you're ignoring are you taking into account the cockroaches the
ants the tuna fish the birds the elephants are you
taking all of that into account how much violence and
evil does the human species perpetuate upon all the other
species but see we don't care about that we discount
that it doesn't matter to us that when we build
a new city we have to kill perhaps a hundred
million cockroaches that doesn't matter to us at all so
even if everyone's gonna be enlightened there's no way you're
gonna just get peace on earth there's no such thing
as peace on earth because life is inherently destructive Ferhat
to have life you need death to have life you
need to have evil you need to have selfishness and
that's something you need to start becoming conscious of that's
not something that's so easily mmm ended the next mechanism
of self-deception is dismissing all of this as mere philosophy
my mom loves to use that one on me all
the time anytime our conversation gets even a little bit
deep about any existential issue it's always like Oh leo
but that's just mere philosophy what good is that gonna
do me it's just philosophy is that gonna help me
feed myself is that gonna help me improve my job
no so it's just philosophy huge self-deception another one is
pleading well who really knows Leo yeah you're right we
can't be certain about anything it's all up for grabs
it's all just a wash we can't know anything so
you're wrong too everyone's wrong well everyone could be wrong
and so we don't know what to do so I'll
just go back to watching TV that's a huge self-deception
this sort of muddying the waters the mind loves to
muddy the waters so much that hey guess what I
don't have to do anything I can sit back and
watch TV and behave exactly the way that I've always
behaved that's perfect for the mind that's the perfect self-deception
because all of the mind wants to do is to
maintain homeostasis how does it do that by getting you
to just do what you've always done so any reason
or justification for the mind to keep doing what it's
always been doing is perfect because for you to uncover
the truth that's something new you see that's new that
requires a change a radical shift all the mine that
has to do is just to prevent any radical shift
or change from happening and it'll guarantee that you will
never discover the inner workings of the mind and you'll
never shatter this illusion that you're in and the last
mechanism I'll mention here for now is all of your
cultural preferences so when I was talking about indoctrination the
way that happens one of the ways that indoctrination works
is of course your culture programs you with all of
your preferences the kind of food you like the kind
of men and women you find sexually attractive the kind
of entertainment that you enjoy television books comedy the kind
of jokes that you'll laugh at the kind of religion
that you prefer like do you prefer Christianity more or
Islam more and you might say Oh leo but I'm
an atheist I don't like any religion yeah but which
one still if you had to live around some Christians
or some some Muslims which one would you prefer see
you have those preferences of course you do because your
culture imprinted you with those and it's really hard to
get rid of your cultural preferences a lot of that
stuff is literally hardwired into your skull and it's really
difficult to change which is why it's difficult oftentimes to
teach non-duality to people because non-duality tends to be very
culturally specific there's all these different traditions and schools of
non-duality christian ones buddhist ones Taoist ones Jewish ones Islamic
ones you know so many and yet every one of
those cultures has a preference for its own way so
it's really difficult to take a teaching from one culture
and then to translate it into another culture it's oftentimes
gonna reject it and then people get very closed-minded about
that and this becomes a huge self-deception because they can't
see past their own culture because your mind will just
accept whatever culture was imprinted into it as the best
one no one ever asks themselves wait a minute is
my culture really the best one what if it's the
worst one why do I feel like it's the best
one could that just be our 'but rarey that I
was just imprinted if I was like born in Australia
wouldn't I believe Australian cultures the best or if I
was born in the Middle East wouldn't I believe Middle
Eastern culture is the best of course I would because
that's how the mine works it just adopts whatever it's
fed first it's really that simple but people don't get
that they cling to their culture and it's like no
we got to preserve our culture our culture is so
important I read an article online the other day that
the French president in this article he was extolling the
virtues of French culture and the French baguette and he
actually got like some World Heritage Foundation I don't know
the name of the foundation but some like important world
foundation has actually inducted the French baguette piece of [
__ ] bread the French baguette and the recipe for
how to make French baguettes into they're like cultural archives
to preserve that culture because we don't ever want it
to get lost because to the French the baguette is
so important I mean it's ridiculous that the French president
would even be talking about this is ridiculous you know
of all the things you could be talking about in
the universe that you know of relative significance you spend
your time talking about a French [ __ ] baguette
and how important it is and of course I'm not
picking on the French here I mean every culture does
this American culture does this and Japanese culture does this
Asian culture it doesn't matter what culture you are because
cultures are highly biased of course they are because culture
is our largest like collective egos and of course a
collective ego also exists within every individual that's how the
collective ego is maintained you are its host so to
speak it's like the virus inside of you that's where
it lives you're the medium through which it spreads so
I have only covered about half of the list I
still have about 30 more self-deception mechanisms to talk about
but it's taking me longer than I anticipated so I
think what needs to happen here is I have to
shoot a part three I didn't want to I thought
I get it all done in just two parts but
I can see that there's so much more or left
to talk about because um each one of these takes
time to explain and even here I'm just breezing through
them I'm barely even scratching the surface of each one
of these so there's gonna be a part three coming
next week so stay tuned for that and this is
gonna be it here what I want you to notice
as far as these self-deception mechanisms is I want you
to start to notice them within yourself I want you
to start to notice them around people who are around
you within your culture notice them happening notice how sneaky
and tricky they are notice how difficult it is to
change your behavior such that you're not falling into these
traps constantly over and over again you see it's not
about just avoiding this trap once in your life many
of these traps happen to you on a daily basis
you have to avoid them every single day over and
over and over again it's like walking through a minefield
and it's a very long minefield to walk and it's
very tricky so don't give yourself too much credit just
because you hear me talking about all this does not
make you immune to it this is like step one
of you successfully navigating this minefield is just learning you're
inside a minefield most people don't even know they're inside
a minefield so yeah that's a very important fact to
learn but that doesn't solve your problem does it now
you need very accurate testing equipment a mine detector you
need a lot of really good ones that you're gonna
use to slowly get yourself through this thing so make
sure you stay tuned for next week for more of
these maps of where the mines are so you can
navigate your way around them alright that's it for today
please click the like button for me right there please
come check out actualize that work as well look at
the stuff I have on my website that's exclusive I've
got the blog with exclusive content and some exclusive videos
that I'm posting there you can't find anywhere else I've
got the forum come check out that chat with people
share your ideas share questions share your frustrations and confusions
check out the life purpose course check out the book
list the book list has a lot of information on
it and books that will help you to navigate this
minefield and lastly just stick around with me for a
lot more in-depth coverage of each one of these elements
so there's going to be a part three but then
in the future you know in the next year or
two as I'm shooting more content I will be picking
out some of the most important of these self deception
mechanisms just like I've done in the past and I'll
be shooting dedicated episodes about those and that's gonna be
very helpful to you so make sure you stay tuned
for that you
