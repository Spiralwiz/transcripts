            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/KV7dHrc_r9g' target='_blank'>Why Men Cheat - And 8 Ways To Keep Your Man Loyal</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding male attraction</b>: Men are primarily attracted to a woman's physical appearance, particularly her body, face, and ass. Confidence and personality are not the main factors for attraction in men. 
</li><li><b>Instantaneous attraction in men</b>: Men can become attracted to a woman within a fraction of a second or up to a few seconds if they are mentally analyzing her attractiveness. If a man takes a long time to become attracted to a woman, it likely means he isn't genuinely interested in her.
</li><li><b>Understanding the opposite sex to have successful relationships</b>: The importance of understanding how the opposite sex thinks is emphasised to have successful relationships, and briefly touches on how this connects to cheating.
</li><li><b>Sexual attraction and dating dynamics in men vs. women</b>: In dating, men can become attracted instantly, creating more opportunities to find someone they have potential chemistry with. Understanding this dynamic can help navigate the dating world, even though there's an imbalance compared to women who typically need more time to feel attracted.
</li><li><b>Evolutionary forces in dating and attraction</b>: Evolutionary forces play a heavy role in dating and attraction, as individuals are driven towards finding the best mate possible. 
</li><li><b>Attraction to high-value partners and the desire to date up</b>: Both men and women aim to attract the highest value partner. This desire to date up is a natural instinct and a reality in the dating world. 
</li><li><b>Cheating in relationships and human nature</b>: The video mentions that both men and women cheat, although it's hinted at that men may do so more frequently due to their visual nature. The video also suggests humans are not naturally monogamous, but doesn't dwell on this topic.
</li><li><b>Attraction and Value in Relationships</b>: Humans have an instinctual desire to date someone "out of their league" or of a higher value. However, the value system differs for men and women, with different attributes being prioritized and considered attractive. The partner one attracts is usually at the same level of value, creating difficulties for low-value individuals to attract high-value partners.
</li><li><b>Desire to Look for Better Options</b>: If one attracts a partner of significantly higher or lower value, the higher value individual will instinctively be on the lookout for a better option. This stems from humans' instinctual desire to find the best mate possible.
</li><li><b>Cheating in Both Genders</b>: While both men and women cheat, men are assumed to do so more frequently due to their visually driven nature, which leads to more frequent attraction.
</li><li><b>Human Monogamy and Polyamory</b>: Evolutionarily, humans are not naturally monogamous but rather polyamorous, meaning they tend to have multiple sexual partners. This natural tendency does not necessarily prevent the formation of monogamous relationships, but it can create challenges in maintaining them.
</li><li><b>Specific Reasons Why Men Cheat</b>: Reasons for infidelity can vary but often include bad or stale sex, lack of sex, physical appearance changes such as weight gain, loss of passion in the relationship, the allure of easy sex, the desire to upgrade for a more attractive partner, the effect of alcohol leading to impulsive decisions, and an individual's character traits.
</li><li><b>Men's Temptation and "Trading Up"</b>: Men can be easily tempted to cheat if sex is offered readily, particularly if they are intoxicated. They might cheat if they perceive a chance to "trade up" for a more attractive or higher-value partner, especially if they feel the current relationship dynamics are unbalanced in terms of value.
</li><li><b>Bad Character</b>: Some men simply have bad character traits, being dishonest, unfaithful, and immoral. A man with such a character tends to cheat not only in relationships, but in other areas of life as well. It's therefore important to screen for such qualities when choosing a partner.
</li><li><b>Sex and Physical Attraction</b>: The quality and regularity of sex in a relationship also plays a major role. Good sex can discourage a man from cheating as it fulfills an essential need. If the relationship lacks and drops its sexual frequency dramatically, it's a red flag, and the likelihood of the man cheating increases.
</li><li><b>Importance of Physical Appearance</b>: Men are attracted to physically fit and attractive women. Letting oneself go, such as through significant weight gain or lack of self-care, can increase the temptation for a man to cheat as his visual attraction to his partner decreases.
</li><li><b>Passion and Excitement in the Relationship</b>: To prevent a relationship from growing stale and losing its passion, it's important to maintain adventure and excitement. This could involve planning dates or coming up with new ideas for experiences to share.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Paranoia and Bitterness</b>: It's important not to be overly paranoid or bitter about the possibility of cheating. Instead, focus on areas that you can control such as the quality of the sex, your physical appearance, and the passion in the relationship, at the same time being keen to notice potential red flags. Accepting that cheating is part of human nature could help create healthier expectations and reactions within the relationship.
