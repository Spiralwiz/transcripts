hey this is Leo for ash lies dot-org and in
this episode I'm going to be talking about the trap
of projection especially your tendency to project onto teachers and
mentors there's a nasty phenomenon that I want to talk
about which is called projection this episode is going to
be all about projection all about the subtleties of projection
which is especially problematic for those of us who are
self-help junkies and who read a lot of self-help books
go to seminars retreats watch a lot of videos if
you're watching various people on YouTube or other places that
sort of thing if you're reading and listening to a
lot of audiobooks right you're coming into contact with teachers
and mentors that's what I mean by teachers and mentors
and so yes even though you do a lot of
projection onto all sorts of other people in your life
we're going to talk about that but mostly what I
want to focus on here is the trap of projecting
onto teachers and mentors because this becomes especially problematic as
you go deeper into your development just as a story
I remember I was reading uh some some kind of
like yoga some sort of yoga book it was like
there's a story there about some uh hindu yogi and
basically he went around and he was like this this
yoga master right enlightened and knew how to meditate and
all this kind of stuff and he was very much
revered and this this one student he had a brief
encounter with this guy and then the master left and
then the student was so enraptured by the master days
at all i got to go find the master again
so he spent two years traveling all around india looking
for the master because master was just like a wandering
ascetic yogi right and then the student finally found him
after two years but he finds the master the master
is a debauch ER and he's there cavorting with with
naked women and drinking booze and and eating lots of
food and so he's living this very materialistic lifestyle this
master and the student what he does is he just
ignores all that and just comes up to the master
and just proclaims his faith in the master and his
desire to learn from him and that was the Masters
test that was the Masters test to see what the
master was testing him on is whether he would be
judging the master and projecting his own stuff onto the
master by seeing him in this sort of materialistic situation
now that's just a story I'm not saying it's true
or anything but that's just a clever little story which
I think illustrates what I want to communicate here about
projection I know that um the reason that I wanted
to even shoot this episode is because over the last
year I've traveled to quite a few different retreats about
consciousness like some really deep advanced um inner work type
stuff with various teachers and gurus and some very profoundly
profoundly enlightened people like wow just like mind-blowing levels of
consciousness these people have like you would not get to
that point if you did 40 years of non-stop work
that's the level they're at and what I found though
is that I'm sitting there for a week at this
retreat you know learning a lot of learning a lot
of great stuff but also projecting a lot of my
issues onto the teacher and for me the way this
happens is it a lot of like intellectual philosophical sort
of criticisms nitpicking of what they're saying or they say
one thing that I don't agree with during the whole
week and then I I'm like wrapped up in it
and I'm thinking about it and then that makes me
question everything and maybe I'm thinking like oh well you
know how can they be so ignorant if they're so
enlightened how could they be so ignorant about this thing
or about that thing or you know they were factually
wrong on this point here so these little criticisms and
also sometimes I found out like personal things about these
teachers were like oh this person he was divorced twice
I didn't know that I've been going to this retreat
now multiple times and only now I find out he's
been divorced twice like wow that that changes my perspective
because I assume that you know he had this whole
relationship thing handled and so that makes me start out
you know project so this is projecting of my stuff
on to the teacher and of course what this does
this interferes the reason this topic is so important is
because it interferes with your ability to really learn what
the teacher has to offer you see so I've started
to catch myself doing this and that's been very important
because otherwise what happens is that I just kind of
go into monkey mind into my own stuff and I
don't really see my own agenda here and then I
don't get the the full value of the workshop or
the teaching and I've noticed that not only do I
do this with workshops I do this with authors too
like if I'm listening to an audiobook or I'm reading
some sort of book I make projections which are all
to do with me but not much to do with
the actual teaching you know some teacher will talk about
some concept I don't believe in like maybe past lives
and then all of a sudden now I can't listen
to that teacher anymore because like all past lives you
know if you believe in past lives then I can't
really listen to you or this teacher uses some kind
of words that I don't maybe quite jive with and
then it's like ah but that that now makes me
kind of go into this criticizing mode run criticizing the
teacher for doing this doing that and this is wrong
and I start to nitpick and I have a whole
argument in my mind about it and I notice that
this sets me back I've also noticed that this happens
with a lot of people who are following me because
I'm sensitive to it from both ends I'm sensitive to
it when I'm doing it I'm also now sensitive to
it when it's being done to me because it happens
to me quite a bit but before I get into
that let's talk about what projection is let's define it
what is projection and of course projection not only happens
with your teachers and mentors but it happens with every
buddy that you run into in your life so your
parents your kids your spouse your girlfriend your boyfriend your
friends your boss your co-workers all that stuff right so
what it is is when your needs your fears your
cravings and your agenda and ego color or distort how
you see people okay that's what I'm defining as projection
it's when you basically superimpose your emotional baggage your own
stuff that's happening with you all your own [ __
] so to speak and you superimpose that on to
others and you interact with them without being aware that
oh this is my [ __ ] it's not really
their [ __ ] and it's not really pertinent to
them at all and it says nothing about them even
though I think that this stuff is about them it's
really all about me but I'm not seeing it and
that's what projection is also with projection you're making a
lot of assumptions about the other person without really knowing
them too well you make a lot of assumptions about
them about what they say or about what they believe
or about what their personal life is like based on
your needs right on my needs if I'm doing it
I'm doing it I'm making these assumption based on my
needs not based on actual reality and the facts of
what I know about this person but just based on
my needs like maybe I have a need to know
about enlightenment and then that becomes my need and I
project that need onto the teacher where in fact maybe
he doesn't care if I know about enlightenment or not
but I do that's my need and then that distorts
her colors now my interactions and my ability to listen
to him or maybe I have a need of like
security financial security or maybe I have a need of
of love and being in a relationship and staying married
but the things that the teacher is telling me might
mean that my marriage is going to dissolve or it
might mean that my financial situation is going to get
worse or something like that or might just might seem
as though it's threatening to me in some way right
because what he's saying might run counter to my needs
and my defense mechanisms around my needs and I make
also of assumptions about that on him also what happens
is thinking what the other person is thinking so it's
like you try to assume you know what is that
person thinking oh he's probably thinking this and he's thinking
this and he's saying this like maybe he thinks I'm
bad maybe he thinks I'm a bad student maybe this
person there thinks that I'm fat or that I'm ugly
or that I'm being too noisy or I'm being inconsiderate
or that I'm not dressed really nice right and so
this kind of trying to think what the other person
is thinking this is a classic neurotic symptom which of
course produces a lot of anxiety produces shyness produces introversion
produces a lot of suffering for you and of course
this happens with teachers you do it to teachers is
you try to think what they're thinking but probably if
you're dealing with an advanced teacher then you're not actually
thinking what they're thinking and this is different than actually
stepping into somebody else's shoes and changing perspectives I think
that looking at the world from other people's perspectives is
a very powerful strategy and I'll talk more about that
in future episodes so there's nothing wrong with that what
I'm saying here is that you're not really doing that
what you're doing here is you're sort of stepping into
the other person's shoes but still keeping your mind and
all your baggage and all your emotional stuff which is
not really adopting their perspective that's like you being blind
to your own perspective it's really the opposite also a
lot of judgments and criticisms get made a lot of
them are all often very petty ones like you could
judge or criticize a person's shirt a person is standing
up there luxury and you're judging and criticizing his shirt
which has nothing to do with the lecture or you're
judging criticizing his haircut or something like that or you
know they might be more pertinent judgments so that goes
on there's a lot of stories you start to create
stories about this person about their personal life stuff that
you have no idea about really but you're creating this
whole narrative in your mind and then that person is
sort of now seen in that context is artificial fantasy
construct that you've created now the person is in that
milieu and that of course changes how that person is
seen by you and how you feel about that person
and this is of course how enemies get created so
the creation of enemies is classic projection if you feel
like you have enemies in life it's because you're projecting
them you don't really have enemies in life that's a
projection and also you create disagreements right so if you're
ever disagreeing vehemently with somebody especially you you're driving down
the road in your car and you're still disagreeing with
them even though they're not there you're disagree with them
in your head that's projection and also generally what I
found is this kind of feeling like you know the
person just because you've listened to them a couple of
times like maybe you've gone to a couple of lectures
or watched a couple of videos maybe you even watched
a hundred videos and then you think like okay now
I got the sense of this guy I know who
he is I know his personal story I know his
motivations I know all this kind of stuff when in
fact you don't so like I said there are two
main forms of projection that I want to distinguish here
which is all the other people in your life like
your spouse your family your boss your kids which is
actually the majority of your life so you project a
bunch onto all these people and that's important to look
into because you're not going to have a satisfying life
until you stop all that projecting but here I specifically
want to focus on projecting onto teachers the second form
because I think with teachers it's especially dangerous why is
it dangerous well it is dangerous because see your spouse
your family and your boss and your kids they do
not have the information that you need to self-actualize most
likely they do not have the sites and wisdom and
knowledge that you will need in order to extract yourself
from this deep psychological hole that you find yourself in
from all the delusion that you're in from ego they
will not help you with that most likely now in
some rare cases maybe they could but in most cases
they won't and in fact they'll only drive you deeper
down into that hole but the teachers and mentors they
are really your only lifeline they can help you so
now imagine that the only lifeline you have you cut
that lifeline that's why it's dangerous see because they are
your only source of improving yourself really because in many
cases the people around you can't help you the people
closest to you can't help you and even you are
helpless to help yourself so how do you help yourself
well first of all by getting the right information which
is why actualize that or it exists which is why
thousands of self-help books exist which is why thousands of
seminars are held across the country all around the world
it's a multi-billion dollar industry providing you with very valuable
information except what's the biggest trap that people fall into
with this information well they just dismiss it they cut
that lifeline and they say something as silly as like
all self-help self-help we all know that [ __ ]
doesn't work oh self-help so silly and yeah I've read
a couple of self-help books but what do they really
do for me nothing those people who read self-help books
they're the most neurotic ones at all some little dismissive
thing like that and you have cut yourself off from
uh uh you know billions and billions of bits of
incredibly valuable data which you need to transform your life
and the ego knows what's going on because the egos
job is to stay put the ego doesn't want to
transform and change and self actualize so all the ego
has to do with it really wants to stay be
the same and not to grow is that it just
has to tarnish the messenger the teacher or the mentor
that's the person who can change you the most not
in the sense that they're going to do all the
work for you but that just they have the capacity
to present a new piece of information or a new
insight for you that will actually jostle something in your
mind so that now you're on a new path in
life see your life won't change overnight but over the
years it can change quite a lot but the ego
what will it do it'll tarnish the messenger so that
you don't listen to the messenger and then you can
just stay on your dead-end path and life right now
won't you do a very little exercise very quickly recall
for me all the judgments you've made about teachers or
mentors in your entire life just let your mind cope
with stuff and I mean all the books you've read
of all the seminars you might have gone to of
all the YouTube videos you might have watched of all
the different information you might have received from religious sources
from scientific sources from self-help sources from whatever from me
try to recall any kind of snap judgments that you've
made about those teachers about how they look about their
life about how they talk about the information they present
all that stuff both good and bad ones just try
to get a sense of how many of these judgments
you make that's the only point in this will exercise
right I'm not going anywhere further with this just to
get you aware that you do make a lot of
judgments about your teachers and I want you to just
simply to become more aware of that over time as
you're on this journey because you know what if you're
really serious about self actualizing you're going to have to
get your hands dirty you have to read a lot
of books you have to watch a lot of videos
and sort through a lot of content because you simply
lack the information you need you don't even understand yet
where you need to be going you don't even have
a map of where you need to go in life
so first you're gonna spend a couple of years just
constructing that map and I hope to help you with
that hopefully I have already helped you with that but
just notice in the construction of that map you will
be severely [ __ ] if you project a lot
on to all the different people that you're learning from
and I hope that you are learning from a variety
of people not just from me or from - or
from three but I'm talking dozens if not hundreds that's
the ideal so you get a variety of perspectives and
you kind of you start to see the common patterns
between the teachings viewers project on me all the time
and I've become very sort of sensitive to it actually
I've just developed kind of a thick skin around it
so that the kind of criticism doesn't bother me but
I've become sensitive to the following thing I see because
I read hundreds of comments every day I've probably read
like over a hundred thousand comments left on actualised org
like I you know I kid you not this has
consumed hundreds of hours of my time now you might
wonder well why do that that seems very wasteful well
in a sense it kind of is is a bit
of an addiction reading all these comments I like it
but also I have learned a lot there's a certain
connection with my audience that I feel I have and
a certain understanding of people's problems that I wouldn't otherwise
understood so I'm actually quite grateful for reading all the
comments and I do enjoy it but what I've found
is people make shocking projections on me like all their
[ __ ] issues they project on me it's so
funny and when I see that sometimes it's shocking to
me not in that it hurts me that it's so
painful to me but simply in that wow this person
really believes this thing about me which is totally false
but somehow they got the idea that it's true about
me I don't know where they got this from because
I didn't say it but somehow they came up with
it their mind came up with it concocted that has
nothing and now they really like think that that's who
I am and that this is what my life is
about and this is what my teachings are about and
that's just kind of shocking to me because I can
see the the unconsciousness happening there and then of course
when I see that I always think oh could I
be doing the same thing and then it's like oh
yeah I do the same thing I do the exact
same thing just in different situations to different degrees with
different people and so uh seeing projections being made on
me has made me aware of how I do it
so that's been very helpful but I mean people have
projected so much stuff on me like Leo you're doing
all this just for money that one I've been seeing
quite a lot also I've seen a common one of
like well Leo you're supposed to be enlightened you're supposed
to be this enlightened guy and and then I find
out you're not enlightened or like you do this thing
that doesn't seem like it it fits in with enlightenment
or it's like leo you're not supposed to be doing
drugs because you're talking about personal development so how dare
you talk about psychedelics to or how dare you talk
about sex and spirituality together on the same Channel or
Leo you're not supposed to say [ __ ] in
personal development that's not right you're not uh following your
own advice of being compassionate of being loving what happened
to this developing higher consciousness and developing the capacity for
love and then you say [ __ ] and then
all that goes out the window see what you got
understand that these are your expectations these are your assumptions
right not really mine you're setting these standards you're creating
this and then you're holding me up against that and
then whatever happens happens might be for the good or
for the bad might make me look bad might make
you look good right some of the stuff people say
about me is good and a lot of great stuff
is being said about me which honestly probably doesn't deserve
to be said like some people say Oh Leo you'd
make such a great father how the [ __ ]
would you know if I would make a great father
or some people like Oh leo because you talk about
all this stuff your your life must be so good
you must be so happy uh and I'm not saying
I'm unhappy see gotta be very careful here what I'm
talking you have to take me literally rather than having
all these kind of assumptions behind what I'm saying I
didn't say my life was bad I didn't say my
life was good I'm just kind of like leaving it
open but then see people then interpret that as like
oh this is me leo is actually depressed I'll see
but then that would be your interpretation that I'm not
saying one way or the other or you know sometimes
people are like well Leo you use the word God
or use the word spirituality so kind of words that
I don't like to hear from teachers about personal development
I like the scientific rationale kind of person but why
talking about God and spirituality this has no place here
and I know that I in the past I've been
that way with the self-help teachers at any time they
said the word God I would just steer clear close
the book but that's my issue right or that's your
issue if you had that kind of issue with me
or sometimes people are like Oh Leo you ignored one
of my comments and done it and if you ignore
my comment that means this is this is this why
are you doing it and it's like it's got nothing
to do with me I might have just like been
busy that day but the person has this whole story
about like what why did you ignore my comment um
and that's interesting right that's interesting to me just because
it started it starts to show how much we really
construct these kind of fantasy images of the people we
interact with in life rather than the way that they
actually are we see them as they are for us
which gets us into a lot of trouble in the
end a lot of trouble so yeah those are some
of the projections that people have made about me and
that's all fine I expect that I'm not saying I
mean I'm going to whine about or anything but it's
just uh be careful especially about the more nuanced stuff
that I talk about especially the Enlightenment stuff be very
careful about what kind of projections you make on to
me and not just on to me but on to
any teacher that you listen to and I hope you're
listening to lots and lots of different teachers I want
you to recognize that you don't really know anything about
your tea like if you read somebody's book you almost
have no idea of anything about that person's personal life
you don't know him just from reading his book even
if you read ten books of his nor from watching
a hundred of my videos do you really know anything
about me or my motives or my level of development
or my personal story alright you don't know these things
you really don't know these things but it's very easy
to assume stuff especially with the video format it's easier
to start to assume stuff and even if you meet
people in person like at a seminar you still don't
really know anything about the person even if you spend
a whole week at a seminar with them that's a
very specific context that you're in see and these stories
that you concoct about people and your teachers just be
very careful because what they really do is they are
subtle sneaky distractions from turning inward and doing the work
that you got to be doing on yourself because when
you're busy thinking and fantasizing about other people and how
they're doing something wrong or even how they're doing something
right now even if you love the person and you
think he's awesome that's still a story and is still
a distraction from listening to the information they present to
you because you know what you might love something I'm
saying and then I say something wrong and then you
agree with it just because maybe you have an affinity
towards some personality quirk of mine or whatever and that's
a that's a um that's a setback for you see
it really helps when you get projected on to see
this so right now as little exercise I want you
to think of some time in your life where somebody
assumed something about you projected something on to you that
was completely false but they really thought it was true
of you and they thought that you really were this
this kind of way but it wasn't true at all
and to you it was kind of ridiculous and also
a bit shocking how they could be so clueless or
how they could be so wrong think of a time
like that I'm sure you've experienced that at least once
in your life and the more you can recall those
times the more you can start to appreciate that you
also do that and you do it on both very
gross levels and also very subtle levels uh especially when
you already kind of like the teacher you probably won't
do it on the gross level you probably won't call
him an idiot you probably won't outright demonize him but
there will be some little stuff that you will nitpick
and project that might take you years to realize that
you're actually doing here's the key inside that I want
to give you in this episode is that when you're
relating to other people 99% of the time you're actually
relating to yourself you're not really relating to them it
takes a lot of spiritual purification work a lot of
consciousness work to get to the point where you can
relate to a human being not as he or she
is for you but as they simply are that takes
years of work to get to that point okay this
is huge this is huge this will transform all your
relationships what I'm saying here if you really take this
on as something to correct in your life and the
way you search corrected is just by simply becoming more
aware of at first right awareness here is very curative
in this case with projection all you really got to
do is just to start to see how you're actually
doing it with every individual in your life and especially
with individuals who you disagree with so anybody you're in
disagreement with in your life whether your spouse your family
members your teachers your mentors some author you read that
you didn't like whatever um you have to remind yourself
and remember that it's all about you the disagreement is
about you it's not about them it's not about what
you read in a book it's not about what you
heard on TV is not it's not what the political
candidate said on the television news or some outrageous thing
they did that you disagree with it's not about that
it's all about you and how you're reacting to yourself
your own expectations your own assumptions and your own story
that you created about that person and when you start
to take responsibility for that and ownership for that that's
when your relationships really start to turn around and that's
also when you can really start to learn from people
because until then your minds not really open to what
they have to say not really because you're only listening
for what will serve you and when you start to
notice this you're going to be in shock at first
at just how rarely you actually interact with people without
projecting on them projections not just something that happens 5%
of the time what I'm saying is that projection happens
99.9 percent of the time in your life pick a
person and we could probably write 10 pages of projections
that you make on that person and the closer that
person is to you the more projections you make on
them your family members you make the most projections on
which is why it's so difficult for you to relate
successfully with them so let's try an exercise right now
because it's just me and you here together we only
have one option for this exercise so right now what
I'd like you to do is just to sit there
and look at me and to see me for myself
and not how I am for you see me for
myself not how I am for you this means you
have to notice any positive or negative projections that you've
been making about me about how I look about how
I sound about the quality of the things I say
any stories or some shion's that you've made about me
my personal life how good or bad you think I
am what you think I eat for dinner what do
you think I do when I go to bed at
night or wake up in the morning what kind of
car do you think I Drive like drop all that
and just look at me exactly as I am like
literally with no assumptions just do this for 30 seconds
this means you have to relate to me as an
unknown because you see my head here you hear the
words I'm saying and that's all you have of me
really maybe you have some memories of stuff I said
in the past okay fine you can you can have
those that's fine but nothing more because you really know
nothing more about me which means that you don't really
know who you're dealing with here and that's exactly what
I want you to experience right now experience me as
an unknown and let that be okay it's not good
it's not bad it just is and notice the difference
between listening to me that way looking at me that
way versus a probably the typical way that you interact
with me okay that's the whole exercise now we did
it with me because I'm the only person here uh
who you can look at but I encourage you to
also try this out with other people in your life
try it out with your family members try it out
with your boss co-workers so forth and especially try it
out with any teachers that you're listening to besides myself
this is how I want you to listen to teachers
is as unknowns they are just like messengers who are
livering a message to you there are really strangers there
just like good samaritans maybe hold them as good Samaritans
who are trying to feed you a little bit of
information and your objective whenever you're listening to a teacher
especially talking about a deep advanced topic is to always
be conscious of your own agenda at work as you're
listening to that teacher it's like what are my needs
what are my values what are my ideals here in
this situation what are my fears and insecurities and how
is that coloring what the teacher is teaching me or
what this book is trying to teach me or what
this video is trying to tell me you're going to
start to notice that a lot of stuff comes up
a lot of subtle stuff that you probably weren't conscious
of before you'll start to see your agenda at work
and how much it distorts and what I want you
to do is I want you to pay attention to
that is to turn it back around any criticism adjustment
you have turn those back around on you and recognize
them like oh yeah I'm criticizing that person for being
too religious and what does that say about me oh
that says something about me it says nothing about them
it's all about me you're like I'm criticizing that person
on television for doing something I disagree with what does
that say about me not them about me see what's
really interesting is that the most advanced teachings you can
have in life are also going to be the most
threatening to your ego that's why they're advanced teachings you
don't hear them very often because most people are so
threatened by them that they can't become mainstream you're not
going to hear them on CNN on CNN you hear
non-threatening stuff despite what you might think you know if
you see violence on TV that's not a threatening thing
to you I could tell you things that would be
much more threatening to you than any kind of violence
that you'll see on television right so the most advanced
teachings are threatening and that means that you need to
be on guard for how much projection you're going to
be doing when you're hearing these teachings and by the
way that's also the reason why these teachings remain advanced
for centuries because people aren't hearing them because even when
you do hear them they're so threatening that you don't
really hear them you run away why uh well you
don't run away I mean you have to have to
rationalize it to yourself so you don't say to yourself
oh this is such an amazing advanced teaching and I'm
too scared you don't never works that way your ego
is very subtle about this so what your ego will
do is it'll say oh look at this is look
at this guy he's so full of himself like how
arrogant he is I bet you this guy in his
personal life he probably has terrible relationships he probably can't
do any of this of you talking about he's probably
a total hypocrite behind the scenes and so I'm not
going to listen to him something along those lines or
maybe even something more subtle than that here are some
telltale signs of when you're projecting with teachers I found
firstly it's when you have imaginary arguments with a teacher
or with a book or something that you've read imaginary
arguments in your head it's like I don't know this
and this and this is like you're here and the
teacher is here and you're kind of debating with them
in your head so when you notice that you know
you're projecting secondly is when you start to get into
the teachers life story you start to want to know
like what does he do it is personal like how
many kids does he have like Leah what kind of
car do you drive like what kind of clothes do
you wear what about this what about that getting to
the personal life that's when you know you're projecting and
thirdly I would say when you start to criticize based
on little nitpicky things like it's like oh I don't
like the words you use there and I don't like
this thing here and you say little things you're nitpicking
those are the tell-tale signs watch out for extremely subtle
levels of projection those of you who have already been
on this path with me for a couple of years
that are going pretty deep and you've rattled hundreds of
books and you watched thousands of videos from all sorts
of different places uh you still have to be on
guard I want you to watch out for the extremely
subtle levels of projection that you make little tiny judgments
and things like that because that's closing your mind down
to the deepest teachings that are available believe it or
not the thing that holds you back from hearing the
deepest teachings is simply a closed mind and that gets
reinforced through projection big time big time I see it
almost every single day in the comments people leave me
under the videos a lot of comments are positive don't
get me wrong most of them are but some people
it saddens me it kind of breaks my heart because
like um I might share a piece of wisdom that
took me several years going 2,000 multiple thousand dollar seminars
to acquire this one little piece of information and then
I provide that a piece of information for free to
somebody and then that person says something like oh you're
doing is just for money and they don't even listen
even though I released it for free and this is
an ollie oh you're just doing this for money you're
just doing this to get me on your newsletter thing
and then to sell me some sort of course or
something I know I know what you're all about something
like that right and then they miss this up this
a rare gem of an insight that could have changed
their whole life simply because they were projecting in their
mind was closed so don't be like that instead I
want you to listen inclusively I want you to listen
with generosity which means that you don't just sit there
and nitpick and try to find the flaws and what
is being told to you but you actually sit there
with a UH with assuming the burden of understanding on
yourself right a good student always takes it upon himself
to really understand what the teacher is saying even if
the teacher says something wrong even if the teacher slips
up here there even if the teacher says something that
doesn't make sense that the student will be like oh
wait a minute how do I get this to make
sense because he's taken the responsibility for understanding on himself
right especially when I'm talking about an advanced topic like
enlightenment your job is to really carefully parse what I'm
saying to do the work of trying to fit it
into your existing model of reality cos because those are
gonna have to change and basically crumble in order to
take on some of these new things that are being
shared with you some of these new insights take that
on to be open to it not to blindly believe
it but to be open to it to listen with
generosity and inclusivity rather than taking sides and then washing
out very carefully for any kind of assumptions you make
especially with topics about enlightenment there's all sorts of little
assumptions you can make like I talked about enlightenment and
then you might listen to that whole episode for an
hour and then you might think oh well that means
that when I'm enlightened I'm perfectly happy all the time
and maybe that's your assumption or maybe it means all
when I'm enlightened then personal development work becomes irrelevant I
didn't say that that's your assumption or it's like all
when I'm enlightened that means I'm gonna have a perfect
marriage and I'll never get divorced I didn't say that
that's your assumption right be careful with these kinds of
conclusions very careful the deeper the teaching the more careful
you have to be very very very careful and you
know what you will make these assumptions and jump to
conclusions of all kinds I do too and the the
only the only thing you got to do is just
to be open enough to go back and to revise
those right if you have an attitude of openness and
you practice radical open-mindedness then yeah you'll have these assumptions
but they won't be like impassable road blocks on this
path like they are for most people you might think
well that's how it is for most people no it's
not for most people their minds are so closed that
literally you couldn't talk to them about the word enlightenment
without all their projections to the point where they can't
even understand even the idea of enlightenment I'm not even
talking about any kind of techniques or spending thousands of
hours doing something about it I'm just talking about just
the idea just introducing the idea of enlightenment is not
possible with probably 90% of the people on earth and
that's not just because they're stupid and religious they're also
very scientific and that could even be worse or even
if they're open to that sort of stuff they still
have all their ideas and all their projections and they
still will not really even grasp the concept of how
significant something like enlightenment could be in their life and
that's personally very sad to me when I see that
it kind of breaks my heart that's why I harp
so much on radical open-mindedness that's why it's such a
big thing for me that's why I keep insisting on
it and I will in the future so anyways that's
it but hold on I have a worksheet for you
so click the link down below there's a free worksheet
with some questions that will help you to identify the
different projections that you make on to people in your
life and especially your teachers and mentors so go ahead
and do that these exercises are critical for you to
actually ground the abstract stuff that I usually say so
that's it I'm signing off please click the like button
for me right now post your comments down below I
do read them like I said share this episode with
a friend and lastly come to actualize it right here
and check out my newsletter check out some of the
resources I have for you there I'll be releasing more
resources in the future so you want to stay tuned
for that in general I want a commitment from you
to take control of growth in your life when you
were a kid and teenager you grew a lot your
life was growing every single year you were learning new
stuff you were having huge insights and paradigm shifts about
reality and then what happened after college all that basically
stopped and you told yourself all well I'm matured and
here I am and basically I've maxed out well I
Got News for you you have not maxed out you're
not even [ __ ] close not even 1% you're
not even 1% they're not even 1% there is so
much for you to learn about yourself so many incredible
things and sometimes people tell me Oh Leo now you're
talking about like maybe quitting actualize other organs because you
run out of content you run out of ideas you
shot 200 videos or something and now you're out of
ideas that's preposterous I look at that and I laugh
because I have at least 200 video topics right now
in my journals very deep mind-blowing [ __ ] you
would listen to these topics and you would think that
all the stuff I released up to now is like
kindergarten compared to the stuff that I have uh to
come a lot of stuff and that's like four years
worth of no that's like if I release 50 videos
a year one per week fifty a year so that's
like 200 that's like what two two years worth no
four years worth yeah 50 years of four years worth
and I could easily generate a lot more my biggest
challenge is how do I get all this stuff out
there because I only have so much time to to
assemble and post all this content and quite frankly you
probably don't - let's do it all either all at
once so anyways my point is that there's a lot
to this self actualization thing there's a lot of ways
in which you can radically transform your life which would
take me hours just to explain them all to you
all the benefits of this work I hope you have
some insight into how powerful these kinds of understandings could
be you have an intuition about that and that you're
willing to follow through on that intuition and commit to
it and the very simple form of commitment you could
make I hope you make a moment but at the
very least watch one of these episodes per week so
that you're starting to build a big picture understanding of
what you should be doing in your life and how
you should be growing and what the potential is for
you that alone will eventually start to really transform but
that'll take some time so it might take you a
year of watching videos to just realize oh it you
know this is so important I gotta commit my whole
life to this but if you are at that point
already great stick around and actually start to take action
do the worksheets do the exercises do them twice do
them three times start reading books check out some of
the resources I have for you start going to seminars
start meditating start building techniques and habits and then your
life will transform in amazing ways so stick with me
and I'll see you soon with more you
