[Music] does free will exist and what is will anyways
we're going to definitively answer that for you today but
please understand this is an extremely advanced communication advanced advanced
advanced very advanced you're not going to understand this without
many awakenings and without thousands of hours of profound contemplation
to the nature of existence this question is so much
deeper than anybody has led you to believe recently i've
had a new level of awakening with a complete understanding
of what will is it's taken me over a hundred
awakenings to crack this nut of what is will so
now i understand and i'm going to communicate it to
you but what i'm going to communicate to you is
not going to make sense to you unless you actually
do all the work that i did to reach this
level of understanding but the point of this communication is
to plant the seed in your mind that such understanding
exists and it's possible and it's not just some pipe
dream and these are not just speculations or theories of
mine you can become directly conscious of what will is
and whether free will exists and it's a lot more
complicated than just a yes or a no to this
question i've spoken about this question a long time ago
in the past maybe four or five years ago i
released an episode about free will and it was in
the right direction but but now i really understand what
will is and it's such a profound thing so this
episode is going to replace the old one that i
have still up all right so where do we begin
what is will and does it exist so this episode
is advanced because it assumes that you've watched much of
my previous content that i won't re-explain here you have
to understand some fundamental concepts that i've talked about for
example about dualities distinctions how those work go check out
my three-part series called understanding duality part one part two
part three that will get you some of the foundation
you need some of the theoretical foundation to understand some
of the things i'll be quickly saying here but here's
the bottom line is that as i've said many times
before reality is an infinite field of consciousness which is
imagining distinctions every thing that you think exists is a
distinction within consciousness that this field of consciousness is making
distinctions like me versus you you versus the world you
versus other humans versus animals matter versus energy matter versus
antimatter black versus white big versus small reality versus fantasy
these are all distinctions that are being imagined and dreamed
up by universal consciousness which is what you are you
are universal consciousness but you're not fully aware of that
yet you think you're a human so human is a
distinction within universal consciousness you see that now what does
this have to do with free will well you see
freedom is a distinction you're imagining within this field of
consciousness so you're imagining freedom on the one hand and
then it's opposite which is a lack of freedom on
the other hand or in other words you might say
constraint or something like determinism you might hold that as
the opposite of freedom furthermore you're imagining something like will
and then the opposite of will not will that's also
a distinction you're creating and you're imagining a distinction between
control versus lack of control or we might also frame
it as controller versus the thing that it is controlling
controller versus controlled so when you're asking this question does
a human have free will what you're basically doing is
you're taking a universal field of consciousness the entire universe
you're subdividing that into a part such as a human
this human here but not that human there or not
that chair or not that table or not the planet
earth or some other thing and then you're asking the
question okay so if i'm just this little part of
the universe who controls that part do i control my
own part and how does my personal control over my
little part of the universe relate to the universe at
large do i control myself or does the universe control
me that's another way to frame the question on the
one hand it seems like the universe controls me because
like for example i don't control my dna ordinarily that's
how we think i don't control when i was born
i don't control who my parents were i don't control
when i get hit in a car crash by somebody
else so in that sense i don't have control on
the other hand i seem to have control over the
universe i can steer the steering wheel of my car
and cause my car to move in different directions i
can choose to go to the gym or to be
lazy and not go to the gym i can choose
to get married and have children or not i can
choose which food to eat or not in this way
it seems like i'm controlling the universe in fact i
could build my own house if i wanted to that
would be me manipulating and controlling the universe so do
humans control the universe or does the universe control humans
well of course it's not a simple either or choice
something much more nuanced is going on here i want
you to appreciate how how delicate and sensitive this question
is the problem here is that the ego mind fundamentally
wants to believe that it is in control that is
the function of the ego mind that is the function
of the small human self identity the lowercase u identity
you need to feel like you're in control of at
least some portion of your life because if you don't
notice what happens there's actually emotional consequences you get depressed
you get frustrated you get angry you get emotional you
start to feel like a victim in life and there
are some people in life who seem to have a
lot of control over life and their own selves and
then there are other people who don't have a lot
of control and they're like helpless victims they can't do
anything they can even barely motivate themselves to wake up
in the morning and and go to work because they're
so out of control now the trick here though is
that it's all about how you define what you is
you see ordinarily when we say well do i have
control over life we just take the u part of
that question for granted but on that question hinges everything
hinges the whole answer for example science cannot answer this
question because science doesn't have a deep enough appreciation of
the relativity of the u identity science just assumes that
well you is a given you means you're a human
not so fast what if there's other definitions of what
u is larger definitions so you see the problem is
that if we have consider for a moment the whole
universe everything that could ever possibly exist everything if you're
going to define you as any subset of that if
you're a little human within the universe if there's a
distinction in your mind between you and the world if
you think you're separate or different from the world or
if you think that you're separate or different from others
other conscious agents in the world see you're defining yourself
as something less than the entirety of the universe if
you do that by definition you cannot have control over
the entire universe because you're a portion of it not
the whole thing you are like one molecule within a
hurricane if the universe is the whole hurricane a human
is like one molecule or one particle flying around and
in that sense it seems like the universe and the
world controls you even though you might struggle to control
sometimes your own trajectory the reality is is that the
majority of your trajectory life is not controlled by you
the planet is orbiting the sun the sun is orbiting
some other galaxy or the center of the milky way
and how much control do you have as a human
over that process none so you see your control is
very localized within the whole universe but that's only if
you define yourself as that little human you if you
assume that that's a physical fact an objective fact but
what if it isn't what if identity is a metaphysical
thing not a physical thing and that it's relativistic in
that you can change what you identify yourself to be
so if you change your identity from that of a
human to that of the entire universe if somehow you
could make that shift in your consciousness then that would
change the whole question and how you look at this
question and what the answer is because if we take
the universe as a whole and we ask the question
who controls the universe as a whole you can see
that it's a very interesting and a different kind of
question because when you're considering some part of the universe
that is not the whole then you can always appeal
to something outside of that part as a controller of
that part so literally what controls your physical xyz coordinates
in physical space it would be the motion of the
planet earth and the sun around the center of the
milky way and since you define yourself as not the
earth and not the sun and not the milky way
that means you don't actually control your xyz coordinates in
space you control a tiny portion of it but not
the majority of it because even as i was sitting
here talking already scientifically speaking you and i have moved
through space xyz coordinates our xyz coordinates have moved even
though we're sitting here not moving the earth and the
sun have all moved hundreds and maybe thousands of kilometers
just in the last few minutes as i've been talking
and you don't control that because you don't define that
as being part of what you are but see what's
interesting is that if you expand your idea of what
you are to becoming the entire universe and you ask
the question well who controls the entire universe see now
you can't make an appeal to something outside of the
universe controlling the universe because the universe the way we're
defining it here is this elastic notion which is totalistic
it's all-encompassing the entire universe everything that could possibly exist
universe with the uppercase u so who controls the universe
well obviously nothing outside the universe can control the universe
because the universe has no outside because outside and inside
itself is a distinction imagined by the universe the universe
being an infinite field of consciousness since the universe has
no outside only inside everything by definition is inside the
universe and it has no outer edge it expands to
infinity that means the only thing that can control the
universe is itself the universe is self-controlled because you see
the notion of controller versus controlled is a dualistic notion
that requires that you subdivide the universe into at least
two parts the controller and the controlled the controller is
one part controlling some other part so if i was
a puppet or a marionette the puppet would be the
controlled and the guy controlling the puppet he would be
the puppet master the controller but you see that assumes
that there's actually a fundamental distinction between the puppet master
and the puppet don't take that distinction for granted as
a given it's not a given that distinction itself is
relativistic in other words it only exists if you imagine
that it exists if we take the puppet and the
puppet master as being one object who controls the puppet
then well you see even that question doesn't really make
sense because to say who controls the puppet to even
ask that question already assumes that the puppet is separate
from the puppet master so the question truly is something
like who controls both the puppet and the puppet master
at the same time because they're one unit and the
answer is of course that it controls itself so if
you identify just as the puppet which is the human
body then there is something controlling you but if you
identify as the entire thing then there's nothing controlling you
but yourself so understand that just to ask the question
of who controls me or who controls the universe is
already a dualistic question it sneaks in a dualistic metaphysics
without recognizing that it's doing so similar a similar kind
of logic applies to the notion of freedom because we're
going to be talking here about free will which means
we have to wonder what is freedom freedom is a
much more profound idea than most people give it credit
for most people have no idea what freedom is they've
never thought about it deeply freedom is also a duality
notice some things you think are free other things you
think are not free how do you distinguish between those
two what defines what freedom means what does it even
mean to say that anything in the universe is free
you might say well leo freedom just means that i
get to do whatever i want well but under this
definition nothing is free you can't jump 50 feet high
you're not free to do that you can't teleport to
some other planet in the universe by snapping your fingers
you're not free to do that so what does freedom
really mean and again this question implicitly assumes a duality
because if you say that you're not free then you
have to blame your lack of freedom on some constraint
that is outside of you that is not self-imposed because
you see if i say you can jump 50 feet
high and you say no leo i can't i would
say why not and you would say well it's not
because of my choice i'm not choosing to be limited
in this way i was just born in this limited
fashion i was born as such a creature that cannot
jump 50 feet high that's just how i am those
constraints were put upon me by the universe at large
not by my own free will i didn't choose to
be this constrained something outside of me is constraining me
in other words for example you might say physics is
constraining me physics is limiting me the earth's gravitational field
is limiting me from jumping 50 feet high now if
i was on the surface of mars maybe i could
jump 50 feet high or some other smaller planet like
pluto maybe you could and see there we would say
aha so it's the earth's fault it's the earth that
is preventing me from jumping that high because if i
lived on pluto i could jump that high so obviously
it's the planet that's at fault here and it's not
me who's doing it but again notice that the word
me that's the identity again the you identity me you
i all this is the same thing we're talking about
how you identify yourself so how you identify yourself here
is crucial the whole question hinges upon your identity so
if you identify yourself as not the planet then you
could say the planet is limiting you and taking your
freedom away on the other hand again if you expand
your identity to include the entire universe now we can
ask the question is the universe as a whole is
it free is it free to behave however it wants
that's a very profound question i want you to contemplate
that by yourself to appreciate its profundity because again what
i want you to notice is that when you ask
that question notice when we're talking about universes of totality
of all things of all possibilities that means again it
has no outside so you can't appeal to something outside
the universe to constrain the universe's freedom so you might
say well leo the universe as a whole is constrained
by the laws of physics because there's a certain gravitational
constant there are other physical constant that scientists talk about
there's a sort of a fine-tuning problem that scientists talk
about and you know the physical laws and maybe even
the logical laws of the universe are so established as
to constrain what it can be and how it can
work but see if you say that you're not thinking
deeply enough because again now see what you're doing is
you're you're defining the universe as something that's separate from
distinct from the physical or logical laws which are constraining
it in this case again you're creating sort of a
duality and you're not seeing that you're creating this but
my notion of a universe the proper notion of the
universe includes everything including the physical laws and the logical
laws so now you have to ask yourself are the
physical and logical laws themselves free what is constraining them
what is defining them what's holding them in place so
to speak and if you say well there's some sort
of metalogical or metaphysical laws which are holding it in
place you're just pushing the problem down one level you're
not really addressing the issue you have to see that
your metalogical laws and your metaphysical laws are also going
to be all part of what we're calling universe the
universe has nothing outside of it no other to itself
it's a unity and when you realize that then what
you realize is the universe must control itself the universe
must define itself and set its own limits if the
universe is setting its own limits then truly in the
absolute sense the universe is free to be however it
wants because there's nothing outside the universe to tell the
universe how it has to be there are no policemen
or judges outside the universe this is such a radical
notion that there is not even anyone outside the universe
who could judge whether the universe exists or not in
other words for the universe to tell itself that it
exists or rather for the universe to exist is nothing
other than for it to tell itself that it exists
because there's nobody to check whether the universe is being
honest with itself you see the universe is self-defining self-creating
self-constraining but if it's self-defining and self-creating and self-constraining that
means it can define create or constrain itself however it
wants including having no constraints whatsoever in other words the
universe is totally free free in the absolute sense freedom
with a capital f you might say belia what does
all this have to do with free will so here's
what my my recent awakening revealed to me specifically on
the issue of will and what it is if you
become infinitely conscious that you are the entire universe and
your identity your finite human identity expands to occupy the
infinite scope of the whole universe what you will realize
is that since the universe is completely sovereign and has
no outside it imagines all of its own constraints and
it defines itself and its identity as the universe or
as something less than the universe like a human or
a kangaroo or a table or a chair or whatever
and as such from that highest level of infinite consciousness
the universe is an infinite mind which wills itself into
existence in other words everything that happens in the universe
is the universe's will physical material manifestation is the crystallization
of the universe's will will with a capital w what
i'm saying is extremely profound i'm saying that all material
objects are identical to will this is a a radical
idea because ordinarily us humans have thought of of will
as something that human minds possess and human bodies possess
will we might say the human body or an animal
body possesses will but a rock does not possess will
a chair is not capable of will and so on
we don't usually ascribe will to physical objects we ascribe
will to ourselves but you see that's what this sneaky
ego mind is doing because the ego mind's function its
whole reason for existence is to believe that you this
limited finite identity has control over its environment to some
degree so that you can manipulate that environment to survive
you see but again just like we do with love
we confuse our human notions of will with a universal
metaphysical will that the entire universe possesses so humans mistake
their personal preferences likes and dislikes of material objects and
they call that love if you like it you call
it love if you don't like it you call it
hate the opposite of love and we think that that's
all that love boils down to is these kinds of
biased emotions on behalf of living organisms but that's not
really what love is i've discussed love in depth in
other episodes go check out my episodes called what is
love part one part two that explains that i won't
recapitulate that here um but see an analogous problem is
happening with will what's happening is that universal will the
will of the entire universe is being severely limited when
an ego mind grabs hold of it and only considers
it in a biased manner in terms of what is
my will what is my portion of the universe's will
that's really what you're concerned about as a human as
an ego you don't care about the will of the
entire universe you don't even care about the will of
other beings and inanimate objects you only care about your
personal will because all you care about is how to
manipulate reality long enough to survive that's all you care
about because of how you've defined yourself as a finite
human if your self-definition is very very finite by necessity
what that results in is a crippling of the universe's
infinite will into that little portion of will that you
think you have as an ego mind you can manipulate
small local portions of the universe by turning the steering
wheel in your car changing the radio station things like
that making a few decisions here there and you feel
like you're a like a like a leaf blowing around
in a giant hurricane it's hard for you to control
yourself or maybe a better example here would be not
a leaf but uh more like a bird imagine a
little hummingbird in the middle of a giant hurricane it
can control where it's flying but its ability to control
where it flies is severely limited because the forces of
the larger hurricane are completely overpowering the forces of its
wings and so this poor little hummingbird is is tumbling
up and down and hitting trees and stuff like that
it can't control itself very well that's a great description
of what your life is like isn't it isn't that
what it feels like every day you wake up and
you struggle to manipulate your life to get it to
feel good for you to get positive emotions out of
it and you struggle and struggle all day long and
at the end of the day you're tired you're frustrated
you're angry you're upset you're depressed you're miserable because things
didn't go your way you're like that little hummingbird in
the middle of a hurricane and then sometimes occasionally you
have a good day and things go your way everything
goes your way and then you're happy but then the
next day you struggle and then the hurricane blindsides you
and hits you into a tree and you're struggling struggling
struggling struggling it's exhausting to struggle like this to live
like this and you tell yourself well but leo how
else could it be i'm just a little hummingbird in
the middle of a hurricane that's so that's that's just
that's just physics that's just how things are but consider
maybe that's not how things really are maybe that's a
function of how you've defined yourself maybe you're not truly
that hummingbird maybe you've tricked yourself into believing that you're
the hummingbird when actually you're the entire hurricane including the
hummingbird who's in the hurricane see that would be a
radical shift in your identity in your self-definition and you
might say well leo so what if i change my
definition it doesn't change anything in a certain sense it
doesn't it doesn't necessarily give the hummingbird more control over
itself but on the other hand remember that you've changed
your definition of what yourself is such that you're no
longer identifying just as the hummingbird so in a sense
you actually have increased your capacity for self-control just by
expanding what you believe you are you have a larger
perspective your situation has been so recontextualized go see my
episode called understanding recontextualization your situation's been so recontextualized that
now if you look at the entire system the hurricane
and the hummingbird in the hurricane you see the entire
system moving with a certain intelligence and a certain higher
purpose and now you no longer feel like you're just
a little hummingbird that is struggling against these evil forces
outside of you because you're you're the entire system so
it's like that so as i've said before the entire
universe is not a physical system it's a mental system
it's a field of consciousness it's a universal mind universal
mind has infinite will at the highest level so what
i'm telling you i'm not just telling you some philosophical
mumbo jumbo here what i'm saying is that if you
become infinitely conscious which is possible to do if you
are fully awakened what you'll realize is that literally every
single thing happening in your life was your own creation
and is the function of your own infinite will or
in other words if you realize that you're god you'll
realize that everything is god's will including the chair you're
sitting on everything all physical objects are manifestations and identical
to god's infinite will god being universal mind if you
became infinitely conscious you could materialize any physical object into
existence that you wanted to this sounds rather outlandish to
claim but nevertheless you can become directly conscious of this
but there's a trick there's a very deep trick here
so be careful because it might sound like oh leo
that's awesome show me how to become a philly conscious
and then when i get that then i will be
able to do whatever i want i will be able
to please myself with with all sorts of creature comforts
and manifest millions of dollars and fast cars and beautiful
women and other things like this but you don't get
how profound this is you're not going to be able
to do that and the reason that is is because
when you reach the levels of consciousness that i'm talking
about at which infinite will exists and everything is the
manifestation of infinite will your ego the closer you get
to that point of infinite will the less ego you
have the less ego you have the less you identify
with being a human the less you identify with being
a human the less you're attached to your personal needs
and biases the less you care about manipulating reality the
less you see problems with how reality is working see
if your ego is very dense and you're not very
conscious you believe that the world is evil you believe
that there's a lot of wrong stuff in the world
that needs to be changed why do you believe that
because you need the world to suit you to suit
your survival because you care about your survival because you're
needy and you're selfish but as you raise your consciousness
and you approach closer to god consciousness and awakening the
self and the ego melts away more and more until
when you reach the highest point there's nothing of it
left there's no more self left there's no more neediness
left there's no more attachment left there's no more biases
left you literally don't care if you live or die
anymore you certainly don't care about money you don't care
about sex you don't care about your children you don't
care about your friends you don't care about your family
you don't care about anything because none of it matters
because at that level of consciousness all of it is
imaginary and there's no difference between one thing or another
thing nothing is better than anything else because everything is
equally great because all distinctions are imaginary and you're conscious
of that when you're fully conscious of how all distinctions
are imaginary that is precisely what gives you infinite will
because infinite will is just imagination you're an infinite mind
and an infinite mind has complete control over itself because
it's completely sovereign because it's absolute because it has no
outside because it has no difference between an inside and
outside because it's so conscious it recognizes that everything it
thought was outside of itself is actually just parts of
itself that it was dissociated from so when you integrate
all of your dissociations and there is literally no more
distinction of other than you you become god and you
become absolutely sovereign in your power to manifest whatever reality
you want now again your mind here is going to
jump in and say aha leo so i can use
this to make a better life for myself and the
answer is no if you think that way you're still
being selfish and you're looking at this from the point
of view of the ego because you actually believe that
there's something wrong with your life there's nothing wrong with
your life and there's nothing wrong with reality when you're
absolutely conscious when you're at this highest level of consciousness
that i'm talking about you realize that reality always was
absolute perfection and therefore it's not that you grab hold
of god's infinite will and then try to use that
power to benefit yourself or even others what actually happens
is very counterintuitive thing is that when you become that
conscious the only thing that happens is a surrender a
profound surrender you completely surrender to your own will because
even the idea that there's a you and there's a
god and it's god's will that is controlling you and
that you must somehow obey god's will even that you
see as a duality you're framing it as though god
is controlling the human it might sound like that's what
i'm saying but that's not what i'm saying i'm saying
much more profound things than that what i'm saying is
that the human is god they're identical when that identity
is actually recognized what happens is the human disappears there's
only the god the human surrenders to the god so
fully that the human melts away and disappears like it
never existed because the human was always imaginary and then
only the god remains and as the god what you
realize is that you don't need to change or control
anything you don't need to manipulate anything because your will
is already perfectly manifest as whatever you see is whatever
is happening and so you surrender any notions you have
about changing the flow of your life to make it
better so very paradoxically you don't make life better by
manipulating life at this highest level you make your life
better simply by surrendering to however life is flowing because
you recognize that however it's flowing is the best possible
way that it could flow because god's will is never
anything less than perfection and god's will is your own
will so ultimately when you fully realize that you are
god what happens is that you accept the fact that
everything that has ever happened to you in your life
and everything that is ever happening or will ever happen
is your own will made manifest nothing has ever happened
against your will it was the ego that believed that
it was the ego that was denying that it was
god not recognizing itself as god therefore the ego thought
there was something wrong in the world because the ego
was afraid the ego was biased and so forth but
when you reach god consciousness all those fears and biases
melt away and you're left with just perfection the infinite
perfection and intelligence of god's will so what is will
will is absolutely every physical thing that is occurring or
has ever occurred in your life literally this physical stuff
is will but it's not recognized as such by human
ego minds because they're not conscious enough and they're too
selfish to see it as will because we think of
this as material stuff but it's not really material stuff
this is mind stuff all material things are mind stuff
just a denser stronger form of mind stuff than the
human mind stuff that we ordinarily use to dream up
fantasies about santa claus and unicorns and things like that
but there's no fundamental distinction between a unicorn and a
table or a chair or the planet earth those differences
are something your mind is imagining those are differences distinctions
imagined within the mind of god so something extremely paradoxical
happens when you reach god consciousness what you realize is
that it's not that there is no such thing as
free will a lot of spiritual teachers and non-dual teachers
will just tell you that oh all of the egos
desires to me manipulate are just narcissism and uh their
the ego isn't even real therefore the ego has no
control over anything this is not quite correct because this
paints uh too blunt of a picture it paints a
misleading picture in the mind of the student about what
will really is because it it it basically gives you
the false idea that will doesn't exist like if you
ask a scientist as well exists a scientist will say
no and that's precisely false it's not that will doesn't
exist it's actually 180 degrees the opposite of that it's
that everything is infinite will you might say william what's
the difference there's actually a profound difference so ultimately what
you realize in the recent awakening that i had is
i became so conscious that i became conscious of how
i was willing my entire body and my entire reality
into existence and i was fully conscious of how i
was doing that in other words when i'm moving my
fingers right now my hand i can actually tap into
a consciousness of how this as the entire universe now
not as a human but as the entire universe this
hand is being moved with a perfect intelligence absolute perfection
staggering intelligence is going to the movements of this hand
now is leo controlling this hand that's the illusion that's
the illusion i was under for most of my life
when i believed i was leo but as my sense
of self expanded to that of the entire universe now
it's not that leo is moving the hand using his
will and it's not that will doesn't exist it's that
universal will god's will is moving his hand perfectly and
i can become so connected to god's will that i
literally merge into god's will and then my movements it
doesn't be it's not like i'm a zombie anymore you
might think oh you know removing the ego just makes
you a zombie no no it doesn't make you a
zombie it makes you god it makes you infinitely conscious
and intelligent of the flow the intelligent flow that is
guiding the entire universe and you and this body are
just part of that entire infinite flow you are an
infinite flow a flow of infinite intelligence this is not
something you're using your logical mind to grab onto because
the logical mind itself cannot grasp onto this because the
logical mind is finite it's not infinite so this is
not going to make scientific sense if you're trying to
make sense of this scientifically or logically it won't work
because all of your logic and your science and your
language and your thoughts are all dualistic this only works
with pure non-dual consciousness there can't be any separation between
you and god you and the world you and the
universe you and other creatures and animals it all has
to be one you have to recognize it all as
one totality as the universe as the field of consciousness
that you are and then the most astounding thing will
happen is that you will realize that everything is a
manifestation of your will and it's absolutely perfect and you
don't need to struggle so hard anymore to manipulate things
anymore using your finite ego mind now you can flow
using universal mind using the intel the intelligence of universal
mind you can tap into that it's like surfing a
wave the wave will overpower you if you try to
go head up against it the way you surf a
wave is that you align yourself with the wave such
that you're riding on the on the edge of the
wave at just that perfect balancing point where the wave
can push you forward but it's not going to be
too much to overwhelm you and drown you and then
you learn to surf on that wave and you actually
become part of that wave you and the wave are
one there's no distinction between surfer and wave anymore and
the whole thing is just one intelligent flow balancing itself
regulating itself controlling itself defining itself creating itself willing itself
into existence and then what you recognize is that ah
my entire life because i've identified as being something smaller
than the whole universe i had to struggle against the
universe and that's why my life felt like a grind
like a struggle and that's why i was so emotionally
dysfunctional and neurotic and i was depressed and angry and
emotional and jealous and petty and all this sort of
stuff because i was fighting against myself i was the
universe improperly defining itself as something less than the universe
some part of the universe i didn't fully accept and
embrace my full universal identity and therefore i had to
be in struggle with myself all the time and that
was exhausting and it led to illness in me and
it led to confusion frustration depression suicidal ideation things like
this and it wasted an enormous amount of energy i
was interfering with myself the whole time that's what you
realize you realize that the ego is a self-interference pattern
it gets in its own way the ego tells itself
that it can control more of reality if it just
clings harder then the ego will get everything it wants
if i can just cling more if i can cling
more to sex if i can cling more to my
family if i can cling more to material objects if
i can clean cling more to money and my job
then i should have a better life that's what it
seems like but it doesn't work it doesn't work because
the whole thing is predicated upon a lie that you
are something that needs to cling to other things to
possess other things but when you realize that you are
the entire universe do you need to cling anymore to
money or to family or to people or to sex
or to whatever no because you're conscious that you're the
entire flow therefore there's no more clinging and when there's
no more clinging that is actually the thing that frees
up a lot of energy within you to then be
at your peak potential as a human because now you've
gotten out of your own way now rather than using
your finite intelligence and will now you're aligning yourself instead
with your true intelligence and true will which are infinite
and universal so it's not about clinging or manipulating reality
more it's about surrendering those attachments in a very counter-intuitive
way you surrender all those and then you flow with
the highest intelligence and the highest will which is nothing
other than your own will you're just recognizing your own
highest will rather than the petty little human will that
you used to believe you had you see how this
works so don't let spiritual teachers or scientists or or
whoever convince you that will isn't real that will is
some hocus-pocus stuff if anybody tells you that will isn't
real they're not conscious of themselves as god because god
is infinite will universal mind wills itself into existence because
it has no constraints what would constrain universal mind what
could tell it what to do you might say physics
could but it can't because universal mind imagines physics you
might say well logic could but then you realize universal
mind imagines logic and then you might say well some
other universe could but then you realize all other universes
are imagined by universal mind and they say well some
other mind might what if there's some other mind outside
of universal mind and then you realize universal mind is
infinite it includes all other possible minds therefore there is
no other mind that is able to control it or
to constrain in any way and this is the power
of god when you realize this this is how god
is able to create itself the reason god is able
to do the impossible which is to create itself from
nothing is simply because it imagines what is possible and
what is impossible therefore for universal mind nothing is impossible
even the notion of impossibility is something that is imagined
by universal mind you see so literally nothing is impossible
from god's point of view therefore god is able to
just will anything it wants into existence because that's the
power of infinite consciousness that's the power of recognition of
yourself as absolutely one and sovereign oneness is such a
profound thing that oneness is omnipotence do you see that
people don't recognize the the profundity of what oneness means
they hear oneness that everything is one they say oh
yeah that sounds all right that sounds plausible you might
even accept that as a physicist but no physicist understands
what oneness really means oneness means you have infinite power
to manifest absolutely anything you imagine that's what oneness means
if you truly grasp what oneness is of course this
level of grasping that i'm talking about cannot just merely
be conceptual or at the level of belief or ideology
or physics or language this has to be absolute infinite
consciousness you have to become completely conscious of yourself that
means you have to be conscious of how you constructed
the entire universe that's what i'm talking about that's not
easy to do you're not going to do that through
a little bit of meditation you're not going to do
that through a little bit of self-inquiry you're not going
to do that through some buddhist practices you're not going
to do that through a little bit of yoga i'm
talking about superhuman levels of consciousness that are completely outside
of the realm of anything you can possibly imagine but
nevertheless you can experience this and you can reach these
stages of consciousness and i've talked about how to do
that in other episodes so we've answered the question of
what is will so you might ultimately ask well does
leo so are you saying that god you're saying god
has infinite will so are you saying god has infinite
free will is god's will free if i was god
could i do anything i wanted to would there be
any constraints on what i could do what i could
imagine there is one constraint and it's an absolute constraint
and you're not going gonna like it the only constraint
on god's will is that it must be absolute love
because at that highest level everything is one when everything
is one oneness is absolute love god is love as
i've discussed elsewhere i won't re-explain that here so if
you're confused about the love issue go go watch my
episodes about love what is love where i explain that
um but uh but if you understand what i what
i talked about there in those episodes then see now
we're gonna connect love and will together and freedom so
on the one hand it might seem like i'm saying
that god can just sit around and imagine whatever stupid
[ __ ] it wants because it's totally free but
it's really not totally free because if you were infinitely
conscious you wouldn't be sitting around imagining stupid [ __
] to titillate yourself or to entertain yourself what you
would do is you would give all of your will
towards the manifestation of infinite love you would materialize infinite
love that's the only thing that would make sense at
that level of consciousness selflessness and intelligence the highest intelligence
cannot be anything other than love love intelligence consciousness truth
goodness god these are all absolutely identical not metaphorically they're
literally identical they cannot be distinguished from each other therefore
if you're at the highest intelligence level if you're at
the highest level of love if you're at the highest
level of will where you have literally omnipotence all that
omnipotence is used towards a singular purpose which is the
manifestation of the entire material dream that you're a part
of so beware the trap of thinking that you can
grab hold of god's powers and use them towards any
selfish purposes you can't you might even be tempted to
do something like this you might say well leo like
let's say i want to do something nice for somebody
else like let's say my mother has cancer and if
my mother has cancer wouldn't it be nice if i
was able to heal her and maybe leo maybe if
i reach this infinite level of consciousness that you're talking
about infinite love and intelligence and will i will have
the power to heal my mother's cancer and it won't
be for my own selfish amusement you know it won't
be like asking for sex or asking for a million
dollars this is me trying to cure my mom what
can be better than that what can be more loving
than that so surely i should be able to do
that right and the answer will be it's not up
to you it's up to whatever is the highest love
so if the highest love means that your mom will
be cured of cancer then she will be if the
highest love means she shouldn't be cured of cancer then
she won't be and nothing you can do will change
that nor should you want to change that so your
job is not truly to cure your mother over cancer
your job is to become infinitely conscious and to surrender
yourself to the flow of infinite intelligence and love whatever
that is you surrender yourself to god's will so profoundly
that you're not even surrendering anymore you become god's will
and you don't tell god's will what's right there's no
improving upon god's will it's absolutely perfect so if that
perfection requires the death of your mother to a horrible
cancer then you accept that and you're happy about it
because that's the highest good now this is very difficult
for most human egos to do precisely because you're so
attached to your mother in this case and you believe
that actually no leo it would be better if my
mother survived see you're not humble enough to actually surrender
to the fact that maybe it's best if your mother
died you think you know better you're biased you're attached
you're needy you got an ego you're afraid you suffer
and so this distorts your perception of what is the
highest good you can't see the highest good without infinite
intelligence and infinite consciousness because you can't see infinite number
of moves ahead you might say well leo how is
how is my mother dying from cancer how does that
serve the highest good of the universe well you're right
from your human perspective you can't see it because you're
only thinking of your little local situation but from the
highest position there are many reasons why your mother dying
of cancer would actually be in the highest service of
the universe and not necessarily i'm not saying that it's
because she was evil or a sinful woman that she
should die of cancer that's not the reason why uh
i'll give you an example of how you can sort
of justify this from god's point of view here's how
it would look from god's point of view like your
mother for example might have gotten the cancer because she
ate a lifetime of poor food junk food food filled
with plastics heavy metals and other toxins pesticides for example
if your mother is 60 years old and she ate
all this kind of garbage throughout her whole life then
she might get cancer that's quite quite reasonable now you
say well leo what kind of god would allow such
food to be created wouldn't it be in the highest
goodness of the universe to not allow such food to
be created but actually no there is a higher good
that you're not seeing who created that food was it
god not really who created that food is humans humans
scientists engineers business people marketers created and marketed that food
and they did it for their own selfish purposes and
they had the freedom see god gave them the freedom
to create whatever kind of food they wanted to create
so the highest good in this case is that humans
are given a certain latitude a certain freedom to construct
our societies however we want god gives us that freedom
we can create a society in which we have beautiful
organic pesticide free food available for free to everybody we
could construct that kind of society but we don't why
not because we're selfish because we're biased because nobody cares
about these sorts of things in our society in our
culture people don't care about nutrition and health and organic
stuff and pesticide free stuff what we care about is
cheap fast salty fatty sugary delicious now i'm gonna say
well well leo why did god give us these sorts
of impulses to crave the worst kinds of foods wouldn't
it be nicer you know wouldn't god be more perfect
if god was all loving then he would allow us
to eat any kind of garbage to eat chocolate ice
cream by the bucket load every single day and not
gain any weight and not get any diseases from it
wouldn't that be the best kind of god but again
you're looking at it from a very selfish position the
answer is no the best kind of god is the
kind of god that allows you to eat whatever you
want and then if you want to be conscious about
what you eat then you're responsible and you're conscious and
you don't eat the garbage in fact not only do
you not eat the garbage you don't even shop at
those stores that sell the garbage and in fact you
can you don't even you don't even build a society
where such stores exist you don't even build companies that
produce this kind of garbage food because everyone in that
society is too conscious and too caring about others too
loving of others to subject them to this poisonous food
see as a human you want god to do all
the heavy lifting for you you might say like william
why didn't god just construct a society where everything was
already perfect where the food was perfect the health care
was perfect the business systems were perfect the political system
was why didn't god just construct a utopia for us
and the answer is because god has delegated its creative
capacities to you to us as humans so that we
could construct whatever we wanted to that is the higher
good think of it like this if you had a
child that you really loved and cared about what would
it mean to facilitate this child's development such the child
grows into a mature healthy responsible creative conscious being that
lived up to its highest potential how would you facilitate
that as a parent well here's how you wouldn't if
you tell the child precisely everything that he needs to
do step by step by step and you beat him
with a whip if he doesn't do it and you
force him to do all the studying all the reading
all the everything that is supposed to be all the
right choices you force him into the right choice all
the time such that he never has any choice at
all in his whole life you tell him exactly where
to go which friends to have which foods to eat
which books to read and which books not to read
which schools to go to which parties to go to
or not go to which businesses to be a part
of basically you're gonna live his whole life for him
if you do that assuming that you have infinite intelligence
then yeah the child would live a perfect life but
then don't you see what would even be the point
of living that life that would not be a life
worth living the whole point of life is that you
have to figure it out for yourself by making mistakes
and that's what us humans are doing as we're building
our societies as we're constructing our food menus at restaurants
as we're filling and stocking our grocery stores we're figuring
it out on our own that's what makes life meaningful
and interesting and worthwhile because it's from that that you
get growth if god solved all of our problems we
wouldn't even need to be alive you see so the
highest good is not for god to stock your grocery
store shelves with perfect organic food the highest good is
for us to recognize that we should correct ourselves and
do it for ourselves don't ask god to stock the
grocery store with the best food do it yourself do
it as a society let's do it if we really
care about it and if we don't care about it
then why are we complaining what is there to complain
about you see the vast majority of mankind's problems are
self-created and the way that mankind evolves the way society
evolves the way culture evolves is by making these sorts
of mistakes and learning from our mistakes this is the
whole purpose of life is to exercise one's consciousness and
to realize that it's insufficient selfish consciousness needy attached consciousness
is insufficient to live the best life and by becoming
conscious of that that is what gets you to surrender
your selfishness and to evolve and to grow until eventually
you surrender enough of your selfishness that you literally become
god you see that's the highest good and you cannot
become god by being forced into it you can only
become god by accepting yourself as god you might say
leo why why did god make it so difficult to
become god why couldn't why couldn't it just be like
i stabbed my fingers and i become god that wouldn't
that be nicer wouldn't that be a better world to
live in no because the whole point of it is
that you have to go through this whole ordeal to
realize the limitations of selfishness that's what all of life
is about life is just a simulation to show you
that if you're gonna be selfish and attached and needy
and biased and untruthful and manipulative then you're gonna live
such a shitty life and you're gonna suffer for it
so either do that or wise up and stop being
so [ __ ] selfish and then ta-da life goes
great but you see selfishness cannot be removed from you
by force you have to be allowed to relinquish your
own selfishness of your own free will because you see
at the highest level infinite will is identical with goodness
and with love goodness and love have to be willed
they can't be forced upon you because at the highest
level there's nothing that can force god god has to
will to be love god has to will to be
good nobody because at the highest level there's nobody other
than god to force it to be anything that it
doesn't want to be so it has to want it
so for you to become god you have to want
it you have to want to love but how can
you want to love if you're so [ __ ]
selfish and afraid and attached and biased and manipulative and
untruthful you can't love when you're untruthful because love is
truth so all the [ __ ] that's happening is
our own creation if you don't like it stop creating
it start taking responsibility for how you're creating your life
for what you're willing into your life with the limited
will that you do have start taking responsibility for how
you define yourself most people don't take responsibility for how
they define themselves as a human they offload that responsibility
onto science or biology or onto religion when you say
oh leo but science tells me i'm a human that's
you offloading your responsibility of self-definition onto some stupid human
called a scientist who for whatever reason you have turned
into your pope the pope of materialism see you can't
awaken to your own god self when you are offloading
your sovereignty and authority on to other people or organizations
or institutions or culture that's the fundamental problem go check
out my episode called how authority works very crucial for
you to understand what i'm talking about in subtle unconscious
ways you are offloading the responsibility and your own sovereignty
and authority onto others authority figures whether it's scientists or
religious people or gurus or new age people or youtubers
or your parents or your boss or your co-workers somebody
and you're blaming others you're not taking responsibility over the
fact that you're constructing the entire universe so that's another
huge problem here is that for you to reach the
highest levels of god consciousness you have to take full
responsibility for everything that you've created in your life and
most people are in such denial that they have created
anything bad in their life they want to blame somebody
else for it it's always somebody else's fault but what
if the highest truth was that you constructed your life
all of it and it's no one's fault but yours
that's one of the biggest obstacles that keeps people from
waking up is that they simply refuse to take responsibility
for their epistemology for their metaphysics for how they think
about science for how they define themselves for how they
think how they emote how they relate to other humans
and so on and as long as you're going to
be denying responsibility and authority and sovereignty you're never going
to realize that you're god so again does god have
free will it does but in a paradoxical sense it
doesn't because all of its free will has been given
to infinite love now you might say but leah that
that seems so limiting but it's not really limiting because
there's nothing higher than this there's no other purpose towards
which to put your will but towards the manifestation of
infinite love so it is the highest purpose there's nothing
higher than it so in this sense god is perfectly
content with its choice it has no other choice but
to be loved from a human point of view it
might not make a lot of sense and it might
seem kind of lame like oh leo it's all just
love but like you're telling me i can't manipulate reality
and help my mother if she's sick and so on
that seems kind of lame seems like it's powerless it
seems like god is weak well that's how it looks
from your limited vantage point if you had an infinite
vantage point it would not be weak it would be
the highest strength but because you're selfish and all you
care about is your little local corner of reality from
your vantage point in your little local corner of reality
yeah it might seem like that is weakness because you
don't get your selfish little way but actually the true
weakness would be to sacrifice the entire universe for the
sake of your little corner of reality and your personal
petty needs and wants and attachments that would be the
real travesty that would be the true weakness and of
course god will never will never allow that now that
does not mean that you as a little human cannot
manipulate reality you can you can manipulate reality to certain
degrees very limited degrees you can manipulate stuff maybe you
can invent a new drug that will save your mother's
life from cancer that's possible and there's nothing wrong with
that per se but remember that even if you cure
your mother's cancer that's not going to be one of
your problems that's just like one obstacle that you've dodged
as a hummingbird within this giant hurricane that is constantly
endlessly swirling and it's never going to end so you
save your mother's life okay fine but then you got
to go deal with some other [ __ ] the
next day that you won't be able to manipulate your
way out of you see so this manipulation strategy it's
a finite strategy it's a finite game you can play
it to some degree but it's ultimately going to collapse
and fail at some point and so you can't really
get true fulfillment or freedom from suffering through that manipulative
method you need to start playing the infinite game rather
than the finite game and then your actions become less
manipulations and more just expressions of god's intelligence goodness love
and will by aligning yourself by becoming a superconductor for
god's intelligence see when you become that conscious what happens
is that you enter into this supernatural flow state where
you are flowing with god's intelligence you're flowing with the
entire universe and then all of your actions just automatically
become imbued with the highest intelligence and the highest love
and the highest goodness that doesn't mean you're going to
survive they could still nail you to a cross and
kill you your fellow humans can and a bear can
still maul you if you're walking through a forest or
whatever but see the thing is is that when you're
aligned with the highest intelligence and love it's not guaranteed
but for the most part you're not just going to
stumble like a fool through the forest where bears exist
you're going to be intelligent enough god is going to
grant you enough intelligence to recognize that hey you know
if i'm hiking through this forest there's bears here so
i better be careful i better pack some bear spray
and you'll pack some bear spray and that will protect
you against a bear attack or maybe you'll just be
smart enough not to even walk through that part of
the forest because you know there are bears there whereas
a fool who's constantly manipulating reality is detached from god's
intelligence he's just going to stumble into that forest forget
the bear spray act cocky and then the bears will
eat him see so the whole point of spiritual work
is to empty yourself of ego and raise your consciousness
so much that you become an ever better vessel or
superconductor for god's intelligence and then that acts through you
and that is what runs the show that is what
makes all the decisions you don't need to sit and
rack your ego mind over every decision anymore you can
act with a certain flow with a certain effortlessness because
you know there's a higher force guiding you and this
higher force is not just some woo [ __ ]
it is what you are you are guiding yourself it's
not even god that's guiding you you just are the
whole universe flowing as god as yourself your higher self
and then life just magically seems to click and to
work just like when you're riding a bicycle see the
best way to ride a bicycle is in a state
of complete flow you're flowing you're pedaling you're balancing you're
turning the wheel you're hitting the brakes at just the
right times you're switching the gears and you're doing it
all without a lot of deliberation you're not sitting there
racking your brain about should i balance one inch to
the left or to the right in order to keep
riding this bicycle no you're just you're flowing on the
bicycle you've mastered the bicycle you're part of the bicycle
it's like you and the bicycle are one and not
just you and the bicycle but you the bicycle the
road you're driving on all the obstacles in front of
you all of it is just one gestalt and it's
all just one flow and it's working perfectly when it's
working but if you're first learning how to ride a
bicycle you're gonna be rusty at it and you're gonna
have to think about it more deliberately and you have
to rationally tell yourself you know which way to turn
and thinks how to do and that's going to be
clunky it's clunky it doesn't look smooth it's not mastery
because you're not in flow with it yet takes a
lot of practice it also takes getting out of your
own way because see if you're so afraid of riding
a bicycle that every time you get on a bicycle
you keep thinking about how you're gonna die on this
bicycle if that's your mind state you're not going to
become a great bicyclist because your fear will cause an
interference pattern you'll be getting in your own way because
rather than freeing up space in your mind just to
flow and to be relaxed you're going to be in
this tense neurotic state this paranoid state always thinking about
how you're going to crash and kill yourself around the
next turn and that's going to make your whole bicycling
or career a grind in an ordeal you see so
there you go now you understand how control works how
freedom works how will works everything's been answered the only
problem is that you have to actually now become directly
consciousness for yourself and if it's anything like like what
happened with me it's going to take you hundreds of
awakenings to realize this i don't see very many spiritual
teachers properly teaching what will is and i think that's
simply because they haven't become conscious enough to recognize what
it really is because this requires extremely holistic levels of
god realization that are going to be very difficult to
reach through basic meditative practices or self-inquiry practices you have
to go much deeper than that to reach it so
i wish you good luck i hope one day you
realize what will truly is don't stop this work until
you become directly conscious of what will is and that
means you have to become conscious of how everything that
is happening right now is your own will being manifest
physical reality is the manifestation of your will if you're
