hey this is leo for actualized.org and we are going
to talk about how to feel happy all right it's
going to be a practical quick self-help segment where i
tell you in about 8 or 10 points what you
really need to know to get sustainable happiness in your
life and here's the challenge is that most of us
do not really understand what it takes to be happy
not on a deep level most of us are out
there chasing the wrong things because happiness is a counterintuitive
concept so let's get into it i'm going to give
you some key points by doing a lot of research
i've discovered these points i think you're going to really
like them all right so number one is gratitude studies
have actually been done on this and gratitude is a
really great technique for creating sustainable happiness and the most
practical way to practice gratitude is to actually have a
gratitude journal and spend five minutes every morning doing this
consistently every morning just for five minutes jotting down the
five or ten things that you are grateful for in
your life and this could be something that you're grateful
for that happened to you years ago like your parents
or your college education or something you are grateful for
just that happened to you today or the other day
small things so it can be big things and small
things because here's the thing is that human beings have
this tendency called hedonic adaptation which means that it's hard
for us to become happy because any external change in
our life like let's say you find a thousand dollars
tomorrow in your car right just randomly showed up a
thousand dollars well you're gonna feel thrilled in the moment
but then after a while a week from from there
a month from there from that point you're not really
going to feel that happiness anymore because you've kind of
adapted to that difference human beings are really good at
adapting to either positive changes in circumstances or even negative
ones so there have been many studies done on this
from water from with lottery winners to paraplegics and they've
actually done studies and they compared happiness levels between people
that have won millions of dollars for free and people
that have become crippled and they've compared and what they've
discovered is that after about a year the happiness level
returns to about where it was so gratitude is a
great great way to turn this tide is thinking about
the things that you are really appreciative of being more
appreciative of all the good things in your life and
happiness is really kind of a mind game you want
to start shifting your focus from all the negative things
that you're thinking about to all the positive things that
are in your life right are you grateful for the
country you live in how often do you think about
that are you grateful for the city that you're in
are you grateful for the family that you were raised
in are you grateful for the friends you have are
you grateful for the fact that you can pay your
bills are you grateful for the fact that you have
food are you grateful for the fact that you have
your boyfriend or girlfriend what are you grateful for take
stock of those things if you've never done this exercise
you'll discover some amazing things when you actually sit down
and do it and force your mind to go back
and think about this stuff consciously and articulate it so
that's a really good strategy okay the next one is
optimism be more optimistic and here this is not an
abstract concept there's actually a practical way to be more
optimistic by optimism what i found one of the best
exercises to do is to do a little bit of
journaling again you can do a five minute exercise in
the morning is sit down and ask yourself what am
i doing in the next year that i can be
excited about what am i doing over the next week
that i can get excited about what am i doing
over the next five years that i can get excited
about so it can happen on the micro scale from
what are you doing today to what are you doing
in a week to the macro scale of what are
you doing in five years what are you doing in
10 years it's about setting a positive expectation for your
future when you feel good about your future you're going
to get engaged you're going to feel happy and you
can do this in the morning with your journal or
you can do it when you're in the shower or
throughout your day when you're sitting sitting in traffic or
standing in a line waiting for your starbucks uh frappuccino
you know just think about what are you excited about
and as you're doing that you're actually going to be
setting some goals too because setting goals is actually a
point lower down a list that i'm going to get
to in a second so building that level of optimism
is a great way to feel happier the next point
stop overthinking so many of us are just always always
always thinking some of us more than others but if
you tend to be the kind of person whose mind
is always spinning always running you got to really watch
out for that sometimes you're going to over analyze situations
way too much you get too much in your head
and you're not gonna be connected with your body you're
not gonna be in the present moment you're gonna be
either worrying about the past or you're gonna be worrying
about the future and happiness is all about being in
the present so you gotta calm your mind down you
gotta stop that because chances are if you're thinking about
something and you're thinking a lot you're not thinking about
it in a positive way chances are you're thinking about
in a negative way you're having these automatic negative thoughts
and you're having just these storms of negative thoughts and
negative debates and arguments in your mind and does that
does not make you fulfilled you've got to cut that
out and good ways to cut that out is through
various techniques from journaling to visualizations to doing therapy to
doing meditation so there's many different ways that you can
try to stop overthinking okay the next point is eliminate
addictions i find that addictions really rob you of any
chance of happiness in life because what an addiction does
and i'll define addiction in a second because it's a
larger uh definition than than you would initially think but
addictions are like band-aids over over the unhappiness in life
so it's like a quick little patch that covers up
the unhappiness in your life with a little hit of
pleasure but it's not a sustainable type of happiness and
ultimately it leaves you feeling very hollow and guilty so
by addictions i mean things like obvious forms of addiction
like drugs and alcohol and smoking but then other more
subtle forms of addictions addictions like television compulsive shopping you've
got gambling you've got sex you've got you've got gossip
you've got addictions to negative thinking you've got addictions to
the internet so these things these are like compulsive behaviors
that you're doing they are destroying your life and if
you have an addiction then you know the that up
and down like guilt cycle that rollercoaster that you're on
it's not ultimately fulfilling it's not pleasant at all even
though that food for example which i forgot to mention
food is a huge huge point of addiction and one
that i personally had to get over is when you're
addicted to food for example what happens is that you've
got a negative day at work and then you come
back home from work and you just want to splurge
on some food because that food gives you a head
of pleasure to mask the crappy day they had at
work and so even though it masks it it doesn't
really give you happiness so what you want to do
is you gotta unhook yourself from these addictions and to
do that you need to do some work first of
all identify what your addictions are be honest about them
and then start to wean yourself off of them and
the best way i found to get yourself off an
addiction is first of all create a very strong and
reason for why you're doing that and for me the
reason would be that i don't want to have any
monkeys on my back and i want to live a
really powerful type of life and i can't do that
when i have addictions but then the other reason and
health might be a very important reason too a lot
of these addictions uh create bad health such as smoking
and food but the other the other reason that you
want to get rid of the addiction is so that
you've got this happiness right this fulfillment that comes when
you're not addicted to anything it's amazing and the other
point that i wanted to make about how to wean
yourself off addictions is create something positive to replace the
addiction don't just stop overeating don't just stop smoking replace
that with a positive habit so maybe now instead of
smoking you do a little bit of jogging maybe now
instead of overeating you do a little bit of writing
replace it with something positive all right the next point
is build relationships relationships because humans even the most introverted
of us are very social creatures are a deep and
fulfilling source of happiness in fact in cultures that are
not very materially successful but that have a rich family
connections and rich social connections people are very very happy
so happiness levels in certain countries that you would think
should be low because their poverty stricken are actually very
high because they have a more interconnected society people are
more plugged in especially in the west in america we
tend to be disconnected we tend to have those more
shallow facebook relationships rather those more personal face-to-face relationships so
the key here is not quantity but quality develop a
few maybe five at most really deep high quality relationships
focus on those invest time and energy to those and
avoid the shallow relationships would just tend to make you
overwhelmed and distracted and don't really contribute much in terms
of happiness to your life next is the point of
savoring life's joys so this is a really interesting one
and i found this one to be really powerful for
me is that i'm always so rushed and all of
us are so frantic and we're living this 24 uh
this 24-hour a day life but we're living it as
though we are on a 27-hour cycle right so we're
always frantic and frazzled and running around and doing things
like a chicken with its head cut off and so
in doing that we forget to slow down and savor
the good things that are already part of our lives
and these are usually mundane things for me for example
is just enjoying a meal a lot of times i'm
so busy i'll just scoff down a meal i won't
enjoy it but when i'm following this principle of savory
life's joys i'll remember and i'll say you know what
i'm just going to calm down give myself five minutes
to really enjoy this nice nice meal i cooked for
myself and when i do that i feel good it's
happiness and then if i remember to do that every
day and i have two or three meals a day
that's two or three moments in my life very consistently
that i'm feeling much much happier and this goes apply
you know this concept applies not just to meals but
it applies to all the people in your life that
you love applies to your family to your spouse boyfriend
girlfriend this applies to nature appreciate nature a little bit
more when you're on your drive to work in the
morning appreciate the sunset when you're on your drive from
work back home appreciate i mean the sun rise when
you're coming uh coming to work from uh from home
and then the sunset when you're coming from from work
to home so appreciate that appreciate nature appreciate all the
little things appreciate all the marvels that we have in
our life and just like savor that savor that enjoy
it don't just rush through everything next is meditation meditation
is a really effective technique if you develop a habit
of it every day i like to meditate for at
least 20 minutes every morning if you develop that habit
then you're going to calm your mind you're going to
quiet those automatic negative thoughts you're going to become peaceful
you're going to stop worrying about the past stop worrying
about the future and you're just going to become very
calm and centered and grounded and that's going to spill
over beyond those 20 minutes of meditation into your whole
day and will improve your whole life so meditation is
a very awesome habit to develop and i have other
videos about exactly how to do that the next point
is flow flow is the state of being in the
moment in the zone being fully engaged and fully focused
so absorbed in an activity that you're not thinking about
anything else and you're not self-conscious anymore this type of
state is entered into usually when you're doing something that
is fairly challenging but that also matches your skill level
so if your skill level is high and the thing
you're doing is challenging then you're able to put your
creative energy into it and you're able to reach a
state of total absorption so this might happen when you're
playing a musical instrument this might happen when you're playing
a sport or this might happen when you're really pushing
yourself at the gym might happen when you're at work
when you're working on a project that you're really passionate
about maybe it happens when you're writing maybe it happens
when you're out there giving a speech or a presentation
right you're totally in the zone and you want to
create more of these flow state experiences how do you
do that two points one is stop multitasking give yourself
time to focus eliminate distractions give yourself at least one
or two hours uh chunks of time of one or
two hours where you can just totally be absorbed in
something because every time you're interrupted you lose your state
of flow so you want to be able to focus
without interruptions and second is develop proficiency in something have
something in your life that you're trying to master have
a technical expertise that you're developing because as you develop
technical expertise it becomes easier to get into flow if
you try and you've never played the guitar and you
try to go play the guitar right now you're not
going to be in flow because you don't know how
to play you don't have enough expertise once you get
really good at playing the guitar in a couple of
years then you're going to really enjoy it you're going
to enter a flow state when you're playing even a
complicated song because you've got the skill level to match
so make sure there's something that you're mastering in your
life and lastly the point is going to be goals
and life purpose have some goals in your life set
some big and ambitious goals the human organism the human
mind is a goal seeking machine really we are designed
to seek goals whether it's at work whether it's in
a relationship whether it's a big goal that's going to
only be accomplished a year down the road or a
little goal that's going to be accomplished tomorrow we are
goal-oriented creatures so have goals that you're constantly setting and
revising for yourself and then even more importantly have a
life purpose have something that your life is about that's
outside yourself that you're having some sort of impact in
this is probably going to be related to your career
have a career that you're really passionate about and that
you are doing something positive with something that's really meaningful
to you ask yourself what is the most meaningful thing
in life and then make sure that your career is
aligned with that when you have that in place you're
going to be very very happy all right i'm going
