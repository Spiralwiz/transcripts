[Music] it's time to introduce you to a powerful concept
that i've been developing that i call the social matrix
this is going to be a very profound concept of
epistemology it's going to be a profound foundational episode in
the epistemology work that we're doing here with actualize.org and
i should warn you that this episode may give you
an existential crisis so if you're mentally unstable if you
have difficulty navigating and managing basic life and reality you
might want to skip this episode because i'm not kidding
once you fathom what i'm going to say here this
is going to corrode your entire sense of reality and
how you navigate life this is going to pull back
the curtain in a sense this is the ultimate conspiracy
theory it is a conspiracy theory that trumps all other
conspiracy theories so you've been warned so what is the
social matrix the social matrix is the entire collection that
we might call society of elements i'll be explaining what
these elements are in a minute of various elements and
institutions which are used by your mind in order to
as reference points as anchors in order to construct your
sense of reality and how you should live your life
what most people don't appreciate is just how deeply social
human beings are the human mind our psyche we like
to think that our mind is just interacting with reality
with an objective reality out there and that the information
that we get from society like from the books that
we read from the schools we go to from the
people we talk to the public intellectuals we listen to
and so forth that they are just giving us straight
reports of what reality is what we're not noticing is
we're not noticing how we as a human species are
actually co-constructing reality together and are using each other in
this social fabric sort of way in order to create
a sort of web of reality that all of us
together can participate in and do so in such an
unconscious manner that we are not aware of this larger
construction that we've made and then we confuse that construction
for reality itself and then our society is designed in
such a way as to make this process opaque to
us so that we don't see what's going on and
we take it as reality this is such a profound
notion that it's difficult to even know where to begin
unraveling it and explaining it because it's a giant intertangled
tapestry and web that we have woven together and it's
precisely because the web extends so far in all directions
and it has no opposite or it has no alternative
that you can appeal to that the web seems like
reality itself this is the social matrix but now let's
get very concrete what do i mean here what i
really mean here is how do you know anything at
all about reality about life about what it is about
what's right about what's wrong about what you should do
what you shouldn't do what's true what's false how do
you even know where humanity came from how do you
even know where your family came from how do you
know where you physically came from how do you know
where your body came from what your body is made
out of how do you know these things if you
do a sort of archaeology on your own mind you
can go back and look in in your past you
can excavate and try to unravel the beginnings of your
own mind and your own sense of reality and knowledge
where did it all come from and what you'll start
to notice is that 99 of everything you know and
believe came from society came from other people you didn't
discover it on your own you didn't do the experiments
you weren't there in the past to see human history
you weren't there at your own conception in your own
birth where did you get all this information you think
you know what is happening here but where did you
get this information you got it from other people but
notice if you got it from other people this assumes
something this assumes the people you got it from themselves
were not self-deceived and this is the trick this is
what you've taken for granted you've always assumed from the
very beginning of your life that the information that you've
been being fed regardless of who or where it was
being fed to you from whether your parents your siblings
your friends your coworkers professors teachers religious leaders whoever you
were getting your information from you've always generally assumed that
the information was true and that those people were not
lying to you and were not themselves self-deceived so here
this episode is going to explain to you how it
is possible that you can be so thoroughly self-deceived about
the nature of reality as to be just completely wrong
about what's really going on here how is that possible
in previous episodes i've talked about this notion of self-deception
and i've made some radical claims about epistemology about ontology
metaphysics science and other things and sometimes it's like well
some of these claims are so radical how how is
it possible that mankind can be so wrong how can
we be so deluded together collectively as well as individually
well this episode explains how that's possible the reason it's
possible for us to be collectively so self-deluded i mean
individually so self-deluded is because actually were individuals participating in
a collective self deception and that collective part is crucial
because there's actually no way that an individual could be
so deluded as we are generally speaking unless we were
doing it all together because when we do it all
together you see this makes it seem more real together
we can construct a fiction that we couldn't construct by
ourselves individually it's hard to brainwash yourself individually you do
it to some extent but it's difficult what really sells
the self-deception is when everybody else around you is doing
it too and then the peer pressure of it and
the normalization of it makes you buy into it so
what am i talking about here to get concrete about
this look we have society society is a very broad
thing with many elements that i'll be mentioning right now
we have different segments of society and each of these
segments present us with knowledge and information that we use
to make sense of our reality and to anchor and
ground ourselves literally from these different elements you are making
sense of reality and developing a sense of sanity without
which you might lose your mind so for example we
have broad segments like we have the media which includes
stuff like books the news entertainment movies video games music
celebrities that you might be interested in following and listening
to because you value their opinion because they're celebrities they're
famous and you like them for whatever reason maybe they
were in a comedy or they were in a drama
in a movie and they're a rapper whatever you look
up to them we have public intellectuals too you might
value their minds or you might think that they are
more smart than everybody else therefore you look up to
these people you have people on television you have news
anchors you look up to these people it doesn't matter
whether you know of course you're not going to agree
with every news anchor and every source of information i'm
not saying that you agree with all this stuff i'm
saying that you're cherry picking which of the media you
agree with but generally you've been watching this media for
your entire life reading newspapers or watching saturday morning cartoons
or going to the movies with your friends or reading
various books as homework assignments from school or just watching
the same kind of stuff that your parents were watching
when you were growing up then you picked up those
habits see and from that you draw information you draw
ideas beliefs about what reality is how life works what's
good what's bad what's right what's wrong what's moral what's
immoral what's true and what's false now of course each
one of us individually is going to draw this doesn't
mean we all believe exactly the same thing that's not
what i'm saying again your chair your mind is cherry
picking you might like some celebrity i might hate that
celebrity i might like some other celebrity so i'm gonna
listen to somebody else and then we're gonna get different
world views based on that you might like fox news
i might like cnn or whatever and we're going to
get different world views based on that but see this
is just the media then we have the internet which
is a more recent development but uh now it's even
more powerful in a sense than all the above uh
now we have social media we have youtube we have
facebook we have twitter we have tiktok we have google
we have wikipedia all of these are sources of information
you use all of these sources you ping these sources
and get back information which you yourself judge as either
valid or invalid see you yourself for example if you
want to look up some fact you're not let's say
you're not sure about something like did the holocaust happen
you might wonder and then you might like go to
google and type it in evidence for the holocaust and
then maybe a wikipedia page comes up you know the
holocaust page that would come up on wikipedia and then
you look through that it's a long page with a
bunch of historical facts and data you read through that
and then uh from that you make up your mind
about whether you think it happened or didn't happen but
see your mind now you're not just blindly doing this
your mind plays a big role because depending on other
influences you got from your parents and from your friends
and from other news outlets you watch and other websites
you go to you know see they might have shaped
how you're going to interpret this wikipedia article like for
example if your parents themselves were holocaust deniers and you
grew up in that environment and so were your friends
they were telling about how jews run the world and
this sorts of stuff then your mind was filled from
an early age with these ideas and now when you
go to that wikipedia page unlike a regular person who
didn't have that background now you're reading that wikipedia page
and now you're skeptical you're very skeptical about everything in
that wikipedia page because of the kind of seeds that
were planted in your mind and you might read the
same wikipedia page that i might read and i might
say that's evidence for the holocaust and you might say
oh no that's just propaganda that's just some sort of
liberal propaganda i'm not interested in arguing whether the holocaust
happened or didn't happen that's irrelevant we're making a very
profound metapoint here about epistemology see the problem is is
how do you know what source is true or valid
at all in the first place like if we really
put you in in sort of a totally clueless totally
ignorant position which is how you started life you knew
nothing about life when you were born how did you
figure out which sources to trust and which not to
trust i want you to contemplate that very very deeply
even after this episode is done i want you to
spend the next week contemplating that very very deeply because
this is the core question i want you to see
that your selection of which sources to trust and not
trust was actually arbitrary and was based on faith largely
and that in fact you did not have any kind
of method or any kind of objective standard that you
used to figure that out that's the whole problem here
you see and as we keep going i'm going to
be we're just we're just we just began articulating some
of the elements of this web or we're going to
be building this web here over the next hour or
two so uh hang hang in there with me because
there's sort of multiple threads and multiple dimensions that we
got to be talking about simultaneously a little bit difficult
to put this into a linear format it's a web
after all multi-dimensional web but look what i'm trying to
say here is that every source that is feeding your
mind with information from society itself is subject to corruption
deception misinformation and delusion and each source itself notice it's
being fueled by individuals like yourself who were also born
at some point in life and didn't know what the
hell was going on and how do they know which
sources to trust so for example you might say well
leo but the the people who wrote the wikipedia page
about the holocaust here you know these were these were
highly esteemed editors of wikipedia they went through sort of
a review process they weren't just random joes these were
like academics many wikipedia pages are written by academic types
you might make that kind of claim okay but see
now what's happening is that you're offloading the sort of
the uh the authority of the wikipedia page onto these
so-called academics if you believe that academics wrote that that
page and i don't even know you know maybe they
did maybe they didn't they didn't that itself is somewhat
unknown because wikipedia itself you're like how does wikipedia vet
who gets to write those articles well you see that
just pushes the problem down one level can we really
be sure that the people who wrote that article were
truly objective what kind of biases did they have where
did they go to school what kind of schooling did
they get and then that takes us into school because
see each time we're going to be questioning any one
of these elements of the web we're always going to
be pushing the can down the road kicking the can
down the road down one level um and appealing to
some other authority so the web the way it works
is that it always appeals to something else within the
web in order to justify itself and to construct this
sense of truth and reality right so now we get
into the education system how do you know you can
trust the education system the schools the universities academia these
are all elements of this social matrix that we're discussing
school boards determine what kind of things are taught in
school but how do we know the things taught in
school are actually the things that need to be taught
how do we know that that itself is not part
of the deception and who's controlling these school boards well
a lot of times it's parents parents get angry when
something is taught in school that they think shouldn't be
taught okay but then those parents where do they get
their notions of what should be taught in school and
what shouldn't be taught in school what's right and what's
wrong to be taught in school well that again so
you see that pushes the problem down one level back
one level because those parents you can't just assume that
those parents were omniscient they were born just like you
ignorant they knew nothing when they were born and where
do they get most of their information about life and
reality and what's right and wrong from school from the
last generation and how did that generation figure out what
should be taught in school well from the previous generation
you see so we have this sort of infinite regress
problem we have universities we have academia we have all
the grades that you get going through the school system
this all influences you credentials diplomas awards peer review journals
in which you publish your your research if you're uh
going for a phd and you're doing serious university research
you got to get published by these journals your career
depends upon it so you got to write what these
journals will accept what are these journals willing to accept
what are their biases who's running these journals these journals
of course are run by people just like you from
the previous generation they're a little bit older maybe they're
30 years older than you they got their phds in
a similar way you got your phd they also got
their phd by writing articles and papers and doing research
to be published in journals what are the standards of
these journals what kind of epistemology do these journals have
the editors at these journals how do we know we
can trust these editors who educated these editors the same
university system so you see what you're going to see
here is you're going to see this sort of vicious
circularity and this sort of deep profound incestuousness within human
epistemology what i'm describing here is sort of a collective
human mind if we take the mind of mankind as
a whole as a species and the question is how
do we know that this mind itself is not self-deceived
what you are going to start to notice as we
add more elements to this web is that every element
reinforces and justifies in a circular manner every other element
in a very self-serving way it's extremely self-serving when you
really zoom out of this whole thing and you take
a look at this massive social uh matrix it really
is um quite obvious how the self-deception is created because
who is there that's going to check this whole system
who is there that's responsible for making sure that this
whole system is not corrupt because you see the people
who write the wikipedia articles are coming from the universities
the people in the universities are coming from the schools
the people who teach in the schools are coming from
universities and the people who taught the people at universities
who are going to go to teach the children in
the schools they also came from universities and schools it's
extremely circular and then people in universities nowadays will actually
go to wikipedia and read wikipedia pages or kids in
school will read wikipedia pages and take that as fact
and reality and then they will use that to reinforce
the university in the school system and then how do
you even find a wikipedia page the only way you
can find a wikipedia page is through a search engine
like google how do you know you can trust google
how do you know what the algorithm of google is
that is serving you up these pages what if there
are portions of the internet that you've never even seen
in your life you don't even know they exist because
google simply won't serve them up to you because what
google serves up what is i mean google's a corporation
what they serve up to you is the stuff that
is most profitable for them to serve up to you
there's no guarantee at all that what google is serving
up to you is the truth google is serving up
to you the stuff that it thinks is most popular
their algorithm includes basically the predominant feature of the google
algorithm what they serve up to you in the rankings
is the highest ranked stuff is simply the stuff that
gets linked to the most and who is doing the
linking and how do you evaluate which links are worth
more than other links for example did you know that
google places way more authority on links coming from universities
than it does from other sources so if if there's
a dot edu domain name like harvard or stanford or
oxford or something like that and it's linking to your
website your website gets ranked much higher in the google
search results than if you don't have those links a
university link might be worth a thousand times more than
a link from some random blog so the way that
google actually ranks their websites i actually have a very
intimate deep knowledge about this because i used to do
seo for a living so i would i would actually
uh study and gain the google search algorithms so um
i have a lot of personal experience with this i
would actually manipulate the search results to get my website
to number one on the search results and i was
very effective at it i earned hundreds of thousands of
dollars doing that um uh it's a very technical very
technical field and by the way google google search results
are being manipulated constantly because it's a it's a trillion
dollar business manipulating these search results so um people are
manipulating google search results all the time they're earning billions
of dollars doing this and the general public has no
idea this is even happening you know a kid when
a kid gets some school assignment he goes to google
innocently he just types in you know about the holocaust
or something or whatever and then he just gets some
results and he just trusts the results he has no
idea the amount of manipulation that went into manipulating those
results now that doesn't mean that every result you get
is bad or untruthful that's not what i'm trying to
say you know i i'm i'm not trying to lay
the ground here or the the groundwork here for holocaust
and now that's not what i'm doing um i'm just
saying that like you can't take this stuff for granted
and you see anyways what the way that google determines
um they have something called pagerank that they assign to
every single page on the internet you know all the
billions of pages every page gets a sort of authority
number between 1 and 10 10 being the highest meaning
that it's the most authoritative so a link coming from
a page rank 10 web web page is a very
very powerful link google actually has a list they've seeded
their algorithm the algorithm the way it creates this page
rank across the entire internet is that it actually has
a list of thousands of what they call authoritative source
websites and any link coming from one of these source
websites basically seeds and creates the foundation for the authority
that then gets spread out uh recursively across the entire
internet through links so if you sort of think about
each link as passing juice link juice passing authority one
page passes an authority to another page by linking to
it so if for example i own a very high
authority website like harvard.edu and i link to some other
page that's going to spread some of the authority that
i have as harvard to some of those other pages
and this is happening recursively throughout the entire internet and
this in this way google determines what to serve up
to you and then what you consider as valid as
as true because you only look at the top like
three search results you don't care about what's on page
10 of google search results right but then how did
google create that list that initial seed list of a
thousand top sources harvard stanford oxford cnn whatever you know
they have they have a whole list of this stuff
how did they create this list well this was done
by humans at google so there was some sort of
committee or panel sitting at google of people and they
said okay we're going to determine that these are the
most authoritative websites but how did they figure that out
how do they know that what was the epistemology they
had to determine that well of course the people at
google are pretty smart most of them went to universities
a lot of them went like to stanford the google
founders are from stanford for what i can remember so
of course they're going to have a natural bias towards
putting stanford on their list and putting other universities on
their list so you see any biases which are baked
into the entire university academia system will automatically get baked
into google search results and now influence the minds of
every single human on the planet and what's worse than
sort of a circular move what's going gonna happen is
that then the people in the universities at stanford harvard
oxford and elsewhere they themselves there are researchers and professors
and academics there who they do research and when they
do research what do they do they go into google
and they type stuff in like if you if you're
a researcher at a university and you want to know
like you have some sort of research question you have
the first thing you're going to do is you're going
to go to google and you're going to type it
and you're going to look for research papers that will
pop up or something like that but what you're not
going to notice is you're not going to notice that
the search results that google serves up to you is
already biased by what they got from universities so this
is creating a question begging scenario a sort of a
circular logic where the thing you're searching for is being
validated by the place from which you're searching uh this
reminds me of a sort of a funny circular scenario
like that that happened with the like with the iraq
war um when they were trying to justify you know
invading iraq during the bush era uh they started sprinkling
rumors of like weapons of mass destruction and so forth
existing uh in iraq and then what happened was like
there's some i don't remember all the details but basically
what happened was like you know like dick cheney would
get on the phone and call uh you know call
the uh the cia and you know ask them hey
you guys we need to are there like weapons of
mass destruction in uh in iraq and they say well
the intel is kind of murky we don't really know
and he would say something like well you know get
clear on the intel we need we need like clear
definitive proof because this is serious this is dangerous and
so you know that would put pressure on the on
the intel guys to you know to conjure up some
some proof they would you know do that and then
meanwhile you know he would call like the new york
times and talk to the reporters there and say hey
you know guys uh you know the cia the cia
is telling us that there's uh there's evidence of weapons
of mass destruction in iraq and you know the reporters
would hear that and they would say oh that sounds
serious and then you know they would start writing up
an article about that possibility and then dick cheney might
call another reporter at like a different news outlet the
washington post and say hey you know you know guys
like uh have you read that article that's being written
have you heard about the article that new york times
is writing about potential weapons of mass destruction you know
are you guys on top of that because you don't
want to be like beaten by the new york times
so then those people they knew the new york times
people they would call new york times people say hey
are you guys writing an article about that and they
say oh yeah of course we are you know because
they all know each other all these journalists and stuff
you know it's a very incestuous industry they all know
each other there's rumors there's gossip about who's writing what
rumors spread through the grapevine very easily this way and
so in this way you can easily sort of drum
up a scenario where people start thinking like oh there's
really weapons of mass destruction because all you have to
do is you know place a couple of strategic phone
calls and a couple of rumors and they all they
all cross pollinate and then it starts to seem like
it's real but where's the actual evidence for that well
what happens is that you cite you know the new
york times will cite you know um some anonymous intel
guy in the cia and and then you know the
washington post will will cite the new york times and
then the new york times will recite the washington post
and it's all going to be self-justifying in this way
and because nobody sees the entire picture because every everything
is sort of siloed and localized and everybody's just concerned
about their little corner of this web of information or
misinformation in this case it's like well i'm only responsible
for the article i'm writing for the new york times
that's what the new york times guy thinks and then
the washington post guy thinks well i'm only responsible for
the article that i'm writing here and then you know
the ca the cia guy says well i'm only responsible
for the cia stuff and nobody puts the pieces together
nobody connects all the dots and sees the deception that's
going on well likewise is happening for example with universities
and what's really devious about about this social matrix is
that at every step along the way there are incentives
for you to play along and to not question the
matrix so when you're going through school and you're in
university and you're in academia what are the incentives there
are grades that you get there's advancement that you get
you get applauded for doing well in school and you
get into arguments with your parents when you do bad
in school they yell at you they ground you they
don't give you the video games you want so very
early on in your childhood you learn to do good
in school and then how do you do good in
school well by memorizing the they tell you if you
don't memorize the things they tell you if you question
things they tell you too much you're not going to
have enough time to memorize the stuff they need you
to memorize to get good grades so they're strong incentives
to go along with the system and there's strong disincentives
not to you also get credentials and awards you get
diplomas you need diplomas in order to graduate and go
on to the next level because of course you also
need a job in the end our system is capitalistic
and now we get into the next sort of giant
chunk of this social matrix which is the economy you
see education and media and the internet is intimately tied
in with capitalism and with the economy in fact education
is a giant business first and foremost the foremost aim
of universities and less so schools but i'm there are
many private schools that just are just for profit purely
for profit but for universities i mean you would think
that like harvard or stanford their number one goal would
be truth and education right no of course not it's
managing their giant multi-billion dollar endowments and also maintaining their
authority and reputation you see the same thing that goes
on in google with their search algorithms the way that
the link juice and authority flows through every webpage on
the internet the same thing actually happens before there was
google this was happening just all across brick and mortar
society every society that has ever existed from the dawn
of civilization has had this dynamic of a flow of
authority and reputation and status throughout the institutions of society
certain elements of society are considered authority authoritative and credible
and others are not so if some information is published
on the nasa website you consider that authoritative if some
nasa administrator gives a news conference where he's talking to
journalists and reporters about you know their mission to mars
or whatever um you're gonna take you're gonna generally believe
that nasa guy because he's from nasa and you assume
that well nasa wouldn't be lying to me because they
have oversight boards and they have regulations and you know
they they couldn't get away with it and likewise if
if the dean of harvard tells you something you're going
to take that as a fact most likely most people
would if some professor with a with a with with
three phds writes a book you're gonna give that book
more authority than you are a book by by me
for example and this is happening all across society of
course there's disagreement about who's more authoritative but in general
there's a hierarchy that's developed within society about credible sources
and on credible sources and business plays into all this
so a giant chunk of this whole thing is business
right so what is researched in the universities is that
which gets funded what gets funded what are the biases
that go into funding something you know uh certain scientific
experiments require millions and even billions of dollars of funding
just to roll out a new drug a single drug
might cost 50 or 100 million dollars for some company
so are they going to roll out some natural drug
a natural supplement or herb that they can't earn a
lot of money on that they can't patent or are
they going to be incentivized to only roll out the
drugs that they can patent even though they might not
be as cost effective and even just as effective and
as healthy for you as taking an herb which costs
five dollars rather than five hundred dollars for this drug
you see and so these giant pharmaceutical companies which of
course are billion dollar companies and all of these companies
that are the big players in the economy these are
companies that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars these
companies have so much sway over universities academia schools they
fund entire wings and departments in universities they fund entire
school systems these companies do and do you think they're
just doing out of the kindness of their own heart
or do they have a financial incentive to maximize their
profits of course they're maximizing their profits these companies have
a legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to maximize profits
so there's that and then of course we have the
banking system we have money itself what is money after
all but a social construction which is part of this
social matrix we have the notion of money that we
use to lubricate the exchange between all these different elements
and institutions you're using money you know your parents are
paying good money to send you to university or you're
getting grants from the government to go to university creating
incentives for you to go your teachers when you're young
in school and your parents are already feeding you the
idea that you should go to university it's going to
be good for you and hey it's true if you
go to university you're going to studies show that you're
statistically much more likely to earn a higher salary when
you're older once you graduate the higher your diploma the
more money you're going to earn generally speaking so you
might even take out some loans student loans your parents
might take out some loans in order to help you
to finance your education because they want you to get
a good education then you got wall street another huge
element of this social social network wall street basically determines
where the money is going to flow to which element
is in this social matrix the money is going to
go flow to and wherever the money flows it's almost
like blood in your body that's what uh wall street
is sort of like in our society wall street is
determining where the money is going to flow and where
the money flows those parts of the social matrix are
going to blossom and flower and you know grow and
those parts that don't receive the money they're going to
shrink and shrivel and die so if if blood doesn't
flow to your left hand it's going to shrink and
shrivel and die but then what about wall street is
wall street concerned about the truth what is the epistemic
and moral foundation of wall street it's laughable just even
ask that question because all these all these uh wolves
care about is just pure pure manipulation and money they
have they have no moral ethical standards whatsoever they don't
care about truth whatsoever they're gonna send the money wherever
they can make the most money and that's what they
do and that influences and skews and biases and distorts
this entire social matrix you see and then as part
of the economy i mean you as an individual i
mean you're born into this life and then you have
to like after age 18 you basically have to start
to worry about well how am i going to pay
my rent how am i going to buy my food
how am i going to survive so there's a very
strong incentive for you by the time you're 18 to
start to play ball because if you don't play ball
with this whole system if you start to question the
system too much you're not going to be able to
get a job how are you going to survive you
see so what i want you to see is that
this entire social matrix it's not just something that's happening
frivolously this is how humanity survives collectively and individually it's
a survival system it's an extremely sophisticated elaborate ingenious survival
system and no element no individual element or person in
this network understands or sees the network for what it
is this matrix no one sees the whole picture no
one sees the con game that's really going on here
nobody sees this as a pyramid scheme nobody sees this
as a house of cards but it gets worse we're
just getting started here see we've talked about the education
system we talked about universities we've talked about the economy
how about science people think science leo we can turn
to science as the arbiter of truth that's how we
know what's really true is that it all sort of
percolates down from science science is the ultimate authority source
yeah well what justifies science's authority how do you know
science is valid have you actually done any science in
your life no all the science you know is just
beliefs that you've accepted from authority figures that is the
case and the majority of science that most professional scientists
know so-called no uh is just also something they got
from other authority figures in fact that is the that
is the sort of game of science the reason scientists
are so conservative and try to be so rigorous and
are so fearful of pseudoscience and other sorts of woo
nonsense is because their entire careers and reputations depend upon
the authority and the credibility that they're able to maintain
in a sense scientists are like women they have to
pretend to be virgins because their survival depends upon it
because no guy wants to marry a so even if
a woman is a she has to pretend like she's
a virgin well a scientist the same way you know
so scientists play this game their entire lives where they
are trying to be very very careful not to say
something too outrageous because if they say something too outrageous
they go too far out on a limb it's going
to destroy their entire reputation if a scientist is disproven
one too many times if they publish one too many
research articles which gets disproven or debunked there goes their
entire career so see this gives them a very conservative
bias and the reason they need to do that is
because deep down science is built upon because it's impossible
for one individual scientist to do all of the science
experiments themselves impossible they're too difficult too much technical expertise
is required in too much time and too much money
so what's required is that we distribute this problem over
thousands of individual scientists so one scientist does one research
study another scientist does another research study and then we
can share the studies you know across each other and
then we can both as though have knowledge of both
studies without by only having done one of them that's
how science fundamentally works except we're doing this thousands of
times and distributing this across thousands of different individuals but
you see the more you distribute it the less validation
there is of every individual study so if you take
any university professor or scientist and ask them how many
studies have you actually personally validated in your own life
it's going to be a handful 5 10 20 at
most and then you ask them but how many studies
do you cite and take as truth and use to
build up your world view they will have to admit
it's going to be thousands thousands and thousands and thousands
of studies so see thousands of them are taken on
faith and then five or ten are actually validated into
personally by that individual and this is happening across the
board and then that is getting percolated down through the
the social matrix through the down the the hierarchy chain
the authority the link juice sort of flows downwards and
it infects the minds of every university student who then
goes on because the university students they become the next
generation of teachers then that any corruptions or errors that
the scientists had they percolate down into the university students
then those university students percolated down into the school system
all the way down to the kindergarten level and then
of course people who go to these universities they become
the politicians they become the ceos they become the managers
the business leaders they become the next generation of teachers
of professors of internet entrepreneurs all these people generally they
went to university all of this is constructing within the
mind a sense of reality and by the way as
all this is going on nobody in this system is
questioning what's going on at the epistemic level the word
epistemology is not even mentioned in the majority of classes
books and even scientific discussions many scientists will treat questions
of epistemology or metaphysics derisively as though this is some
sort of frivolous armchair philosophy and speculation and that science
doesn't need epistemology science doesn't need metaphysics this is the
general attitude and then the attitude is even worse outside
the university system if you start talking about metaphysics or
epistemology to a ceo or to a business person or
to a marketing person or to a politician or to
a person running a non-profit organization or to one of
these tech entrepreneurs at google or the guy running wikipedia
or youtube or facebook or whatever you start talking about
epistemology they don't care at all that word is not
in their world view it is not in their lexicon
much less metaphysics they don't care about metaphysics they don't
care about truth all of these people are participating in
a game of survival they care about their bank accounts
they care about their children and their family they care
about their friends their care they care about entertainment and
having fun and they care about sex and they care
about buying fast cars and yachts and they care about
being famous and they care about making progress and breakthroughs
in their technical work they don't care about truth they
don't care about bismarck they don't care about metaphysics they
don't even basically care about society as a whole they're
not holistic thinkers they're only concerned with their business you
know the people at google are only concerned about google
they're not concerned about the whole world they're not concerned
about the entire epistemic framework that is informing all of
mankind they don't care about that the professors in their
university at harvard they don't care about the the health
of the entire ecosystem of the education system they don't
care about that they care about harvard and even there
it's probably even more local than just caring about harvard
most of the professors at harvard probably only care about
their little department within harvard if you're a physicist at
harvard you don't care about all of harvard you only
care about physics the physics department and even there you
might not even care about the physics department you might
only care about the uh you know like the nuclear
physics department if you're a nuclear physicist you might only
care about that sub sub field and you might only
care about your own personal work and the research paper
you're going to publish to you know next quarter and
not even your little department and you certainly don't take
any responsibility for the epistemic ecosystem of all of society
if you're a professor scientist phd researcher ceo business owner
educator teacher celebrity public intellectual entertainer artist filmmaker musician you're
not taking responsibility for the entire social matrix you don't
even know this is a thing you're clueless about all
of this but it gets worse see how does mankind
even know where mankind came from through history stories and
myths that's all we basically have how do you know
history is true i mean after all it is just
basically a chain of humans telling other humans what happened
effectively sure you can find evidence you can find evidence
of like uh you know archaeological evidence of pottery and
weaponry and ancient cities you can unearth those and validate
some things here some things there but do you really
know like how do you how do you know that
julius caesar was assassinated by his senators how do you
even know that's true where'd you get that information from
of course you got it from some authority source that
you uh trust it's hearsay it's just hearsay and who
where they get it from well they got it from
some other source it's here say on top of here
say on top of here say it's a hierarchy of
hearsay that's the majority of what human history is and
most of it is taken for granted but what about
the biases of the people who are relating the information
what about the interpretive distortions that their minds are putting
on this information because every mind that is holding these
stories and myths is interpreting in a different way has
different agendas that it has different biases that it has
it's reporting some things correctly other things incorrectly there's distortions
exaggerations many things are left out which are inconvenient those
people who were killed they don't even get to report
their side of the story and of course there's a
constant whitewashing of history because human history is so savage
and brutal and ugly and devilish that every group has
to whitewash its own history because otherwise they would just
be transparent devils your ancestors would look like villains so
every race every ethnicity every culture has to whitewash their
history to you know pretty it up polish it up
put some lipstick lipstick on that pig um before you
present it to the children so that your children grow
up with a sense of pride in their culture and
their lineage and their history and their culture and their
people there's also many cultural elements to this social matrix
ceremonies rituals holidays various prestiges and awards that you get
as playing into this social matrix there are many norms
and taboos within the social matrix taboos for what kind
of sex you're allowed to have and not allowed to
have what's moral what's immoral what you should do what
you shouldn't do what's respectable what's not respectable what's allowed
in polite society and what's not you know as you
start to climb the social hierarchy you want to really
become somebody in this world in the society you want
to become someone rich someone famous someone powerful someone who
has access to important people in the world you have
to play by their rules play their game you have
to subscribe to their norms you have to be polite
to them you have to be nice to them you
have to treat them well you have to kiss their
ass you have to blow smoke up their ass and
then they'll reward you otherwise they'll ostracize you and shun
you and maybe they'll even do something nasty to you
they might ruin your ability to have a career by
gossiping about you behind your back locking you out of
some industry virtually every industry is deeply incestuous whatever industry
you're in people in that industry know each other gossip
to each other constantly the top players in the industry
all know each other they all network together they go
to conferences to seminars to workshops they have mastermind groups
they go to country clubs they socialize they play political
games with each other they build social networks with each
other these social networks then are used to advance themselves
and enrich themselves giving them access to money power sex
friendship and many other of the basic core needs of
a human psyche also part of this social matrix is
food and cuisine what kind of food you eat and
this is deeply tied in with business and with the
economy because the kind of food you put into your
body affects then how you're able to think how conscious
you're able to be but the food that is widely
available is the lowest quality most toxic and poisonous food
that there is the cheapest food every restaurant every fast
food place that you go to from your birth till
today has been feeding you poison inorganic food full of
artificial additives trans fats carcinogens god knows what else pesticides
heavy metals and you might think well but what does
that have to do with a social matrix well but
you see the restaurant industry the fast food industry the
supermarket industry all the food that is marketed to you
on television and on youtube and throughout ads everywhere from
coca-cola to mcdonald's to whatever else this is all part
of the social matrix and it's all part of business
billions of dollars are earned in this way by feeding
you this toxic food which then corrupts your mind's ability
to make sense of reality you get hooked and addicted
to this food because that's of benefit to those people
who are selling you the food which brings us to
the next huge part of the social matrix which is
the advertising system this is huge and i've talked about
it before in my episode called the deep problem of
marketing go check that out um but to cover it
briefly here basically the entire epistemic ecosystem that we as
a species have today is deeply influenced by marketing and
advertising literally trillions of dollars are spent every year around
the world on marketing and advertising campaigns these marketing advertising
campaigns are designed with scientific laser-like precision to trigger your
limbic system and your deepest fears and anxieties in order
to get you to buy that you wouldn't otherwise buy
and to behave in irrational emotionally driven ways whether it's
food gadgets technology sex alcohol weed nowadays in america is
starting to be advertised pharmaceuticals or defense contractors or big
oil companies all the ads you see everywhere think tanks
do advertising political advertising all of this is influencing what
you think is true what you believe what you know
about the world and about reality and about what's right
about what's wrong and do these marketing executives and people
doing these marketing campaigns do they care about the health
of the epistemic ecosystem do they care about truth do
they care about consciousness do they care about love no
all they care about is getting you to buy their
that's all they care about and if their kills you
they don't care no sweat off their back at all
and their marketing and advertising to children all the time
starts with toys and then food and then everything else
and your children as they're growing up from age two
their minds are being brainwashed with this advertising as they're
watching cartoons as they're playing their video games as they're
online they're seeing banner ads youtube ads for all sorts
of toxic dysfunctional untruthful distorted biased stuff and this is
all influencing the development of your children's minds and this
is happening like a drip drip drip drip system it's
happening for 20 years your children are getting brainwashed with
this and hey i mean this happened to you too
not just your children but it's happening to you too
you're you're already you're already a slave to this whole
system you see um and this has influenced your tastes
your desires your values your fears your anxieties these ads
in very subtle and unconscious ways in such ways that
you don't even know what your authentic values are or
would be without this advertising you don't even know what
kind of food you would eat if not for all
the food advertising that you've received over the last 30
years of your life you don't even know you don't
even know what your life would feel like without eating
this garbage food for the last 30 years of your
life see you think that oh leo i'm depressed and
my life sucks that i can't follow up on my
life purpose and i can't do anything i'm demotivated and
i can't meditate and i can't do spiritual work and
i need to take all these medications for my adhd
and my depression and my autism and all this sorts
of stuff and my mental illness i gotta take all
this medication and see you think that that there's so
where do you think that came from a large majority
that came from your lifetime of just eating shitty food
most of your health problems came from eating shitty food
for so long and you've been so brainwashed you don't
even understand that what you're eating is poison because it's
been marketed to you as great stuff healthy stuff hey
it's low fat low calorie free of trans fat it's
all natural it's organic it's organic so how can it
be bad for you well it can still have heavy
metals in it it can still have pesticides in it
but leo organic food has no pesticides oh yes it
does organic food can have more pesticides they just have
to be organic pesticides just because it's an organic pesticide
doesn't mean that it won't cause cancer in your body
or it won't give you depression or it won't throw
your hormones out of whack or give you an autoimmune
disorder see but you see when food is being advertised
to you on tv like when mcdonald's is advertising to
you their big mac are they telling you what's really
in the big mac are they truly informing you about
what's in there are they telling you how many calories
are they telling you the ingredients are they telling you
the quantity of heavy metals of pesticides of other things
hormones are they informing you of the effect this has
on your body on the possibility of cancer on your
immune system on your capacity and ability than to to
fight with diseases and viruses are they telling you any
of this no they're only telling you what they need
to tell you to get you to buy it because
if you truly were shown the full picture if you
were given all the information about a big mac you
would never put it in your mouth so the entire
advertising system is designed to deceive you and to misinform
you that is the sole function of advertising is to
misinform you to such a degree that you will then
buy whatever is being sold so literally you're being lied
to every single day by youtube videos by tv commercials
by radio ads by podcasters by celebrities by people on
twitter who are doing sponsored tweets by the sponsorships from
your favorite public intellectuals most of your public intellectual favorite
public intellectuals probably have a podcast and on their podcast
they probably do ads and sponsorships that they got paid
for but of course they claim oh but leo i
truly genuinely believe in the value of this product i
wouldn't advertise something i didn't believe in the only kind
of sponsorships i take are the ones i really believe
in right that's what you tell yourself but the stuff
you believe in is precisely what serves your survival again
it's a self-justifying system you're going to believe in whatever
is going to help you to get money fame power
sex love approval all of the basic needs you have
as a human that's what you're gonna believe in and
of course your boss you're probably gonna have a boss
your boss where did he get his worldview from your
boss went through the same system you went through maybe
he's a bit older than you but not that much
older and he went through the same system he also
got brainwashed by marketing and advertising he also went to
university he also uh watched the similar youtube videos that
you watched and participated watch the same movies you watch
participated in the same you know it likes the same
celebrities you might like and listens to them listens to
the same public intellectuals so he's basically got the same
worldview that you do he's participating in the same social
matrix alongside you and now if you want a job
if you want to survive in the world you have
to please your boss you can't piss him off you
can't have a worldview that's radically different from his that
contradicts his because if your worldview contradicts his that's going
to get him to start to question his worldview and
he's not going to like that it's not going to
feel too good for him besides which his worldview as
a boss is completely soaked with with notions of capitalism
because it serves his survival his whole business is built
upon exploiting labor this is baked into his worldview so
he can't have ideas put into his mind that somehow
what he's doing is wrong that somehow he's too greedy
or he's hurting the environment or he's polluting and corrupting
the political system with his lobbying efforts if you work
at facebook or google or youtube as just a programmer
an employee can you go to your boss to your
head executive to the ceo of your company and tell
them something like hey you know what i love working
here but um but the kind of lobbying that our
company does in the government um to get subsidies and
to get government contracts and to get special perks and
bonuses and tax cuts uh for for corporate for large
corporations i think that's immoral and unethical and illegal even
it should be illegal what's gonna happen if you tell
that to your boss you're gonna get fired the next
day they don't want somebody like you around you see
so just by the fact that you have to have
a boss and just have to live i mean you
don't have to have a boss you can be your
own buzz but uh but that just pushes the can
down the road because if you're gonna be your own
boss you're competing against other bosses essentially like if you
start your own business you think oh leo i can
avoid all this i can start my own green high
conscious loving business that cares about truth and epistemology and
and metaphysics and i'm not going to lie to anybody
i'm not going to you know deceive anybody i'm going
to be totally truthful oh yeah how are you going
to survive how are you going to survive this ecosystem
when everybody is advertising how can you compete with that
you're going to go out of business very quickly that's
what you'll discover or you're going to quickly learn that
you can't tell the truth you have to play by
the same rules that those guys are playing by which
means you gotta engage in lobbying you gotta engage in
bribery you gotta engage in capitalism because you're competing against
others who also are you got to pay the lowest
wages you gotta evade every possible tax you can after
all all your friends are doing the same thing so
what's wrong with it all your country club friends all
your millionaires and billionaires that you're friends with they're doing
it too and they don't think there's anything wrong with
it so maybe there's nothing wrong with it that's how
you start to think and then there's charities and non-profits
you might say well leo i'll just go into into
the non-profit sector and i'll avoid all this nasty stuff
that's related to business oh yeah will you really the
charity sector and the nonprofit sector is perhaps even more
corrupt than business businesses today giant businesses and multinational corporations
are using charities and non-profits in order to launder their
reputations because now what's starting to happen is that collective
consciousness is rising so much we're starting to see how
toxic this success of capitalism is that companies just can't
be bold faced unreal pet and capitalists anymore now they
have to now they have to do a little bit
of a veneer of like oh we care about the
animals we care about the environment we care about pollution
we care about racism we care about lgbtq issues we
care about uh democracy and so forth and you know
we care about the starving children in africa so we're
going to donate 10 million dollars to this nonprofit charity
organization which is helping kids in africa and you know
we're goldman sachs or we're boeing or we're lockheed martin
or we're exxon mobil and look we're not we're not
these selfish corporations we actually care about uh humanitarian issues
we donate millions of dollars and see that money gets
fed into the non-profit sector and then those people who
go into the non-profit sector thinking they're going to avoid
this giant corporate business corruption um but then all your
funding for your non-profits where are you going to get
your money you're going to get it from those from
those guys who have all the money you're going to
get from the millionaires and billionaires because little people who
are barely you know scraping by you know wage slaves
they're not going to donate a lot to your to
your chair your non-profit most of this money for your
charity is coming from for millionaires and how do they
get it by participating in this system and of course
they're going to only give you the money if you
treat them nicely if you give them perks if you
thank them if you kiss their ass if you blow
smoke up their ass and so in this way that
money will crawl into your non-profit and corrupt your nonprofit
and then your nonprofit will adopt similar values to the
businesses because your nonprofit has to survive too see the
common denominator beneath all these actors and agents and systems
and elements is survival every one of them is struggling
to survive and not just the people but also the
institutions do so the university professor is struggling to survive
the high school teacher is struggling to survive the guidance
counselor at the elementary school she starts struggling to survive
the the doctor he's struggling to survive the politician is
struggling for his survival the ceo is struggling for his
survival the stockholders are struggling for their survival the retiree
who invested his retirement savings in the stock is struggling
for his survival which leads us to technology the next
element of this whole matrix is technology what kind of
technology is developed who develops the technology the businesses of
course technology usually requires a lot of money that money
comes from the giant businesses those giant businesses earn the
money through massive advertising and marketing and so the technology
gets developed is the kind of technology that is easiest
to market and to advertise and what kind of technology
is the easiest to market advertise is it the healthiest
the most conscious the most truthful the most loving the
most scientifically accurate no it's the one that pushes all
of your emotional buttons so even the very technology we
developed is biased and corrupt and then that technology you
see it feeds in to the social matrix so the
kind of technologies that become the most popular are not
just one-off technologies but technologies that can reinforce this entire
game the internet the smartphone social media twitter youtube twitch
virtual reality all of this expands the depth and juiciness
of the social matrix making it more difficult to see
and to escape it makes the social matrix even more
mesmerizing and all-encompassing when you put on those virtual reality
goggles and then the first thing that comes up is
the facebook logo and some advertisement thanks to facebook before
you enter your virtual world you see that is already
the social matrix shaping your epistemology what you know what
you believe as true what you value what you desire
what you fear and it seems so innocent like well
it's just a facebook logo and just a one ad
you know how bad can one ad be and vice
besides this one ad is it's something i like it's
an ad for a coke and i love coke yeah
because you've been brainwashed with ads for coke for the
last 30 years see that's the that's the trick with
brainwashing is that once you've been brainwashed it's like stockholm
syndrome you uh you start to actually love the thing
you've been brainwashed with you sort of think that like
well if i'm brainwashed with something it's something nasty that
i don't like but no the whole point of brainwashing
is that you get brainwashed enough then you start to
like the thing that's actually bad for you it's like
being in an abusive relationship it's bad for you but
you'll love it too much to quit it's like a
drug it's horrible for you it's destroying your body and
your teeth and your career and everything else but you
can't stop which leads us to the next big piece
of the social matrix which is government of course laws
courts the police the prison system the military system the
intelligence system the intelligence apparatus taxation empire subsidies government contracts
regulations the entire notion of a country you your epistemic
worldview actually believes you're living in a country you were
born in some country you actually have a national identity
that you have identified yourself with you're american or you're
japanese or chinese or russian or german whatever you are
this infects your self-image it infects your political beliefs and
ideas along with that national identity comes a a national
history and a legacy of course which has all been
whitewashed most of it is not even true but nevertheless
you've been brainwashed with it in school they taught you
if you're an american they taught you to recite the
pledge of allegiance or to sing the national anthem they
taught you about the founding fathers and how great they
were of course didn't really mention the raping of the
slaves and all that so much and then we have
political parties we have lobbying we have think tanks there
are entire multi-billion dollar think tanks whose sole purpose is
to shape public opinion about homosexuality abortion church and school
or prayer in school rather corporate lobbying the military environmental
issues and many other things and they do this through
advertising through youtube channels through facebook ad campaigns through articles
on the internet through blogs through their own hiring their
own journalists even developing their own entire news network i
mean fox news is basically a a propaganda machine of
the right wing it's a multi-billion dollar propaganda machine do
they care about truth objective reporting metaphysics epistemology i mean
it's laughable it's laughable to even ask these questions nobody
there cares does anybody at cnn care about metaphysics and
epistemology no they don't care you see everybody is so
preoccupied with their little local corner in this matrix just
struggling to survive you know even like a cnn anchor
who earns 10 20 million dollars a year he's just
struggling to survive at cnn i guarantee you he's struggling
to survive every day he wakes up and he's just
struggling to survive you might think leo that's crazy these
people have so much money and success and fame they're
not struggling oh yes they are it doesn't matter how
much money you have the struggle is all the same
in fact the more money you have the more fame
you have the more responsibility you have as like a
public figure as a news anchor or something you know
there's a lot of pressure on these news anchors they
feel it i'm sure they feel it every single day
it doesn't get easier actually gets harder because the stakes
are higher if you had a billion dollars you would
be waking up in the morning and worrying about where
do i invest my billion dollars so it's not lost
how do i avoid taxes on this billion dollars how
do i prevent my children from being kidnapped because i
have this billion dollars now i got to put my
children to a private school i got to get security
cameras i got to hire bodyguards because when people find
out you got a billion dollars there's a whole new
set of challenges that arises you see so with the
government piece see the government is completely made up of
the people who are players in this social matrix all
the people who vote to elect people in the government
are people who have been brainwashed by this social matrix
completely it's the teachers the university professors the doctors the
scientists the business people the marketers the advertisers all of
them were brainwashed by the system and all of them
now go and vote and then not only do they
vote but they participate too they volunteer or they get
elected they run for office or they become the judges
they become the police people they become the military people
they become the intelligence people they become the tax collectors
they become the regulators they become the politicians and then
they govern but what place do they govern from are
they governing from a place of concern about the epistemology
of this whole system or the metaphysics or caring about
truth or love or consciousness no they're also just barely
struggling to survive as a politician or as a bureaucrat
and they have been so brainwashed through the marketing system
the business system and all this the school system and
by science they've been so brainwashed by the culture that
now the laws and policies they're going to pass are
all going to be the kind that reinforces this system
so they will make it such that even to question
the system could be made illegal you could be put
in jail just for questioning the system too much for
example there are laws that have been passed in certain
states i don't know exactly which states i think in
most states actually that it's illegal to videotape to take
a video camera into a slaughterhouse in america that's been
made illegal isn't that the perfect example of the how
the social matrix operates you see this is the perfect
nexus point the sort of incestuous nexus point between corporations
the food industry government lobbying capitalism marketing and advertising all
of those things interconnect to lead to this one specific
instance of this law that you can't take a video
camera into a slaughterhouse why not because if that video
footage gets out and it percolates through this social matrix
then people are going to be horrified at where their
food comes from and then that's going to be bad
for business bad for stockholders bad for people who invested
in those stocks you know their retirement savings and so
forth might cause problems for politicians because then people who
will be angry the politicians aren't doing anything about this
and that they're sort of in bed with these corporations
this sort of stuff um and then and then even
as an individual even the individuals in the system don't
want this because they're going to be disgusted because they
don't want to know how the sausage is made you
like your sausage and you don't want to be shown
a video on your favorite tv show of how your
sausage is made because you enjoy your sausage and your
sausage by the way is part of your culture it's
part of your cuisine you actually have a mythos the
social matrix has developed a mythos in your psyche about
the lineage and ancestry of these sausages and how how
wonderful your ancestor ate these sausages and it's part of
your culture and your heritage and every thanksgiving you eat
one of these sausages and it's so good and the
whole family comes around and eats the same sausage and
now all that is spoiled yeah these are our traditions
which are being spoiled so of course we're going to
pass a law against that you see how this works
so notice that even though for what i'm describing here
in a sense is a sort of a conspiracy theory
the ultimate conspiracy theory might say but the difference between
this and the dumb conspiracy theories out there is that
here we're not offloading the problem onto any group of
people or elites i'm not saying that this is being
done to you by some nefarious group of reptilians or
something like that i am describing a force of nature
like gravity and that force of nature is survival this
force of nature like gravity is not exclusive to jupiter
or to mars every object in the universe exerts gravity
the more mass they have the more gravity they exert
likewise this force of nature that i'm describing called survival
it's not limited to elites or to billionaires or millionaires
or greedy corrupt politicians this force of survival is in
every human and it's proportional to the amount of self
and ego that you have it's proportional to the amount
of attachment and fear that you have and it's inversely
proportional to the amount of consciousness that you have and
so i'm not saying that you are an innocent bystander
in this system i'm saying you're a participant in this
system you're a player just like everybody else around you
as a player so don't go blaming and pointing your
finger at the at the billionaires they're just like you
these billionaires went to the same schools i mean they
went to private schools but you get the idea i
mean they basically got the same cultural memes infected into
their mind as you did not that not that different
from you in fact they might be more evolved than
you many of them are but we haven't even mentioned
the piece of the matrix which is religion every nation
every culture has a predominant religion that influences that culture
this is true all around the world it's true even
in so-called atheistic countries like uh soviet russia uh supposedly
you know secular china it's still influenced by religious ideas
spiritual ideas of the past um scriptures sayings these uh
you know various quotations holy books this informs the morality
and ethics of of the social matrix both in positive
and negative ways and most of these moral norms and
standards and ethics are not questioned these scriptures are not
question how do you know these scriptures are true how
do you know the church is true how do you
know these sayings and quotations are true did you validate
any of them yourself no you were just uh indoctrinated
into it another further piece of this social matrix is
language language itself the very grammar and lexicon and vocabulary
that you use to think shapes the pathways that you're
able to think down the kind of distinctions you're able
to make the concepts you're able to hold the ideas
you have this language is programmed into you from age
one basically you learn to think in this language and
of course language changes over time this entire social matrix
is constantly evolving morphing and changing every generation what you're
able to think language changes influenced by religion by spirituality
by science by education by academia by government by politics
by culture by art by entertainment all of this influences
language and language in the opposite direction influences all of
those so again it becomes this very incestuous sort of
cycle there are certain ideas that you can't even think
because you're so locked into the social matrix of your
culture and your language and your society you haven't been
giving the vocabulary to think these things and then we
have the piece of the social matrix which is your
closest relations family relatives friends and co-workers basically all the
people you hang out with face to face have fun
with go to parties with socialize with as you're doing
all that you want to maintain all these people in
your life because they're a source of happiness and love
for you so you don't want to upset your family
too much you don't upset your friends too much you
don't want to set your co-workers too much you have
to work together to maintain a family or a circle
of friends so that there's peace and harmony there at
work too and how do you do that by believing
in the social matrix because all your friends do all
your family do all your coworkers do they've completely bought
into it hook line and sinker they don't question at
all and as soon as you start questioning it they
quickly put you in your place they tell you oh
that's that's dangerous don't question that what are you doing
stop wasting time that's just philosophy that's just metaphysics epistemology
that's some just you know be normal stop being weird
stop rocking the boat you've noticed this if you try
to talk to some of your friends or family about
some of the stuff that i teach here with self-actualization
they quickly put you in your place and you're afraid
to lose them if you start questioning the system too
much how are you going to get along with your
family at christmas time at thanksgiving how can you still
keep your friends if you realize that you're putting poison
in your mouth every single day from the food that
you're being advertised and you stop eating that food how
can then you go out for lunch or dinner with
your friends if you realize that your job and your
in the place you're working at is having a corrupt
influence on government or on society on people through advertising
through marketing through lobbying through technology you know bad technologies
whatever you can't even share that with your co-workers because
your co-workers then are going to have seeds of doubt
in their mind and they're going to start to feel
bad about the work they're doing they don't like that
they don't want to feel nobody wants to feel bad
so your co-workers are going to look down on you
for you know causing trouble at work when you start
to question these things because they don't want their job
endangered it's like what are you doing questioning our boss
you know our boss is paying our paychecks every month
and i gotta pay for my kids school and lunch
and medical bills i can't worry about lobbying and i
can't worry about the kind of toxic that our company
dumps into the rivers and i can't worry about the
unethical advertising campaigns we do i got to worry about
my children going to school that's what i got to
worry about that's how your coworkers think any social gathering
you go to is also a part of this social
matrix clubs bars parties country clubs banquets expos conferences workshops
seminars and all of the conversation happening these social gatherings
what is it going to be it's all going to
be within the social matrix if you go to one
of these social gatherings and you start talking about some
of this weird stuff outside the social matrix people are
going to look at you like you're crazy and you're
not going to be able to fit in in that
environment so you got to play by their rules talk
about the same shallow stuff they talk about can you
talk about metaphysics and epistemology at these places no can
you talk about consciousness and love no another aspect of
the social matrix is etiquette dress and fashion gender role
sexuality where did you get your sense of fashion from
where did you get your ideas about gender and sexuality
from what's polite and what's impolite you got all this
from the social matrix you didn't invent the stuff yourself
you weren't born and then you you said yourself you
know what i'm a man so for me it's wrong
to wear high heels and therefore never wore high heels
that was brainwashed into you and you never questioned it
see you weren't born and then said to yourself well
it's wrong to have sex with animals no you have
not spent a single moment of your life seriously contemplating
the ethics of whether it's right or wrong to have
sex with animals you just know it's wrong because that's
what was brainwashed into you and anything other to that
you think is weird crazy criminal evil and useless to
even think about of course another huge part that we
have we should have mentioned earlier really is the healthcare
system medicine the healthcare system pharmaceuticals i touched upon pharmaceuticals
earlier uh doctors this is a huge part of the
social matrix so where do you get your ideas of
what's healthy and what's not healthy of what chemicals are
drugs and which ones are not drugs how do you
even know what a drug is where did you get
the idea that you should listen to your doctor that
your doctor is not some fool giving you bad advice
but you see your doctor went through this entire social
matrix through 12 years of schooling through four years of
you know bachelor's education through another four years of md
education and then did residencies and all this other stuff
has come out that whole system completely brainwashed by the
social matrix and furthermore the giant pharmaceutical companies come by
the doctor's office every single week with their advertising campaigns
pamphlets and free samples and give them out free samples
and then the of various kinds of new drugs and
then these doctors they go to conventions and they go
to to ski resorts and other things that are hosted
by these pharmaceutical companies to advertise more drugs to them
and then they sell those drugs to you is the
doctor sitting there and thinking about the entire epistemic ecosystem
of the medical healthcare industry please it's laughable the idea
is laughable are these doctors actually themselves doing any real
science no not a single doctor does serious science where
do all these doctors get their information through google through
books through research studies all of which are completely co-opted
by the social matrix and then perhaps we'll start to
wrap it up here the last element of this social
matrix that we'll talk about is the sort of the
mental health health system therapy psychotherapy this is also all
part of the social matrix how do you know what
is sane what is insane what is healthy and what
is unhealthy mentally speaking also from a sort of doctor
a doctor of the mind a psychologist a therapist and
where did this guy or gal get his his knowledge
about the mind from about what's healthy and unhealthy for
the human mind he got it from the social matrix
and does the social matrix actually know what's healthy and
unhealthy for the human mind no in fact mostly what
it considers healthy is actually deeply unhealthy for the human
mind this entire social matrix does not care about health
it never has it cares about survival so you might
actually start to question the social matrix to the point
where you start to question your own sense of reality
and you might even start to get a little bit
nihilistic and depressed about it and you might say well
maybe i should go to a shrink and get their
advice so you go to a shrink and you start
talking about some of the stuff that i'm maybe you
heard me talk about before [Music] and when you explain
all this to the strength the shrink will say there's
something wrong with you why because this shrink went through
the whole same system so and the shrink in order
to maintain his shrink practice has to be bought into
the system therefore she or he is going to automatically
defend the system because the shrink can't admit to themselves
that everything they learn about human psychology is is predicated
upon lies and deceptions that wouldn't feel so good to
realize so what you have here now what you can
see is you have this tapestry this tapestry of these
fibers i've been describing these individual fibers to you and
we've been sort of interweaving them together the reality is
that even as much as interwoven interweaving as i've done
here for you it's still not enough to really communicate
how tightly woven the tapestry is like this and it
all reinforces each other it's a house of cards it's
a house of cards and the reason we're talking about
it is because this is how you have constructed your
entire sense of reality life morality values norms ethics political
ideas economic ideas sexual ideas business ideas and this is
why it feels so real the biggest challenge with getting
people to deeply question their epistemology and their metaphysics and
their worldview is that the mind cannot even imagine how
it can be so self-deceived what i'm saying is that
even your idea that you are a physical biological being
made out of atoms and cells and molecules that you
were born to a mother and a father in the
21st century that even that i'm talking about the very
physics of your reality i'm saying the physics of your
reality are are coming from this social matrix and the
idea that it's not coming from the social matrix is
itself part of the social matrix and the idea that
it's dangerous to question the social matrix is coming from
the social matrix and even my communication to you about
the social matrix must come to you through the social
matrix because the social matrix has so deeply taken hold
of your mind there's no way for me to get
to you but through the social matrix and my game
is to show you that you can break free of
the social matrix you can become conscious of the social
matrix you can transcend the social matrix but it's going
to be a lot harder than you think because it's
so ubiquitous it's so deep it's so interconnected it's so
all-encompassing what else is there one of the biggest ways
in which the social matrix maintained its hold over you
is that it simply doesn't allow you to see any
alternative you can't even imagine it shapes and and constrains
your imagination itself it's almost like they have that foot
binding that old traditional foot binding in in china or
in japan i forget in the asian countries they did
this foot binding for for women where you know the
cultural standard was to have these little feet and so
they would bind the feet to the point where they
would bind the feet of little girls where it was
like you can find videos or pictures of this online
it's pretty disgusting with a foot is just they will
take like a little baby foot of a little baby
girl and they will bind it up such that the
foot can't even grow as the skeleton is maturing and
developing such that the woman go grows up with these
disgusting distorted grotesque you know baby feet um that's like
what your mind is like i want you to picture
that little baby foot go go actually pause right now
pause this recording go to google use the social matrix
see we kind of use the social matrix to help
you break out of the so we got to turn
the social matrix on top go to google search for
chinese foot binding or whatever it's called find that picture
look at that picture as you're looking at that ugly
foot i want you to picture that that's your mind
that's your imagination that's what the social matrix has done
to you epistemically and metaphysically to your epistemic and metaphysical
imagination that's what it's done to you and now start
to wonder what it's going to take to undo that
because that's been happening since your birth and although your
mind and brain are more flexible than a foot they're
not that much more flexible ideas and beliefs and worldviews
and paradigms that get programmed into your mind especially from
the age of 1 to 10 those are really really
difficult to change they get cemented into your mind it
can be changed but just appreciate the challenge here now
don't get me wrong i am not saying that everything
in the social matrix is and everything is wrong i'm
not trying to cast doubt on literally every fact i'm
not trying to make you paranoid in the sense that
you can't even go to google now and or read
a wikipedia page and trust anything there that itself would
be a delusion if you adopted that kind of attitude
that's not the point here so be careful nuance is
required this is not some sort of simplistic conspiracy theory
that i'm presenting to you again what i'm describing is
the force of survival especially at the intellectual and conceptual
level you see survival is not just a physical activity
physical survival for humans is mediated by something much more
important which is conceptual survival so this whole social matrix
more than just being a bunch of physical institutions like
physical buildings at a university or you know military bases
around the world or corporate headquarters around the world more
than those the social matrix is software more so than
it is hardware it's the ideas it's the ideologies it's
the dogmas it's the paradigms the assumptions that are held
within the minds of all individuals on the whole planet
the software is running the hardware but also the hardware
is running the software it's a two-way street but actually
the software is more fundamental than the hardware which is
why humans are so defensive about their software are so
defensive about their belief systems their paradigms their ideologies and
you see this you see if if you just want
evidence that what i'm telling you is true you might
wonder like well leo how do i know i can
trust you because after all you say don't trust the
social matrix but you're part of the social matrix so
how can i trust you well this is where you
have to do a little bit of self-investigating self-validating the
way you discover that what i'm telling you is true
is simply by first of all looking around you very
objectively and just noticing all these things but secondly it's
your interactions with people when you go to people and
you start to question their attachment and belief in the
social matrix watch their reaction watch how they react the
way they're going to react is exactly as i am
telling you because this is a survival game they are
going to react in a defensive manner to protect their
selfish agenda and you will see this across all industries
all segments of society you will see this on wall
street you will see this in government you will see
this in every political party you will see this in
every non-profit organization you will see this in any corporation
you will see this from every ceo you will see
this in the military you will see this in the
university system you will see this amongst scientists historians philosophers
academics teachers doctors lawyers everybody your therapist your friends your
co-workers your family everybody even the random strangers you meet
at a club or a bar everybody your boss your
religious guru or preacher or teacher rabbi or priest you'll
even see it in the self-help field which is supposedly
supposed to help you with this stuff you'll even see
it in spiritual circles you'll even see it in non-dual
teachings and teachers so so the way you test this
and validate it is that you push you push against
the social matrix that's try at school try pushing a
little bit against the social matrix at your university with
your research colleagues you know in the science department at
the physics department you know push a little bit on
the social matrix and and you'll feel it push back
and you'll also notice the the indifference that all these
folks who are engaged in this social media that all
the indifference that they have towards what's really going on
you try to explain this to them and they're not
going to see the big picture and they're not even
going to care and that's how you really know that
something is deeply wrong here because they're not even going
to care they're not even going to take these questions
and this issue seriously they're not going to give it
the time of day you see they're not going to
think about epistemology or metaphysics they're not going to care
they're going to have excuses they're going to tell you
they're busy or they got work to do or they
got articles to publish they got kids to feed or
they got this to do or that to do or
money to make or something else they got a project
do they have a deadline they have this and that
nobody is willing to stop and actually look at the
epistemology and the metaphysics of the thing or this is
a favorite one that they'll use is they'll say ah
that's not my problem that's that's outside the scope of
what i do you know i'm just a humble physicist
i'm just a humble doctor i just i'm just a
therapist i can't be concerned about these big questions so
test go test go test don't believe me if you
believe me in the same way that you've been believing
everybody else in this matrix then then yeah you're going
to keep being stuck in that matrix escaping the matrix
can't happen at the level of the matrix escaping the
matrix is not about believing more stuff the way you
have been escaping the metro matrix is a meta function
go see my episode called what it means to go
meta it's a meta function it's a structural thing not
a content thing go see my episode called content versus
structure this is a structural matter you got to see
the structure it's a holistic matter go see my episodes
about holism and holistic thinking you got to see holistically
you got to connect dots here the whole reason you
got mired in this matrix in the first place is
really one thing you haven't been thinking independently for yourself
almost at all in your life have you you've been
letting others think for you you've been going along with
the herd and the reason you have is because actually
thinking true thinking original thinking is difficult work and you're
mentally lazy and you have been your entire life you
don't actually want to do the serious contemplative work of
examining and inquiring into the nature of reality in life
and what's really going on in society and science and
religion and spirituality and philosophy and medicine and nutrition and
how to live a good life you don't actually want
to do the the leg work because that involves serious
labor mental labor you got to burn calories doing that
you got to rack your mind doing that see you
just rather have the answers given to you and as
long as you take that attitude you will you will
forever be stuck in the social matrix the only way
to recognize and to break free of the matrix is
to start to think very deeply independently methodically without any
biases very truthfully very self-honestly about what's really going on
and you have to think from scratch thinking from scratch
means you don't take anything for granted that means you
don't take for granted that you're made out of atoms
you don't take for granted that you were born to
parents you don't take for granted that science is true
you don't take for granted that you're a man or
a woman you don't even take for granted that you'll
die one day because all of that came from the
social matrix and you can't really know any of it
for sure this is what i'm describing here this is
the beginnings of true skepticism not the kind of skepticism
that you see others doing where they cherry pick little
things and they skepticize about that thing or that thing
that they don't like this this form of skepticism the
way you know you're doing real skepticism is when it
when it pains you to do it because as you're
doing it all of your favorite illusions are crumbling because
you see the way the social matrix got created is
through a set of incentives and disincentives that are tied
deeply to your we might say psychological or biological needs
however you want to say it as an ego your
ego needs safety security shelter food love approval friendship even
things like relaxation and enjoyment your ego needs these things
so these are the hooks that the social matrix uses
to take over your entire mind it's done through peer
pressure which begins in kindergarten and preschool already the peer
pressure begins there and then continues throughout your entire schooling
and university days you're constantly being peer pressured to conform
to the system it happens through brute force memorization indoctrination
throughout your entire schooling system and vocational training system a
blind acceptance of what adults say you've been blindly accepting
what adults say for the majority of your life it
happens through explanations and stories and myths that your parents
and teachers give you as your a little kid trying
to ask questions about the nature of reality they give
you stories and explanations and myths that are all inadequate
and you foolishly accept their their silly explanations for what's
really going on it happens through the linguistic categories that
are baked into the very language that you use and
then of course all of this ultimately ties to the
the the linchpin the linchpin of all this is your
need for love and approval this is how they get
you this is how they get your mind the reason
it's possible to brainwash any mind is because every mind
needs love and approval to survive and to be healthy
and so when you're when a mind grows up in
a dysfunctional environment that mind will absorb the dysfunctional environment
and those values because if it doesn't it's not going
to receive the love and approval that it needs to
survive so it basically is forced into this bind this
existential bind of like for example if you grow up
with racist parents they're gonna in a sense force you
to adopt their racism because if you don't they won't
approve of you and they won't love you and because
of this you too will become a racist you see
how it works and then that's going to get exacerbated
by the books media internet entertainment and art that you
select to enjoy and to imbibe all of that will
reinforce all of your biases that you got from your
parents and your education system and furthermore you're going to
have a sense of family obligation and loyalty your family
will make you feel bad and guilty for not being
loyal to them and so will your friends and by
the way so will your co-workers for that matter and
your colleagues like for example if you go into into
the sciences and you become some scientist with a phd
and then eventually you know you start to question the
entire science system you sort of deconstruct all of science
eventually your colleagues will start to feel like you have
betrayed them that you've stabbed them in the back so
there's going to be social obligations and loyalties placed upon
you no matter where you are and people will explain
expect you to play by the game of the social
matrix and not to question it because the social matrix
is ensuring the survival of the entire human species you
see and so while it might seem frivolous or kind
of silly here or there um actually this is a
this is a a matter of life and death and
by the way it doesn't matter what country you were
raised in it doesn't matter where you're whether you're in
a first world developed democracy or you're in a third
world uh you know hell hole somewhere um the social
matrix is there it's a different social matrix and today
we're having a more globalized social matrix we have sort
of a meta-social matrix which is incorporating all the smaller
more localized parochial social social matrices that are found in
nations all across the world and we have sort of
now this new you know western overarching internet culture which
is connecting everything together it's all the social matrix some
of them are more healthy than others some of them
are more developed i'm not saying every culture is the
same some are more developed um some are more functional
some are are more dysfunctional nor don't don't make this
mistake nor is it possible to completely live outside the
social matrix so even though i'm sort of presenting this
possibility here of breaking free of the social matrix you
might start to wonder well leo how do i do
that first of all and second of all what would
that look like to be totally free of the social
matrix well that's the that's the trick is that you
can't be totally free of it because you're part of
a society a human being is not an individual a
human being is part of a super organism in the
same way that the cells in your body can't live
by themselves you can't rip out one of your cells
and have it live very long by itself the cell
requires the whole body it requires the blood the heart
the brain and also sorts of stuff to make it
work likewise an ant an ant can't survive all on
his own i can't can't just say you know this
ant colony i'm just going to go it all by
myself in the woods the ant will die very quickly
likewise with humans so transcending the social matrix is a
is a tricky proposition because at the same time you're
transcending it but also you're in it you're always in
it you're like a fish in water and you can't
live outside the water you can jump outside you can
see what's outside there but you gotta you gotta come
back and you still gotta swim in the water and
so you might say well well leo you're such a
hypocrite because you're talking about overcoming the social matrix and
yet here you are on youtube you've been criticizing you
here you are on youtube and your videos have advertisements
on them and you sell a life purpose course and
you charge for money and you're a capitalist and blah
blah blah blah blah look how big of a hypocrite
you are um but what i'm saying here is much
more nuanced and sophisticated than just something like that you're
gonna have to keep playing the game of survival you
can't avoid being social you got to get your food
from somewhere you can't make all your own food you
can't hunt all your own you know animals you can't
make all your own technology you can't like so it's
it's tricky because unlike certain things in life where you
can just quit cold turkey you can't quit society called
turkey you might say well i can go live in
a cave yeah maybe but you can't really even live
in that cave all on your own where are you
gonna get your food your water it's gonna have to
come from society and if you have some illness you're
gonna have to get some medication from society even the
the transportation you take to get to your cave will
have to be a plane a train a car a
bicycle it came from society so this myth that you
can be this a rugged individual all independent and self-made
it just it it just it's a fantasy it's a
childish fantasy so that doesn't work uh and besides which
i'm not it might also sound to you here like
i'm making a case for like society being evil and
bad and that we need to destroy society you know
somebody might listen to this and say okay leo well
then this is this is a great justification for like
starting to bomb stuff like the like the oklahoma city
bomber or something you know like anarchy is the way
we got to destroy the government man and like no
no that's complete delusion that's not what i'm saying i'm
not justifying any of that generally speaking and this might
sound now paradoxical it's uh i think mainstream society is
the way forward there is no way forward other than
through mainstream society so the way the way we solve
this problem is not by avoiding it by by going
deeply through it you go so deeply through it you
come out the other end so you can you can
start to question the social matrix and you can start
to untangle your mind from it that's really what i'm
talking about um i'm not advocating any kind of political
action here or anything like that i'm talking about internally
starting to think for yourself really what we're talking about
here is independence of thought start to contemplate reality for
yourself stop taking on these assumptions and this knowledge for
granted start to validate things for yourself start to figure
out what's actually true rather than just believing random people
or authority figures become sovereign in your sense-making that's what
i'm talking about here as you do that that will
free you somewhat from the shackles of the social matrix
at least it will free your mind it doesn't mean
it will free your body and your entire life you're
still probably gonna have to go to work you might
still have a boss you might still have friends and
family that's that's fine i'm not telling you to leave
your family um you can still participate in social activities
i'm not also telling you to be a recluse here
where i'm saying don't socialize don't go to a bar
don't go to a club don't have sex i'm not
saying that i'm saying free the software of your mind
first and then watch how that changes your life your
life will start to change in gradual subtle ways some
of them will be minor some of them will be
significant don't worry so much about that worry more just
about freeing your mind first learn to think straight learn
to see clearly and then whatever the consequences of clear
vision are just embrace those you're not going to be
able to predict what the consequences are of clear vision
there needs to be a sort of just a faith
a blind faith in in truth in the uh in
the value of truth just in the value of clear
perception if we think of this entire social matrix as
a as a cloud of smog clearing your vision i
mean obscuring your vision then what i'm advocating is clearing
that smog and then seeing what's there without the smug
and then act accordingly try to live your life in
such a way that you don't contribute to the smog
now you can't live your life perfectly where you never
contribute to the smog you're gonna contribute to it here
or there it's uh it's not about perfection it's a
matter of improvement just do the best you can so
that you're not um in the pool so to speak
this is difficult to do not very many people break
free of the social matrix or even ever realize what
it is it's difficult to do because it's threatening it's
scary and goes against all the incentives and disincentives that
are there from a purely sort of a survival physiological
survival perspective the incentives for playing along with the social
matrix are money approval friends love status fame and various
kinds of rewards or rather awards sex luxury fun entertainment
power control over others and a sense of purpose and
meaning this is what the real payoff is from playing
this game this is how the game hooks you and
you might wonder well leo that sounds great what's wrong
with that what if i just play the game like
everybody else you could do that that's what most people
do 99 of people do that that's exactly what the
system was designed for but maybe you want something more
out of life than those things maybe you can intuit
that there's something more to be had from life maybe
there is a higher purpose maybe there is a higher
meaning a transcendental meaning maybe there is truth with the
capital t maybe there's love with a capital l maybe
there's consciousness with the capital c maybe there's genuine happiness
with a capital h which cannot be found within the
social matrix because after all if happiness if genuine happiness
in any way depends upon access to genuine truth then
you're never going to find in the social matrix because
the social matrix is not true it's a self-constructed survival
mechanism it's a house of cards it's a self-deception so
you have to wonder what are the costs of self-deception
do you think self-deception has no costs if you think
that you're a fool and you should join your fellow
fools in this game you'll be happy but if you're
too wise and too intelligent to think that if you
could intuit that self-deception must have a cost falsehood must
have a cost you might figure maybe you don't want
to pay that cost maybe that cost is too great
maybe you don't want to live a false life maybe
the false life is fool's gold maybe it seems like
it's going to work it seems like it's going to
pay you off with money and approval and status and
fame and sex and luxury but maybe these things aren't
all they seem maybe none of them will satisfy you
maybe the only thing that will really satisfy you is
the truth the real truth maybe that's what's missing amongst
your family and friends and co-workers who are living their
life like zombies maybe there are hidden costs to living
life unconsciously maybe also humanity needs to evolve and wise
up collectively and clear up this collective delusion otherwise we're
going to crash and burn as a species and maybe
you don't want to participate in that foolishness maybe you
want to be part of the next wave the next
generation the next evolutionary developmental step of mankind which recognizes
all of these internal contradictions and deceptions and takes responsibility
for them and starts the process of cleaning it up
collectively and individually it has to start at the individual
level but then once you clean yourself up a bit
you can start to work on the collective level and
hey maybe that's maybe that's what mankind has been doing
for the last couple thousand years it's just a slow
very drawn out gradual process after all we've come a
pretty long way from the dark ages we no longer
use leeches we we don't burn wishes at the stake
anymore we don't stone homosexuals anymore we don't have slavery
anymore we don't have child labor anymore we don't have
uh 80 hour work weeks anymore we've removed many superstitions
we used to have we're not as violent as we
used to be so we've made progress and what did
that progress entail maybe that progress entailed cleaning up this
social matrix evolving the social matrix into something better and
maybe it's not about destroying the social matrix but improving
it maybe what human civilization evolution is about is about
birthing a collective hive mind which is truthful selfless conscious
and loving and that then this collective hive mind is
what guides all the individual minds who are born into
it up to its level rather than dragging them down
lifting them up and then who knows what this collective
hive mind could turn into in a thousand years and
five thousand years what it could become with technology and
with virtual reality and with brain implants and neural links
and whatever else is going to happen dna and gene
splicing and crazy stuff is going to happen who knows
where that ultimately evolves to and leads to it certainly
seems like society is not just a mistake it's not
just an aberration it's not just a cancer on this
planet even though it might seem that way sometimes maybe
you can intuit that society is like the next stage
of what evolution is doing sort of like evolution evolved
first to like live in the ocean as little single
cell organisms then there was a quantum leap in evolution
from single cell to multi-cell organisms that was a radical
change and then from multi-cell organisms to like actual animals
like a fish that was a huge quantum leap for
evolution into something a higher order and then even those
fish those individual fish they evolved into something like schools
of fish working together that was like a leap as
well a social domain was evolved and then and then
beyond that you know we got mammals and stuff and
then beyond that we got humans and that was sort
of a quantum leap above the animals and maybe there's
a quantum leap that comes after humans and maybe humans
are actually conscious participants in that next quantum leap and
maybe you are going to be one of the major
early players in that quantum leap just being able to
see it with your mind already is part of that
leap because most humans are such zombies they're so brainwashed
that they can't even see anything beyond themselves or their
petty little life they don't see something bigger going on
here so this is all part of this endeavor and
project that i call jail breaking the mind i've spoken
about it in the past deconstructing the mind this is
part of that you can't jailbreak your mind without really
deconstructing this social matrix the social aspect because most people
just don't appreciate how much their individual mind has been
influenced by the collective mind and you might wonder what
do i get out of it in the end what
does it all lead to and the thing is i
could tell you but i don't want to tell you
because the truth is that if i told you you
just believe me and that would just be more the
same so see it's not enough for me to tell
you what you'll get out of it you have to
want to discover that you see if you're living in
old europe old world europe back in the 1500s and
somebody like columbus comes to you and says hey let's
you know i'm going to to the america i'm going
to the west to the americas there i mean you
can call them americas but uh let's say the americas
uh come with me and you would say well what's
there you know tell me what's in it is there
going to be gold is there going to be diamonds
what am i going to get out of it and
and the truth is i mean he could he could
tell you some stories some pretty story about gold and
diamonds and things but you can't really believe him the
truth of the matter is is that you don't know
you don't know what's gonna what you're gonna get out
of it maybe you're gonna drown at sea maybe a
giant octopus kraken will will devour your whole ship you
don't know that's a very important aspect of this work
is not knowing and discovery and exploration and the willingness
to go out there and to explore consciousness and this
whole attitude of some authority figure like me telling you
why you should do something because you're going to get
x y z and to clearly articulate it for you
and to feed you a little uh you know story
that that that that plays right into your ego like
you're going to get sex and money and food out
of it or something um that's already antithetical to the
kind of attitude you need to really figure out what
reality is because the whole endeavor of figuring out what
reality is is to stop expecting others to give you
the answer see that's what got you so locked into
this matrix in the first place is you just kept
asking people the answer they kept giving you answers and
you just kept accepting their answers and then 20 years
later your mind is completely full of all these silly
answers that you haven't validated and now it prevents you
from exploring the rest of reality and now you're stuck
so something different is needed to transcend uh and one
of these things is a stop expecting easy answers and
rather than that follow some certain principles and intuitions right
your intuition is actually a very powerful tool you can
have an intuition about for example the value of truth
the value of exploration and discovery for yourself the value
of independent thinking the value of questioning deeply profoundly you
can have intuitions about these things i mean honestly i
don't know why most people don't it's baffling to me
like when i was when i was young when i
was 10 15 years old i just naturally nobody needed
to convince me of the value of truth of the
value of of um of understanding a thing of contemplating
a thing for myself independently it was just obvious to
me that these things had inherent value in them and
that they would lead to something important in that if
i didn't do that something would be lost and problems
would arise the value of epistemology the value of metaphysics
you should intuit the value of these things and if
you don't it's kind of hard to help you honestly
because it all starts there the value of open of
radical open-mindedness you should intuit that too the value of
wisdom the value of living your life by certain principles
the value of integrity the value of clarity the value
of of living your life beyond merely survival can you
intuit some of those you're not going to know what
exactly that's going to lead to per se like one
of the lessons and principles of life that i've discovered
is that you really to live a good life you
have to plan a bit less of it and to
expect less of you know what's going to come to
you and just operate based on certain principles and intuitions
that are very fundamental and then let life unfold from
there and just trust in those principles and intuitions and
don't try to micromanage your life too much in terms
of like oh well but will i earn money or
will this happen or will that happen i want to
be exactly in this place in 20 years like no
life is far too rich and mysterious and uh counterintuitive
to be able to plan your life out 20 years
from now in this kind of simplistic way it's much
better to improvise you gotta part of learning to to
live a good life is learning to improvise but the
way you improvise is not just by being chaotic and
just doing random dumb things throughout your life every day
it's sticking to principles you stick to principles and i've
shared many of those principles with you throughout my my
videos and and those principles are what constitutes wisdom so
that's the social matrix i hope it helps you to
see to explain how a profound self-deception is possible within
you because how would you even know you're self-deceived to
know that you would need to have some sort of
foil against which to see yourself you need a mirror
to reflect it back at you otherwise you couldn't see
it but what happens if there are no mirrors what
happens if part of the self-deception is to break all
the mirrors so that you couldn't see yourself that would
be the deception within deception and that's exactly the function
of the social matrix is to hide all the mirrors
because if every one of your peers and friends and
relatives and colleagues and celebrities and authority figures and teachers
and gurus everybody you look up to everybody who loves
you and who you love if all of them are
doing exactly the same thing as you're doing and participate
participating in the same self-deception mechanisms collectively then how would
we ever know that we're doing that that's perhaps one
of the biggest doubts you should have about the entire
enterprise of human civilization is that you see human civilization
is in a very dangerous position epistemically and what i
mean by that is that we are one species we
don't know any other intelligent species that we can communicate
with that is more advanced than us that could teach
us lessons about how to structure our civilization and about
the direction our civilization is going in and about our
understanding of reality right we can't go to a lion
and ask the lion to help us figure out if
our model of reality is correct like you can't ask
the the lion am i made out of atoms or
am i fooling myself do i have a brain or
am i fooling myself was i born to humans or
am i full am i even a human or am
i fooling myself right you can't ask that of a
lion um so by virtue of the fact that we're
just one civilization at this point as far as we
know that's a very dangerous epistemic position because you see
we can ourselves to almost endless degrees collectively as a
species and there would be nobody to tell us that
we're wrong the only people who could tell are the
only the only beings who could tell us that we're
wrong is ourselves a lion is never going to tell
you that you're deluded only you only us humans can
tell ourselves that we're deluded that we're deluding ourselves but
that assumes that we actually care about the truth if
we don't care about the truth collectively then we will
keep deluding ourselves forever until we start to care and
if it's inconvenient for us if it's uncomfortable for us
to admit that we're deluding ourselves that we have been
for thousands of years then we're just going to keep
doubling down on that problem see that's one of the
deep epistemic quandaries of existence is that in a certain
sense because existence is one reality is one consciousness is
one it has no other authority it can turn to
to ask it if it is deluding itself and in
this way the sovereignty of consciousness and reality ends up
being self-constructed and it gets itself trapped in its own
imaginings and fantasies that's precisely that's not a mistake that's
actually a deep feature of of oneness oneness is sovereign
by definition because there's nothing constraining it and nothing else
defining it so if you as oneness turn to where
where are you going to turn to to get a
definition of who you are and what's right and what's
wrong see there's nobody to turn to but yourself the
only one who can tell you what's right and what's
wrong what's true and what's false what's meaningful and what's
not is you but the question is are you gonna
carefully contemplate through that to get to the bottom of
the truth of it or are you just going to
sort of accept some sort of superficial answer or are
you going to construct some imaginary other an imaginary authority
figure out there who you will defer that sovereignty too
so it's like you say oh leo i'm not smart
enough you know i want to be humble i'm not
smart enough to really know what reality is i can't
really figure it out you know the physicists know more
than me the scientists know more than me i'll just
defer to them but when you're deferring to them what
that implies underneath that there's a deeper implication which is
that if you're deferring to somebody else that means you
already know you can trust that person but what you
should recognize that you can't trust that person because you
don't know if you can trust that person because if
you knew that you could trust that person you would
already know what's true and what's real what's deception what's
not but that's begging the question because you don't know
that you start life with total ignorance you don't know
who you can trust that's the whole problem if you
knew who could be trusted and who couldn't there'd be
no problem but the only way you could know who
you could trust is if you already knew everything about
the universe because the only way you can validate whether
you can trust somebody is against your knowledge of the
entire universe like if some preacher tells me god exists
i can either believe him or not how am i
deciding whether to believe this this preacher well based on
my own intuitions about what i think is true if
i happen to lean in the direction of thinking that
god exists then i'll tend to believe the preacher because
what he's saying matches up with my intuitions if i
lean the other direction i think that god doesn't exist
and he tells me that god does then i will
judge the preacher as being wrong right but this assumes
that i already know whether god exists or doesn't exist
which of course i don't to begin with so because
i don't know that i don't know whether what he's
telling me is correct or not and that is the
fundamental problem of epistemology is that you don't know and
you don't even know what is the right way to
know and what is the wrong way to know because
how would you know that and you can't even ask
somebody what's the right way to know and what's wrong
way to know because how would you know that what
they told you is correct and so here we are
now in practice what people do instead of going through
all of this complicated philosophical contemplation is they just they
just take everything for granted and they just they just
buy whatever first idea is lodged into their mind by
their culture which means they don't think deeply about anything
and all i'm telling you here is just to start
thinking deeply about stuff for yourself question question question but
when you question make sure you question in an unbiased
way because the biggest danger here is that you're going
to start to question stuff but you're going to do
it in a cherry-picked way where you're going to question
in a way that just validates all of your pre-existing
prejudices and biases that if you're going to do that
don't even begin questioning because you're going to just drive
yourself deeper into your delusions you're going to make yourself
more convinced of your own deceptions by doing that so
the questioning how you do the questioning is is crucial
it has to be done selflessly if you question selfishly
you're gonna drive yourself deeper into delusion so one of
the deep connections you should start to see is that
between truth and selflessness why might these things be connected
somehow well what you'll discover if you are real serious
about pursuing the truth is that the biggest obstacle to
getting the truth is selfishness because as soon as you're
selfish now you have attachments to things and you have
biases and you have preferences you have things you like
and things you don't like things you want to know
and things you don't want to know well if there's
things you don't want to know and it turns out
some of those are true how will you ever come
to know them because you have a preference not to
it pains you too much see so if you're too
attached to being comfortable if you're too attached to being
selfish you're never going to be able to recognize the
truth and so to get to truth you have to
be very ruthless with yourself about all of your own
personal sticking points attachments biases twisted ways of thinking preferences
fears pet attachments intellectual inclinations all of those are going
to skew and distort your perception of reality so the
real obstacle here is not other people it's not some
elites out there somewhere it is you it is yourself
you are your own greatest enemy in this game of
self-deception and the reason that i don't take other conspiracy
theories very seriously as uh some have criticized me you
know some people are like leo why don't you take
some of these conspiracy theories more seriously i thought you
were open-minded leo i thought you were interested in questioning
stuff and then you come out with some of these
positions and episodes of yours like you did with your
conspiracy theory episode where you sort of dismissed all these
conspiracy theories flippantly very flippantly and you weren't willing to
entertain them very seriously and this this just makes me
doubt everything that you're doing here epistemically well well now
maybe you can understand where i'm coming from the reason
i don't take all of the conspiracy theories that are
popular in pop culture too seriously is because they're all
part of the social matrix number one and number two
is because there's only one conspiracy theory that that matters
and that i care about which is the social matrix
see i'm not interested in the little stupid peanuts conspiracy
theories i'm interested in the mother of all conspiracy theories
i'm interested in the conspiracy of selfishness which has soaked
through our entire civilization from its very inception that's what
i'm interested in that's the only conspiracy theory i care
about the conspiracy of egotism and human selfishness and bias
that distorts mankind's perception of reality that's the only thing
that matters the only kind of deception i care about
is self-deception everything else is a distraction everything else is
a deception within the deception that is just reinforcing the
singular self-deception which is the heart of your worldview that's
what really matters if you can unravel that gordian knot
then everything else will become clear and also in a
certain sense irrelevant so in this process you have to
be very very careful about distractions because very quickly as
you start to question society and reality there's going to
be so many different avenues and threads that your mind
can go down it's going to be like a branching
tree with infinite possibilities and so the problem is going
to be you have finite time finite energy finite contemplative
capacities you can only think for so long every day
and you have only so many days to think in
your life so you are going to have to develop
some sort of heuristics or intuitions about how to focus
your mind on the things that really matter there's a
lot of things going on within the social matrix that
don't matter that will seduce your mind and cause you
to waste years and years pursuing that little triviality while
losing sight of the big picture so for me one
of my principles in life is get the big picture
get the big picture nothing matters more than getting the
big picture if you get the big picture right but
some of the little stuff wrong you'll be okay but
if you miss the big picture it doesn't matter how
many of the little things you get right you will
always be deluded for me this was a deep intuition
from an early age that this was true and that
this informed then my strategy and my approach and my
priority in figuring out reality so i looked upon all
the different things i could study in the world and
i quickly realized that the most important thing for me
to study and get right is the epistemology because if
i don't get the epistemology right i can't get anything
else right if my epistemology is an error if the
method i use for knowing anything has any distortion in
it any corruption in it that means everything i know
will be corrupted i figured that out when i was
like 15 years old so for me that's just obvious
i don't know i hope it's obvious for you and
then of course if it's obvious for you you got
to act on that what are you doing about that
don't just realize that and go back to playing video
games what are you doing about it to realize that
is to see how significant and important it is to
actually do something about it and to get this right
and so then that's what i spent a lot of
my time doing i started reading books and studying philosophy
and contemplating stuff on my own and figuring stuff out
and then that's the path i recommend for you the
point of these teachings is not for you to blindly
believe me the point of these teachings is just to
demonstrate to you the possibilities that then you go and
pursue for yourself you gotta validate the things that i
say because you don't know it's true don't just assume
that what i'm saying is true i could be wrong
i could be self-deceived for all you know i could
be biased what's beautiful about the mind if you use
it properly and most people don't but if you you
use it properly there is the possibility of the mind
clarifying itself this is a beautiful property of the mind
if your mind is open if you genuinely care about
the truth if you really care about clarity if you
really want to get to the bottom of what's going
on and you're serious about it you have that intention
if the intention is there and it's genuine and you're
willing to work for it and you're not just lazy
there is a real possibility of using your mind to
clarify your mind this is a sort of a bootstrapping
process of the mind the mind can bootstrap itself this
is a beautiful and amazing thing that this is even
possible because you might wonder how can the mind discover
what's true at all how come the mind is just
not just lost amongst all these different possibilities and ideas
and beliefs how is it possible that one can get
to the truth well the answer is actually it's so
simple it's too simple really it's too simple to believe
the answer is that you all you really need to
go to the truth is just the intent to do
so the desire you need the desire you need to
desire it more than anything else and if you have
that then that desire will guide you you see that
desire will will force you to be brutally honest with
yourself and that really is the only obstacle to truth
it's just a a lack of self-honesty and a lack
of uh willingness to question all of your own assumptions
and um prejudices and biases because it's painful and uncomfortable
to question them because as soon as you start doing
that you'll realize how selfish you are you're a selfish
that's what you'll quickly realize and that's exactly the thing
you don't want to realize it's how selfish and biased
you are and so one of the biggest obstacles to
doing this work is just the fact that as you
start doing it you start to realize that you're a
monster how monstrous your mind is how utterly disgusting you
are how ugly your mind is how how much it's
filled with the lies you tell yourself your own fantasies
and illusions right so it's really just a willingness to
cut through all that and and why would you want
to do that because you want to get to the
to the truth because you actually want to know what's
true don't you want to know wouldn't you want to
know or do you want to do you want to
live for the rest of your life um be clouded
in in in in in your own drowning in your
own see and then if you think that there's no
cost to living a life where you're bullshitting yourself all
the time well that's that's the mother of all right
there you better believe there's a cost all right that's
it we're done here please click that like button for

many unique books that you won't hear about elsewhere sort
of niche stuff not mainstream stuff which will help you
on this journey that book list is really mandatory if
you're gonna try to escape the social matrix uh my
life purpose course can also help you out to clarify
your mind and your values and your get a sense
of direction your life's a little bit more practical than
the things i've been talking about here less metaphysical in
its nature what else can you find you can find
my blog where i share resources and videos frequently every
week make sure you check that out you can support
me at patreon.com actualized thank you for any donations there
you can find my clips channel called actualizedclips with short
little snippets that you can share with your friends and
family rather than these giant monsters and uh now you
might be wondering but leo you didn't tell me you
didn't tell me how to escape the social matrix what
are the steps i should do well in a sense
that's sort of what my whole channel is about um
everything i talk about ultimately revolves around this uh i
wanted to sort of do a big picture thing here
with this episode i didn't want to get caught up
in the nitty-gritty details of techniques to use and stuff
like that but um i mean i have many episodes
which talk about the techniques that are necessary for this
so go check out my episode called um developing introspection
that's huge for this purpose go check out my episode
called contemplation and how to contemplate and how to contemplate
using a journal so the contemplation technique is huge for
this of course meditation mindfulness practices are huge for this
uh what else have we got psychedelics of course will
quickly bust you out of the social matrix at least
for a while um and many many of the other
techniques that i've shared and just in general really using
your mind properly i really need to do an episode
where i just teach you how to think there's especially
this problem within spiritual circles where thinking is demonized uh
because it's like oh it's all about shutting down the
mind and reaching nirvana by shutting off the mind i
mean that that can be good that's how that has
its usefulness but man people just don't know how to
use their minds very well and i even see this
amongst so-called enlightened and awake people and spiritual people is
that they still just because you're awake does not mean
that you know how to use your mind well learning
how to use your mind is a is really a
an art and a skill set that needs to be
trained up and it's not trained in school because in
school they teach you how to memorize stuff they don't
train you how to use your mind properly and the
key to using your mind properly is you got to
be able to see how your own mind is deceiving
you while you're using it that's the whole devil of
the mind is that it's a it's not like a
hammer or a screwdriver which is like a simple thing
that doesn't deceive you when you're using it it's it's
a very self-deceptive sort of thing so i'll have an
episode in the future about how to think properly some
principles and maybe some techniques about that um but uh
i hope this episode got you to take epistemology a
little bit more seriously and has cast some some profound
doubt on your world view so if you really understood
what i was saying here the conclusion of it like
you might say well what's the practical consequence of all
this the practical consequence is that you should now have
a sort of a foundation for doubting everything you believe
and you should take that doubt very seriously and if
you do then then you're going to be motivated to
follow up on it and then to sort of get
curious like well if everything i believe could be wrong
now i want to know what's true and also i
want to kind of find out which things are wrong
and which things might may be right probably not everything
is wrong so now this this gets you going on
this journey and um of transcendence of jail breaking the
mind and then um another episode that i will point
you to of mine is called um how to find
out what's true go watch that and then take action
on these things this is not just theorizing the theory
needs to connect with action action might mean reading some
books busting out a journal and contemplating for an hour
uh talking to some people finding some teacher advanced teachers
to talk to asking some questions formulating a list of
questions going on a meditation retreat you know stuff like
that so get to work on that make sure you're
connecting every one of my advanced metaphysical episodes to something
practical something that's going to actually lead to changes in
your behavior otherwise it's going to turn into mental masturbation
and this will actually end up backfiring on you you
need to act on the things i talk about or
you're going to get very deeply paralyzed and trapped inside
your own doubt and nihilism and skepticism and it's not
gonna it's not gonna be constructive or productive so remember
that the things i talk about need to be connected
with something constructive you're doing in your life overall even
though i talk about deconstruction a lot you know deconstruct
this deconstruct that my approach to life is constructive very
very constructive the purpose of the deconstruction is to then
clear the ground so that we can do some healthy
construction on top of it some conscious construction so don't
get the idea that i'm against construction i'm against building
a beautiful society or something no no no not at
all you can build a society you can build a
business you can build a family you can build a
government these are all necessary and beautiful things if done
correctly consciously when you know what you're doing but to
really be able to construct something first you have to
be able to deconstruct it you
