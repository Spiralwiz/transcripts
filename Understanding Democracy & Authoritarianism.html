let's talk about some of the fundamentals that make a
democracy work and what democracy is and tie it in
with personal development work that we're doing with consciousness work
with spirituality and also with the current events that are
happening around me i've gotten multiple uh comments and feedbacks
over the last couple of months that i've seen in
the comments sections where people want me to talk about
kobit 19 or they want me to talk about the
black lives matter black lives matter protests and other things
that are happening in current events so that's going to
tie in with this discussion of democracy so what is
democracy how do real how do we really understand what
democracy is and how to make it work effectively where
to even begin with this topic um we're going to
be kind of going all over the place this is
going to be a freewheeling discussion i don't have anything
planned per se but the first thing we should notice
about democracy is how much it's taken for granted especially
if you grew up in a democratic country more or
less a developed country first world country where some degree
of democracy is available it's very easy to take it
for granted and to not see the challenges the inherent
challenges that democracy brings so fundamentally what is democracy about
about it's about giving ordinary people autonomy in controlling their
futures their lives and the trajectory of their society it's
where ordinary people are involved in important decisions about war
about taxation about regulation about discrimination about rights about laws
and the direction of society how to structure health care
how to structure the economy and so on and people
we just sort of assume that well democracy is just
sort of like the default state and it just works
because if you're in a country like in america then
it's sort of been here for a couple hundred years
and people just take it for granted but and then
also you know like when we look at other countries
less developed countries third world countries from america or from
europe we look at those countries like iraq or perhaps
china or perhaps other places in the middle east or
south america or something like that where there are dictatorships
and autocrats and tyrants and oligarchies and and things of
this nature we tend to look at that and we
say oh look how crude and how barbaric they are
how evil they are and if we could just bring
democracy to them the way we tried to do with
iraq but then of course we see the problems and
the limitations of of what happens when you do try
to bring democracy to the middle east to places like
iraq it doesn't work so why doesn't it work and
we also have negative stereotypes about what autocracy and tyranny
is is sort of baked into our culture like oh
well tyranny is wrong and evil then we look at
people like hitler or stalin or mao and others like
that throughout history we look at them as emperors and
tyrants and dictators and this is supposed to be like
bad stuff but have you actually ever wondered about why
autocracy is so prevalent throughout history and still is even
now in the 21st century there are still many dictators
and tyrants around the world in various countries why is
that if dictatorship and tyranny and authoritarianism is so bad
why is it so popular i mean wouldn't it be
obvious that like people in iraq would just automatically see
saddam hussein as a bad person and overthrow him wouldn't
that be the obvious thing that happens because obviously it's
bad so why do people put up with something that's
obviously bad and wrong and unjust we tend to have
very simplistic notions of democracy the first thing we need
to understand about democracy is that it's not a binary
it's not like oh well we have democracy or we
don't there are many many degrees and orders of magnitude
of democracy and there's this sort of myth that we've
developed at least within american democracy this this notion of
like well america was just founded on democratic principles it
was a democracy from the beginning now of course obviously
people say oh leo but america is a republic technically
let's not split hairs about this sort of terminology what's
important is that one of the innovations of the american
constitution was the idea that uh citizens get the right
to vote now of course there were severe limitations on
what counted as a citizen you excluded females you excluded
blacks you excluded uh native americans and and a bunch
of other stuff and you even at the very beginning
you even excluded poor white people who didn't own land
and didn't have any kind of status so really even
though america was a democracy we sort of say you
know in the history class we say that america was
started as a democracy but really how democratic was it
the degree of democracy there was pretty limited looking back
at it now to uh two and a half centuries
later we see so many people were disenfranchised didn't have
a lot of power so they're sort of like the
myth of democracy the sort of idea that oh everybody
in the country gets to decide the direction of the
country and then there's the sort of reality of it
of what who's really pulling the strings in terms of
influencing the direction of the country and the reality of
it is that it's it's a very select group of
elite people who have status power certain position usually they're
born into a certain class even though they're not might
be official classes but basically the people who are on
the show are are a pretty small segment of the
population the general population even today in the 21st century
not to mention two and a half centuries ago don't
have much of a say at all in determining the
direction of the country why is that see there are
certain inherent limitations to democracy and democracy only works effectively
when it fits a certain psyche at a certain cognitive
level of development a certain moral level of development and
a certain educational level and a certain level of consciousness
within people if we just take a group of chimpanzees
and we try to give them democracy it's not going
to stick why not because they're operating at such a
low level of cognitive and cognitive development moral development and
level of consciousness that they're not going to be able
to sustain that even if you were able to teach
them assume we can get over the language barriers and
so forth they wouldn't be able to sustain it because
there are more animals and as animals you know it's
it's it's hard to sustain democracy within a society of
animals so you see all if we go back thousands
of years into the origins of human civilization all of
these civilizations thrived on strong leadership and basically tyranny and
authoritarianism because survival was very brutal basic matters of just
having a shelter having a farm raising your children and
making sure that that's secured in that you don't get
attacked by marauders and warlords and enslaved raped and pillaged
and have all your goods and and work stolen just
to ensure that that didn't happen required severe compromise on
behalf of those farmers and workers they were basically put
into a very difficult situation where either they could act
like libertarians and try to just maintain their autonomy and
their freedom and not be subjugated by anybody they could
try to do it that way but if they did
then they would quickly be just physically overrun by warlords
and marauders because they didn't have the physical power they
didn't have the organizational structure to defend themselves you know
a couple of farmers living in a little village can't
defend themselves against some marauders coming in from out of
town who have thousands of of troops and uh elaborate
weapons and horses and carriages and and catapults and whatever
else they've got see there's there's nothing they're going to
be able to do to prevent them from getting just
overpowered physically so what they're sort of forced to do
is they're forced to find some other leader who's going
to protect them they're forced to band together so you
have multiple villages come together and then just it's a
is basically just a function of brute survival for them
to survive they have to come together and they have
to organize themselves under some leader and then that leader
has to take control and make decisive actions that are
going to ensure the survival of this group of villages
let's say and on the decisions of that leader is
going to hinge the survival of everybody in that community
all the villagers all the women all the children all
the men all the soldiers all the farmers all the
doctors and intellectuals and scholars all the uh politicians and
ultimately he himself is gonna lose his head he in
fact will be the first one to lose his head
if he makes the wrong decisions so it's a lot
of responsibility to put on one person and it it
really matters who that person is you see because if
you get some buffoon some incompetent buffoon he's not going
to make the the right decisions and then quickly everybody's
going to die now that might seem to us now
because we're looking back at it it might seem like
this is a very archaic and brutal system and it
is but you also have to appreciate the bind that
our ancestors were in back then and i mean some
of them still are some of these people still exist
on this planet in certain parts of the world africa
south america asia and elsewhere where we we have in
in developed countries we have the luxury of freedom that
was hard won that now we can kind of like
say oh well but i would never subject myself to
some authoritarian some tyrant uh i would always want to
maintain my freedom this sort of libertarian stance but this
is this is absurd because your freedom is only valuable
to you assuming that you're alive assuming you don't get
overrun by warlords and other tyrants which exist out there
in the world so as long as that's taken care
of then yeah you can you can talk about freedom
and you can [ __ ] and moan about people
infringing on your freedom of speech or some other you
know second amendment rights or whatever that you might feel
entitled to but what you have to understand is that
these freedoms they don't really exist they have to be
invented and they have to be enforced otherwise they are
lost very easily so what happened is that in many
cases these just ordinary people who you know think about
a couple thousand years ago the average farmer most people
a couple thousand years ago were farmers there was like
nothing else to do there weren't computer programmers there weren't
engineers per se there weren't scientists there weren't uh marketers
there was there was basically farmers ninety percent of people
farmers and then maybe five percent were scholars or mark
uh something let's say like um bazaar owners or shopkeepers
that sort of stuff and then maybe less than one
percent were politicians or military leaders and so on of
course there were also probably a good chunk of people
who were just troops soldiers maybe 10 of those or
something but most people were just ordinary farmers now these
farmers didn't go to school they weren't literate because education
was very very expensive so you you have to remember
that education we take it for granted now in the
21st century everybody is literate basically everybody goes to school
at least 10 years of school maybe 12 years maybe
16 years in developed countries but a couple thousand years
ago most people didn't know how to read didn't know
mathematics didn't know history had no historical context for things
had no study of philosophy or government or politics so
what did these people really know they knew nothing except
what they learned through direct experience from their family so
you were born your father and mother were farmers and
so what do you know you only know whatever your
father and your mother and your extended family whatever they
knew so if one of them was a blacksmith maybe
you could have learned some blacksmithing skills if one of
them was a you know a shopkeeper you could learn
some maybe some business skills although they were very crude
uh this sort of stuff but most people just knew
farming and that's like all you knew try to really
put yourself into that position of a farmer from a
couple thousand years ago like you were so utterly clueless
compared to the way that average people are today in
the 21st century there was no internet there were no
books if there were books they were extremely expensive and
only afforded by the most elite wealthy aristocrats who were
the equivalent of today's millionaires and billionaires so there were
no books there was no printing press there was no
school there was no university for you to go to
if if there was anything even close to that it
cost millions of dollars basically to send your your child
to a university you know you think university is expensive
today back in the greek and roman times literally you'd
have to be a millionaire to send one of your
kids off to school for private tutoring and this sort
of stuff so what did you as this basic simple-minded
poor farmer what did you know how to do what
did you know about the world what did you know
about reality almost nothing it's whatever what was programmed into
you by your culture by your religion which of course
played a huge role for you in shaping your worldview
so you you clung to your religion and you just
did your task and that was it and you didn't
know very much about world affairs you couldn't go on
facebook and see what's going on today in the world
or cnn or anything like that none of this was
available like it's we've we've advanced so much that in
a sense we're now victims of our own advancement because
we forget what it really took to get us to
where we are today and that makes us take for
granted what is allowing us to stay where we are
today and that makes us ignorant of what's coming in
the future and what it'll take us for us to
to advance to to new stages in the future some
of the sacrifices that it takes see a lot of
sacrifices were made by our ancestors that are completely taken
for granted today by us by libertarians and so forth
so these people the majority of people were so ignorant
that they weren't capable of even casting a ballot for
some politician because to cast a ballot for a politician
just to go and vote you need to be able
to read to write you need to have a sense
of of civic responsibility just the idea that every four
years or every two years that you are going to
go into some ballot box at some appointed place and
you're going to vote for some person and if this
is your civic duty to do so and that this
if you don't do so then somehow you're not um
contributing to the to the society in the right way
these things had to be invented and developed they the
technology this so it was a combination of confluence of
things there was the material physical technology that needed to
be invented such as writing books paper papyrus whatever your
ballot was cast on um and then how to tabulate
all these votes see even just the very notion that
you're gonna you're gonna get all the people in town
to come into town and to vote on a specific
day at a specific time that means you need to
invent clocks calendars there needs to be a social system
a cultural invention where we all agree that this is
something we're going to do on such such a date
at such-and-such a time that this this is like our
moral civic duty to do this all these all this
infrastructure needs to be built up you see people need
to understand and make a connection in their mind of
like well me going to this ballot box and making
some some chicken scratches on this piece of papyrus and
putting it in this little box and it's going to
be all counted and tallied up and then you have
to like make the connection between that and then the
person who's going to who's gonna get elected and then
the person who's elected how do you know even who
you're voting for well you need to have some sort
of like marketing system basically a crude form of marketing
so that people know who that person is and they
know the alternative you know rival candidates the opponents then
you gotta decide who to vote for based on what
are you gonna decide which of them is the best
do you have a deep knowledge of history and government
and politics and human psychology and warfare and all of
this to understand which person is going to make for
the best leader do you understand how leadership works you
see even today most people don't understand these things these
are very complex and nuanced things to understand or to
make educated decisions so back then this was simply impossible
democracy was simply unsustainable back then back then the situation
was that hey we've got a a rival army headed
our way that's going to be here in two months
we've we've got some news that it's coming so we
better rally together and build a fortress around our villages
uh build like a wall defend this wall raise an
army and and try to defend ourselves otherwise we're all
going to get raped and pillaged and enslaved that's what
would happen in ancient times during the times of ancient
rome times of caesar it was well understood by everybody
in the city that if a city got sacked if
the perimeter wall between the inner city and the outside
of the city was ever broken through that was the
end of the entire city it wasn't like it is
today where the united states invades iraq maybe strategically bombs
a few power plants and the electrical system maybe bomb
some military installations maybe accidentally bombs and drones a few
you know civilian buildings and factories but overall like 95
percent of the infrastructure of the city is is maintained
and ordinary people can still go about going to the
market buying their food going you know doing their work
and all this sort of stuff can still be maintained
that's not how it was two thousand years ago two
thousand years ago if that city was invaded all the
men would get their throats slit by the invading army
and all the women would be raped and all the
children and women would then later be enslaved uh or
sold off as slaves and oftentimes that city it was
either captured and totally repurposed maybe for a new military
base or you know a new outpost for the invading
army or it was just completely ransacked and burned to
the ground a lot of times that happened because certain
cities just hated other cities so much that they wouldn't
even want to like live in the city they conquered
they would just raise it to the ground or it
would just be raised to the ground in the process
of invading it and those people who were defending that
city they weren't just it wasn't just like oh well
yeah some of our military troops might die in this
invasion it's like no no if this city gets invaded
everybody's going to die everyone's going to be screwed including
the women the children everybody so understand the stakes that
are involved here in this game of politics and government
the stakes are enormous and these stakes they still exist
they're just buried today under a lot of infrastructure and
bureaucracy which uh helps to sort of mask that and
it it softens the edges of the brutal nature of
of human beings because we have thousands literally thousands of
years of infrastructure and and and moral and cultural development
it it sort of it pacifies our brutal nature such
that most people aren't going around raping and killing and
pillaging and even most countries aren't really doing that these
days so you see when you're faced with such stark
survival conditions democracy is a luxury in fact it's completely
unworkable what's necessary is very strong leadership and a group
of elites basically the smartest strongest people out of your
village need to come together and they need to devise
a plan because we don't have time to educate all
the masses we don't have time to explain everything to
the masses because the masses are mostly stupid so it's
only those few elites they come together they form a
cabal which will govern all the mass the masses and
then they will elect one of theirs as the leader
the authoritarian the king and then he's going to be
the boss and on him we'll hinge our future and
our our survival see now this might seem very unfair
from a sort of libertarian perspective like how dare they
do this and then they impose taxes on all the
farmers and we don't even get a say of like
who the king is going to be and yet we
we start to pay the king taxes and give a
portion of our of our grain supply that we generate
every you know of our harvest every year um yeah
but that's still highly preferable to getting slaughtered by the
enemies that are coming out from from outside and they're
coming they're coming because it's a lot easier to come
and to conquer some poor defenseless farmers than it is
to actually do the hard work of farming for yourself
it's very appealing to go invade other villages and towns
if you can just rally enough people together build an
army it's very very appealing it's appealing on many levels
first of all it's appealing to the ego there are
many ambitious tyrannical people who you know want that sort
of power who want to be in that position of
conquering others so in that sense it's very appealing to
spiral dynamic stage red egos um but it's also appealing
because hey you know farming is very hard work who
wants to labor in the fields day after day after
day harvesting fruits and vegetables and grain this is hard
work you'd much rather prefer to invade somebody who's done
that work for you and then enslave them and have
them keep doing more of that work for you than
having having give you a portion of their harvest every
single year to support you see this is just basic
human laziness we don't want to work we want to
have somebody else work for us so democracy here is
completely unworkable which is why a large chunk of the
developed rather underdeveloped world even today is not democratic because
democracy is unworkable it's not so much that the tyrant
is this evil person who oppresses the ordinary individual and
takes away his rights it's not so much that actually
in a sense the tyrant and the authoritarian the king
is doing those farmers and an ordinary folks a favor
because he's taking on a lot of responsibility to make
sure that they stay safe now of course he can
abuse his power but also you can have good kings
and there have been examples throughout history of good kings
who had a lot of power a lot of authority
and they used it responsibly they weren't lazy they weren't
drunkards they weren't just about having orgies and you know
living in luxury and exploiting people underneath them they were
actually like working for the people there are certain roman
emperors that were like that and um and actually quite
a few kings throughout history were like that they fought
for their people they cared about their people a lot
in fact that's what you see mostly with the authoritarians
even today many authoritarians like we see authoritarians in china
um xi jinping and he you know he has certain
authoritarian tendencies in in russia we have putin with certain
authoritarian tendencies in the philippines we have duterte with certain
authoritarian tendencies but these people what are they really fighting
for sure some of them love the power of course
they do but uh i would say that most these
people aren't in it for the power per se they
are actually patriots they really care about their nation their
nation they see that amongst all the other nations in
the world their nation is not at the top um
they see how much better their nation could be they
see that their nation is getting exploited by others like
america and other european powers which are which are stronger
than them they're they're getting exploited they're getting the raw
end of the deal and so it's like their patriotic
duty to take on that responsibility to not just sit
around and wait for people to democratize themselves and to
fix this problem for them but to take the reins
and to fix it yourself have you ever found yourself
in a position or a small group of people where
there's maybe five or ten of you and then you
notice that most of the people in that group they're
meek some important decision needs to be made but but
it's like a committee thinking nobody's making any clear strong
decisions there's no sense of leadership people are just kind
of waffling around throwing around ideas debating each other bickering
with each other gossiping with each other but like nothing
is getting done in the meantime nobody is willing to
step up and take responsibility everybody's blaming somebody else but
nobody's doing anything about they're talking but they're not doing
anything about it so what you have to do is
you have to step up in that situation and you
have to say i'm going to be the leader i'm
going to take responsibility and now of course what happens
some of the people in that group will say oh
well but who said that you're going to be the
leader i don't like you as the leader blah blah
blah blah blah and then they [ __ ] and
moan and they gossip amongst themselves about how you shouldn't
be the leader well okay if i'm not the leader
then who is the leader say well maybe that person
should be the leader but then as soon as that
person is picked out somebody else in the group will
say oh but i don't like him because of this
is this and that and then they'll start to fight
with each other over that you see so part of
the the challenge of of selecting a leader that is
a certain sense the leader is going to be the
one who steps up who steps up and annoys himself
as the leader this of course takes some gall some
arrogance some ego some ambition and some confidence to be
able to to do that because we could always say
well who appointed you king and in the end you
have to say i appoint myself king and then whether
that actually works or not will depend on how strong
you are as a person if you're a weak person
you'll be dethroned very quickly usually it takes a vicious
person a highly ambitious highly vicious ruthless person to take
that position because what's going to happen is that as
soon as you stand up and say i'm going to
be king i'm going to lead us here's my vision
there's gonna be at least a few people in the
group who will challenge you and question your vision and
will not agree with your vision and will try to
stop you even though they themselves may not want to
take that position as king and as leader and maybe
they don't have a good vision but they will sit
back and they will whine and moan and [ __
] about how your vision is not going to work
so oftentimes what you have to do is you have
to just fight those people and conquer them win them
over to your side you can do it through diplomacy
you can do it with money you can do it
uh with with rhetoric with you know a motivational speech
you can convince them but when all of that fails
you can also use reason of course when all of
that fails you're going to defeat them physically which is
why authoritarians are known to be bloodthirsty and vicious oftentimes
gassing their own people killing their own associates and colleagues
and political rivals who are friends of theirs playing these
sorts of games of throne because that's what's necessary in
that kind of environment to come out on top and
then to to unify a diverse group of of people
who have their own agendas unify them together the unification
is absolutely crucial in order for us to survive i
have an episode i'm actually going to be bringing multiple
prior concepts from old episodes that i've talked about that
are important here we're going to be synthesizing a lot
in this in this conversation here about democracy um i
have an episode called uh unity versus division where i
talk about how the structure of all of realities that
things are getting divided and separated and then getting reunified
back together that this is a fractal process that is
happening at all scales and levels of reality well of
course it's happening within the formation of societies and governments
because what we start off with is our sort of
default state is a is a a loose diverse collection
of individuals and small clans and tribes and then we
unify them if we unify them we get more strength
because now we can organize all these tribes to work
in a coordinated manner to build something larger than a
tribe something more like a a state or a country
a nation but how do you you unify all these
people who have diverse cultures maybe different ethnic backgrounds different
religions different belief systems different economic ideas about how things
should be structured different ideas about the military how do
you bring all of that together under one banner and
have them act towards one common purpose such as for
example building a fortification around the perimeter to defend all
of those folks from outside invaders or how do you
get them all working towards some sort of larger public
project like building a pyramid or building a temple which
costs a lot of resources uh thousands of of man
years and man hours go into that to build something
as great as a pyramid well you can't build something
as great as a pyramid with just a couple of
tribes you need to unify giant groups of people small
groups into into much larger groups and those the groups
as even larger groups you know you got to unify
before you can start to build great monuments and really
build amazing feats of architecture and infrastructure you can't build
a lot of fancy roads and marble courtyards and fountains
and great cities unless you're able to defend all that
stuff and also you're able to tax people and you're
able to get people to buy into that vision because
you know one person might say well let's build a
pyramid guys another person in the tribe might say well
no pyramid is stupid let's build a cube instead of
a pyramid and then somebody else says no not a
cube let's build a sphere well which one are we
going to do and if we just let people bicker
back and forth and argue with each other about what
we're going to do endlessly then what we get is
we get the sort of problem that stage green actually
faces um and we're seeing a bit of that today
in the news and in our politics one of the
problems with stage green sparta dynamic stage green is that
it's sort of that hippie uh social justice warrior type
of mentality and we're seeing you know in recent news
that they they they took over some some chunk of
seattle and they created this jazz zone c-h-a-z um the
capitol hill autonomous zone and it's sort of like this
uh this hippie commune type of vibe a little little
town in the middle of the city and they sort
of cordoned it off and now they're offering you know
free this and free that's sort of this almost like
burning man kind of culture taking place there and it's
sort of since it's cool it's nice but the problem
with that it's it's a very loosely distributed hierarchy it's
a flat hierarchy there there's nobody who's the boss at
stage green and one of the problems and negative downsides
of stage green is that when you get a bunch
of green people together in a group they're so concerned
about gathering a consensus not offending anybody in the group
and being nice and cordial and accommodating to everybody in
the group that you have this committee thinking where no
clear decisions get made no strong vision comes out you
can get a you know 20 people 20 green people
into a room and have them sit there for 24
hours in that room trying to decide you know okay
what's going to be our project that we're working on
what's going to be our next business idea let's say
it's a small startup and everybody's just sitting around and
they're just throwing around you know spitballing stuff they can
be sitting there for a week spitballing stuff and still
at the end of all that there's no clear decision
made maybe you've experienced that in some of your corporate
uh experiences if you work in in corporations sometimes you're
going to do a meeting or you'll be doing meetings
all day but then these meetings happen you sit there
you spend hours discussing stuff but at the end of
the day nothing gets resolved that's because that shows you
uh that just endless deliberation and a flat hierarchy has
its limits it can be valuable to have someone who's
like a director a creative director or a manager or
the ceo who comes in there and kind of sets
the agenda and says okay we have five hours we're
gonna discuss for five hours but at the end of
this five hours we're gonna have a concrete plan for
what we're gonna be doing and here are the specific
values that we're gonna be using to to to guide
us towards what our decision is going to be that
can be very helpful because you can't just sit around
and endlessly deliberate about what to do next sometimes not
making a decision is the worst decision you can make
and that's especially true when you have some horde of
warlords and marauders coming to pillage and raise your little
town to the ground in a few months you need
very clear decisive action which is the function that the
authoritarian is playing there and that is exactly the function
that people like putin duterte ji jinping and other authoritarians
around the world are playing today it's it's it's easy
sometimes for americans american political pundits to say like oh
well putin is this evil dictator and the chinese you
know the chinese leaders also now starting to become this
dictator and so forth taking on power but you have
to consider the environment there that they're in you see
they're playing ketchup those countries are still highly underdeveloped like
russia china the philippines they need a lot of decisive
strong action bold visionary leadership in order to get them
up to parity with the united states with europe and
other parts of the world see and this is a
double-edged sword because of course when someone gets a lot
of power they have a lot of power to do
good but they also have an equal amount of power
to do evil and of course oftentimes they get corrupted
by that power and they end up doing more evil
than good one of the problems we have now in
the united states is in a sense we've become so
democratic everybody has a say now to the point where
there's no clear vision of what america is shooting towards
or working towards anymore we're very fragmented politically and ideologically
half of us want to go in this direction half
of us want to go in that direction and it's
actually worse than that because it's not just two two
forces there's there's many many different forces tugging and pulling
in different directions and there's no real strong clear leadership
and in a sense america has become so complacent now
because we've got a decent democracy but it could still
be much better but we don't have so much of
the power in america is distributed it's distributed between the
supreme court the executive branch the uh the congress the
you know the senate and the the house and then
it's distributed to the media it's distributed to business and
corporations and it's distributed to you know civil rights leaders
so like the power has gotten so distributed that everyone
believes that they should have a say as to what
is best for for the country going forward and in
a sense what's happening is that when when you have
10 different forces equally pulling in 10 different directions the
net result of that is a movement of zero you
stay in place and then you stagnate and then actually
that actually ends up being the worst thing you can
do after a certain while it's just stagnating because other
countries are moving forward they have a sense of direction
see so one of the myths we need to bust
about democracy is this idea that democracy is a unmitigated
positive thing and that more and more democracy is just
better and better and better automatically and that authoritarianism is
just bad automatically this is a simplistic fairy tale that
they taught you in school when you really start to
look at how politics works it's it's incredibly ingenious and
intelligent there's not a lot of room for fluff and
ineffectiveness in politics politics is so derided and it's called
dirty and and and all this precisely because it's so
ruthlessly effective see it has to be it has to
be extremely pragmatic and survival oriented and of course this
this ends up going full circle and kind of biting
it in the ass because when you get so pragmatic
and survival oriented that then you know you lose your
humanity in doing that so so part of the challenge
of life is that again bringing in my episodes about
understanding survival part one and part two which are very
important make sure you watch those we're always in this
very delicate balancing act where it's like we're trying to
balance a knife on on its point on on a
flat glass surface we're trying to balance because you know
if we go too much to one direction then we're
gonna we're gonna stray too far away from survival we're
gonna die as a species or as a group as
a society but if we stray too much towards the
other direction where we're just only concerned about our survival
and nothing else then we become savages and um all
sorts of evil happens and that also ends up destroying
us you see because too much selfishness will destroy you
and too much selflessness will also destroy you so reality
is all about balancing that knife on its point very
delicately and this is both collectively and individually as well
this you know brings in my episode about collective ego
there's a sort of a self-similarity between as i talked
about in that episode between the individual human life your
life personal development and so forth what's happening with you
and then what's happening collectively in your society in your
family in in your company in corporation and in your
nation and in the whole globe for humans as a
as a species there's similarities there one of the similarities
is that we're both of us individually and collectively are
trying to balance that knife delicately between being not too
selfish and not too selfless because if we go too
much in one direction the knife is going to fall
over and everything's going to collapse and then we die
see so here's sort of my general simplified story of
the rise from authoritarianism to democracy so if we go
2 000 years ago rewind the clock to ancient roman
greece what we see is that even though there was
talk of you know the athenian democracy the athenian democracy
collapsed pretty quickly and it quickly turned into actually an
authoritarian state and the reason it did is because the
democracy wasn't sustainable in athens and probably one of the
reasons it wasn't sustainable is because the people weren't selfless
enough weren't conscious enough weren't developed enough to sustain it
it was a good idea and it lasted for a
short while but then eventually um authoritarianism took over and
it took over for for hundreds and even thousands of
years through the middle ages and then beyond that so
in the last 200 years especially what we've seen in
america and in europe is we've seen a softening a
moving away from kings kingships and authoritarian states towards more
democracy and this is good in this in a sense
this this equalized a lot because for thousands of years
we had rigid cast systems the way that they still
do in india but we had it in europe as
well um we had separations between the aristocrats and the
sort of the plebs and the surfs and the slaves
and the working class versus the the elites and the
clergy and the you know the aristocracy all of this
these these boundaries they all started to get dissolved after
the french revolution and then you know continuing up to
the 21st century till today every single decade every single
century basically power has become more and more distributed taken
away from aristocrats and elites and given to ordinary people
in a sense this is a great trend because today
society is more equal and fair than it's ever been
we have the least racism that we've ever had the
least slavery in the world than that we've ever had
the least raping and pillaging that then we've ever had
in human history um since the rise of major civilizations
um the least you know animal cruelty that we've ever
had the least environmental destruction that we've ever had so
you know people say oh we're destroying the environment well
yeah we are destroying the environment of course but in
a sense people 2 000 years ago were much less
environmentally friendly than we are today they just didn't have
the enormous scale and the technology that we have today
you know and not everybody didn't have a car back
then but if they did they would all drive and
they wouldn't give a [ __ ] about what it
did to the environment this idea that ancient people care
about the environment this is this is absurd you only
start to care about the environment once you get to
spider-dynamic stage green and higher people below that at lower
stages they don't have a sort of a systemic ecological
consciousness the the only extent to which they don't destroy
their environment is simply because they don't have the power
yet they haven't become so developed that they haven't developed
the technology and the scale the sheer numbers you know
it's easy to live ecologically when you're living in a
tribe of 100 people pretty easy you can just [
__ ] in the river the river will carry your
[ __ ] downstream into the ocean no problem because
relative to the size of the planet 100 people is
nothing same thing with animals you know some people say
oh leo but how dare you say that animals are
below humans in their development animals are actually more developed
because they live so peacefully and harmoniously with nature no
they don't the only reason animals live harmoniously with nature
is simply because they haven't developed the capacity to outstrip
nature and in those areas where they have developed that
capacity you know like you have a giant locust swarm
that will just uh you know fly through some forest
or through some grassland and just eat everything in its
site and then eventually just dies of starvation because it's
eaten everything that it can there are examples of that
happening in nature as well so don't think these animals
somehow care about nature they don't they're acting completely selfishly
and unconsciously it's just that uh for them living harmoniously
with nature is sort of automatic because if they don't
they're automatically killed by nature so that sort of solves
that problem rather quickly for them and so yeah so
like for the ancient greeks it was fairly easy to
live harmoniously with nature because they they didn't have nuclear
weapons they didn't have cars they didn't have oil refineries
and all this sort of stuff and their scale was
so small that we're talking about hundreds of thousands of
people maybe a million people at most but today we're
talking about billions of people who are all driving cars
and actually this is the consequence of democracy see because
if only a king got to drive a car or
fly on a commercial jet then we'd have no environmental
problems the environmental problems are precisely a problem of scale
when you have seven billion people and we give them
a lot of democracy which means that these people get
to control their own life they are relatively well off
economically they're not slaves they're not plebs they have disposable
income that they can use to travel which means they
use airplanes they have their own vehicles many times they
have multiple vehicles they have their suvs they can buy
hummers and other you know gas guzzling cars and all
this so you got to supply them with with trillions
of barrels of oil every year and all this sorts
of stuff yeah then you have an ecological catastrophe on
your hands that's coming so what's been happening in the
last couple hundred years is that there's been a rapid
democratization for thousands of years humans were just content to
basically live under kings and aristocrats the king and these
aristocrats and maybe these aristocrats were like five or ten
percent of the population they had the majority of the
wealth and there was so little social mobility that it
was impossible for you if you were born into a
farmer family to ever become an aristocrat never basically now
today we still have a lot of inequality our democracy
is not perfect and in fact one of the lessons
i want you to take away from this discussion is
that democracy has so many degrees in a sense don't
even think of human society as either being autocratic or
elitist or aristocratic or democratic there's not these categories really
what you have is you have one single scale this
scale represents democracy in a sense and this scale also
correlates to some degree with consciousness and with development so
as we start to crank up the consciousness and the
development of human beings of human minds basically democracy becomes
more important and more necessary because the more conscious you
are the less you're willing to be subjugated by somebody
else and also the more conscious you are the less
the less willing you are to subjugate other people because
that no longer pleases you either you actually want others
to be on your level you want to help raise
up others around you to also be conscious and loving
and to have the opportunities that you have see because
also along this scale what we have is we have
democracy going this way we have consciousness going this way
and we have selflessness going this way and we have
love it's all going in this direction now they might
not be perfectly correlated you can think of these as
like separate toggles on a mixing board you're dragging them
in this direction but generally what that does is that
it sort of raises the volume of the entire soundtrack
so to speak um so if we take ancient rome
and greece it was down here if we take the
middle east it's down here and then as we move
to more developed countries over the centuries in europe and
america and elsewhere everything is moving generally in this direction
now it's not always just purely moving with no backsliding
it moves it backslides it moves it backslides it oscillates
but as it oscillates it moves upwards so we've got
this upwards oscillating curve we might say and so really
what we're talking about when we're talking about society and
government and creating a better country is we're talking about
creating a better country for everybody a more equal more
fair more softened environment in which all of us can
prosper together that's what we're really talking about but of
course what we have is we have our own nature
which interferes with us getting what we want the only
ones we have to blame for the structure of our
society and culture is ourselves you see we created it
we invented it so why is it that we created
these authoritarian structures that are unfair and unequal and distribute
resources to the top and so forth enslave people and
so forth uh because that's all that our level of
consciousness could sustain if we were more conscious if we
were more selfless if we were more loving if we
were more developed if we were more educated then we
could sustain a higher more equitable distribution of resources and
power then individual people could have more autonomy but when
our consciousness is low we're basically close to the level
of development of an animal and the way that you
govern animals is harshly with a whip because the animal
doesn't understand anything but a whip if you have a
vicious animal and so it's a mistake to blame simply
the the death spots tyrants and autocrats who are supposedly
responsible or like the elites it's popular today i hear
this the there's a lot of populism in the air
today right-wing populism left-wing populism and this is popular to
blame the elise media or the elite democrat or the
elite republicans or the elite business class or the the
silicon valley elites or the wall street elites or the
you know the jews who are running the world elites
this sort of conspiracy stuff uh or just even conspiracy
theories are so popular today it's like oh bill gates
is you know doing something behind the scenes george soros
is doing something behind the scenes the koch brothers are
doing something behind the scenes you know to manipulate all
this and it's all their fault but this is this
is really um a shirking of responsibility in fact it's
this sort of mindset where you're trying to blame these
elites for the state of our society it's actually this
mindset which is a low level of consciousness and understanding
that prevents you from taking responsibility over your contribution to
the problem because what it does is it sort of
separates you says well i'm not the problem the ordinary
citizen i'm not the problem it's the elites it's bill
gates who's the problem no no no it's not bill
gates who's the problem it's you the average person who's
a problem it's your own lack of development your own
selfishness your own fear your own susceptibility to conspiracy thinking
your own lack of systemic understanding of these complex and
subtle issues your own lack of education your own unwillingness
to actually go and read some books on politics and
government history to actually study this stuff carefully that's really
the problem of course i'm not saying the elites are
innocent they also contribute to the problem because they're part
of the system everyone's part of the same system so
it's not about blaming some one part of the system
it's about seeing sort of the the meta of what's
really going on how we're getting in our own way
so over the these last hundred years a lot of
stuff has become democratized voting at the ballot box has
become democratized now we have women who are allowed to
vote we have gay people who are allowed to vote
we have black people who are allowed to vote foreigners
who are allowed to vote people of different religions who
are allowed to vote poor people are also allowed to
vote now of course it's not all fair there is
still shenanigans and gerrymandering and and you know this sort
of stuff it's still happening there's still racism within the
voting system systemic racism and so forth yes all this
stuff is still there to a degree but it's gotten
a lot better than where it was you have to
admit but it wasn't just the voting that got more
democratized uh everything in a sense has become more democratic
the economy has become more democratized believe it or not
you might say oh but how can you say that
in the 1950s you know you could just go work
a decent job in america and earn a decent wage
you know at a normal job today you can't do
that because you have millionaires and billionaires who have sucked
up yeah that's happened to some degree but still um
considering how unequal the economy was a hundred years ago
or 200 years ago it's a lot better today than
it was back then overall today people have more opportunity
more freedom to move up the social hierarchy it's easier
to become a millionaire or a billionaire today than it
ever was in the past because in the past you
had to be part of a millionaire or billionaire family
today that's less important because technology allows you to create
something amazing and then to earn you know you can
create a billion dollar company within 10 years today it
was very hard to do that 100 or 200 years
ago and of course so the economy has become more
democratized you have more control over who you can work
for you have more control over what kind of career
you want and a lot of that has to do
with also the democratization of technology and education so technology
also has become more distributed whereas in the past the
most advanced technology was only available to the to the
wealthiest people today highly advanced technologies are actually some of
the most accessible the most advanced computers and cell phones
and so forth they're pretty cheap and they're designed for
mass market so a lot of technology has been democratized
you know everybody has access to a microwave to a
refrigerator to a telephone to a tv to the internet
and the internet has been a huge development in the
last 20 years which has led to a massive democratization
of information and knowledge whereas before it was elite scholars
in universities and in various kinds of esoteric sects that
had all the information and knowledge and it would cost
you thousands or millions of dollars to access this knowledge
and you have to have the right social class and
status to access it now it's easy online you go
you can look up any fact basically that you want
to you can you can buy any book with with
20 you can basically buy any book in the world
that you want to get it shipped to your door
for free um you could take online courses you can
go to you could take harvard classes through the internet
you don't need to apply to harvard anymore um so
it's all getting democratized and this is amazing and you
have access to news instantly you know a thousand years
ago you didn't know if there was some 911 a
thousand years ago you would even know about it as
some stupid poor farmer now today you click on facebook
and you see everything immediately so this is all great
but of course now you're trying to reconcile the everything
i'm telling you you're trying to reconcile this with sort
of the bleak picture that you're seeing now in in
the news you say well leo if all this year
that you're saying is true then how come we're facing
all these problems how come we're facing the rise of
trump how come we're facing the alt-right how come we're
facing these neocons how come we have these uh you
know kkk and all this racism and how can we
have these police shooting black people and how come we
have you know the coronavirus and we have all this
stuff and we have rising income inequality and we have
healthcare problems and you know we have um politicians cheating
in the election systems and gerrymandering and blah blah blah
blah yes of course we have all of that what
you first and foremost have to understand is how much
worse it was for your ancestors all these things that
you're bitching and moaning and complaining about today that you
think are so terrible that are the end of the
world you think these are signs of the apocalypse uh
that some black guy got shot you think this is
the the end of the world that's not the end
of the world mankind has survived such horror in the
past that makes coronavirus and these police protests and riots
and stuff and looting this makes it looks like like
kindergarten this is child's play our ancestors would look at
this with envy at how good we have it now
this is not to discount the importance of of handling
the coronavirus intelligently unlike what trump is doing and the
importance of you know wearing face masks and the importance
of not looting and the importance of not shooting innocent
black people and so so forth these are all important
causes so i'm not um i'm not simplistically discounting the
importance of you know fighting systemic racism so forth all
of that is important i'm just trying to put it
into some perspective for you some historical larger perspective the
perspective of the entire human species in our entire history
which has been very brutal and and uh and vicious
i mean human history is so brutal that it's impossible
to capture the brutality and horror of it the selfishness
of it on paper like human history is just atrocious
when you look at all the slavery the pillaging the
raping the genocide the you know the wars the world
war one and world war ii and all the wars
that came before and afterwards um the torture and the
the imprisonment and the massacres and just war crimes that
have happened public executions private executions horrible weapons of all
kinds used on the battlefield for centuries that wiped out
up to a third or even half of the european
population so you know our ancestors have been through a
lot of [ __ ] and that survival dna it's
coded into your genetics and my genetics we're here we're
we're standing on the shoulders of giants all that all
that survival history is in a sense what's making us
so egotistical and selfish today it's sort of one of
our biggest obstacles to overcome that survival karma of our
ancestors because all of that is coded in our dna
it's also coded in our culture in our infrastructure it's
got a very long tail [ __ ] that happened
thousands of years ago it's still informing our culture and
our society today never mind something like the civil war
in slavery which is only a couple hundred years old
of course all that is still with us today in
in various subconscious ways so humanity as a species is
developing and growing and becoming more conscious more loving more
selfless we've got a long way to go we're still
in a sense in the dark ages but we've also
made it pretty damn far and life overall is pretty
damn good even if you're poor still life is pretty
damn good you still have opportunity no matter what race
class or sex you have you have you have pretty
decent opportunity now is it all fair and equal no
of course not there's a lot of corruption and inequality
and it's harder for some than for others might be
harder for women than for men maybe it's harder for
blacks than for whites maybe it's harder for gays than
for straights maybe it's even harder for trans gender people
than it is for normal people yeah of course there's
there's a lot of this stuff and all of that
will get smoothened out with time because that is the
trend line throughout human history is an increase in democracy
but uh you have to also appreciate what democracy really
means here democracy is not all rainbows and butterflies as
you democratize society move it away from elitism and authoritarianism
what happens is counterintuitive things happen fragmentation happens so ironically
when a dictator comes to power in ancient rome like
augustus the one of the first roman emperors one of
the most effective roman emperors because he was so managerial
and so controlling also brilliant strategist so as that the
emperor what does emperor do the emperor unifies like i
said unifies gives a coherent vision in a singular sense
of direction this can be very very powerful because you
can effectively get a lot of stuff done you can
build temples and win wars and build cities but also
if that vision is wrong it can go south very
quickly too so there's a double sword there but as
more and more people become educated we all become more
developed democratized power goes away from the emperor and gets
distributed to ordinary people that means ordinary people like you
and me who are not kings or politicians or aristocrats
we get more ability to control our own lives we
can be more creative we can be more autonomous we
can travel more we can spend our money more we
have more money to spend and and so on but
as that happens each of us now becomes like our
own little mini tyrant it doesn't automatically solve the problem
in fact what it does is sort of fractures society
society now breaks apart into factions when you don't have
one strong force to unite people together sometimes through vicious
force when you don't have that people will naturally tend
to break apart into clicks and factions that then start
to fight with each other this becomes quite wasteful in
terms of wasting a lot of energy and we're seeing
this today with american politics back in the nineteen fifties
and sixties one of the things that made america great
back then in a sense that america was predominantly spider-dynamic
stage blue america was unified by a certain culture of
uh judeo-christian values many of the conservative values that conservatives
pine for today the whole appeal of trump's you know
make america great again this idea of going back to
the 1950s and 60s where america was simpler it was
more white it was more protestant judeo-christian um there wasn't
so much political turmoil there wasn't this rank partisanship that
we have today in a sense there's there's some truth
to that and the reason that was was because we
were at spider-dynamic stage blue back then for the most
part which means that we were more unified by a
single religion a single set of values which kind of
shaped our sense as a nation as a civilization we
were very nationalist so when we were fighting off enemies
like nazi germany or communist russia or communist china or
communist korea something like this or communist vietnam you see
we had outside enemies and we kind of rallied together
as americans under sort of a cohesive idea of you
know maybe it's american patriotism the founding father you know
whatever is the american narrative so we sort of came
together under that we all sort of agreed on that
and um and we were actually able to be quite
effective but then what happened was that after that the
democratization continued and we started moving beyond sprawling stage blue
into orange orange is more business oriented more individualistic the
spirodynamics pendulum swings if you watch my sparrow dynamics series
it swings from individualist stages to collective stages back to
individual stages so stage blue was the 1950s and 60s
was a collectivist stage which many conservatives don't understand today
because many conservatives today are actually in stage orange which
is individualistic and they think that oh everybody was individualistic
back during the world war ii era no they were
very collectivist in a sense individualism was very suppressed during
the 1950s and 60s there was more of a sense
of america as a sort of a a higher identity
that all of us subsumed ourselves to but then the
pendulum swung after that with the baby boomer generation the
pendulum started swinging more towards individualism there was the rise
of consumerism the rise of marketing that appealed to every
individual consumer the rise of technology the rise of luxury
and then also what opened up after the 60s is
with the counterculture revolution the hippie psychedelic revolution 1960s which
is very very significant i'll talk about that in a
separate episode the significance of the psychedelic revolution of the
60s uh that opened up stage green so you see
as we move higher up the spiral as we develop
more as we become more democratic what that means is
that that opens up more room for voices suppressed and
marginalized voices to come to power and to speak their
truths and to put forth their survival agenda so as
we bring more people into the melting pot and give
them a voice now we have to start to listen
to their voice so you know you bring in women
and i have to listen to women you bring in
black snapchill listen to blacks you bring in asians they
have to listen to asians you bring in gay people
you have to listen to a gay people you have
to treat them all as equal to your own if
you're white now you say well that's great it is
great but it also comes with problems because now you
have to spend a lot more time listening to different
perspectives and voices and now the unified monoculture that used
to exist in america or in other countries it starts
to crumble and fragment what was once unified under a
great pressure now when the pressure has been removed it
starts to slack and fall apart and break apart into
fragments to disintegrate and that is in a sense what
we're experiencing now in the last let's say 10 or
20 years of american society we're starting to experience this
sort of disintegration different stages on the spiral are starting
to fight with each other because now we're not all
predominantly a sage blue now maybe a third of us
are at blue a third of us are at orange
and a third of us are green now we're pulling
in three separate directions now with the rise of the
internet information has become democratized the news media is becoming
democratized whereas 30 40 years ago you had a couple
of cable news shows on tv that everybody listened to
and everybody got their information from and everybody agreed you
know when some you know walter cronkite or somebody on
on the evening news came on everybody watched him everybody
thought he was a decent guy everybody just listened to
what he said about vietnam or about the soviets or
whatever the communists whatever and everybody agreed and that was
actually you a unifying force for the whole country but
what's happened since then as we've had now we don't
have a couple of cable channels we have hundreds of
cable channels now we have not just tv we have
radio we have satellite radio we have podcasts we have
youtube we have facebook we have online blogs and websites
and whatever you want you can go start a blog
website a podcast start talking preaching about your religion your
philosophy your ideology your latest conspiracy theory your opinion your
criticism of the news your criticism of elites and so
forth so this is a democratization of information and media
but the problem is is when you have a bunch
of ignorant people and you start to give them power
you can't just assume that that's automatically a good thing
it's like giving power to children and in a sense
that's what's happening today so one of the reasons that
we're seeing a bit of a backlash and a bit
of a some of the negative effects of this democratization
because you would think like well leo the way you've
been describing it up to now everything should be hunky-dory
and peachy and positive we shouldn't be seeing all this
strife and conflict but actually no that's exactly what you
should be seeing is strife and conflict as democracy increases
at least for now temporarily you should be seen more
conflict because people are getting a sense of their own
power but they they haven't really developed a responsible relationship
with this power yet they don't know how to use
it responsibly these people are still children and yet you're
giving them enormous power oftentimes these people are morons and
idiots and you're giving them a lot of power any
[ __ ] and idiot can now go and start
a podcast and start ranting about the latest conspiracy theory
about whatever any selfish devil can go on facebook open
an account and start running ads with some misinformation campaign
some you know doctored deep fake videos that are sensationalized
to get clicks and to delude people and to subvert
democracy any [ __ ] who hasn't thought deeply and
studied deeply history and how government works can go and
start a podcast or a youtube channel and start rave
ranting and raving about the idiot elites who are mismanaging
the country even though this person was ranting in raven
has zero governing governing experience zero deep understanding about how
governance works how politics works and so he's ranting and
raving about his favorite enemies who he's demonized and he's
going to infect the minds of millions of his followers
with that same toxic ideology that conspiratorial thinking that's going
to start to eat away at the the the institutions
and the the bureaucratic foundations which are actually the pillars
that are supporting the entire system of democracy you see
but he's ignorant without understanding what he's doing and his
followers are ignorant and don't understand what they're listening to
and how they're being brainwashed by it and who's to
say which of these news sources and media sources is
the right one does leo get to decide does the
president get to decide does your does your church leader
get to decide does your professor get to decide does
your mother or father get to decide do you get
to decide see when everybody gets to decide for themselves
now we have this problem of ken wilber calls it
a perspectival madness what happened was that before most people
at stage blue were just sort of forced into seeing
the world through the perspective of stage blue of the
society that they were born into so if you were
born into america in the 1960s like a baby boomer
you saw the world according to sort of the american
mythos whatever that was it was a very artificial way
of looking at the world but everybody sort of got
imprinted with that way of looking the world if you're
born today you know a millennial or whatever the next
generation is after that um now there's so much diversity
there's so much more diversity in perspectives you could become
a neo-nazi you could become a neocon an alt-right person
you can become a libertarian you can become some an
anti-fascist you can become there's so much there's so many
different perspectives now that are that are considered um acceptable
and that are easily accessible you can access the books
the websites the blogs the podcasts whatever you want you
can create your own echo chamber that will feed back
to you exactly whatever you want to think the world
is like so if you think that jews elite jews
are controlling the world you can find sources of information
that will feed all that back to you as confirmation
bias and then you'll really become convinced that you're right
and if you're some conservative you can find a conservative
news source that will just feed back to you everything
that you want and you will then just get entrenched
in that and if you're a liberal you can find
a liberal news source that will feed everything back to
you create this echo chamber and then you're going to
be stuck in that and unable to see the world
in any other way and in a sense now there's
no daddy figure there's no ultimate authority figure to tell
average citizens what to believe what's true anymore see one
of the functions of the king in the past were
the pope and oftentimes the position of the king and
the pope were interchangeable or they were held by the
same person basically the religious chief and the military chief
and the political chief they were oftentimes one person divine
monarchs they called it in europe uh where the king
was the head of the church and the state or
they could be separate people but anyways you had you
you in the past you had a couple of big
daddy authority figures who told you what was true and
what was false what was good and what was evil
what was acceptable and what was unacceptable what was decent
and what was indecent what was it a reasonable perspective
and what was an insane or a criminal perspective but
as democracy is happening those big daddy authority figures are
going away they're getting questioned and it's right to question
them because of course what they were peddling us they
weren't peddling us absolute truth nothing that some king or
pope says is the absolute truth it's just one perspective
that's right but in a sense it was functional it
was useful at least in that time in human development
because we needed one source of truth one source of
morality in the past because that's what unified us in
order to overcome the survival challenges that we faced which
were very serious today the survival challenges have largely been
overcome most of us are not an imminent threat of
getting you know ransacked by a neighboring country raped and
pillaged most of us don't live under that threat so
in that sense we sort of transcended and overcome those
survival challenges but we have new survival challenges now our
survival challenges how do we survive together while allowing all
of us to be so diverse see in the past
if you lived in a society a thousand years ago
everybody in your town in your village and in your
nation probably had the same religion probably pray to the
same god probably went to the same church probably had
the same ideas about race ethnicity homosexuality economics politics and
other things it was this sort of siloed narrow culture
very nationalistic and ethnocentric people didn't even know that there
were nations or cultures outside of their culture because a
thousand years ago there were no jet airplanes there were
no atlases there were no doc nature documentaries or documentaries
about other countries there was no internet you couldn't interact
with a indian person or a chinese person or a
south american person the way that you can today there
was no international media so nowadays you know everybody watches
hollywood movies and hollywood movies are very diverse there are
hollywood movies about homosexuality there's hollywood movies about racism there's
hollywood movies about whites and blacks and asians and and
uh chinese and japanese and africans and even aliens and
and so this hollywood culture now has become global culture
but what it's done is it's exposed these siloed narrow
cultures to other cultures now even if you live in
africa in some little village you've probably seen some you
know hollywood movies and those hollywood movies have exposed you
to new ways of life you've seen gay married men
which you would never see in some african village you
you see it in a hollywood movie or you see
some you know some asian person living some weird asian
lifestyle through some youtube video that you would never have
seen if you were living in africa a thousand years
ago or whatever and so this amount of diversity is
difficult to hold together think of it almost like a
small family small family of four where you have the
mother two children of the father the father is extremely
domineering almost to the point of being abusive he physically
will beat the wife if she doesn't do what he
says and he will beat the children too and he
has a gun and they know it and he won't
hesitate to use it if they get really out of
hand and so in this situation um in a sense
the family is counter-intuitively very unified because they live in
fear and this strong male presence is the king in
the family around which everything else revolves and it holds
it together now it's very dysfunctional i'm not saying this
is good or desirable but in a sense you can
actually maintain a family this way much longer than you
might if the father was very permissive and the father
just let the woman do what he wants and the
children do whatever they want and everybody's doing whatever they
want and then when you we have a family like
that often times what might happen is that they just
decide to to spread apart the wife will say well
i don't feel so happy with you anymore i i
like this other guy more so i'll just go marry
him i'll get a divorce and the husband will be
just like okay yeah sure sure honey you can do
that i'm not gonna i'm not gonna hold you back
go ahead and i'll give you the divorce and you
can go be with that guy i want you to
be happy i'll find my own new uh wife for
me you know who i'll be happy with and the
children you know now they're grown up they can just
go off and do whatever they want and we're not
going to control them so in this sense you know
yeah you got democracy but then the family falls apart
you know one of the reasons conservatives you know one
of the things conservatives say they say well but leo
a lot of these problems we have is we have
the collapse of the of the old-fashioned family it's collapsed
yeah it's collapsed precisely because that's what happens under democratization
the old-fashioned family was often ruled by some [ __
] father who was very domineering and now as women
have come to parity with men in terms of their
economic and political power now all of a sudden of
course yeah women have more more freedom and so when
a woman isn't satisfied in a relationship before she had
to endure it she had no other option now she
gets a divorce she can go do whatever she wants
and this dynamic is still playing out for example in
the middle east in the middle east in certain countries
now women are so suppressed and so dominated that they
don't really have the luxury of getting a divorce for
example like in saudi arabia it won't be allowed or
only under some certain extreme circumstances which are very favorable
to the man not to the woman so in a
certain sense this this makes it easier for people in
the middle east to maintain their classical traditional conservative values
and families and there are certain positives to that children
might benefit from that to some degree of course it
can also be very dysfunctional but that's one of the
problems i want you to notice with democratization is that
it leads to fragmentation so with the rise of social
media traditional media now is getting subverted undermined this is
one of the things that i'm seeing which is concerning
to me is that people now have way more autonomy
and control over their own epistemology which means their own
knowledge base their own world view see as we democratize
we give more power to everybody in different fields you
have more power with your sexuality you're more powerful with
regards to where you can travel in the world you're
more powerful economically you're more powerful because you have more
technology you're more powerful because um you have more you
know career opportunities and so forth you have more freedom
but as you give people more freedom it takes a
lot of responsibility now now something that was done for
you by some authority figure now you have to do
it yourself and if you don't do it properly you
[ __ ] it up so in the past epistemology
wasn't even a word that people understood your world view
was handed down to you by your church and your
culture there was no thing like where you're like okay
well should i be a christian or a muslim or
a jew or a hindu or should i be a
buddhist or should i be an atheist or a theist
or should i be a solipsist or should i be
a nihilist or should i be a nietzschean or should
i be a conservative or a liberal you didn't have
these choices and of course a lot of people still
don't have those choices today but you have more of
a choice today than you ever did before in the
past so in the past you know you were you
were born into a buddhist family you were a buddhist
that's all you knew that's that's it you didn't even
question it in a sense that's easy it's easy to
live life that way where you're only given one opportunity
one possibility it's almost like an arranged marriage see arranged
marriage is also counterintuitive because you think well if if
my parents just you know like arranged a marriage for
me that would be so terrible i don't even know
how i would live with that person we would probably
fight all the time we would not get along we
would be so incompatible because i got to choose the
most compatible person for me right that's kind of how
we think in the west but actually counter-intuitively like in
india where they do arrange marriages a lot it almost
works the opposite because if you do submit to the
authority of your parents to pick your mate for you
that's actually a huge relief think about it you don't
have to go dating anymore you don't have to have
all the stress of thinking about am i going to
die alone is that person going to like me you
know oh what if i get this person but then
i like that other person more there's all this complicated
all these complicated choices and we sort of hang ourselves
with all this freedom whereas if your parents just like
when you were born if your parents said oh you're
marrying person x we already have it set in stone
you're just gonna marry that person if you resign to
and you say okay fine i guess i have to
because there's no alternative and you do it in a
sense you're so all in on that bet with no
alternative you actually make it work you actually are so
committed you have that necessary commitment that is needed to
actually go through the arguments and the challenges and actually
learn to love that person in a more unconditional way
because you had to whereas if you if you just
you know have sex with the hottest person you see
in a certain sense that's a very shallow reason for
for dating somebody's you know based on their physical appearance
and then you you quickly find somebody else that you
like more because they're more attractive or whatever um but
in an arranged marriage you don't have that freedom and
in a sense that actually helps you to maintain a
cohesive marriage now of course it comes with a lot
of downsides as well those are pretty obvious i won't
even mention those but anyways my point with this arranged
marriage thing is that so going back to this epistemology
business you see now you have a lot more responsibility
over how you would what what world view you're going
to adopt there's more world views than ever which one
is right which one is healthy which one is conducive
to democracy there's a lot of traps now with epistemology
because see the problem is that most people don't even
know what the word epistemology means they have no appreciation
of it they have no appreciation of the dangers of
epistemology and belief systems and worldviews and ideologies and paradigm
locks and all the stuff we've talked about in the
past they have no idea how any of this stuff
works so what they do is they just go online
and they just start watching some youtube channel or some
podcast and it could be alex jones or it could
be some you know conservative person or some liberal person
and they just get sucked into it whatever it is
they're not consciously choosing the information they're watching they're unconsciously
just consuming information and places like facebook and youtube make
it very easy to unconsciously just consume information go down
some particular ideological rabbit hole and then get stuck in
it see and so you might say but but that's
that's freedom that's great that is great except here's the
problem in the past the primary worldview that you were
programmed with from your from your culture from your monoculture
yes it was very narrow and limited but it was
also in a certain sense it was time tested and
it was effective because it survived many generations of trial
and error and um and you know survival challenges it
had to survive all that otherwise it would die out
so in a sense only the best world views the
most effective i should say world views were able to
survive um and they they weren't too extreme either for
example a worldview like the kkk it couldn't have been
the mainstream worldview because it was too extreme certain world
views are so extreme they have to they have to
be niche in order to survive they can't survive at
mass scale so even though you know atheists love to
criticize for example the evils of religion and things like
islam or christianity and how stupid and how ignorant they
are and how much evil has this has caused actually
we can flip this on its head in a certain
sense these major worldviews like christianity buddhism islam and so
forth these were the most moderate and sensible worldviews what
you shouldn't take for granted is how many other extreme
world views existed which were way worse than these major
worldviews they were so bad so extreme so toxic that
you probably even haven't heard of them because they never
became mainstream because they died out long ago or simply
because they they they still exist but they exist in
a very um specialized uh narrow way and they can
never fully go mainstream so for example the kkk can
never go fully mainstream even though it still exists but
you see the danger now is that now that you
have access to all the media you want now that
it's been democratized but you're still a child epistemologically you
just go around stumbling to various conspiracy theories and now
you can really get trapped into some cult into some
radical ideology which you might think that well but but
it's better than the mainstream it's better than all those
elites that were controlling me but actually it's worse just
because something is different than the status quo does not
automatically make it better don't make that mistake i see
a lot of naive people these days who are getting
into politics who are starting to follow some of these
populist channels on the left or the right which are
now demonizing cnn and msnbc and are demonizing the elite
media and the new york times and all this sort
of stuff and they think that they're so much better
but actually they're not better they're even stupider you have
to be very careful about whether your critiques of a
system are from above or from below a lot of
these critiques are actually from below before you go criticizing
a system understand why it exists in the first place
see it's very easy for some ignorant naive person to
sit back and criticize the politicians the democrats the republicans
the clintons the bill gates's this and that yeah it's
easy to sit there to criticize all this you can
criticize mark zuckerberg and elon musk and all this but
the but the reality is if i had to bet
money on who would actually be able to make a
more stable successful society i would bet on all those
people over you over some [ __ ] youtuber who
sits there and rants and complains and criticizes all day
but doesn't know how to achieve jack [ __ ]
it's very easy and tempting to sit in to criticize
it's a lot harder when you actually go and try
to lead others in a conscious manner towards something better
than what already exists and this is now starting to
get ironic because usually i'm very critical of jordan peterson
and his whole ideology but i think the part of
his ideology which i totally understand and uh now i'm
some extent agreeing with is that he has sort of
made this point about how young liberals and progressives on
university campuses you know they get so idealistic they try
to you know go and you know involve themselves in
politics but they're young they're like 22 years old or
something and they think that they've got reality figured out
they have politics and government figured out and they go
and they start you know protesting and getting politically active
uh and then you know this is where his advice
comes into like clean your own room fix yourself first
before you go off and try to fix the world
because it's very easy to sort of start to fall
into this trap of thinking that all you know how
to fix the world how everything should be but in
fact you've accomplished nothing in your own life you've not
started a successful business you've not awoken yourself you've not
done any deep inner development you've you have no you
know serious relationships or understanding of how they work and
yet you think that you can go figure out politics
in this sense he's right now of course the problem
is that as bad as this might be on college
campuses this is even worse with young conservatives this is
not a liberal exclusive problem this problem exists with young
conservatives as well libertarians you know they have no idea
how how government works and why government exists and why
some of the things that exist need to be there
see government is a very tricky thing because we can
have ideas about how government should be about how society
should be but society and government is such a complex
[ __ ] thing that all of our idealistic utopian
ideas about it just completely wither and crumble away when
faced with the brutality of real life you might have
ideas like oh well police shouldn't shoot black people and
you know we should be nicer to gay people and
should be nicer to women and we should be doing
this and we should be in that you have all
these ideas but then reality hits you in the [
__ ] face and then you start to cry and
you run away and all of your fancy ideas crumble
now that's not to say that you know fighting for
equality is bad of course we should generally fight for
equality but um you have to be very careful about
just forming opinions about politics and government without actually being
involved with it and seeing how it really works politics
is notoriously dirty precisely because it's so brutally utilitarian and
it's so harsh you you might have some ideas but
oh yeah bernie sanders should be leading everybody he should
win and if bernie sanders didn't win then [ __
] joe biden i'm not going to vote for him
he's some corporatist shill i'm just gonna vote third party
sort of this sort of mentality it's this very naive
simplistic utopian uh perspective on politics the reality is that
bernie didn't win because bernie is too radically liberal for
the majority of the citizens of america that's why bernie
didn't win not because he was robbed or because some
you know some elitists some elitist you know hillary clinton
shills that they somehow you know stole it from burning
no no no most of the population is develo is
not developed enough to appreciate what someone like bernie offers
see so the problem we have now is we have
democratization than ever but this power and freedom and autonomy
is being distributed to morons who are uneducated about history
government politics science epistemology personal development spirituality survival and they're
just stumbling into the most obvious traps and they're developing
new world views that are actually more toxic and less
functional than the old ones that they are fighting against
you have to be very careful that the new thing
you create is actually going to be better and more
democratic in practice than the old system you're replacing it
with and the trick with politics and policy is that
oftentimes you come up with some idea about how to
change a system and actually it makes it worse it
doesn't make it better these systems are so complex that
no one individual ever sat down and just while sitting
in his armchair in his loft you know came up
with the ideal economic system or the ideal voting system
or the ideal constitution like it didn't work this way
when you do that you end up in disaster utopian
disaster what actually happened was that a bunch of different
ideas there was sort of a marketplace of ideas as
they say um a bunch of different ideas for different
political systems and economic systems they all were you know
shared by many people and there was a battle for
which of these ideas is the best one and then
the ones that were the most survivable and realistic those
are the ones that actually persevere and all the other
ones they died off or they got marginalized see and
this happened through sort of a natural evolutionary process in
a sense evolution is more intelligent than any one individual
human being and so that's sort of what's happening now
our political process now to start to link this to
the present moment and to start to wrap this up
i guess what i want you to see is i
want you to see how many of the challenges that
we're facing today whether economically in the media culturally with
racism and other issues how this is related to what
is actually a positive force of democratization and in a
sense this is a consequence of that and in a
sense what's necessary is for us to educate ourselves more
to become more conscious as citizens to understand more deeply
the dynamics of these systems that are going on so
that then we can be more responsible voters and more
responsible citizens so that we can take ownership and responsibility
for our epistemology our worldview so that we don't get
tracked into various toxic ideologies conspiratorial thinking and other things
like this which will um make things worse not better
and you can see now why there's a sort of
a oscillating up and down feature to this curve of
mankind's development as we get more power that calls on
us to be more responsible to be more conscious more
loving more developed but we're not there yet and so
because we're not there yet we we misuse that power
and then that power that misuse of power that we're
given that misuse of responsibility down that pulls us down
see for example mankind develops nuclear weapons in a sense
that's that's amazing you know we have nuclear technology now
we can have nuclear power plants awesome right if an
asteroid is coming to hit the the earth we can
even send nuclear weapons at it and blow it up
in theory are we in style uh maybe that would
save the earth that's a positive thing that's a positive
trend we're becoming more powerful with atomic knowledge see it
wasn't just the invention of nuclear weapons you have to
think of it more broadly as that the nuclear weapon
is actually a consequence of the fact that we gained
atomic understanding understanding of quantum mechanics basically that's a powerful
thing we've used that understanding of quantum mechanics not just
to build nuclear weapons but to to build gps systems
and to build rockets to the moon and to build
computers and the internet and all this couldn't have happened
without understanding of you know fundamental principles that ultimately led
to the nuclear bomb so we get this this massive
boost in our power but then we don't have the
responsibility yet to use this power in a conscious loving
manner and so therefore we go and start throwing bombs
at various places and then you know potentially cause a
nuclear war and so that that that dips us down
but then as we get dipped down of course we
start to see that we're we're going to annihilate ourselves
or something bad is going to happen and then that
is what triggers us to say wait a minute we
gotta what's happening here how do we fix this let's
let's pull the plane back up before it crashes and
the way we do that is by taking more ownership
and more responsibility becoming more conscious more educated and more
more loving and then we we rise back up to
eve even higher level than we began than when the
dip began but then you know we that leads us
to even more technology and more power and then more
power and more power more democratization more equality as all
this is happening consciousness is just kind of doing this
snaking dance up and down so you might wonder how
did trump come to power well in a sense trump
came to bower because we actually had massive democratization we
had so much democratization that people started to say hey
wait a minute i don't like the status quo anymore
let's get somebody who's outside a complete outsider somebody who's
not a traditional politician [ __ ] those politicians they've
been so corrupt for for centuries let's get somebody who's
a businessman let's get somebody who's who's not from washington
let's get somebody with without government experience that government experiences
all corrupt [ __ ] we don't need someone like
hillary clinton who has a bunch of government experience we
need somebody fresh somebody new who can come in there
somebody bold who will you know kick some ass and
and uh and not be bashful about it who's not
going to be the sort of typical polite politician who
says the the cordial things who's not gonna follow decorum
somebody who's a little bit brash somebody who's a little
bit more normal like us and then what you get
is you get idiots electing somebody who's like them an
idiot idiots vote for idiots and that's how you get
trump and now you say well but but trump is
a sort of a quasi-authoritarian fascist and so leo what
you're saying here it's not true because trump is a
fascist and the world is becoming more authoritarian there are
authoritarians on the rise in in eastern europe in south
america in and other places but that's precisely a consequence
of the democratization you see it's a temporary temporary dip
you have to see that it's temporary it's actually part
the dips are part of the trajectory of going up
you can't go up without having dips this sort of
idea that just because something is different it's better it's
going to solve the problem this is this is a
perfect example of this sort of fallacy is exactly what
happened with trump see a lot of people who voted
for trump thought that trump would um would change washington
because he's not from washington and this idea that government
experience is actually a negative this is actually one of
these examples of thinking that you're more clever than the
ones you're trying to replace when actually you're dumber than
them as it turns out having government experience is extremely
important you can't just get some business buffoon to come
out to come in from the outside and to be
able to run an effective government even those things that
the conservatives wanted from trump they can't really get from
trump because trump is so [ __ ] incompetent at
managing things and understanding how government works we see that
with the recent supreme court decision on daca the only
reason that they didn't go through is because trump was
so [ __ ] incompetent and his administration was so
incompetent with their racist policies that they were so ra
so blatantly racist with their immigration policy that even us
a conservative supreme court couldn't rubber stamp it because they
would feel like um like devils for doing so see
so experience does matter notice that it's much harder to
build something better than it is to tear something down
or to criticize something that already exists every idiot can
criticize an already existing system but it takes a visionary
genius leader to be able to build one that's better
that's far harder so you see in a sense what's
happening is that this is also something i forgot to
mention is that as american society becomes more democratic also
notice what happens it becomes more vulgar vulgar is an
interesting word look up the definition of vulgar in the
dictionary what i mean by vulgar here is that like
in the 1950s and 60s in american culture there was
more propriety simply because the culture demanded it of you
you couldn't go around just spouting the f word on
tv you couldn't even say words like [ __ ]
on tv you couldn't show certain sexual images because they
were seen as too immodest in a sense this is
sort of an old timey cultural relic we might think
oh immodest or crude or vulgar or obscene these sorts
of notions these notions have have significantly been eroded in
the last 60 or 70 years of american culture nowadays
even on cnn like i turn on anderson cooper sometimes
i i hear him saying [ __ ] i hear
news anchors saying the f word sometimes uh our culture
has become a lot more vulgarized and the reason is
is because as the cultural power gets more democratized what
happens that it goes to it goes from the aristocrats
and the elites who have been well educated mannered they
were taught manners and ethics and such things at universities
you know or in religious schools because universities used to
be religious schools basically all of them were um and
so there was a sort of a high a high
bar a high kind of bar of decency in order
to go to a university that you must meet certain
ways you must act and behave but now that the
power is getting spread to ordinary people who most of
them haven't gone to university haven't been educated uh you
know they have a more vulgar language a more vulgar
style and you see that vulgarity spilling out now into
youtube into facebook all over the internet podcasts blogs but
now even it's even infecting mainstream media this vulgarity because
now of course the mainstream media now has to appeal
to to these people and has to compete with with
uh platforms like youtube and facebook where the vulgarity is
off the charts and of course i'm not i'm not
saying that i'm not some bulgarian of course i'm a
bulgarian so i'm i'm i'm not trying to say that
i'm above this i'm completely in it um i'm just
i'm just pointing these things out to you just so
you notice what's happening and in a sense there's something
there's something nice about the vulgarity but there's also something
bad about it too what's nice about it is that
it feels like media is becoming more real like you
one of the biggest differences between watching cable news show
and watching a youtube video is that on a youtube
video you get sort of like real people talking to
you the way that people really talk to you like
the way you would sit down with a friend and
talk about politics you can get that on youtube or
that the way that maybe some teacher um for example
in the way that i communicate with you i communicate
in a sort of vulgar very common simple style i
mean i talk about very advanced metaphysical topics but i
do it in such a um how would i characterize
it it's almost like designed for high schoolers right like
i use very simple language um i talk to you
the way that a normal person might talk to you
whereas when you go on cnn or some you know
some really polished source like that which you might say
an elitist source it's it's got super high production values
it's all everybody's buttoned down wearing a tie and all
this and they speak very proper and you know everything
is very produced and managed and all this sorts of
stuff and in a sense it's unreal it's fake people
don't behave that way they don't talk that way to
each other in real life so in a sense it's
nice to get that realism from youtube or from facebook
or whatever but in another sense yes it's kind of
more real but also in a sense it's a lot
more vulgar and something is lost in that something positive
is lost in that see and so what we what
we're seeing now is is we're seeing both sides of
the aisle sort of the conservatives and the liberals they
don't respect one another anymore in the past there was
more respect people wouldn't just like call each other the
f word and so forth to their faces whereas now
it's that's a lot more prevalent and so there's just
like more polarization going on that's just a microcosm of
the larger dynamic of the macrocosmic dynamic of the unification
and and the di that division that reality is going
through right unification division like this reality is always doing
this at all scales at all levels so right now
in america and maybe around the world we're sort of
going through a phase of fragmentation polarization diversification that's going
to be happening i don't know for how long maybe
for 20 years 30 years 50 years and then it's
going to sort of reach its its climax it's going
to reach its peak probably some bad [ __ ]
will happen as a result and then there will be
a correction the pendulum will swing the other way towards
unification and then we're going to slowly start to come
back together unify at a higher level and each time
this unification happens it's not the same reunification happening over
and over again it's a new higher order of reunification
and then again once that unification happens again it'll sort
of hit its minimum and then it'll or maximum whatever
you want to call it and then it'll start fragmenting
again and again that won't be the same fragmentation all
over again it'll be a new order of fragmentation a
higher one leading to a higher reunification after that so
overall i'm very positive about the direction of mankind i
don't buy into any of these apocalypse theories about how
mankind is going to end the environment is going to
kill us all nuclear weapons will kill us all this
stuff i don't buy any of this [ __ ]
because mankind has been dealing with very serious bloody problems
life and death problems from the very beginning for tens
of thousands of years we've been dealing with these problems
and even for longer um but at least in in
sort of recent recorded history we've been dealing it with
it for all of recorded history for thousands of years
we've faced much worse problems we've faced plagues and we
face world wars and we've faced um terrible atrocities and
racism and other things like slavery which if you think
about it it's amazing that we were able to abolish
it at all it's amazing we were able to overcome
many of these problems that we have so based on
our track record i would say we're also capable of
overcoming all of our future problems whatever racism remains we
can fix it um will people still get hurt and
die from it of course in the meantime yes but
you have to understand that we're talking about this very
grand scale or we're talking about the deaths of millions
and billions of people here so you know a couple
of people here and there is you know a rounding
error in the grand scheme of things not to say
that you should be callous and not care about an
individual person's life you should it's important not to just
turn people's lives into into mere statistics and rounding errors
but uh but also it's important not to get overly
outraged over one or two deaths because that can turn
into a into a distraction from the real issue it
can turn into a red herring see and we see
this with some of the riots some of the looting
that's been going on um some of course some of
these protests are very justified and healthy and all good
but also um it gets out of hand as well
and we already know if you study sprawl dynamic stage
green go check out my episode it's probably dynamic stage
green if you've studied that you already know i i
talk in that episode about the excesses of stage green
we already know what that is a sort of a
mob mentality an indecisiveness a flat hierarchy structure we know
the limitations of green does that mean we don't go
green no we go green right now what i'm seeing
is america is experiencing a green awakening that's really what's
happening we're transitioning from orange into green that transition is
by no means complete it will probably continue for another
30 or 50 years to fully complete itself there's a
lot of resistance a third of americans want to take
us back to blue still they're completely in denial about
green but nevertheless they're going to lose they're on the
wrong side of history blue is not going to be
where america goes in the next 50 years it will
be green now one of the mistakes i see people
making here is that they see the excesses of green
and they start to use that as excuse to stay
at orange this is not going to work and this
is counterproductive yes there are excesses to green just as
there are to orange and blue and every other stage
but what's really needed now is for us to fully
move into green of course just saying that's not going
to make it happen the only way we get to
green is by slamming our face in the brick wall
of orange the excesses of orange see right now more
and more people are starting to wake up to the
excess of orange the gross income inequality the shenanigans on
wall street this sort of private uh looting and hoarding
that is happening amongst the elites in washington and on
wall street in silicon valley this sort of stuff the
the sort of monopolistic business practices that are happening um
the corporatization of politics and government the corporate lobbying that
happens in washington that is corrupting our democratic system these
are all the excesses of orange which ordinary people are
now facing more and more and more and more and
of course trump is the ultimate embodiment of that he's
also quite red spider dynamics red stage red but um
but in a sense trump is sort of the culmination
of stage orange he's the ultimate manifestation of the limits
of orange of the orange worldview and value system and
the world is now seeing the ugliness of orange the
ugliness of trump and this will then be the thing
that leads to the correction that will be necessary in
the next four eight or whatever 12 years to start
to now put a nail in the coffin of orange
what is necessary is for us to develop a consensus
as a society that stage orange is not the end-all
be-all libertarianism um unchecked you know capitalism unchecked corporate power
and corporate success and uh and a constantly increasing stock
market that these are not the true metrics of success
and we as a culture have to come and unify
around that idea to form a new sort of cultural
norm where we say that society is not about your
individual ability to create a business and to earn billions
of dollars and to stay independent and free and not
pay a dime in taxes and to be a libertarian
that's not what society is here for society is here
for a much larger purpose and if that's the best
you can do with your life is that then that's
fine you can still do that but we're going to
limit you we're going to limit the damage and the
excess of that on the rest of society because in
a sense what's happened also which is an interesting thing
to notice is that the tyrannical authoritarian power that a
single king used to have in a country what's happened
to it is that it has become democratized but not
fully what's happened is that that that power both political
power and economic power because the two go hand in
hand has been diversified not to the entire population but
to a select number of the most successful business people
in the country so in a sense it's true that
people like jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg and bill gates
and others like that warren buffett they have an enormous
overwhelming amount of political power because of their economic power
and in the future that's not going to be tenable
what's going to have to happen in the future is
that we're gonna need to democratize not just the government
and voting rights and civil rights we're gonna have to
democratize the business sector wall street silicon valley these giant
media platforms they're gonna have to become more democratized because
fundamentally it's not right or fair that somebody like a
bill gates gets to control all the operating systems on
the planet or most of them or that someone like
jeff bezos gets to control and make decisions about every
single purchase that's made online or most of them or
that somebody like mark zuckerberg gets to control and decide
how people can connect with friends through the internet right
this is fundamentally undemocratic for one person to have that
much control and that much power the only reason they
have it is because these are new frontiers of technology
that have been developed recently and they have not yet
been regulated because we haven't figured out how to best
regulate them there's a lot of criticism of people like
mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey from twitter and so forth
because they're not regulating their platforms the way that people
want them to regulate it but this this problem of
regulating and policing platforms is an extremely challenging problem i
don't envy zuckerberg or dorsey or other people like this
they have an enormous responsibility and one of their problems
is that these people they're from stage orange mostly so
they came into this endeavor with twitter and facebook and
so forth and google you know amazon they just came
into it saying like well i'm gonna start a website
it's gonna become popular and i'm just gonna earn a
bunch of money from it that sounds like a good
idea and then they did it and they succeeded great
but what they didn't realize is that you didn't just
start some website that's earning you a lot of money
you created the reason your website earns you so much
money is it because you created a platform which is
integral to the functioning of the entire society whether it's
google amazon facebook twitter the only reason these companies earn
as much money as they do apple as well with
their itunes and app store especially uh the reason that
these companies earn so many billions so effortlessly every single
quarter is because they're so deeply intertwined with the culture
and the fabric of society but it's precisely for that
reason that they can't be ruled by one single individual
or even a small corporate board because that's fundamentally authoritarian
and so in the future we're going to see the
democratization of these giant companies in all these various sectors
because people will get more and more frustrated by it
because these companies are sucking up more and more resources
increasing the economic inequality in the country and getting too
much power for their own good see the problem is
that you get so much power you ultimately it goes
full circle it starts to corrupt you these companies like
facebook and google and apple and microsoft they think that
they need more money and more success and more power
but actually what happens is that after a certain point
it starts to backfire on them they're seeing that now
and what i predict will happen in the future is
that these these handful of companies in particular which are
so integral to the functioning of society in the world
not just america but the entire world facebook twitter amazon
google microsoft apple and a few others that i'm not
mentioning uh these companies are gonna be the source of
a lot of tension going forward in the future because
they've monopolized together these companies have basically monopolized probably half
of the world economy is owned by these six companies
or so and it's only going to get worse and
right now all these companies are still new that means
they still have some sense of the original founder's vision
you see these companies usually the way the company goes
through a life cycle the company is usually found a
successful company usually founded by some visionary leader this visionary
leader is usually pretty good pretty benevolent pretty caring and
passionate about the field he's in which is why he's
able to create this company sometimes people like to criticize
people like bill gates or mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos
but if you think that's bad imagine what happens when
the when the life cycle of the company because right
now we're still in this phase of the life cycle
of the company still the beginning chapters what happens in
50 or 100 years when all of these founders die
from old age and they get replaced by tools and
corporate shills and committees and wall street types who only
care about now you might say oh yeah but that's
already the case bill gates and warren buffett and and
elon musk and all these people all they care about
is just money no that's not right the original founders
of a company they didn't found the company just for
money even though that's a popular stereotype they actually found
it because they were passionate about something the pure money
types the wall street wolves those types those are who
come at the end of the life cycle of the
company once all the ideas have been exhausted all the
creativity of the company has been exhausted that's when the
wolves come and they try to squeeze every penny out
of the company and they they bankrupt the company morally
and then usually that moral bankruptcy leads to a financial
bankruptcy in the end and then they're going to pull
out all the money before it goes bankrupt you see
they suck it dry these wall street wolves because these
are not true visionaries these are not the founders so
what happens when half of the world's economic power and
therefore also political power as well is put in the
hands of these wall street wolves who are just going
to be thinking about how can i extract as much
money for myself and my family as possible and my
partners as possible from this company like google like facebook
like amazon like microsoft what happens then that's what i
foresee as being a huge huge looming problem in the
future that nobody is yet talking about people do not
appreciate how much power a company like google has or
amazon has or facebook or apple has it has way
more power than we currently appreciate because it has not
we have not really seen any of these companies yet
as much as you might hate these companies or think
that they are undermining democracy you haven't even seen the
beginning the tip of the iceberg we've only seen the
tip of the iceberg of how much damage these companies
can do if they really stopped caring and if they
really were controlled by people who just didn't give a
[ __ ] and were willing to do any kind
of damage for money yeah but at the same time
even though that makes it sound very negative and pessimistic
here's the silver lighting the silver lining and here's a
thing that nobody will really tell you in the news
or on youtube in any political analysis because they don't
understand this this it takes a deep understanding of human
consciousness and collective consciousness to understand this corporations are also
evolving corporations are not a static thing how many times
have you heard that oh corporations they only care about
money that's actually not true it might seem on the
surface that corporations only care about money that's only because
right now predominantly most of our corporations in the 21st
century are at spider-dynamic stage orange but as the people
in the organization evolve as the leaders who run the
organization evolve up the spiral so will the corporations because
highly advanced loving conscious developed moral leaders are not going
to lead organizations that are unconscious fearful selfish depraved immoral
and so forth it's not going to happen so the
silver lining is that corporations like facebook amazon google and
whatever else they will also have to evolve and in
fact they are in the process of evolving this is
exactly what we're seeing with google and amazon and facebook
we're seeing these companies evolve you're seeing their employees staging
protests which is forcing the management of these companies to
respond many of these silicon valley companies are already halfway
staged green at least culturally if not economically companies like
google are some of the most advanced high consciousness companies
that exist compared to oil companies and others military companies
and others some of these companies like google for example
they have fairly high ethics now you might have certain
things you can nitpick about google you might say oh
they don't treat this person right they don't treat that
person issue or this issue right whatever but overall these
silicon valley companies you have to appreciate they're actually better
than the majority of companies you should actually be grateful
that internet companies are roughly spiral dynamic stage orange slash
green in their culture rather than pure orange or blue
orange which many companies are for example many wall street
companies are just pure orange google is not like that
if it was google would be a lot more evil
than it is now that doesn't mean google is not
evil at all um every company every organization is selfish
like every individual is selfish it's a matter of striking
that balancing act see but what i'm saying in a
nutshell is that these companies will also have to evolve
into pure green and then above that and this will
soften them make them more compassionate more loving more democratic
and so in this sense i'm i'm an eternal optimist
i'm an optimist in the long view i think mankind
is going to be able to deal with all of
its problems i think we can deal with all of
our war problems our famine problems we can deal with
all the environmental ecological problems we can do it and
in fact i think we're too [ __ ] selfish
to do anything else because in the end it's our
selfishness which will keep us from destroying ourselves because we're
just too selfish to kill ourselves see now will a
lot of people get hurt in the process of course
they will they always have that's always been the case
there will always be casualties and collateral damage and innocent
people getting run over by this machine that humanity is
but then again do you have a better idea see
it's easy to sit there to criticize about how awful
humanity is but what else what other game is in
town you got a better way of of managing seven
billion people even though right now we live in the
dark ages this era will be known as the dark
ages by future generations hundreds of years from now um
[Music] we are in the dark ages scientifically spiritually psychologically
emotionally politically so even though we are in the dark
ages i'm still very optimistic because we have from the
darkness the only the the only other alternative to darkness
is light you see and we are right at that
point now that we have we have the knowledge and
the understanding that's the crucial thing we have the understanding
to really um get our [ __ ] together by
which i mean we have the spiritual understanding we have
the psychological understanding we have the metaphysical and existential understanding
that is necessary to understand what drives all of mankind
and what unifies all of mankind which is the desire
for love and consciousness now it's just a matter of
how long is it going to take to to spread
all this information the high quality information out to the
masses because right now there's a lot of high quality
sources happening on youtube but there's a lot also a
lot of low quality sources creating a lot of noise
and turmoil and people are not able to differentiate between
what's the good stuff what's the bad stuff what should
be trusted what shouldn't be trusted this process has to
play itself out it's going to probably take us another
50 years to really resolve all this and to start
to upgrade our education system to start teaching this this
new material the material that i talk about so much
on this channel this has to get spread out through
official channels like the education system into the mainstream media
and elsewhere that will take time to happen and there
will be a lot of resistance to it and there
will be a lot of noise in the meantime a
lot of conspiracy theories and distractions and red herrings and
so forth and traps so you as an individual don't
get trapped by that but also don't be surprised that
a lot of your friends and colleagues will fall into
it we should expect that it's uh it's all part
of this democratization process see once we really upgrade our
education system and we start teaching these fundamental spiritual metaphysical
conscious concepts to people early on and get them not
just to learn it as a dogma but actually experience
it to feel it to start to understand things like
spiral dynamics and so forth at an early age that
is going to create sort of a new metaculture that's
going to link us together what we're really missing now
is some sort of vision for what america could be
if we work hard together over the next 50 years
that's what's really missing i don't see any politician really
articulating that vision there's so much we can do as
americans if we get our [ __ ] together if
we come together and we really want to grow and
we start to educate ourselves and we start to take
seriously the idea of lifting everybody up helping everybody raise
their consciousness in the meantime as we're doing that we're
also spreading opportunity across laterally to all the marginalized groups
[Music] and if we act fearlessly america could set the
next prototype for what all the other nations in the
world could be moving us into spider-dynamics tier two level
of governance with all the intellectual power and economic power
that we have and all the cultural power that we
wield still through hollywood and through the media because the
whole world is basically watching us and following us culturally
so in a sense we're doing a great disservice to
other nations other nations are starting to out pace america
in certain ways because we're so fragmented and so polarized
we're just kind of running around with our head's cut
off like a chicken with no sense of direction but
also i understand this is totally necessary this is a
necessary phase for america to go through before we find
a new sense of direction and vision and there's a
lot of resistance so a lot of what you're seeing
a lot of the turmoil you're seeing a lot of
the confusion and noise in the media and elsewhere that
you're seeing violence and so forth a lot of it
is coming from people who are being left out from
the prosperity and from the development you see what's not
going to work is it's not going to work to
take half the country and to lift up half the
country but the other half stays where they are that
can't work so the part that wants to rise up
needs to figure out a plan to help elevate those
parts that are struggling to rise up that's part of
the challenge we can't just as as progressives we can't
just look at at conservatives and just call them idiots
and morons and uh and just kind of like leave
it at that that's not going to resolve the problem
we need to figure out a way how to get
them to see what we see to buy into our
vision to help them along economically culturally whatever to understand
their point of view and of course many of them
will resist and the reason that happens at any given
point in time you take a society you can take
that society you can cut it in half half of
that society will be progressive half that society will be
conservative roughly speaking half of that society will be on
the upper end of the spiral half the society will
be on the lower end of the spiral and of
course the lower end of the spiral is going to
resist moving up to the higher end of the spiral
the higher end of the spiral half is going to
look down at the at the lower half and is
going to like do a face palm wondering how ignorant
stupid they are but at the same time it's the
higher half's responsibility to find a way to elevate the
lower half because the higher half is more conscious and
more loving by definition this is higher and therefore it's
more capable of doing that and in the end how
do you elevate the lower half consciousness love understanding fundamentally
those are the principles and then of course how that
actually gets manifested and fleshed out in practice that that
can all the devil of all that is in the
details see the more conscious and loving you become the
less interest you have in controlling others the less interest
you have in power and so naturally you want democracy
because you want everybody to experience life at your level
and life at your level of high consciousness and high
development is you take a lot of responsibility and ownership
for your creation of reality you are the creator of
your reality and of course by being the creator you
you take on the responsibility and the autonomy you create
consciously and then you can be entrusted with more power
without worry that you're going to abuse it or get
corrupted by it and that's sort of what all of
all of life is leading towards is becoming more powerful
as a creator more conscious more loving all these go
hand in hand more selfless fundamentally the reason our society
is so [ __ ] up and has been for
thousands of years and will be for probably hundreds more
is because we're too selfish too many of us are
too selfish not the elites are too selfish but ordinary
average people are too selfish and nothing is going to
fundamentally change until you become less selfish that is true
both individually for your own life and for the collectives
that you're a part of whether it's your family your
business your town or your country or your species your
planet so hopefully this interconnects a lot of stuff for
you makes a little bit more sense of what's going
on in the world remember to keep your eye on
the ball develop yourself you can still partake in collective
issues so i'm not i'm not doing the sort of
jordan peterson nonsense i was telling you that oh clean
your room and that's it mister it's like no no
yes clean your [ __ ] room of course but
also have an eye out for understanding how collective systems
work and educate yourself about it contemplate about it don't
just adopt some ideology from some person on youtube about
it really get curious start to study these systems and
then play a play start to play some leadership role
in changing these systems take some responsibility and ownership over
them don't just sit and whine or start some youtube
channel about bitching and moaning about the politicians but actually
try to go out there and construct something do something
constructive you see criticism isn't really constructive go build something
that's actually more conscious and more effective as a system
for your collective contribute to your collective in whatever way
is appropriate to you maybe that means running as a
volunteer for some politician or even running as a politician
for some new position maybe it's that or maybe it's
something less direct it doesn't have to be that direct
maybe it's about becoming a coach or a teacher or
a shaman or whatever and having your impact that way
on the collective so as you're going forward in your
life really there's two fundamental facets to your development that
are related and both very important your individual growth and
then how that connects with and intersects with your contribution
to the collective that you're a part of so keep
those both in mind see it's natural that as you
become more conscious and developed you're going to want to
take more responsibility for the collective that you're a part
of and you can get a lot of meaning and
value and satisfaction from having an effect using your personal
growth to then affect others in positive ways whatever those
are whether it's through business or through spirituality or through
politics or government or environmentalism or art or whatever that
is so even though there's a lot of [ __
] that comes with being a social species there's also
a lot of positive as well the positive is the
opportunity that it gives you to impact others which you
couldn't otherwise do if you were just living alone by
yourself in the woods somewhere so you have that opportunity
start thinking about how to best leverage this opportunity really
it can be a win-win situation where you grow yourself
into this powerful conscious leader and then you lead others
with that and you help inspire others to be conscious
leaders you empower them and that synergizes and the two
work hand-hand and that's how we create more democracy and
that's how we create a better society that's how we
elevate the consciousness and love of the entire planet and
since that's really the only game in town what else
are you going to do you only have two options
here you're either going to do this or you're not
if you do it you can either do it consciously
or unconsciously if you unconsciously you won't be effective at
it if you do it consciously you can be very
effective at it if you don't do it if you
choose to just kind of be selfish and hang out
and kind of live an irresponsible life where you don't
really contribute to your collective in a positive meaningful way
if you do that or if you resist it you're
going to be on the wrong side of history the
human species will become more conscious and more loving and
more egalitarian and more democratic and higher up the spiral
whether you like it or not whether you become a
nazi or not whether you join the kkk or not
whether you become a conspiracy theorist or not whether you
blow up some some civilian building or not whether you
shoot up a school or not so why not um
just like side yourself with the inevitable forces of consciousness
and love rather than fear and depression and selfishness and
misery side yourself with god in other words and then
um turn yourself into a vehicle towards this evolution and
then you will reap the rewards that naturally come with
that and if you don't if you act lazy and
depressed and [ __ ] and moan and complain and
act like a victim then um or you act out
of fear and so forth with your conspiracy theories and
you criticize and you act toxic and polarized if you
do that then [Music] you're also going to suffer the
consequences the karma that comes with that the karma of
selfishness so make a conscious choice start working on that
and you should notice that you start to feel better
about your life and you start to feel better about
mankind there's a lot of distraction happening these days in
the news and it's very easy to get sidetracked by
get all pessimistic about it because the news shows you
all sort of negative stuff like war and genocide and
racism and this sort of stuff uh it doesn't show
you the good stuff so again don't get distracted by
all the petty human [ __ ] that's happening around
you keep your eye on the ball on your purpose
on developing yourself and then having the contribution to mankind
and leading others towards consciousness and to love that's what
you've got to do and ignore all the naysayers and
all the uh all the people who are tearing their
hair out and whining and complaining and worrying and caught
in fear you can't be a powerful creator or leader
when you are trapped by fear even when it's fear
of something like economic or sorry environmental collapse that's still
fear-based thinking if you're sitting there worrying about the environment
which is not to say that the environment doesn't need
our attention it needs massive attention but that's not solved
through fear and through criticism that's solved through developing yourself
and then becoming a vehicle for god to then do
god's work on earth and to inspire and uplift others
with your creative contributions positive creative contributions that's what we
need so get to work all right i'm done here
please click the like button for me and come check
out actualize.org that's my website you'll find my blog the
life purpose course the book list the forum uh you
can support me on patreon by going to patreon.com actualize
chip in five bucks a month that helps to fund
my work and lastly what should i say to wrap
this up hmm try not to treat policy with some
dirty thing that you are above i notice that people
who treat politics this way they actually contribute to its
dirtiness there's something very very profound going on within politics
that people are not aware of there's something profound going
on in society with how our government is organizing itself
that people are not aware of society is organizing itself
to higher and higher complexity systemic complexity and you can
play a role in that you can shape that you
can start by trying to understand how it works and
you can actually start to appreciate how politics is love
see usually you tell a person all politics is love
like what kind of hippie [ __ ] is that
of course it's not but what's really really profound and
the point that i want to ultimately guide you to
is to the point where in your life you will
be able to understand how politics is love even the
most dirtiest kinds of politics is love but of course
that will take a lot of development from you a
lot of awakening a lot of contemplation a lot of
open-mindedness a lot of surrendering of your judgments and criticisms
and political positions so whatever political positions you have i
recommend that you throw them away and start from scratch
start to look at government in a non-ideological way start
to see the spiritual aspects of it that are there
it's not there because some evil people want to control
the world it's much more subtle and complex than that
it's much more benevolent than that but that's a topic
for another time so stay tuned because yeah i probably
will have more political topics in the future we still
have yet to talk about economics i want to have
some some videos about economics i want to have some
videos about libertarianism i still want to talk about i'm
going to have videos about leadership there's still some important
insights about leadership that i need to communicate to you
we're going to have more videos on spiral dynamics more
videos on developmental psychology uh other social endeavors like science
that's coming soon we're gonna have a series of videos
about how science works and the the complexity the social
complexities that are involved with science so yeah there's there's
a lot of material that's sort of at the at
the nexus point between the individual spiritual growth and sort
of the collective development that we're doing as a as
a species so stay tuned for those
