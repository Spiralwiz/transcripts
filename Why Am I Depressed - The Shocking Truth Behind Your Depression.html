hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about depression I'm going to
answer the question of why am i you depressed okay
so why are you depressed what is the cause of
your depression what is the root cause and what are
some ways that you can start to get a handle
on it so depression is an epidemic it's out there
so many of us especially in first world countries nowadays
are starting to actually get more and more signs of
depression why is this going on what's happening here what
is the rock-bottom truth about depression all right here is
the deal I'm going to be blunt with you here
because the bottom line is that the reason you're depressed
is because your psychology sucks all right you've got [
__ ] psychology I'm not blaming you I'm telling you
a fact now there's really two cases here that I'm
going to distinguish there are people who are watching this
that are going to be clinically depressed that are actually
going to have perhaps legitimate physiological conditions that are contributing
to their depression but I want to be very careful
about saying that because most of you when you're especially
when you're depressed in a depressive type of state are
going to be quick to look for a way to
be a victim and to not take responsibility for how
you're feeling and for the fact that you are causing
your own depression all right so even though there are
clinical cases which I'm going to suggest that if you
are a clinical case go and see a medical doctor
or go see a psychiatrist put yourself on medication perhaps
if that's the right course for you so there's that
then there's the other half of you and I would
say it's not the HAP it's the majority by lot
by and large the majority that are really just in
a bad psychological state and that your depression is not
really genetic and it's not really clinical all right this
is just bad psychology and the fact that you have
not taken responsibility for your own personal development and so
that's really what we're gonna tackle here all right so
let's break into this now I want to be very
clear here that no matter who you think you are
you are going to listen to this talk and you're
going to assume that you're in this group of the
people that have a shitty psychology because I can guarantee
that even if you do have biological clinical factors to
your depression your psychology still sucks so you're going to
want to look at the psychology and the fact is
that this psychology getting this in place is way more
important than getting the clinical stuff in place and that
actually you can totally negate the clinical stuff when you
get your psychology really into shape alright when you really
understand yourself when you understand what's going on here so
I'm going to get into this and I'm gonna give
you some techniques alright so here's the bottom line is
that your happiness level scientifically it's been shown it's about
50% genetic so they've done Studies on fraternal twins identical
twins comparing and they've shown that basically people have a
certain happiness set point and that about half of it
50% of it which is quite a lot is determined
by genetics you can read more about this like various
research and positive psychology literature that's out there a lot
of new studies are being published all the time right
now in the 21st century but really the book the
howl of happiness has some some good evidence and discussion
about the the genetic side of depression and you can
find books and other resources out there that will talk
about the genetic causes and maybe some of the clinical
causes some of the chemical imbalances going on in your
brain that might be causing it but I really want
to encourage you stop being a victim and take ownership
of it right take ownership of your own psychology because
the software the mindset that you've got the software that's
running up in your head is more important in a
sense than the the hardware and that's not strictly true
mean hardware is really really important but I think that
people are just so quick to point to external sources
of problems that they really ignore the most important source
of the problem which is themselves and their mindsets so
that's what we're getting into all right so the biggest
reason that you are depressed is because you are too
identified with yourself you're too self-absorbed and you're too self
identified in you're too egotistical now this might sound a
little bit harsh and your immediate reaction might be to
say well egotistical I'm not egotistical I'm a really kind
and sweet and nice person I go to church and
I do community service that I do I do good
things for my family and I take care of my
spouse and you know how I'm not egotistical I'm humble
you're egotistical in the sense that you have a strong
sense of who you are and that actually your depression
is contributing to your sense of who you are and
this is a deep idea this is actually an Enlightenment
level idea this is an idea that you work on
when you're going through and you're working towards enlightenment through
Zen through meditation and this is something that goes deep
so unless you're a real student of this you're not
going to really understand it when you first start but
I want you to start to just get an idea
around what's going on here you the person that you
think is you your ego right when I say your
name who you think you are your past history all
your beliefs all your assumption about how the world works
alright the bottom line is that all that is a
concept all that is conceptual it doesn't actually exist anywhere
that I that you call EU that I that is
depressed it doesn't actually exist now it's one thing to
understand this conceptually and intellectually it's another thing to actually
be aware of it on an experiential being level to
do that you need to work on well you need
to do a lot of deep meditation deep contemplation and
work towards enlightenment the more you do that the more
you start to get aware of that right that can
take months years of serious work but the festival remains
that you are extremely identified with who you are all
your problems all the circumstances that are hurting you all
the ways in which you are a victim and in
many in a in a big sense your depression is
about you you are extremely self-absorbed when you're focused on
yourself so much and you're focused on all your problems
and you've got these negative thinking patterns that are deep-rooted
and are deeply ingrained in your subconscious you're always running
through you're always worrying you're always panic you're always anxious
you're catastrophizing situations you're thinking about yourself that's making you
depressed all right that is the bottom line of it
you also probably have a negative self-image at the bottom
line the reason that you're probably going into these spirals
of negative thinking and these deep dark emotions is because
you have a negative self-image so you think something inherently
is wrong with you on some level I don't know
what it is maybe you think you're unlovable maybe you
think that you need approval from other people maybe you
think the happiness can be found out there somewhere and
that someone owes you something maybe you think that you're
not good enough maybe you think that life is just
hard it's inherently painful it has to be painful there's
always suffering around right and that you deserve that suffering
now a lot of these ideas they sound silly when
we just talked about that when we when we voice
them consciously but a lot of times it's happenings that
those are operating on you on a subconscious level you
don't even realize what's actually going on here you might
feel that you're depressed because for example you don't have
the relationship that you want and you keep failing to
get it the relationship that you want but the reason
you keep failing to get into that relationship that you
want and you keep trying and stuff breaks up and
you get into bad miserable relationships nothing seems to work
the reason that's happening perhaps this is just an example
is that actually you're very needy in that relationship and
you're very insecure so whenever you get that relationship you
become very attached very loving and you might think well
what's wrong with that well actually what's happening is that
you're not fulfilled with yourself and the reason that you're
becoming so insecure and needy is because you're not comfortable
with who you are you're not fulfilled as yourself you
don't realize that you can be fulfilled by yourself and
the reason that might be is because you feel like
you need approval from other people and that you now
need to live up to other people's expectations of you
and the reason that might be is because well you
want to be loved and you feel like love is
the most important thing and that you're lacking it then
on some level you need that love and deep down
the reason that you might want that love for example
is you feel that you are not good enough just
as you are right now without having to be somebody
at somebody else and so that whole chain of beliefs
and assumptions and logic it might be completely logical it
might sound silly but that whole chain might actually be
running on you and I can bet that a lot
of people watching this if thousands of people are watching
this that a good percentage of you have that exact
chain of reasoning going through which is causing you your
miserable relationships and that will always that patter will always
keep running because that is the subconscious those are the
subconscious layers so that might be creating a lot of
depression for you right you have to start to get
more in touch with what's really really going on there
and start to realize that a lot of this stuff
is just [ __ ] a lot of it is
past conditioning from past traumatic experiences from childhood from early
adulthood maybe you've had some bad breakups you had some
some trauma and so those things are holding you back
but that is your personal past history that is not
the case right now in fact I can guarantee you
that if we put you into a meditation program where
we forced you to meditate for an hour every single
day for let's say six months if we forced you
to do that then your depression would be either entirely
lifted or it would make a really big impact on
your depression because what meditation does for example is it
puts you in the present moment and this is a
fact all right this is not a concept if you
right now drop you can do this exercise if you
right now drop your past history completely forget about it
just at least for a second forget your past history
forget your future history forget that you have a future
forget that you have a past be completely in the
moment right now get rid of every single thought you
have in your mind get rid of your idea of
yourself pretend like you are dead you have no more
life you have no more ego you have no more
conceptualizations you have no more beliefs about how the world
is and how it works and you just sit in
quiet and peace close your eyes as you're doing this
and you just focus on that and you do that
for ten minutes and you're very disciplined about this you're
going to feel you're going to get a real feeling
this is not a concept it's not an idea not
a theory you can get a real feeling of what
real happiness is you're going to feel genuine happiness this
is not some sort of external stimulation this is not
some sort of titillation or excitement and you're going to
notice that whatever depression you've had does not exist in
that moment right that's because each one of us when
we get rid of our ego the natural state of
the human psychology is total bliss and happiness this is
extremely powerful idea if you thought that your depression has
been so crippling that you can't break out if I
really encourage you to try this and prove it to
yourself on an experiential level right but really try it
you have to try it and it takes some work
to actually do this this is not going to come
naturally if you've never been meditating before if you've never
sat quietly alone in a room by yourself before for
thirty minutes then you're going to find yourself really struggling
and resisting first time you do it you might actually
become more anxious because it feels very unnatural and your
mind is hooked it's probably hooked on all sorts of
external stimulation so go unhook yourself and start very small
start with minute just try to do it for a
minute and see see if you can tap into even
five seconds of just that pure happiness of being in
the present moment you'll see that it when it when
you actually do that you'll see that it's very possible
it's actually not as hard as we make it out
to be and this proves to you that really a
lot of your depression is self-created as your natural state
is not a depressive state nobody is naturally in a
depressive state maybe with I would say an extremely extremely
extremely few people that might have some sort of serious
physiological condition do not put yourself into that category until
that has been confirmed by someone with a PhD all
right and even then I would say or I'm an
MD do not put yourself into that category and even
then I would say even if a doctor puts you
in that category still question that because a lot of
doctors that are out there do not understand the power
of these psychological ideas that I'm talking about to you
here these are so so powerful all right so other
ideas that I'm going to throw out you here really
quickly here's what you need to know other reason that
you could be in depression most definitely you are in
depression because of this root cause but then there's other
things that are adding on to it here are some
other things one is that you're not living in integrity
with your values all right each of us has core
values that are important to us and when you're not
living and honoring those on a practical level every single
day then you become lazy undisciplined you start to feel
guilty you start to procrastinate right so maybe that's just
not splurging on that ice cream maybe it's waking up
on time maybe it's going to the gym maybe it's
getting to work on time maybe it's doing your work
well and when you're not doing these things you're breaking
your values that's making you miserable and it's feeding into
your depression it's not really causing it I would say
I'd say it's feeding into it another thing I would
say that is feeding into your depression and it's actually
a a symptom and an outgrowth of this ego problem
that you have is being inauthentic and fake around people
and being fake with yourself it's not being honest about
the emotions that you're actually feeling it's being around people
and trying to please other people trying to live up
to other people's standards and expectations society's expectations it's not
being independent and realizing that actually you are totally happy
and blissful in your natural state when you're not thinking
any kind of crazy thoughts and that you do not
need anybody to fulfill you and in fact nobody else
in life can fulfill you no human being can fulfill
you no external object can fulfill you this is all
a question of your inner psychology this is a problem
not just for depressive people this is a problem for
almost everybody out there is not realizing that you could
not find deep fulfillment in anything external it's all internal
so starting to get around that and being more authentic
especially be more authentic with people right you're so worried
about rubbing somebody the wrong way saying something wrong to
somebody getting someone's disapproval that that is destroying you right
you're so worried about it not being able to live
up to some image of how maybe you should look
or how successful you should be or maybe even how
you should feel or how many friends you have or
the kind of the kind of parties and places that
you go to or the house that you live in
or the clothes that you wear you're so worried about
that you don't realize that that stuff cannot make you
fulfilled anyways even if you had it all in place
so you really are misunderstanding what fulfillment and happiness is
on a deep level you should probably check out some
my other videos that really talk about what happiness is
and how to get alright so solutions let's quickly talk
about some of the solutions the fundamental solution is to
start to do introspection and understanding of how your ego
is creating your depression you have to start taking responsibility
you are creating it you have to start to understand
that and this is not something that you just are
exposed to one time right here this is something you
need multiple exposures to this is something that you should
really start thinking about and start noticing about how you
are creating the feelings in your life alright that is
the most underlying solution I would say next on the
list would be start to meditate this is so important
if you're a person with depressive symptoms you need to
start meditating at least 20 minutes every single day as
though your life depended on it for some of you
it actually might so start meditating I have other videos
talking about meditation the benefits of meditation how to do
meditation there are millions of books and resources out there
join a meditation class do it yourself do it with
a friend doesn't I don't care build a habit of
it and follow through on that right and stick with
it stick with it and you're going to see some
amazing results another thing that you can do to really
boost your meditation or I mean to mooster boost your
mood get yourself out of depression is to start exercising
consistently there have been actually studies that have been done
that have shown that exercise is equally effective as zoloft
in controlled studies of relieving depressive symptoms this study has
been talked about in the book at the how of
happiness by Sonja Lyubomirsky and I'm sure you can find
it in other places as well but this is the
oh this is a powerful this is actually a powerful
finding is that an antidepressant an exercise can have an
equal impact on lifting your depression and in fact that
study that they did showed that exercise is better because
the exercise produces more lasting results because when you take
yourself off the antidepressant you're back in your depressive mood
whereas if you're doing your exercise and even if you
get off that exercise the results of it lasts longer
plus the exercise good for you anyways you should be
exercising anyhow so that's another one all right then I
want you to do the things the little things that
you know you need to be doing wake up on
time get to your job on time do your work
well eat healthy all the little things that are important
to you start doing them and if you don't know
what's important to you start to clarify that Values Clarification
I talked about value identification many other places you can
get coaching on that to really get your values to
understand who you are and what's important to you then
start living to those principles of course life purpose if
you're depressed I can definitely aren t you've got no
life purpose you probably don't because if you've got a
strong sense of purpose and you know what you're committed
to creating in life and your life is not about
yourself but it's about serving others it's about having creative
impact it's very hard to be depressed that's why I'm
rarely depressed is because I have a very strong sense
of life purpose I've worked on it a lot so
get your life purpose into place I have a lot
of videos I'll talk about that you can also get
coaching on that if you're really serious I do poach
in on that and then if you really want to
get a handle on depression and not only that but
take it to the most highest level possible I encourage
you to look into serious meditation work serious contemplation work
really working your way towards enlightenment research the idea of
enlightenment I have some videos that are going to talk
about enlightenment really research the idea of ego your subconscious
mind and enlightenment and commit yourself to that spiritual work
that you do with enlightenment because what that is going
to do is that's going to put you in that
present blissful state that you are naturally capable of being
in and that is going to completely shift you because
right now you're in the exact opposite of all that
all right so that's it this video ran a little
bit long because there's a lot of deep stuff in
here plus a little bit of these practical tips so
I'm going to wrap it up here this Leo signing
