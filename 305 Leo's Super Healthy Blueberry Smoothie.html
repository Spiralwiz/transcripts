            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's Blueberry Spinach Smoothie Guide</b>: Leo provides a detailed guide on how to prepare his super healthy blueberry spinach smoothie, highlighting the importance of a high-quality blender and fresh, preferably organic, ingredients. Ingredients involve frozen blueberries, almond milk, a ripe banana, and baby spinach as their main components, with additional supplements like matcha green tea, freeze-dried beet juice powder, ground vanilla bean, and raw organic cocoa powder for added health benefits.  
</li><li><b>Instructions and Tips</b>: Leo starts by blending 3/4 cup of frozen blueberries and the same quantity of almond milk, adding a ripe banana for creamy texture and sweetness. Next, a half teaspoon of beet juice powder, 1.5 scoops of matcha green tea powder, a small amount of ground vanilla, and a bit of raw cocoa powder are included. Lastly, two handfuls of organic baby spinach leaves are added, suggesting one finds the balance between healthiness and the sweetness of the drink. Once all of the ingredients have been added together, Leo recommends a high-quality blender to mix everything up.
</li><li><b>Trial and Future Anticipation</b>: Leo implores viewers to try this smoothie every morning for a week or month and observe the performance benefits. For those keen on self-actualization, he assures that they'll find it worthwhile. Leo teases the audience about sharing more practical, healthy, and easy-to-make recipes that save time and energy for self-actualization activities. He values viewer feedback on their experiences, maintaining the promise of more healthy recipes to come. 
</li><li><b>Routine and Diet Importance</b>: Understanding that the recipe may become monotonous due to daily usage, Leo reminds viewers of the trade-off and stresses the aim, which is a focused, steady diet for self-actualization, growth, conscious quality maintenance, meditation practice, and philosophical living. He acknowledges that his diet, while healthier than average, could still improve, thereby committing to find more practical and healthy recipes for routine meals.
</li><li><b>Utility and Cost of Recipe</b>: Leo highlights the cost-effective nature and practicality of his smoothie recipe, with overall preparation time only panning out to roughly 5 minutes. He also mentions the longevity of ingredients, advocating for foods that can be bought in bulk, stored for long periods, and used when needed. Praising the recipe as a necessity for a sagely lifestyle, he invites viewers to reassess their diets and include healthy food routines for improved physical and mental performance.
