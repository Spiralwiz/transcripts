            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/d7B7A3GBdMw' target='_blank'>What Is Love - Part 2 - The Brutal Nature Of Love</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misunderstanding love</b>: Leo warns viewers about potential misunderstandings of his teachings on love. He recounts a story from a retreat he attended where a Buddhist participant had an awakening into the nature of love but struggled against it due to her existing religious beliefs. Leo uses this story to emphasize caution against narrow, dogmatic beliefs that may limit understanding of love, which he describes as an existential aspect that needs to go deeper and broader. 
</li><li><b>First-order and second-order love</b>: Leo distinguishes between two levels of love - first-order and second-order. First-order love is the existential aspect or the essence of everything, whereas second-order love refers to loving actions and emotions. He uses the metaphor of Lego bricks to illustrate this: the first order is the bricks themselves (the foundation), and the second order involves the creations and structures made with the bricks. Understanding first-order love and its connection to awakening and truth is emphasized.
</li><li><b>Love and consciousness</b>: He explains that second-order love, including romantic love or actions expressing love, are built upon the foundation of first-order love. First-order love refers to the fundamental consciousness underlying all emotions and experiences. He explains that even in situations where negative emotions such as anger and hatred are displayed, it is still an expression of consciousness, and therefore an expression of love. Leo also calls into question the stereotypical perception of love as purely positive and gentle, pointing out the more ruthless, masculine dimension of love.
</li><li><b>Love and truth are identical</b>: Leo argues that love and truth are the same thing which encompasses all aspects of reality, including the negative and brutal parts. Lack of understanding of the depth and breadth of love could potentially lead to a limited perspective on love and reality. Love is shown to be intertwined with every aspect of life, transcending practical concerns related to survival and self-interest. 
</li><li><b>Ego distorts our perception of love</b>: He argues that our egos can distort our perception of reality, blocking us from experiencing unconditional love. Rather than embracing love as an absolute, we often confuse love with our personal needs and fears, making it conditional. He states that our egocentric version of love is a survival mechanism designed to manipulate reality to service our desires. He underlines the necessity of understanding the concept of survival as it plays into our understanding of love.
</li><li><b>Love and survival</b>: Leo expounds on the concept of survival and its relation to love. He clarifies that everything in existence, including corporations and organisations, are driven by the need for survival. He also notes that humanity often demonises those who dare to teach about love and truth as such teachings threaten the prevalent survival mindset. 
</li><li><b>Challenges common understanding of love</b>: Leo disputes the common understanding of love as being purely sentimental and emotional experiences. He describes real love as serious, involving both positive and negative facets of life, and states that peoples materialistic mindset, emphasising survival at all costs, discourages them from comprehending a deeper, more genuine definition of love. He also suggests that the journey towards real love requires individuals to become more selfless and acknowledges their own selfishness.
</li><li><b>Higher consciousness and love</b>: Leo suggests that God, as an infinite manifestation of love, does not hate any aspect of itself. He proposes that hatred is a characteristic of lower consciousness. Comprehending love as being proportional to ones level of consciousness, Leo suggests that as consciousness increases, so does love and acceptance of oneself and others. In addition, he reassures concerned listeners, explaining that love, as absolute freedom, must include all facets of existence.
</li><li><b>God's love is all-encompassing</b>: According to Leo, God's love is all-encompassing and accepting of all aspects of existence in the universe. He emphasizes the connection between love and absolute freedom, as true freedom involves exploring all aspects of consciousness, both positive and negative. Love stems from infinite intelligence, selflessness, absence of needs and fears, and the ability to express love is linked with courage and acceptance.
</li><li><b>The creation of life</b>: Leo discusses the concept of God and the creation of life. God, as an infinite entity, sought to explore all aspects of its consciousness, giving rise to life and the experiences that it entails. Selflessness, non-judgement, and self-acceptance are identified as key factors in God's creation. Gura challenges the misconception that embodying love requires constant positivity or peace, asserting that acts of violence can also be manifestations of love.
</li><li><b>Expression of Love</b>: Leo argues that love can be expressed in numerous ways and one should not limit it. The ego tends to judge certain expressions of love as not genuine, however, love does not mean allowing oneself to be exploited; enforcing boundaries and standing up to exploitation is also an expression of love. Sometimes violence may be necessary as a last resort. Achieving a balance act between masculine and feminine expressions of love can avoid dysfunction.
</li><li><b>Understanding First-Order and Second-Order Love</b>: Leo Gura explains that to practise love more effectively, one must first comprehend the distinction between first-order and second-order love. First-order love refers to the very essence of existence, consciousness, whereas second-order love pertains to actions and emotions associated with love. 
</li><li><b>Challenging Stereotypes of Love</b>: He advocates for a move beyond the common perception of love as solely kind, gentle, and feminine. He introduces the concept of masculine love, which can include harsh or brutal actions undertaken out of care or concern, such as severing a toxic relationship or confronting a friend regarding their detrimental behavior. 
</li><li><b>The Ubiquity of Love</b>: Gura argues that love is omnipresent, found even in brutal aspects of reality. He uses the example of a scene from the movie "I Am Legend" where the protagonist has to kill his own dog after it is infected by zombies, illustrating the severity of love. He posits that love and reality (or truth) are identical &mdash; both encompass all facets of existence, including the negative ones.
</li><li><b>The Brutality within Infinite Consciousness</b>: At an existential level, consciousness encounters various aspects of itself, some of which are brutal or shocking. This can lead to denial or inability to recognize these aspects as reflections of itself. 
</li><li><b>The Impermanence of All Forms</b>: Consciousness's relentlessly changing and impermanent nature is important in understanding reality, love, and the origin of perceived evil. Attempting to make the impermanent permanent leads to dysfunction and suffering. 
</li><li><b>Real Love is Serious</b>: Real love does not just encompass positive, pleasant aspects but also negative, severe aspects of life. This can be too raw or real for the ego to accept, leading to a preference for a lighter, more idealized version of love. It's the skepticism towards this raw, serious version of love that Gura argues is deluded and untruthful.
</li><li><b>Lion hunting an antelope - love in survival</b>: Lion hunting an antelope, while it seems brutal, is a manifestation of love as such actions allow survival and the continuation of life. The process of hunting and death is a fundamental part of the ecosystem that allows the growth, evolution, and survival of species including humans. Furthermore, humans being omnivorous was necessary for survival and led to the evolution and the development of civilizations before the possibility of alternate food options such as vegan diets.
</li><li><b>Survival  a distortion of love</b>: Humans have developed a conditional form of love that leans towards survival. This survival-centered love manipulates reality for individual satisfaction and survival. The uncompromising nature of reality which doesn't always suit individual needs is misinterpreted as evidence of a godless or indifferent universe. However, in truth, this is a manifestation of love from a higher perspective that takes into account the good of the entire universe, not just an individual or a group.
</li><li><b>Universality of love and good from individual perspectives</b>: According to Leo Gura, everything that happens in the universe serves to maximize love. Therefore, if something occurs and the love in it isn't visible, it implies a need for a broader perspective. Similarly, everyone, based on their viewpoint and life circumstances, is doing good. If someone's actions appear evil, it's because their point of view and motivation aren't understood. Regardless of how twisted their actions might seem, they act from love. However, consciousness can lose itself and become incredibly egotistical despite being fundamentally rooted in love.
</li><li><b>Universal love and survival</b>: In the context of survival, love is an essential driving force. The vital connection between love and survival can be observed in the prerequisite of survival for the existence of life. Everything, including the treasured moments and experiences of life, is underpinned by survival and for life to continue, death is a necessity. To enjoy life, one must acknowledge the role of death in its existence. The lion hunting the antelope for survival, as cruel as it might seem, is an example of the broader universal love driving survival. 
</li><li><b>Evolution and love</b>: The evolution of human civilization from hunting-gathering societies to the potential future societies with plant-based diets or lab-grown meat demonstrates the overarching influence of love in survival and evolution. The transition towards a meat-less society may take hundreds or thousands of years, signifying another evolutionary step driven by love.
</li><li><b>Unconditional love and acceptance of reality</b>: For humans, the hardest task is to embrace love unconditionally and accept reality as it is, in all its imperfection. This is challenging due to the infinite and hence threatening possibilities that such acceptance opens up. However, love is infinite consciousness and is not a subset of reality. It is a complete whole without exceptions. Love, therefore, has counterintuitive manifestations where seemingly non-loving occurrences are in fact, representations of love. The personal ego often distorts and obstructs the vision of love. Understanding survival beyond physical existence is essential for grasping the unexpected manifestations of love.
</li><li><b>Self-centered survival leads to distortion and inability to perceive love</b>: People often dwell in survival mode, leading to a self-centric perception of reality which misjudges the all-encompassing and universal nature of love. The result is a distorted and conditional form of love invented for self-survival and wellbeing. This misinterpretation is often the reason for misjudging the not-so-obvious manifestations of love as hate or evil. To truly experience and recognize love, self-centered survival mechanisms need to be transcended to embrace reality and love in their entirety.
</li><li><b>The integral nature of death in survival and life</b>: The death of one being often paves the way for the survival and continued existence of others, thus reinforcing the cycle of life. Death, therefore, plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of life and is an integral part of the evolutionary process. Embracing this tough truth of reality is a primary step towards recognizing the universality and pervasiveness of love.
</li><li><b>Concept of Love in Challenging Scenarios</b>: Leo discusses the concept of love represented within the cycle of life, examining the brutal example of a lion hunting an antelope. He argues that love is present in both the antelope's will to live and the lion's drive to feed its cubs, an act that also contributes to the evolution and survival of the species. This dynamic shows how love is moving through the entire lifecycle of these animals and, by extension, human beings. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Roles of Tyrants</b>: Tyrants such as Saddam Hussein are believed to have acted out of love from their point of view, echoing the necessity of seeing things from other perspectives to understand love in all situations, including those that may seem cruel or unfair.
</li><li><b>Perspective of Individuals Involved in Imperialism and Military-Industrial Complex</b>: The military-industrial complex, often criticized for its violent outcomes, is also acting out of love when viewed from a different perspective. The employees working within these industries, such as manufacturing components for military purposes, provide for their families with their earnings, showing a personal, intimate form of love. This contrasts with the broader consequences of their work, which might inflict harm on others.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of Love</b>: Leo emphasizes the interconnectedness of all elements of reality, which all manifest love in different ways. Despite the contradictions and layers of complexity, all situations, actions, and outcomes are expressions of love, from the unconditional love in appreciating a beautiful sunset to the survival instincts shown by a lion hunting its prey.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of Reality and Love</b>: Leo Gura explains how everything in reality is interconnected. He uses the example of cancer, stating that while it is seen as a negative consequence, it is tied to activities, actions, and decisions driven by love. He touches upon how people enjoy products and lifestyles that might lead to an increased risk of cancer. However, these factors contribute to a better life, comfort, and survival, indicating that these choices are driven by love.
</li><li><b>Love and Creation of Harmful Technology/Products</b>: Leo illustrates that the freedom to invent and create new technologies and products is a form of love from God. Despite that, some of these creations might lead to harmful consequences such as cancer. These creations stem from the desire to improve life, cater to convenience, and meet survival needs. While people love these comforts created by humans, the adverse effects are an outgrowth of the freedom given.
</li><li><b>Cellular Mechanism and Cancer</b>: Discussing the occurrence of cancer at a cellular level, Leo maintains that these cells' mechanism is necessary for human existence. He explains that while these cellular mechanisms are prone to errors leading to conditions like cancer, the larger picture is the existence and lives made possible because of these cells. Even accidental cancer, where no lifestyle or external factors contribute to its occurrence, is part of the limitations of these cellular mechanisms. 
</li><li><b>Human Testing and Animal Sacrifice</b>: Touching upon the controversial topic of animal testing, Leo describes how testing drugs, chemicals, and products on animals, though seemingly cruel, leads to potentially life-saving discoveries. He argues that a few animal lives sacrificed for developing medical solutions can help save and improve countless human lives in the long run. The act of animal testing, in this perspective, is seen as a display of love.
</li><li><b>Burning of the Amazon</b>: Another controversial topic brought up by Leo is the burning of the Amazon forest. Destroying these forests for creating farmlands and cattle grazing lands is driven by struggling farmers' need to provide for their families. This activity, while harmful to the environment, is also an act driven by love, as it shows the farmers' desire to care for their families.
</li><li><b>The complexity and selfishness in human actions</b>: This section discusses the complexities involved in human behavior and actions, saying that actions are driven by each individual's level of consciousness and their capacity to love in their own limited way. 
</li><li>- Leo highlights various human actions, such as farmers clearing land by burning forests and people cheating in relationships, as necessary manifestations of love based on individuals' circumstances and levels of consciousness.
</li><li>- Leo also stresses that certain negative behaviors are products of complex contributing factors, like history, environment, and mental health. Understanding these factors is key to understanding why these events happen or have happened, though it doesnt justify these actions being continued in the future.
</li><li>- This all ties back to the idea of survival, which Leo describes as a dirty business that also enables existence and everything humans perceive as love. In sum, Leo suggests that the complexity of consciousness conceals the simplicity of love.
</li><li><b>Preconceived ideas about love and survival</b>: Humanity often demonizes those who teach love and truth because these teachings threaten our survival. Leo also suggests that individuals' preoccupation with safety and personal gain prevents them from understanding the underlying love behind actions that don't serve their purpose.
</li><li><b>Brutality and love</b>: Leo illustrates the connection between brutality and love throughout human history. He asserts that love is not a flaky or soft concept, suggesting that cynicism towards love is what is deluded and untruthful.
</li><li><b>Perspective on 'evil' actions</b>: Leo discusses that what most of us deem as 'evil' actions could be seen as manifestations of love when contemplating their historical and sociological context. He mentions acts of domestic violence, infidelity, and deforestation as examples, emphasizing that none of these actions should continue in the future, but rather we should understand how they occurred based on past circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Self-interests and love</b>: Lastly, Leo ponders about how the human ego is worried about one's safety, doesn't care about truth, and only wants its own way, which we often deludedly call love. However, he states that true love exists outside of what solely serves us and our ego.
</li><li><b>Concept of Love and Survival</b>: Surviving forms the foundation of existence and life; it enables human life, happiness, and many other things. However, Leo Gura points out that survival and love are interconnected and must not contradict each other. Teaching love and truth as absolutes can threaten human survival, as it challenges the deeply ingrained drive to fight for survival at all costs. The challenge lies in reconciling survival with love and even negatively perceived concepts such as devilry with love. 
</li><li><b>Misunderstandings about Love</b>: When people think of love, they often imagine a sentimental, emotional experience. However, Leo argues that true love is far from this depiction. It is more profound and serious, encompassing even the negative aspects of life such as cancer, genocide, rape, to name a few. Materialists usually deny this deeper understanding of love, as they tend to hold survival and self-interest above all else, leading to a distorted perception of love.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Consciousness and Selflessness</b>: Leo suggests that people resist the deeper meaning of love as it would demand real growth and change from them. The selfish survival instinct is so deeply rooted that the idea of becoming selfless appears threatening. He argues that real growth involves moving beyond survival-centered mindset and manifesting love in all aspects of life, including what we think of as negative or evil like hatred. 
</li><li><b>God's Love and Consciousness</b>: Leo describes God's love as infinite and all-accepting, resulting from infinite self-acceptance and self-love. He maintains that God does not hate any aspect of itself or its creation but instead grants absolute freedom, which permits the existence of evil. This concept is thought-provoking and demanding, as it requires us to transcend our finite point of view and see everything, including hate and evil, as facets of God's infinite love.
</li><li><b>Transcending Practicality</b>: Leo conveys that the pursuit of truth and love transcends practicality, which is essentially survival-focused. By grounding oneself in survival alone, one tends to deny and demonize love, causing confusion and dissatisfaction. He encourages people to explore the truths about love and the universe that exist beyond daily survival.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of practicality and the consequential dissatisfaction</b>: Focusing on practicality leads to constant dissatisfaction as it engenders self-interest and keeps one focused on future improvement. This approach lacks peace and grounding. Leo suggests transcending practicality to understand truth and love, providing an escape from the destructive cycle of the rat-race and leading to true peace and joy.
</li><li><b>Finite understanding vs infinite love</b>: Finite beings, such as humans, struggle to understand and appreciate infinite love due to their limited identities. Attempts to comprehend infinite love often result in demonization of it, equating it with evil. Finding peace requires expanding oneself to infinity, rather than trying to confine infinity to human level.
</li><li><b>Experience of infinite love</b>: The experience of infinite love bursts the limitations of human identity, an experience often feared and termed as 'death'. Leo asserts that our struggle with practicality and dissatisfaction stems from running away from this realization, calling it evil and rejecting God's love.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of love and consciousness</b>: Unconditional love and infinite consciousness are interconnected, with each condition requiring the other for existence. In the presence of infinite intelligence, selflessness, absence of needs and fears, love becomes the only worthwhile experience.
</li><li><b>Comprehending God's love</b>: God's love is the acceptance of all aspects of existence exactly as they are. It is the realization of being a part of a perfect universe. The problems and dysfunction arise when we try to force change rather than surrendering to the acceptance of the universe as it is.
</li><li><b>Courage to explore all possibilities of consciousness</b>: The exploration of infinite possibilities and all facets of consciousness, including the negatives ones, requires enormous courage. This exploration, driven purely by desire, is what leads to the creation of life.
</li><li><b>Understanding the selflessness of God</b>: God's selflessness has enabled the existence of all aspects of life, and even negative tendencies like selfishness. Selfishness is a manifestation of God's infinite exploration of consciousness. Furthermore, human existence is an expression of God's selfless imagining of various possibilities.
</li><li><b>Human discussion as a manifestation of God's consciousness</b>: The very exchange between humans, including this discussion between Leo and the audience, is a manifestation of God's imagination, reflecting God's desire to explore all possible aspects of consciousness. This imagining and actualization of discussions serves as an illustration of the omnipresence of God's love.
</li><li><b>Distinction Between Good and Bad Actions in the Context of Love</b>: One's actions being good or bad is determined by their level of consciousness and their ability to surrender personal fears and needs. 
</li><li><b>Love and Violence</b>: A common misconception is that love prohibits anything violent. Subverting this perception, love should also encompass violence, and individuals should learn to view violence as a manifestation of love. This does not imply endorsing violence but accepting it as part of reality.
</li><li><b>Expression of Love</b>: There is no certain prescribed manner in which one has to express love. Love can be embodied and expressed in any form, sometimes even in a ruthless manner involving difficult decisions. Leo emphasizes that experiencing a wide range of emotions is a part of love, and one should not limit love to certain expressions or behaviors.
</li><li><b>Importance of Selflessness in Love</b>: It takes complete selflessness to accept the unlimited forms of love. Ego often limits the scope of love by distinguishing certain expressions as not real love.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Boundaries</b>: Love doesn't involve being submissive or being taken advantage of. Being able to enforce one's boundaries and standing up against exploitation is an important aspect of expressing love.
</li><li><b>Balance between Feminine and Masculine Dimensions of Love</b>: Females learning the 'masculine' assertive aspect of love and males understanding the 'feminine' nurturing dimension helps maintain balance and avoid dysfunction.
</li><li><b>Seeing Horrors as Opportunity</b>: Accepting horrifying experiences as manifestations of love helps in strengthening love and understanding its depth. 
</li><li><b>Taking Assignments on Love</b>: Leo suggests an exercise to contemplate and write about how various horrible incidents are examples of love, thereby helping individuals widen their understanding of love. 
</li><li><b>Seeing Love in all Teachings</b>: All teachings, even those not explicitly mentioning love, are ultimately about helping people actualize love. 
</li><li><b>Conscious Acceptance of Love</b>: Awakening experiences help individuals become consciously aware of love and its existential nature. 
</li><li><b>Moving Beyond Rational to Emotional</b>: Awakening should not be seen as a cold, emotionless state. It should make individuals softer, more human, emotional, and caring. It serves to unify the 'masculine' Zen or rational approach with a 'feminine', heart-centered Christian approach.
