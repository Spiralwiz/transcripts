[Music] have you ever wondered why is there something rather
than nothing this is the ultimate question if you could
answer this question and that's a big if you would
have the answer to all of existence making this question
rather important the problem is that philosophers and theologians and
scientists have been asking this question for thousands of years
and probably even long before that since humans first walked
on the earth and could think and could formulate questions
at all we probably started asking this question but the
challenge is that we have thousands of years of philosophy
recorded in the history books and so forth but no
clear consensus as to what the answer is and in
fact most of us today if you talk to a
scientist or even a philosopher today or a theologian or
just a normal guy off the street you ask him
this question what's he going to tell you he's going
to tell you it's impossible to know nobody knows and
nobody could know and it's not worth your time to
even think about it anymore because hey if it could
be known we would know it by now right at
least that's what most people assume well i'm here to
break some amazing news to you it's actually possible to
answer this question clearly precisely definitively once and for all
not as a belief not as an ideology not as
speculation not as theory but the actual answer but the
trick as you might expect is that the answer is
so profound that it's gonna stretch the capabilities of your
mind to understand it so that's where we're gonna have
to go kind of slow and kind of work through
it here and then you're also gonna have to do
some additional work on your own beyond just watching this
recording to really understand what i'm talking about but i
can guide you towards this answer i've derived at it
myself not as a belief but as something you can
become directly conscious of and it's it's a hell of
an answer it's really worth understanding so how come there's
something rather than nothing before i give you the answer
we first need to appreciate the significance of this question
see a lot of people they'll just ask these sorts
of questions very willy-nilly without appreciating the gravity and significance
and the the scope the enormity the profundity of the
question and the accompanying answer so what's important when you're
contemplating reality in general and there's lots of different aspects
of reality that you could contemplate when you contemplate reality
it's important that your mind gets what i call traction
with the problem or with the question at hand because
you can ask questions just kind of like flippantly without
being serious about it and then you can ask questions
in such a way where your mind is really on
track with it so let's let's get your mind there
right now so what i want you to do is
i want you to take your awareness and your consciousness
and to turn it inwards towards yourself because usually it's
oriented outwards so take that consciousness inwards so kind of
focus it inside your skull into your eyes into your
head into your deepest sense of self do this along
with me when you do that then i want you
to just focus your consciousness on the fact that anything
at all exists that you exist that this room that
you're sitting in exists that this body here exists that
noises and sounds exist that colors exist i mean this
is clearly what is happening in your experience is that
you have these things so just focus your consciousness on
the fact that anything exists at all and just try
to wonder it how amazing and mysterious that is it
might help you to look at your hands it helps
me when i'm doing this exercise to look at my
hands and to just wonder how come these hands are
here how come they exist how is it possible that
anything exists at all are you doing this can you
feel when you do this can you feel that sense
of like wonder and awe and mystery at the fact
that your hand exists right here how is that possible
why is there a hand why is it not a
tentacle why is it not some claw why is it
not nothingness connect with that deep sense of wonder this
is crucial this is what i mean by your mind
gaining traction with the question and also your mind has
to be open here so be careful about your mind
quickly supplying you with some sort of pre-made narrative that
you got from society or from your culture whether it's
from religion or from science or from your parents or
from some videos you watched on youtube or whatever see
the mind will tend to come in and quickly the
mind will want to dispel the mystery and the wonder
it'll want to kind of plug that empty hole with
some sort of narrative like it'll want to say something
well this hand is here because my mom and my
dad got together 30 years ago they had sex there
was a sperm and egg they met that turned into
a zygote that the cells multiplied then that turned into
a little baby and then that grew up and then
30 years later here i am and here's the hand
so you could explain it like that or your mind
could explain it some other way such as like well
there was the big bang the big bang was just
like a bunch of molecules and they formed and then
those molecules they were swirling around in gas clouds those
those congealed into stars and then more gas clouds congealed
into planets and then one of those was the earth
and then billions of years of evolution passed and there
was fish and then there was amphibians and there was
lizards then they crawled up into land and then they
turned into mammals and there were dinosaurs and then the
dinosaurs were killed by some asteroid and then uh the
mammals rose up and then there were primates and then
those primates turned into chimpanzees and we were off shoot
off those and then came humans and here i am
you could explain it like that or if you're a
religious person you could say well god created it all
something like that some kind of story like that so
you have to resist all those narratives you have to
throw all those away and you have to kind of
start from scratch and just start with what's actually here
in your direct experience in your direct experience there is
no evolution there is no big bang there is no
uh god there is no what reptiles who who turned
into humans there is no chimpanzees there's only this only
what's here so let's just work with that so that
opens up your mind now you're connected with the question
now we can do this with our mind we can
conceive of a universe in which there would be nothing
at all so imagine reality that was completely nothing absolute
nothing there was no planets no animals no plants no
molecules no gas clouds nothing at all just total blank
when we imagine this it makes us wonder because we
think like well that seems to be what reality ought
to be right because like where did all this stuff
come from wouldn't it be simpler if reality was just
absolutely nothing that would be so simple right then there
would be nothing to wonder about and nothing to explain
in a sense what we have to explain all all
this weird complex ordered stuff if you haven't noticed reality
is very very complex it's filled with very specific ordered
things everything is ordered so intricately within reality have you
noticed this that requires a sort of explanation why is
the order that way not some other way why is
this a hand not a claw or something we have
to explain that but if it was absolutely nothing it
would require no explanation and you would think like that
would be the simplest solution as a scientist you might
say that's real that's what reality really like ought to
be is just pure absolute nothing that would be like
the ultimate answer right because if that was what reality
was then there wouldn't even be us to wonder about
what reality is it would be so nothing there wouldn't
even be one who is wondering about what it is
and then in a certain sense that that very nicely
ties all the loose ends together such that there aren't
even loose ends because there's nothing so there's not even
loose ends to tie up that's how elegant that solution
is right but we have a problem even though that
seems to be like the most efficient way for reality
to be can you see how that sort of like
a if we think of it as a scientist you
know scientists like to think in terms of like uh
maximization of energy efficiency uh it seems to create all
of this to create planets and stars and all this
you need so much energy where's this energy coming from
why is why is this energy arising in the first
place wouldn't it just be simpler to have nothing and
if we had this nothing it would be perfectly symmetrical
it would be perfectly even everywhere it would just be
pure nothing forever we wouldn't need to answer quite tricky
questions about time travel about space about the curvature of
space about different dimensions about a bunch of different quarks
and particles and strings and all this complex stuff like
we would just simplify everything so much if it was
absolutely nothing but of course the problem is is that
it's not at least not in the way we can
mentally think of it in the way we think of
it it's something there's all this something that's going on
so why this and not that but here's the trick
how do you know how to distinguish between something and
nothing how do you know that your mind's ability to
make that distinction is itself something you can rely on
something that's valid something that's objectively true and not merely
something that's perspectival or relativistic uh-huh see that now we're
getting to the rub what if the difference between something
and nothing was actually relativistic something that you were projecting
on to reality and not something fundamental to reality itself
what if reality itself didn't know the difference between something
and nothing and what if what if this current state
that we're in that we call something is actually more
energy efficient it's lower in energy than absolute nothing how
could that be well consider if we have absolute nothing
what would keep absolute nothing from spontaneously spawning into something
what would prevent it nothing there is nothing preventing nothing
from turning into something so while it seems that absolute
nothing is the most energy efficient state it's perfectly symmetrical
actually it's not symmetrical because to have absolute emptiness without
any form without somethingness that you can see is an
asymmetry it's a bias in a sense what you're doing
is you're kind of saying that you know we're pushing
reality to be just this way but not this way
so see what would be pushing reality to be one
way rather than another way that's the whole trick here
is to start to understand this that there is nothing
holding reality back from being any particular way so in
a sense we could think of it like this if
reality was absolute blank nothing since there's nothing stopping nothing
from turning into something nothing becomes something but since there's
no time yet because time is something and this is
happening in nothing there's no time there's no space there's
no nothing so because those are all some things space
time these are some things so if there is nothing
to begin with and then there's nothing holding back nothing
it spawns into something generating everything that we know of
and that this happens instantaneously it's not a process that
happens through time or through space this happens instantaneously so
much so that there's literally no distinction between nothing and
something such that as i'm sitting here speaking to you
right now and you are sitting there listening to me
actually all of this that's been happening here in this
recording and happening right now is literally nothing so nothing
is precisely what exists but nothing is not as you've
imagined some pure blankness nothing and something because they're indistinguishable
because the distinction between them is relativistic and purely a
projection of your mind actually they unify into a singularity
such that this is nothing and so your entire life
and the entire physical universe in a sense we could
say never even happened it's nothing it's nowhere it's no
win and it's know-how and that explains the whole universe
it's a perfect symmetry you see because if it was
purely something that would be an asymmetry if it was
purely nothing that would also be an asymmetry if it
was any particular way it would be an asymmetry and
it would be some bias that we have to explain
somehow we would have to come up with an explanation
for well why would the universe be this way and
not that way why that way and not this way
well the answer is that it's always possible superimposed into
each other into an infinite singularity so what everything is
is just infinity but infinity is identical to nothing because
something is nothing because if you take a circle of
a certain diameter and you shrink this circle to zero
diameter zero diameter circle so what happens can you imagine
what happens if we take a circle and we start
to shrink it shrink it shrink or drink it until
it turns to zero diameter at that exact moment when
the diameter becomes perfectly zero can you see how there's
an inflection point where the circle in instantly inflates and
becomes identical to a circle of infinite diameter so actually
there's no difference between a circle of infinite diameter and
zero diameter which is why zero and infinity are identical
so yeah it's twisted it twists your mind the problem
is that our mind is wired to think in dualities
and one of the most fundamental dualities we have is
that of nothing and something but the nature of reality
is such that everything is non-dual and all dualities ultimately
collapse have you wondered for example what the boundary is
between nothing and something what is that boundary made out
of so in reality let's say this is reality right
here right we have something like this and then we
can imagine nothing like maybe you imagine outside the universe
there's nothing if we go to the edge of the
universe there's nothing you might imagine but what would the
boundary between the something of the universe and the nothing
outside the universe what would that boundary made out of
would that boundary be made out of something or nothing
you see when you really think this through you realize
there can't be a boundary because all boundaries themselves are
nothing and that there's no difference between something and nothing
and when that boundary collapses you could say that well
that means the universe extends out forever there's no nothing
out there but the converse is also true it means
that the the nothingness extends forever so the universe could
extend forever in that way the something that's extends forever
let's say in that way from the center from the
center it radiates outward but you could also say that
the nothingness radiates inward from the outside see so what
that means is that the nothingness that we're supposedly thinking
the universe exists inside of isn't actually something that the
universe came out of but something that the universe actually
is so what i'm saying here is not merely that
like some scientists say that the big bang came out
of nothing and there are some reputable scientists who make
these claims i think stephen hawking was one of them
i read in one of his books where he talked
about how you know it would be very elegant if
the universe came out of nothing because that would sort
of like neatly tie tie up all the questions but
that's still not quite right what i'm saying here is
not that the universe came from nothing what i'm saying
is that the universe is nothing has always been nothing
and will always be nothing because something and nothing are
completely indistinguishable and that the only distinction we're making between
the two is simply a function of our own mind
projecting that out onto the world so what this means
is is that everything that's happening right now in this
moment i'm sitting here talking you're sitting there listening to
me this all of this even though we've conventionally called
this something actually it's it's nothing it's as though it's
not even happening even though of course it feels as
though it's happening so to really understand this you have
to you have to think so fundamentally here so existentially
here that you have to realize that when you were
born as a child or at least you imagine you
were um think back to how did your concepts of
something in nothing originate where do those come from how
did you learn to distinguish between something and nothing what
if what if those concepts themselves are what is flawed
in your worldview see in a sense your whole worldview
hinges upon this these very fundamental distinctions you made as
a little child to make sense of the world but
who told you what nothing is and who told you
what something is how did you define those terms huh
think about this like really think about this get some
traction on this with your mind what if everything you
pointed to and called something and your parents did this
for you you know your mom pointed a ball and
she says that's something and then she points at a
dog and she says that's something and then she points
to something else and she says that's nothing like maybe
she points at a at an empty space and says
that's nothing and then your mind sort of creates this
distinction between some things and nothings but what if when
your mom pointed at a ball and told you that
that's something and when your mom pointed at a dog
and told you that's something what if she was wrong
and you were wrong for believing her and actually that
entire time she was pointing at nothing but you mistook
that nothing for something can you sort of undo this
this move that your mind made when you were a
child go back undo that and now look at this
room that you're sitting in i want you to look
around it and i want you to realize that everything
you see around you is precisely what nothing looks like
this is the crucial mistake that every philosopher theologian and
scientist has made for thousands of years it's such a
simple yet such a profound mistake is that they assumed
all of them assumed and you assumed that what nothing
is is a blank black hole or void when i
say nothing your mind thinks of some black hole but
that's not nothing first of all that's something a black
hole is something blackness is something a void is still
something how would you even think of true nothing actual
nothing actual nothing can't be thought of because if you
think of it that's something see but anyways the mistake
is that you're trying to imagine this nothing as something
different than what is right here right now which you
have called something that's the mistake and the resolution to
this whole challenge is the is just the realization that
this right here is nothing so look at your hands
and realize that they're nothing look at my face look
at my body hear my voice hear the sounds in
your room maybe the air conditioning is blowing maybe some
birds are chirping maybe sunlight is shining through the windows
or maybe it's dark outside you're looking through the window
you're seeing some tree or whatever some mods circling around
a light whatever you're seeing all of that recognize it
as nothing notice how your mind has been tricking you
your entire life you've been calling all of this something
this entire time when it was really nothing this is
what nothing looks like this is actual nothing not some
imaginary nothing actual nothing actual nothing has colors actual nothing
talks actual nothing hears actual nothing is a bird flying
through the air chirping actual nothing is pain in your
leg that's been bothering you actual nothing is a toothache
actual nothing is your partner rejecting you actual nothing is
your parents abusing you when you were a child actual
nothing is what you see on tv as you're flipping
through every channel actual nothing is every book that you
flip through and read that's actual nothing it's indistinguishable from
something this is not really something you can think about
and understand this is not something you can believe or
take on as an ideology this is something you have
to become directly conscious of there will be a there
will be a shift a a significant shift in your
current experience of reality when you realize that something in
nothing are identical your jaw will drop if you really
understand what i'm saying here this is a utterly radical
realization this is not just something oh yeah there's some
cool philosophy but let's let's move on to the next
video no this this this this will stop your life
dead in its tracks if you ever realize what i'm
saying here i distinctly remember the first time when i
became fully conscious that everything is nothing i was on
a meditation retreat in hawaii in a cabin in the
jungle i was sitting there late at night meditating and
looking out um looking out the window and uh and
i i yeah i just i distinctly remember the moment
where i realized i looked out the window i saw
the entire jungle as i was kind of like looking
out um and i saw the room that i was
in kind of like looking through the room through the
window out into the jungle and i just realized that
the entire thing was just nothing as though none of
it had ever had ever happened that's what the zen
masters call mu mu the realization of mu nothingness see
you still might think that sort of a black void
is a simpler more energy efficient state for reality to
be in than this state right here that's actually not
the case because something would have to just maintain that
pure black void forever something would have to restrain it
or hold it back and actually what reality is is
it's purely unbiased and unrestricted unlimited consciousness so you're conscious
right now that's what reality is made of the substance
of reality is consciousness consciousness is nothing um and the
trick to understand there is that if consciousness is allowed
to be completely unlimited and unrestricted it can't just be
purely formless because if it was purely formless that would
be a negation of form which would actually be an
asymmetry within consciousness so for consciousness to truly be unlimited
it simultaneously has to limit itself and go from formless
into form such that there is no distinction between form
and formlessness such that the whole thing you can think
of the entire universe as just a singularity made up
of both formlessness and form all superimposed into each other
at once completely unlimited which includes this present moment that
you're sitting here and experiencing right now you think it's
something you think it came from somewhere you think it's
happening somewhere in during some time some place in space
somehow through some method all of this is an illusion
in fact the present moment and the entire universe and
all of reality is nothing no win nowhere and no
how and this is why science and the human mind
and human intellect and rationality and logic struggle so much
to answer metaphysical questions such as why is there something
rather than nothing because the analytical mind only works based
upon certain premises and certain assumptions and certain fundamental distinctions
like the distinction between something in nothing the distinction between
something existing and non-existing the distinction between something being logical
and illogical all these distinctions but all of these are
biases within consciousness reality can only exist precisely because it's
perfectly symmetrical such that it cancels itself out there by
tying up every loose end such that there's nothing left
to explain because it's it's it's completely self-contained it's singular
it's one it can have no boundary it's just an
infinite singularity of everything superimposed on top of itself into
a perfect unity a perfect symmetry and this is once
you understand this you realize that this is the most
energy efficient state and that this is the only state
that reality could be in and this is the only
way that anything could exist at all is if it's
part of this singular uh unified super symmetry where everything
perfectly cancels itself out such that we could say that
none of it even exists are you getting this i
have a demonstration for you to illustrate this point so
here we have a glass and then we here we
have a second glass so how many empty glasses am
i holding up of course it's a trick question i'm
holding up two empty glasses but how could they both
be empty when this one seems full this one is
obviously empty but can you see that the way that
we define what full is is actually an incomplete definition
because if you look at this glass yes it's we
could say it's full but what does it really mean
to say that this glass is full when we truly
understand fullness fullness is such that it must include emptiness
within it so obviously this full glass just because it
has water in it can you see how it still
has the empty glass inside of it it's like there
you can sort of just picture it with your mind's
eye so when we really say full we can sort
of have two definitions of full we can have a
relativistic definition of full which is full like this like
the conventional sense of full which is opposite of empty
this is sort of a duality or we can have
a more holistic understanding and definition of the word full
this would be fullness with a capital f this would
be fullness as an absolute this is a fullness which
includes and encompasses the emptiness within it as well see
so when when you're able to see this glass as
empty only then have you understood what fullness truly means
because how can something be truly full if it excludes
the empty you see how that duality must collapse it
must go full circle likewise try to apply that to
your present experience what i'm talking about here is not
just some abstract philosophy or theory i'm talking about your
direct experience i want you to look for the first
time in your life at this present moment that's happening
right now and to realize that it's completely empty you've
been looking at it as though it was that full
conventionally full glass and now what i'm asking you to
do is i'm asking you to look at this glass
i'm asking you to look at this present moment and
to to realize a higher order of fullness of fullness
which is so full that it goes full circle and
it recognizes the emptiness that permeates through this entire experience
and this glass so even though this glass looks like
somethingness actually it's nothingness even though this glass looks like
form actually it's also formless at the same time you
see the problem is that the human mind is very
biased towards survival it has to be otherwise it couldn't
exist for your mind to be here thinking about this
stuff it had to worry about survival its whole life
otherwise it would be dead so your mind is very
biased towards form to the exclusion of formlessness your mind
benefits materially from form because all material benefit is of
the formed variety money sex power pleasure these are all
forms what good is formlessness to you formlessness is not
pleasurable you can't use it to to buy a vacation
you can't use it to have sex you can't use
it to live in it like a nice luxury house
what can you do with formlessness seems like nothing so
you might wonder well what's the use then what's the
point why should we care about formlessness exactly which is
why most people don't care about formlessness but the cost
you pay for thinking that way is now you're stuck
in the domain of form and you're only understanding half
of reality because form is only half of reality the
other the other half is formlessness and even though i'm
talking about them as though they're two things actually they're
they're perfectly identical so it's not like there's a world
of formlessness that you're missing out there no the world
of formlessness is precisely the world of form it's right
here but you're just missing that way of seeing reality
you're only seeing form for its form but you're missing
its formlessness and therefore in your mind you've created this
sort of split where there's the world of form here
and in the world of formlessness is some abstract philosophical
thing that maybe you could reach after thousands of hours
of enlightenment work and meditation and whatever else you think
the world the foremost is somewhere else to reach it's
precisely here you're not going to reach it elsewhere you're
going to only find it here because it's identical where
formlessness is hiding is directly under the form in the
same way that with this glass where is the empty
glass hiding why can't you see the empty glass precisely
because it's inside the full glass it's obscured because it's
identical to it right underneath it in a sense you're
standing on top of the rug that you need to
pull out from under yourself see it goes in a
circle when you understand this everything is perfectly explained there
are no more questions about the nature of reality because
you realize it's nothing you realize that it didn't come
from anywhere because nothing has always been nothing it's eternally
nothing and it will always be nothing it can't come
from somewhere else because there's nowhere to come from since
it's singular it exists only in one place which is
nowhere and it exists outside of time and there's not
even a process or method by which it comes into
existence because uh all processes and methods are again dualities
that need to be collapsed and so in this way
it's possible for you with direct consciousness to become perfectly
aware of the origin and nature of all of reality
and your own self and that's a pretty cool possibility
see most people don't think this is possible but it
is you're gonna have to work at it it's not
gonna be enough for you just to listen to me
here you're gonna have to really work at it to
realize this one day but this is a good place
to get you started and i think the most important
thing i want to just have you take away here
is just the fact that these sorts of questions of
like why is there something rather than nothing these are
not purely philosophical questions that are impractical and have no
answers they seem that way which is why most people
don't pursue them seriously and they never discover the amazing
answers that can be arrived at if you pursue this
stuff seriously how do you know that what i'm telling
you is true not by believing me for all you
know i could be lying i could be deluded i
could be a cult leader whatever the only way you'll
know if what i'm telling you is true is by
actually doing these exercises and by becoming directly conscious of
it for yourself and i hope one day you do
your jaw will drop now you might wonder leo if
all this is nothing what about other stuff you've talked
about like consciousness and love and truth and god where
are these things well all these things are identical nothing
is consciousness nothing is truth nothing is love nothing is
god and nothing is you all those things are identical
it will probably take you multiple awakenings and profound realizations
and epiphanies in order to connect all and equate all
of those different terms together so maybe one time you
have an awakening into the nature of this present moment
as being nothing that's great but that still won't be
the end of it then you'll need to have another
awakening to realize that consciousness is nothing then you'll need
to have another awakening to realize that love is identical
to nothing then you need to have another realization to
realize that god is identical to nothing and then maybe
you need to have another realization to realize that you
are identical to god and to love and to consciousness
and to nothing and so the full awakening is when
you when you equate all those terms together and then
it becomes your living reality it's not just something that
you're thinking about but it's something like literally i've had
moments where i'm walking down the street for a stroll
through the park looking at a tree as i'm walking
by the tree i'm conscious that this tree is nothing
it feels like like walking through a hologram almost when
this happens it almost becomes as though all of reality
becomes a hologram it has this hollow quality to it
this is what the buddhists call emptiness reality is fundamentally
empty it feels hollow so right now you might you
know as a conventional human you might look at a
wall a brick wall you might look at a car
you might look at a tree you might look at
you know you might tap something hard like a wood
table you might tap a wood table and all of
it feels so solid it feels so real but when
you truly realize that it's all nothing it becomes like
a like a wispy hologram like an immaterial virtual reality
it's almost like you're walking through a virtual reality like
a video game you know in a video game the
walls aren't real but they still behave as though they
are real walls a hologram seems real but actually it's
it's sort of just empty it's just a pure illusion
and so that's what we mean when we say reality
is an illusion it's an illusion in the sense that
yes there's all this stuff happening here there's all this
experience but the nature of what experience is is just
nothingness rendering the entire thing just like a hologram or
a virtual reality but one that is not run inside
of a computer so it's not the same as simulation
theory and also spirit so the reason we call it
spirituality is because when you become conscious and you awaken
to the fact that everything is nothing you realize that
every material thing that you used to think of as
a physical object that science told you was a physical
object all of that becomes recontextualized see my earlier episode
called understanding recontextualization where i explain what that term means
your entire experience becomes recontextualized such that you see all
that physical material stuff as actually just being pure spirit
or in other words mind mind with capital m so
right now as i'm sitting here talking to you and
you're sitting there listening to me all of this is
happening inside your own mind the walls and roof of
your house and the floor that you're sitting on and
the earth that is supporting you is just a figment
of your own mind but since there's nothing but your
own mind and since the mind is infinite it's not
a problem that it's all mind because there's no alternative
to mind see so when you have an infinite illusion
there's no way to distinguish the illusion from reality such
that now you think it's real you're lost in the
reality of your own illusion and since the illusion is
total it's absolutely total there's no way to tell that
it's an illusion other than through a massive instantaneous awakening
in which you realize the entire thing and the entire
thing gets recontextualized as the illusion that it is completely
hollow and empty because it's nothing nowhere no when no
how and that's reality in a nutshell all right i'm
done here please click that like button for me and

um and check out my life purpose course if you
want to figure out how to get your life on
track in a more practical way just be beyond just
the philosophy and the the metaphysical stuff that i like
to talk about that's the life purpose course all right
that's it i'm out of here the last thing i'll
tell you is that be careful a lot of people
will naysay you on metaphysical questions and they will tell
you like oh you can't possibly know that oh that's
a waste of time oh that's just philosophy oh it's
just abstraction oh it's not practical beware of these people
these might be your parents your teachers your friends your
colleagues people in the comments section scientists doctors philosophers theologians
it actually is possible to answer deep metaphysical questions and
not only is it possible it's absolutely essential in order
to find happiness and peace in life the reason that
most people are dissatisfied in their lives is precisely because
they take a highly utilitarian pragmatic survival oriented approach to
life where the only things they value is that which
is tangible material and immediately gives them some sort of
pleasure or immediately give some sort of material tangible payoff
that's mostly what people value and it's this sort of
myopic short-sighted overly utilitarian approach to life which leads to
great dissatisfaction because the truth is is that all this
material stuff is actually a illusion you're never going to
find satisfaction that way to find satisfaction you need to
you need to ask deep penetrating metaphysical and epistemic questions
and you need to work at it for years to
penetrate through to the essence of what you are life
is love is the universe is consciousness is this is
how you master life and how you get satisfaction you
don't get satisfaction from chasing material things but it takes
a lot of wisdom and maturity and vision to be
able to see that most people they need to spend
a good 10 20 30 years of their life chasing
material pleasures and by the way when i talk about
material pleasures i include in that all of science see
so see the scientists think that oh well we're not
chasing material pleasures we're we're discovering deep truths of the
universe no you're still chasing material pleasures of your own
mind so when a physicist is sitting there you know
working on some advanced astrophysics problem he's still chasing material
pleasure the material pleasure of figuring out how some particles
work or whatever that's still a material pleasure that's still
a limited finite sort of knowledge and understanding there's used
to it i'm not saying you shouldn't do that it
can be useful but again just because something is useful
doesn't mean at least a deep satisfaction it doesn't mean
that it leads to any ultimate answers about the nature
of reality so see most people are stuck chasing their
tail in materialism and then they wonder why they're not
satisfied with life because you're missing the very essence of
life the spiritual essence of life and spirit is nothing
so when are you going to realize that when are
you going to realize that life is nothing and see
contrary to this being some bleak depressing nihilistic problematic realization
actually it's wonderful it's a huge relief to realize that
life is nothing and that reality is nothing because it's
a sense of completion it's a sense of relief it's
a sudden there's it comes with a sense of surrender
and acceptance uh and then what can really flow forth
after that realization is love because love is nothing now
you wonder leo how could love be nothing love is
not nothing well that's the topic for another day i
have discussed the nature of love in other episodes check
out my episode what is love part one and what
is love part two where i explain love in a
lot more detail love is a very tricky and counter-intuitive
and paradoxical thing it's not just a human emotion the
way that most people think love has an existential component
to it and love is very the very fabric of
reality so the beauty of realizing that life is nothing
you're not going to turn into some sort of frederick
nietzsche uh nihilist and you're not gonna turn into some
sort of you know uh sartre-esque uh existentialist who's always
brooding and depressed and this sort of [ __ ]
it's not going to be that those people didn't realize
that life was nothing they were playing mind games to
truly realize that life is nothing is a huge relief
it's a spiritual epiphany this is a spiritual epiphany you're
discovering god this is not some sort of bleak materialistic
realization where you're sitting there doing some calculations on some
napkin and then you realize one day like einstein or
something and then you realize like oh reality is nothing
and it's like oh that's so depressing i want to
kill myself no no no you realize it's nothing but
then you realize nothing is love and then you realize
like oh my god infinity is nothing infinity is god
and god is what i am and that blows your
mind so much it blows your whole heart open and
then you become a fountain of love because love is
just infinity it's an endless creative outpouring of form which
is always held within a larger meta unity that's true
love and that's what reality is that's what god is
that's what you are and then from this place you
can live a great life you can be detached you
can be easy going you can laugh you can be
playful you can be light-hearted you don't need to be
afraid anymore you don't need to be terrified of death
you don't need to worry about bad stuff happening to
you you don't need to be worried about enemies out
there who are doing bad stuff to you because it's
all nothing see all those problems are negated when you
realize the nothingness the hollowness of life and of course
because that goes full circle the emptiness which you think
is just depression that depression lifts and it turns into
just uh joy joy and bliss and that's the whole
point of the spiritual path is to realize this nothingness
and then to bask in it as bliss and love
see it goes full circle you surrender chasing pleasures of
the material realm in order to discover the higher pleasures
the divine sublime pleasures of the spiritual realm which is
just purely nothing and that's what bliss is bliss is
just blissing out on nothingness so don't let people fool
you into thinking that this is just philosophy that these
are just beliefs so these are just an ideology no
no no this is something that you make a living
reality and this is not something you brainwash yourself with
like in a cult where you just tell yourself oh
yeah i'm feeling positive because i'm empty and nothing no
no that's not it you actually have to realize it
you have to awaken to it it has to be
your living conscious reality that's possible to do but it
takes work and if you want to know how to
do that work then hey subscribe to the channel stick
around and you'll get more um content for me which
helps you to guide helps to guide you in that
direction
