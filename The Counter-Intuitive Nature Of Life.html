[Music] in this episode we're going to be talking about
the fee counter-intuitive 'no supply f-- one of my most
important principles which simply states that life is counterintuitive life
is counterintuitive now that's a very simple principle and if
I just said that to you in a five minute
video and you heard that you would just go about
life and you wouldn't understand the depth of what is
being said here because something very powerful and deep is
being said here which is why we need to go
through a long list of examples to help illustrate this
for you and I've been alluding to this principle a
lot in my work in the past where I tell
you that all this facet of life is counterintuitive in
that facet right there is counterintuitive and I keep saying
that but we need to really hit it head-on I
first became aware of this principle when I learned it
from Evan pagan who talked about it in the context
of being successful in business and also female attraction and
in those two fields it's a it's a quite an
important principle and we'll talk about those two fields but
then what I saw is that I as I was
studying personal development and applying it for the last five
years and thinking about it a lot and communicating it
to a lot of people I just kept seeing more
and more and more examples of how this principle is
found everywhere throughout life and it was just a mind-blowing
for me and I kept a list a list of
all the examples it's a very very long and juicy
list that I want to share with you so that's
mostly what we'll be doing today success basically in anything
is counterintuitive whether it's in business in attraction in relationships
but also things like with emotions and with spirituality and
basically every every facet of life you see the fool
the fool assumes he already knows everything and he just
sort of stumbles his way into some new domain of
life and because he assumes that he knows everything already
and there's really nothing new that would ever surprise him
he always takes the most obvious route does the most
obvious things and ends up falling into every trap and
stumbling on to every landmine and then of course that's
why he becomes a failure and so to really become
successful you have to learn to rethink the most obvious
routes that people take in life because of course most
people are not successful most people get very mediocre results
and they struggle and they hit their head against the
wall over and over and over again and they just
don't know well I don't know that life seems so
hard and life seems so troublesome and problematic and full
of suffering and full of evil all these things in
it just see that then they project that out into
the external world and I think that life just is
that way no it only seems that way because you're
taking the obvious foolish routes and you're not considering the
counterintuitive 'no sub life you must really learn to appreciate
just how tricky reality is reality is a very very
tricky thing very very deceptive so the key lesson from
this episode is that you always want to be looking
for that counterintuitive move that you can make in every
important situation in your life whether it's with business with
your career with getting hired for a job with attracting
the right person for a relationship or with your spirituality
or when you're meditating always be looking for that counterintuitive
move if these counterintuitive moves that separate you from the
herd now before you give I give you the whole
list of examples less let's mention an interesting point here
about the word counterintuitive so I'm using the word in
the sort of colloquial sense but really it's a misnomer
because actually it might seem like well Leo so so
you've got something against intuition so if I'm following my
intuition in life that somehow means I'm gonna live a
bad life I'm gonna be a fool and actually it's
quite the opposite what I want you is to follow
your intuition more so then why does the word counterintuitive
use in this in this case well really what the
word counterintuitive really means it's more like actually counter logical
what it means is it's the most logical solutions usually
those end up being the wrong ones the intuitive solutions
actually require you to already take into account that things
aren't gonna obviously work out in a straight linear path
so really what we mean when we say counterintuitive is
we mean counter logical we mean it's the opposite of
common-sense we mean that it's the opposite of what you
would naively expect going into a situation we mean that
it's there's something misleading and something non-obvious about this facet
of reality that needs to be understood in order to
achieve success here we also mean often that it's the
emotionally difficult thing to do in many cases usually the
counterintuitive thing is emotionally difficult and the the logical or
obvious thing that's the emotionally easy thing that were sort
of wired to do and also what counterintuitive usually means
is that it requires a sort of a cognitive leap
and perspective stepping outside of your existing perspective in order
to to get a good result so why is this
topic of counter intuitive is so important well because wisdom
itself is counter intuitive and one of the things that
I love most of all is wisdom and people who
love wisdom are by definition philosophers and that's really what
actualizado is is it's a modern version of philosophy and
philosophy is not just abstract ideas about stuff philosophy is
about how to live the good life it's also the
pursuit of truth how do you structure your life such
that you live the best kind of life that is
philosophy and that requires wisdom and that is counter intuitive
stuff and so since most people what they're looking for
life in life is they're looking for a good life
but then they don't take into account the wisdom and
the counterintuitive nature of wisdom then they end up getting
the wrong kind of life and then they suffer another
precedent and they they get all the wrong kind of
results and they can't get success where they wanted what
I want to teach you is how to get good
at spotting wisdom and another sort of corollary principle that
I want to share with you is that the more
wise of teaching is the more counterintuitive it is the
more a fool will look at it and say oh
that's not wisdom that's idiocy and that's precisely how you
know that it's wise because to a fool it looks
like foolishness but to a wise person it looks like
deep wisdom psychology I want you to notice is especially
counterintuitive if you studied various research that has been done
in psychology various psychological studies that have been done over
the last hundred years let's say within universities in academia
you know they keep coming up with all sorts of
psychological studies that produce counterintuitive results where people behave in
ways that you would think that they wouldn't behave but
they behave that way and it's because psychology runs your
whole life it's so important to understand psychology but then
psychology is so counterintuitive and the Nats what gets you
into trouble is the psychology that you bring into every
situation in life the psychology of money the psychology of
relationships the psychology of business the psychology of marketing the
psychology of your career the psychology of all of your
emotions that's what we're really interested in when we're talking
about creating the good life and also think about how
reverse psychology works you know on a child to use
reverse psychology to get them to do something that they
didn't want to do and that's very counterintuitive isn't it
like when you tell a child to brush his teeth
he doesn't want to do it and sometimes he doesn't
do it just to spite you so you can use
reverse psychology of awe don't need to brush your teeth
and then maybe he will of course maybe he won't
but uh that's reverse psychology so that gets a little
idea of or talking about and also think about being
a great strategist the greatest strategist what were they they
were highly counterintuitive thinkers and I of course encourage you
to do a lot of strategic thinking I have a
whole episode what am I most popular called how to
be a strategic [ __ ] where I talk about
how to do this just that but think of for
example Sun Tzu's the art of war what does he
talk about there he talks about military strategy and all
of it is about being tricky and being counterintuitive and
out thinking your opponent not just using brute force so
now let's get into the examples this is where the
meat of this topic lies so first of all in
business it would be intuitive to try to maximize your
profits at all costs and you think that would make
you the richest and the most successful in business but
actually the counterintuitive move in business is not to pursue
maximum profits because by pursuing maximum profits what happens is
that you end up leading your company into bankruptcy or
into decay that's what happens with businesses who purely pursue
maximum profits it actually hurts the brand in the end
by trying to cut corners everywhere it's counterintuitive not to
cut corners the obvious thing to do is to cut
corners and to pay your employees the lowest possible wages
but then we know what happens with these companies in
the long run sure the short run they might make
some money but in the long run they always get
out competed by the companies who build a stronger brand
who aren't just doing it purely for profit also another
example from business is trying to appeal to everybody with
your marketing if you try to come up with a
product the way that most naive business people do when
they first start is they try to create a product
that appeals to everybody everybody in the world is gonna
love my product and I don't want to possibly alienate
everybody so I'm gonna add all these features into my
product such that it appeals universally to all and then
when you do that usually what happens is that nobody
really loves your product because your product gets so diluted
by trying to appeal to everybody so when you're marketing
a really good idea is to have a very specific
market that you're trying to hit maybe like women who
are in their 40s who are mothers who have children
that might be a very specific type of niche that
you're marketing and you could help with a product specifically
for those kinds of women you know whatever their issues
and problems are you can go do your research and
find those and then whatever that product is you know
it'll resonate with that particular market really really well whereas
of course everybody else won't care about that product at
all but that's going to be enough for you because
all you really care about is just hitting a residence
with that particular niche and that's a lot of what
smart business strategy is about another example of this in
business there's many these examples in business but another one
is sales have you noticed if you try to do
sales that if you're desperate to get a sale you
usually end up losing the sale which is quite counterintuitive
and if you're new to sales you might think well
man why aren't people buying for me it must be
because I'm not pushing my product hard enough so you
go out there and you push it even more and
even more and then what you realize is that wait
a minute it's the opposite of how I thought it
works the more desperate I am to make the sale
the more people don't want to buy for me why
is that well it's because when I'm desperate to sell
something what that sub communicates is that I think that
my product doesn't have that much value which is why
I'm pushing it so hard because if I really believe
that my product had a lot of value I wouldn't
need to sell it so desperately I would just let
people come to me and that's counterintuitive another domain where
there's a lot of counterintuitive examples is with attraction especially
if you're a man trying to attract a female man
how many hours have I spent thinking about this topic
and and struggling my way through this topic with female
attraction he's so so counterintuitive when you start off as
a guy and you're not successful with girls and you're
trying to attract some girls you're trying to date what
you first try is the nice guy approach you try
to be extra nice because you think well ah she
wants a guy who's gonna treat her well and so
you do that but as you do that you repel
all the girls and none of them want to be
with you and this is so frustrating and so backwards
because what we then see is we see the [
__ ] and the jerks getting all the hottest girls
and you wonder how could that possibly be how can
these women be attracted to like the the scummiest guys
and then what you realize is that actually it's because
in trying to be so nice and trying to supplicate
to women what that sub communicates is that communicates that
actually you're a low value guy because if you were
a high value guy you wouldn't place so much value
on the girl you wouldn't play so much value on
her looks and you wouldn't you wouldn't bend over backwards
to try to attract her and women are very very
sensitive to that so as soon as they see a
guy who's trying to bend over backwards to attract her
she's immediately gonna get turned off it's the same thing
as trying to be very desperate to make a sale
your sub communicating low value another very counterintuitive thing is
that the less committed you are to a girl the
less you care about her the more she'll get attracted
to you like it's it's just it's so uncanny the
way it works and I had to spend hundreds of
hours like rewiring my entire brain so that I don't
fall into these most obvious foolish traps in order to
get better at attracting women another one with women is
that bragging and boasting you would think that bragging and
boasting about your nice car and all of your money
and the house that you own and how successful you
are at work that this would attract women and it
does the exact opposite it makes you less attractive so
again I had to spend hundreds of hours reprogramming my
mind to stop me from boasting and bragging as an
attraction strategy in fact what you discover when trying to
attract women is that the opposite thing works so if
you're talking to a girl for the first time and
you want to attract her start talking about like how
low quality of a guy you are kind of tongue-in-cheek
you know you can tell her that you work at
Walmart and that you uh you live out of a
cardboard box and that will actually attract her because what
she sees there of course when you're doing this tongue-in-cheek
she sees that you're you're you're so confident in yourself
that you don't need to brag about how nice your
car is and all of this you sort of trust
that if she's gonna get attracted to you she'll get
attracted just to your authentic personality and then sure enough
she does because you don't come off as desperate and
needy and try hard now of course don't get the
wrong idea here that now you have to be an
[ __ ] to women in order to attract them
you have to really distinguish between the attraction phase and
the relationship phase so you don't want to be an
[ __ ] and treat your your girl badly in
the relationship phase but during the attraction phase which actually
lasts for a very short period of time the attraction
phase is like only an hour long from the moment
where you meet the girl to the moment where she
makes a decision that she wants to sleep with you
or that she even would that moment where she gets
sexually attracted to you that particular moment that's where you
don't want to come off as overly nice and then
after she's attracted to you then you can be quite
nice to her and she'll still love you in fact
she wants you to be nice to her in the
relationship it's really just about the attraction component that we're
talking about in fact I sort of came up with
a super counterintuitive rule for myself where if I'm talking
to a really hot girl my rule is that the
hotter the girl and the more I want to attract
her the smaller that I tell her that my penis
is it's the funniest thing it just cracks me up
and it works so well it's amazing how effective this
rule is and you can test this for yourself by
going to a strip club if you're a guy and
finding some really attractive girls at the strip club like
supermodel level of attractiveness of girl and then just try
to get the strip or just by talking to her
get her to naturally get attracted to you and what
she'll notice that if you sit there bragging about how
how awesome you are and how big your muscles aren't
everything she won't get attracted to you but if like
if I'm talking to a really hot strip or what
I'll do just just to entertain myself is I'll start
telling her like the worst things about me starting with
how small my penis is and so the hotter she
is that the smaller I tell her my penis is
and and then also I'll start telling your like how
crappy my job is and how bad my car is
and all of this and so you know you do
all this of course kind of in a tongue-in-cheek way
it has to come off natural and then just like
you you noticed immediately how attracted she gets to you
because she senses that you're not trying to do the
ordinary obvious thing that every guy tries to do with
her see you're doing something counterintuitive and it's just amazing
it it blows your mind and it's difficult as a
guy it's difficult to rewire your brain to work this
way right you have to you have to really be
confident in yourself to be able to do that another
example is investing with investing it's counterintuitive to buy when
the market is crashing most people who invest are fools
and what they do is they buy stock when the
market is at the high everyone's crazy about buying so
they just get into the wave and then of course
the market crashes soon after that and then they get
worried along with everybody else as the markets crashing they're
all getting worried and now they're selling off selling off
selling off and so this is the exact opposite strategy
that you want if you want to earn money in
the stock market you got to be buying when the
market is crashing and everyone's terrified that's when you buy
and when everyone's enthusiastic and the market is doing great
in the economy is doing great that's when you sell
and that's how you earn money but you're probably gonna
lose a lot of money before you learn that lesson
which is why investing is such a dangerous game to
play another example is hedonism this is a great example
just a crystal clear example of counterintuitive miss in life
by seeking physical pleasure in life you would think that
that would lead to the best life possible but actually
that leads to the worst life it leads to enormous
pain just ask a heroin addict for example and it's
very counterintuitive to the point where I mean you spend
a good chunk of your life you spend decades in
your life chasing physical pleasure whether it's sexual or food
and fine cuisine or luxury and travel or shopping and
all this sort of so you spend your whole life
basically chasing this and it still doesn't click for it
for most people that it's just creating more suffering and
more pain it doesn't work the whole strategy is backwards
and then that's where you open yourself up to spirituality
which is the opposite of that which is why soap
you people understand spirituality because spirituality as a whole is
very counterintuitive and we'll get to specific examples of that
as we go along here but let's talk about perfectionism
first that's another great example by seeking to be a
perfectionist in your work have you noticed that your work
suffers you would think that I would get the best
work if I was this anal perfectionist right no wrong
it backfires how about with being a good parent it's
very counterintuitive not to lecture and criticize your child the
most obvious thing that parents do is when they see
the child doing something wrong they start to criticize the
child judge the child tell the child no and then
they lecture to the child as though the child will
understand your lecture and of course the child usually wants
to do the exact opposite of what you lecture them
just despite you what the parent needs to realize is
that the child actually needs to learn from making mistakes
and that what you want to encourage in your child
is a sense of exploration you want your child to
explore life and to learn the lesson that failure is
not bad but actually good through failures how you make
all your biggest lessons in life but if you are
the kind of parent who chastises your child all the
time by the time your child goes off on their
own they're gonna have this ingrained programming from you that
failure is terrible and awful and that they're gonna be
judged harshly for it and then of course they're too
scared to actually live life because they're so afraid how
about with being cheap I love this example do you
know people who are so cheap that by trying to
save pennies in the end the end of losing dollars
I know some people like this some people like this
in my family even a really good example for is
is when you're buying products like a really cheap person
will not want to spend ten or twenty two extra
dollars to buy a higher Brent quality brand like blender
for example because they just want the cheapest thing so
instead of buying the hunter dollar blender they're gonna buy
the the cheapest $50 blender but then that cheap $50
Brenda blender ended up breaking the next year whereas the
$100 blender will last you for a good ten years
and so in the long run by buying the cheapest
lowest brand products you end up actually losing money and
I have a really good example of this a few
years ago I went to a 99-cent store in my
neighborhood and I've never been to a ninth 99-cent store
ever in my life until that point because just I
avoid cheap stuff for this reason but I said you
know what let's just go and see what they got
there so I was walking through it and just kind
of like looking around and at that time I needed
some post-it notes I was out of post-it notes and
usually I buy the brand post-it notes which are pretty
expensive it's like ten dollars for for a pack of
though and here I see some generic non brand post-it
notes for 99 cents and I'm like okay that's that's
good it's a pretty good deal so I grab a
pack of those I bring it home thinking that I
got a good deal and then I start taking off
the first post-it note and I realize that as I'm
taking off the note the note actually has such terribly
low quality adhesive that it it doesn't even come off
the notes don't even separate properly they actually tear and
leave like various kinds of sticker marks on each other
and it was so terrible like you can't literally you
couldn't pull them apart the way you can with a
regular post-it note it was so terrible I had to
throw the whole package into the trash after five minutes
of trying to separate them it was so frustrating and
that's that's when this this idea of getting cheap was
really shown to me another example of this is is
with cheap food people think that although I don't have
the money to invest in organic food and high-quality meat
and all this you know I'm just gonna like eat
ramen noodles that's the cheapest way to go right but
then what happens thirty years later forty years later when
you've got heart disease and cancer and all this other
crap that comes with eating this low-quality pesticide filled food
food filled with lead and Mercury and all of this
what are your medical expenses gonna be is it still
gonna be cheaper than after you pay fifty thousand dollars
for some sort of surgery see but people don't factor
that in because they're too cheap when you actually factor
it in and for example you factor in the cost
of eating low-quality fruits and vegetables which are filled with
pesticides which all get sucked in and lodged into your
brain tissue and then your brain tissue is filled with
lead and Mercury and if you've read the studies on
letting mercury you know how that decreases your cognitive performance
might give you all sorts of conditions like chronic fatigue
and fibromyalgia and all the sorts of stuff and headaches
and it just makes you less energetic and it makes
you less creative think about the cost of that long-term
for example in your career if you're a creative type
of person if you're an artist if you're a business
person you rely on your creativity to make a living
imagine the cost of of that over the next 30
years of reduced creativity let's say your creativity is reduced
by 10% because of all these heavy metals and pesticides
in your brain what's that gonna cost you over 30
years another great example is education it would seem obvious
that people with the highest degrees and the most formal
education would be the smartest ones the most conscious ones
and that turns out to be very false and actually
counter-intuitively formal education especially like getting master's degrees and PhDs
oftentimes this makes you dumber and less conscious because you
get way too stuck in your logical mind how about
evil evil is a super counterintuitive topic by trying to
stop evil you end up creating evil if you ask
the average person on the street how do we rid
the world of evil what will they say they say
well let's just find all the evil people and kill
them or put them in jail that will stop all
the evil but that's precisely what will create the world's
evil it's trying to do that the counterintuitive move is
to love evil not in the sense that you actually
love the killing of children for example or the starting
of genocides but that you have such a deep understanding
of life and how counterintuitive it all is that you
see that hating evil just as more evil on top
of the evil hating evil ends up backfiring if you
want a real solution to evil you love the evil
to death and also is very counterintuitive to love one's
own sins to death usually people who are very worried
about sins they don't want to be sinners and so
when they find sins within themselves they think that the
best thing to do is to I should call themselves
a sinner than just her to hate themselves think of
themselves as an evil one and try to get rid
of the evil by hating their own evil but of
course all this does this just adds gasoline to the
fire and it it multiplies your sins because then what
your psyche does is it has to suppress and deny
all of that and then projects it out into the
external world which of course creates more evil the counter
to does move is to love your sins to death
melt your sins away with love now just look take
this one last example that I was talking about this
this example of evil just think about how significant this
example is think about how life transforming this is if
every human being on the planet grasped that by trying
to stop evil they are actually creating evil and by
trying to hate their own sins they're actually increasing their
own sinfulness if they grasp that think of how much
suffering would be saved in the world think of how
many lives would be saved we're talking about millions of
lives being saved just from this one counterintuitive example so
even though we're going down this list relatively quickly here
and we're covering all these examples don't fall into the
trap of thinking that oh well yeah Leo you're just
giving me a list and it's kind of nice but
what am I supposed to do with it it's like
no no no no do you understand how powerful each
one of these examples is these are life transforming examples
we have to really grasp the counterintuitive nasaw this you
have to really grasp how you're doing it wrong and
then you got to work on embodying it it could
take you 10 years to learn how to just embody
this one counterintuitive example with evil another example is with
avoiding work a lot of lazy people they try to
look for shortcuts and they try to avoid hard work
but counter-intuitively when you do that you end up doing
twice as much work in the end another example is
with control and manipulation it's counterintuitive to give up your
manipulating and trying to control people that's one of the
biggest mistakes that people make with other people is that
they try to control them and this creates all sorts
of problems and then when you let go of control
counter-intuitively you see your relationships end up going much smoother
and for parents you know this is a very big
insight stop try to control your children so much that's
so counterintuitive because it's apparent you know you want the
best for your children so of course you think that
well if I want the best and and I know
so much I know so much more than they do
that I'm gonna I'm gonna control them to become the
best they can possibly be and when you do that
ironically you end up making them weak and reliant on
you and then they are presenting you because you're not
giving them the autonomy they need to to struggle through
life make their own mistakes and then flourish how about
the example of get-rich-quick schemes this one's a really obvious
one people who chase get-rich-quick schemes end up never really
building true wealth and these get-rich-quick schemes they're promising to
make you a lot of money very quickly but what
you discover after you try a series of them is
that each one basically fails and you waste five or
ten years of your life chasing all these schemes plus
you waste a bunch of your money buying all these
different schemes of course they're never free and then what
do you have to show for it in the end
nothing but failure and disappointment and then you build up
this idea that well I could never succeed in business
yeah because you're trying to do these get-rich-quick schemes which
never work how about the example of the 8020 rule
especially when it's applied in business the 8020 rule says
that 80% of your results comes from 20% of your
effort what that means for example in business is that
80% of your profits come from only 20% of your
products it means that 80% of the work you do
is only responsible for 20% of your profits whereas 20%
of the work you do is responsible for 80% of
your profits so the counterintuitive move is to focus on
the top 20% of your work and your profits and
to cut everything else as much as you can but
most people what they try to do is they try
to be good at every percent of their business and
this ends up losing the money how about rationalism is
a good example the rationalist by being so fearful of
illogicality x' and superstitions he thinks that he's gonna live
the most truthful kind of life by being a strict
rationalist and so he's gonna avoid all sorts of new-age
and mystical thinking but by trying to avoid magical thinking
the rationalist ends up cutting himself off from the magic
of life because counter-intuitively life turns out to be magical
rationalist just don't get this how about the example of
trying to be cool you ever tried to act cool
what do you realize you realize that by trying to
act cool you actually end up being such a try-hard
that it's very obvious to people around you that you're
not cool what it means to be cool is to
like not care when you care about being cool you're
automatically not cool anymore and that's very counterintuitive how about
with patience a lot of people are impatient and so
they try to get stuff done quicker faster and they
think that by doing stuff faster they're gonna end up
getting double the result but often times by trying to
do it too fast you end up having to redo
things and then it ends up actually taking longer than
it should have you just did it with patience this
is sort of a more general principle about the get-rich-quick
schemes how about people-pleasing it's very counterintuitive that by trying
to please people they end up respecting you less not
more a lot of people pleasers don't understand this see
because if you really respected yourself you wouldn't be going
around trying to please people all the time so if
you're not respecting yourself why would others respect you how
about what the example of negotiation in a negotiation if
you want to be successful you need to come into
the negotiation not needing whatever is being negotiated and that's
really counterintuitive because usually the whole point of going into
negotiations because you need something and it's likely oh but
if I don't need this house or I don't need
this car then why am I even negotiating for it
exactly that's your negotiate you need to negotiate for a
position of strength for a position of detachment that's how
you get leverage in a negotiation is that you just
sit down at the table and not need the car
not need the house not need the loan see you
know what they say the irony with loans is that
if you need a loan you'll never get one and
if you don't need a loan then everyone will want
to give you one that's so counterintuitive if you go
desperately interest into a negotiation you're going to get the
worst possible deal and the only way you really learn
that lesson is by negotiating going into a few negotiations
and getting totally hosed and then it starts to click
in your mind how counterintuitive negotiations are how about with
life purpose a lot of people get hung up chasing
money in life in their career and in their business
and they think that well Leo I can't follow my
passion in my life purpose because I got to worry
about paying the bills and I got to worry about
money but what I have actually discovered is that the
most money I've ever made personally in my life is
what I was following my passion not when I was
chasing money because when I'm chasing money that D motivates
me because I'm not passionate about money I'm passionate about
my passion I'm passionate about doing my art and so
on lining yourself with your passion ends up being sort
of a counterintuitive strategy that actually ends up earning you
more money in the long run because it's it's by
being super passionate about something even though it's not the
most lucrative thing in the end that passion will whitout
because you'll be able to produce some amazing art or
some amazing work that you just could not do if
you were only in it for the money how about
with losing weight a lot of people struggle to lose
weight and that's because it's so counterintuitive because most people
they think well I'll just I'll take one of these
diets and try to lose weight as quickly as possible
they look for the diet that will lose as many
pounds as possible on them and then what they discover
is that it doesn't work it's these these yo-yo diets
that just frustrate you by by helping you shed some
weight but then you get it Gannett back on because
you're not really changing your eating habits and your relationship
to food you're just using some kind of gimmick and
then you end up staying fat or even getting fatter
or just getting frustrated and demotivated and then you know
after you've tried 10 or 20 of these diets over
the years and you stop even believing there's possible to
lose weight that's just because you're doing it wrong how
about with pursuing goals this is so counterintuitive and this
is a life-changing insight right here little goals are actually
harder to accomplish than big goals why because a big
goal comes with a big vision it's inspiring and it's
motivating it will actually motivate you to get up early
in the morning and work on it because you'll be
inspired with a little goal you would think well a
little goal is easy because it involves less work yes
sort of logically thinking about it that's what it looks
like but actually a little goal if it's so little
that it doesn't inspire you then it won't make any
difference in your life and therefore you won't be motivated
to do it that's why it can be easier to
lose 50 pounds that it is to lose 5 pounds
because 5 pounds makes no difference you won't even notice
it in the mirror 5 5 pounds you can't build
a strong vision for losing 5 pounds but building a
vision for losing 50 pounds that's very significant because you
know 50 pounds will make a substantial difference in how
attractive you look how people react to you and all
this stuff and that will inspire you to actually do
it motivate a meditation rather not motivation meditation is another
great example of counterintuitive news sometimes people say all léo
but I don't have time to mow to meditate because
I'm so busy I'm working all the time and you
know the classic advice that they give you about that
is they say well the less time you have to
motive to meditate the more you need it so if
you don't have the time to meditate for 20 minutes
then you gotta meditate for 60 minutes and that's very
counterintuitive it's very counterintuitive to spend an hour a day
meditating for most ordinary people because they look at that
and they think that it's a waste of time like
Leo what's the point of meditating you mean I'm just
gonna sit there for an hour and do nothing and
think about nothing why wouldn't it be better if I
just sat there and thought about stuff for an hour
I would be more creative but the answer is no
you won't be more creative if you want to be
smarter and more creative try not thinking not thinking makes
me the most creative person when I do one of
my solo 10-day meditation retreats out in the woods somewhere
all by myself doing nothing for ten days I have
the most creative ideas I'm so creative is hard to
even continue to meditate that's how creative I get see
most people didn't understand this because it's so counterintuitive it's
also very counterintuitive that doing nothing is hard most people
think that doing doing stuff is hard and that doing
nothing that'sthat's easy any fool can do nothing oh yeah
try it have you tried to do nothing for 10
days straight if you haven't this is one of the
most powerful techniques for personal growth ever ever sit for
10 days and do absolutely nothing and by the end
of those 10 10 days you will have like levelled
up your life by by 20% it's amazing and it's
also very very difficult you'll notice that doing nothing for
10 days straight is the hardest thing you've ever done
in your life and if you're not devoting at least
10 days a year for doing nothing you're really missing
out on how much you could be growing in fact
really you should you should probably schedule at least 2
retreats per year where you just sit and do nothing
for 10 days straight 2 of those if you really
want to be growing but see s so counterintuitive most
people they won't be able to to come up with
the right justifications in their minds to actually be able
to schedule that because they'll say oh yeah Lea that
sounds nice but you know I got family obligations I
got work business money this that I got all this
stuff I don't have time to to schedule ten days
of doing nothing right because you're doing the emotionally easy
thing you're doing the most obvious thing you're doing the
most logical thing which is why you get mediocre results
in your life it'll take you many years before it
clicks at all I really got to schedule these retreats
they're the most important thing in my life the most
important chunks of time on my calendar during the year
are my two do-nothing 10-day retreats see but it takes
a lot of failure before you learn that that's a
counterintuitive move creativity is very counterintuitive have you noticed this
that it's counterintuitive that you're the most creative when you
aren't actually trying to be like when you sit down
at your desk and you want to write a book
or you want to do something like that and be
creative on command you have you noticed that you're not
very creative but when you're not trying to be creative
when you're just like in the shower or on the
toilet or cooking food or just driving your car you're
the most creative on the weekends I'm the most creative
it's so counterintuitive I always have my best insights when
I'm not trying to have my best insights usually on
the weekends usually when I'm driving in the car to
the grocery store or something like that which is why
I keep a little post-it notes in the car so
they can write down mine my best insights but that
took me a long time to learn because it's so
counterintuitive it's also counterintuitive to be a man most guys
most juvenile guys they think that to be a good
man they need to act macho and it doesn't click
for them yet that by acting macho they're actually coming
off as an insecure beta a truly strong man doesn't
need to act macho and in fact embracing your feminine
side makes you stronger as a man and that's very
counterintuitive and it's counterintuitive for people who are stuck in
stage Orange smile dynamic stage Orange and that stages is
rather masculine for them to move up into stage green
because the stage green is more feminine and then guys
get worried about this hello well am I going to
become some some weak feminine soy boy I don't want
to become that I want to be more macho and
so they resist going into green but what they don't
realize is that by integrating the feminine side they're actually
become much stronger as a man another example is with
rest and relaxation it's counterintuitive that rest actually improves the
quality of your work it makes you more creative another
example is tithing money you know certain religious traditions especially
I think Christian ones there's a principle there a long
time honored principle of giving away 10% of your money
every year to charity or something like that and you
know many people who are struggling with money they would
say well yeah Leo if if I had a million
dollars if I was earning a million dollars a year
yeah I would give away 10% no problem but you
know Leo I'm just earning 30,000 when I'm earning 30,000
giving away 10% you know that's gonna that's gonna make
it hard for me to earn more money and to
make my my ends meet but but what you don't
realize that when you're when your hoard your money and
you're so stingy with it that you don't give it
away to charity what happens is that that's actually sub
communicating to your own mind that money is scarce and
so you're actually operating from this scarcity mindset whereas when
you're giving away 10% of your income every year what
that communicates to you is that money is abundant and
then I'll just get more it's not a big deal
but you know it's it's it's difficult it's counterintuitive to
actually do it try to actually want for one year
try to actually give away 10% of your income that's
so hard to do unless you've you've trained yourself to
do that it's so counterintuitive especially if you come from
a sort of a uh huh a history like I
did for example where money was scarce in the family
and and so I had to kind of like learn
to be frugal and learn to be conservative and not
to waste my money you know it's very difficult for
me to convince myself to give away 10% of my
income like super super difficult very counterintuitive but then I
also noticed that because I don't give away that much
money then I notice that I find myself in this
scarcity mindset even when I do have a lot of
money it's so kept money is such a counterintuitive topic
I have a whole episode called money psychology where I
talk about many of the counterintuitive facets related to money
and that's directly proportional to why people stay in poverty
and never really are able to amount great wealth because
their psychology is backwards how about the example of creating
a good portfolio to get my first job I had
to create a good portfolio I was a video game
designer and so the intuitive thing for me to do
was that I thought well let me get all the
work I ever did and put it all as this
port floats gonna be the most comprehensive portfolio of my
work and then what I discovered is that it didn't
work it was terrible it was a terrible portfolio if
you want a great portfolio we need to do we
need to pick the top 5% of your work and
hide everything else your portfolio needs to be small but
like really really well polished and then your portfolio becomes
impressive and then people will hire you how about the
example of giving credit that's super counterintuitive the the conventional
way of thinking is that we don't like to give
credit to other people because that we think that that
debt takes credit like away from us and I've had
to struggle with this for example when I when I
shoot my videos because a lot of times you know
I'm researching many sources a lot of my information comes
from hundreds of different sources and sometimes I get insecure
about like giving credit to a source that I got
a piece of information from because I think that well
but if I if I say that I got this
information from such as a source people will think that
I didn't create it myself it wasn't an original insight
that I had but then so I notice that in
myself I noticed that sort of like contraction of me
wanting to kind of like own these insights but then
I also that that that notice that makes me sort
of a weak person and so counterintuitive I need to
be more generous and actually credit more and then counter
and truly what happens that when you credit people properly
and you credit excessively what actually happens that people who
are watching and listening to those hey oh look this
person is a really like honest and reliable person and
he's so confident in himself that he doesn't care about
giving credit to others and then actually that makes you
look the best it makes you look very credible when
you give credit to other people counter-intuitively that's so counter
intuitive and that's something I've always struggled with and one
of the challenges I face with actually is our organs
because I do pull from so many sources a lot
of times I don't credit all the sources that I
pull from honestly partially it's because of my own insecurities
but also other times it's because often times I just
don't even remember where I got some of these ideas
because like I've studied so many sources it's hard to
keep track of where you get all of your ideas
and then they mix in with my own insights and
so it's just sort of this massive hodgepodge although in
my own commonplace book I do try to keep a
list of my sources you know just so that I
can credit people properly especially if I'm doing some kind
of formal work like if I'm writing a book for
example for my book I'm keeping a very detailed list
of credits and sources another example is with solving problems
have you noticed when you're working on a really challenging
problem at work and you're just you're kind of going
at it after hour after hour after hour and it
just it won't solve and then counter and totally what
you have to do is you have to leave the
problem alone leave it alone go away for a few
days come and then the problem is magically solved that's
so counterintuitive but that happens precisely because you're more creative
when you're not pushing yourself and forcing yourself to have
to be creative so over the weekend while you're shopping
for groceries the solution will just come to you because
that's how creativity works the next example is love love
is super counterintuitive most people think that love is me
surrounding myself with lovely objects like I have a beautiful
woman in my life or I have an awesome man
in my life or I have beautiful awesome children I
can love them and I have a beautiful dog and
I love my dog and have a beautiful house and
I love my house and so love is all about
getting lovely stuff when actually it's the exact opposite of
that love is not about giving and getting stuff love
is about you being able to radiate love out into
the world that's what true love means it's it's about
rewiring your mind such that you're always giving more and
more and more of yourself to the world and then
you feel so good by doing that that then you
feel the love you become the source of the love
and then you don't have a scarcity mindset with love
and then it's not easy to break your love because
with a person you know with the average person their
love is very easy to break all you have to
do is take away that lovely object that they're attached
to whereas a person who's always radiating love you can't
break their love because they're the source of it and
they're always radiating it which makes them the most loving
and then people want to love them back because they
receive so much love from them see whereas those people
who are always wanting to leech love like a love
vampire they're the ones who end up alienating everybody because
nobody wants a loved vampire to be around them which
leads us to the next example of relationships relationships are
extremely counterintuitive because in a relationship the intuitive thing is
to focus on getting your own needs met it's like
I'm in a relationship with you so that you can
satisfy me sexually and you can do all the chores
that I want you to do and you can be
there for me when I'm sad and you can you
can fill all the voids in my life that's usually
how people get into relationships and that's exactly the opposite
of what you need to do if you want a
great relationship you want to instead satisfy your own needs
so much that you don't care about your own needs
anymore and now you're focused on actually the needs of
your partner now of course that really only works when
your partner is willing to do the same so a
lot of mistake that people make is they get into
this kind of relationship where they they focus on fulfilling
the needs of their partner but their partner is like
a malignant narcissist and just keeps sucking and sucking and
sucking and sucking so that's not going to work it
takes two to tango in this in this relationship and
so your partner also needs to be on that same
level as you otherwise it's gonna get toxic another example
is with emotional armor or psychological armor what this means
is that psychologically we armor ourselves against the world every
time that we get wounded or hurt from the outside
or we suffer we create sort of a wall a
piece of armor gets created whether it's in a relationship
or in business or something like that you know someone's
screwed you over in a business deal you're gonna do
off some armor if someone cheated on your relationship and
have armor and you're doing by doing this you you
think you're gonna make yourself involve all but actually what
ends up happening counterintuitive is that you you cut yourself
off from life and from the world and from feelings
and so the counterintuitive move in the situation is to
actually surrender your armor and make yourself more vulnerable the
best life is a vulnerable life and very counter-intuitively people
don't understand this for example when they're trying to arm
themselves with guns people say oh there's there's all these
mass shooters running around and terrorists and all this chaos
happening in the world so I need to amount a
bunch of guns I need to build a gun arsenal
so the logic goes but this is exactly backwards because
actually statistically speaking if you own guns in your household
the thing that's most likely to kill your family is
your own guns not some terrorists or some mass shooter
somewhere it's your own guns that's so counterintuitive and also
by surrounding yourself with this arsenal of guns what is
that really sub communicating to you and to to the
rest of the world that you're scared and that you're
actually vulnerable a vulnerable person a scared person needs a
lot of guns whereas someone who's really courageous and has
opened themselves up and kind of let go he doesn't
need to surround himself with guns now you might say
leo but what if someone comes and tries to rob
you or shoot you what are you gonna do then
well that's right that's what it means to really accept
your vulnerability is you accept that you are vulnerable which
means that someone can shoot you and you know what
the fact is that even if you have an arsenal
of guns someone can still shoot you the arsenal of
guns won't defend you nearly as much as you think
you will it will you see so vulnerable it is
very counterintuitive and I notice that men suffer from this
problem a lot because men try to act macho a
lot so men don't like to admit that they're vulnerable
and that's sort of what it means to start to
embrace your feminine side more is to embrace your vulnerability
admit that you're vulnerable because the truth is that you
are we all are because you're alive and so long
as you're alive you can die and that by definition
makes you vulnerable freedom is also a very counterintuitive because
a lot of people say oh well we need free
speech and just freedom to the hilt everything has to
be free and freedom freedom freedom freedom but then what
they don't realize is that freedom too much freedom actually
backfires and actually creates chaos so counter-intuitively by creating good
government regulations you would think well that's not freedom that's
infringing on my rights if we lived in the Wild
West I could just own a gun I could just
like have sex with animals and I could do anything
there'd be no laws and everything would be just the
best maximum freedom but maximum freedom is just complete chaos
you don't really want freedom because if you really lived
in some kind of crazy Wild West totally free society
that would just be a survival of the fittest that's
all that is it's like jungle it's like living in
a prison the strongest person is gonna dominate all the
weaker people in that kind of scenario so actually strategically
creating regulations and rules maximizes freedom see so in a
certain sense it might seem that regulating guns for example
limits freedom but in a certain sense it doesn't it
actually increases freedom because now you have the freedom to
like walk through the park or send your children to
school without worrying that they're gonna get shot see freedom
is extremely counterintuitive and a lot of these staged orange
people who are diehard advocates for freedom they don't understand
this if you lived in a environment that was totally
free you would be dead see the only reason you
can even stay alive as an organism is because there
are very tight restrictions on your environment you need a
very stable environment which means unlimited environment in order to
be able to live at all how about the example
of overthinking a lot of people think that by thinking
a lot they will make great decisions but actually counter-intuitively
the opposite thing happens when you overthink a decision you
end up making the wrong decision changing complex systems is
very counterintuitive for example changing the environment or changing public
policy with government or for example like take the Iraq
war a lot of people thought that the Iraq war
was justified because it helped to prevent terrorism from spreading
that was basically the justification for the Iraq war but
now in retrospect we see that its exact opposite the
Iraq war actually helped to spread more terrorism and a
lot of government action works exactly this way because government
is very complex system and complex systems tend to be
very counterintuitive speaking of government a lot of people get
it in their head that it's possible to create a
utopian government if only we got rid of the military
if only we got rid of of all the all
the corporate corruption and all the other problems in government
we create this this pure utopia of hippie love and
and and everyone would be enlightened and conscious and it
would be wonderful and then in practice though these people
end up creating the worst dystopian nightmares because they underestimate
how counterintuitive all these systems are war and peace is
also counterintuitive a lot of stage green hippies think that
wall if we could just get rid of all the
militaries in the world and all the guns then we
would have peace but that's not how it works if
you want peace counter-intuitively you actually need a very strong
military that ensures peace stage green people don't fathom this
they think too simplistically about war and peace now of
course it doesn't mean that you need to go start
wars I'm not saying that you can have a strong
military and use it only defensively for peacekeeping purposes or
you can have a strong military and use it very
flippantly the way the United States does lately and then
of course that doesn't ensure peace so there's there's right
and right right and wrong ways to go about it
how about self love also very counterintuitive it's counterintuitive to
love yourself more when you fail usually what people do
when they fail is they start to hate themselves they
get really harsh with themselves they start to blame and
criticize themselves but that just doubles down on the failure
next time when you fail try to love yourself the
way your mother might love you if you had a
loving mother despite any of your failures and then see
what happens see how quickly you outgrow your failures see
how much stronger you and resource will you become how
about ideals ideals are very counter intuitive people think that
having high ideals and principles is really good but actually
counter intuitively by having a lot of high ideals you're
never gonna live up to your ideals so you're always
going to be miserable and suffering because you've created this
fantasy of these high ideals that nobody can possibly live
up to because reality is over here but your idealistic
fantasy is up there and people think that by having
this idealistic fantasy that they're gonna they're gonna create that
but in reality reality is different you're not going to
create that you're just going to torture yourself how about
the example of anger and now we're really getting to
some very juicy and practical territory these next few examples
I'm going to give you are all going to be
emotional psychological examples and emotions are some of the most
counterintuitive things that there are and also emotions are one
of the most important factors in the quality of your
life so anger is very counterintuitive most people think that
by being angry all they're doing is they're just authentically
expressing theirs their emotions but actually when you're being angry
you're in denial of the fact that you've been hurt
so anger is not an authentic expression anger is a
is a smokescreen for actually admitting to yourself that you've
been hurt and that's super counterintuitive how many years is
gonna take you to learn that and stop being angry
that'll take a lot of years if your anger prone
how about with suffering suffering is one of the most
counterintuitive things when we suffer the obvious thing that we
do is we recoil and we try to kind of
shut ourselves off from the suffering create that little piece
of armor there and to distract ourselves from the suffering
one of the most counterintuitive things you can do in
life is to actually open yourself to the suffering and
fully feel it with full mindfulness unconsciousness and really suffer
it like really suffer it extra hard and from that
actually you will be able to dissolve your suffering it's
in the resisting of suffering that most suffering gets created
that's so counterintuitive and so challenging to embody you can
know this logically but then to be able to embody
it in everyday life when you're actually in a moment
of deep suffering that's really difficult that takes a lot
of training and that's a lot of what spirituality is
about and that's also why spirituality is so counterintuitive one
of the ways is because you know this is a
classic technique that spiritual masters and gurus and Yogi's have
used for thousands of years is that they deliberately make
themselves suffer by lying on a bed of nails for
example or sitting and meditating on a hard rock in
a cave somewhere this creates a lot of suffering but
this is exactly what spiritually purifies them and ultimately makes
them a happy person is because they went through all
that suffering see that's so counterintuitive most people what they
want is they want to do the opposite they want
to surround themselves with a cushy environment where everything is
perfect and idealistic and or ideal look rather and and
and in that situation actually you become soft and you
become weak and then even the littlest agitation will make
you suffer enormously whereas the person who lives in a
for ten years to him he can endure in enormous
suffering and no problem because he's trained himself on it
and that's the whole idea behind asceticism fear is also
a great example of counterintuitive Ness a lot of people
when they're faced with the challenging situation they'll worry about
that situation and they'll think about it and they'll ruminate
about all the stuff that can go wrong with it
and the idea being that if you worry so much
about it that somehow you're gonna prevent it but actually
what it ends up happening is the exact opposite by
law of attraction you end up attracting those things which
you think about so if you're worrying and you're thinking
about negative stuff you tend to attract that so if
you're fearful about lack of money that tends to actually
instill and program you with an with a poverty mindset
and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy if you're fearful
about love and you think you're gonna end up alone
and that makes you needy and clingy when you do
get into that relationship with your perfect partner you're gonna
be so needy and clingy and so fearful of losing
their love that actually you're gonna repel them away and
they will leave you for your neediness and then trace
the self-fulfilling prophecy that's why fear is so dangerous and
so toxic what's really counterintuitive with fear is to face
it head-on our natural inclination with fear is to try
to resist it or distract ourselves from it is to
avoid the thing that we fear the most and with
spirituality just is that we have to go into the
fear and face our greatest fears head-on and then through
that we conquer our fears we realize that our fears
all fear is just illusion but that's so counterintuitive because
I fear does not appear like an illusion it appears
like reality but then again that's precisely what an illusion
is an illusion is an appearance which mimics reality but
really isn't how about the example of arrogance it's counterintuitive
to be humble have you noticed this or blame it's
counterintuitive not to blame other people when something goes wrong
how about criticism it's counterintuitive to listen to criticism our
natural inclination when we get criticized is to again create
armor and share ourselves off and to instead demonize the
person who is criticizing us to invalidate their criticism because
their criticism is pointing out some weakness in us that
we need to work on and fix but of course
we don't admit that we have a weakness the ego
does want to admit that the counterintuitive thing is to
actually listen to feedback and that's counterintuitive because it's emotionally
difficult to do that because then you have to open
yourself up to the possibility that other people might know
more than you minimalism is another example it's counterintuitive that
less is more minimalist design for example is actually harder
than non minimalist design because it's actually very difficult to
edit away all the fluff and trim all the fat
off of your product or creation to get it to
that perfect polished minimalist look or function usually what people
do intuitively is they just they to try to lump
a bunch of features into a product like if they're
making a piece of software they're not going to create
a a simple minimalist piece of software that does exactly
what it needs to do they're gonna lump all these
features into it he's gonna make it all bloated and
make a terrible piece of software and also minimalism in
your life is counterintuitive as well you would think that
I would have the best life I surround myself with
a bunch of cars and houses and yachts and and
objects and and bunch of clutter in my house but
counter-intuitively that actually makes your life worse because now you
have to worry about all these things all these things
can break they all need to be maintained there's costs
involved with them you always have to be thinking about
them whereas if you simplify your life down to just
a few simple things just the bare necessities you actually
end up having more time to do the stuff that
really matters like meditate and do spiritual work and follow
your passion and go traveling and having cool experiences rather
than working through that mess of clutter that you have
in your garage open-mindedness is very counterintuitive when I tell
people to be open-minded radically open-minded the Communist objection I
get is that Leo but if I'm open-minded that means
I'm gonna believe crazy stupid ideas like flat earth but
a flat earther is not open-minded they're actually close-minded by
being open-minded you're gonna believe in Flat Earth you're just
gonna open yourself up to exploring reality it's very counterintuitive
that by opening your mind actually you reduce your likelihood
of false beliefs because with an open mind you don't
cling to any beliefs you don't attach to any of
them it's the closed-minded person who is and so actually
it's the closed-minded people who end up coming up with
all the conspiracy theories it's the closed-minded people who are
actually the flat earthers and who believe and all the
kooky fringe ideas that are out there which are ridiculous
those are the closed-minded people not the open-minded people selfishness
is also very counterintuitive it's counterintuitive to live a selfless
life because you would think that well the best life
that I could live is one where I'm always concerned
about myself and my needs and where I'm always getting
more and more and more and I'm manipulating as much
as possible to get everything that I want that's the
best life right wrong exactly the opposite it's when you
surrender that entire dynamic and you live your life to
give to others to love others to help others to
serve the world that's when you're gonna have the best
life the selfless life projection is a very counterintuitive psychological
mechanism projection is when we deny something within ourselves and
suppress it and then we see it everywhere out in
the world so for example if if I have homosexual
tendencies as a man and I'm afraid and I don't
like them and I think it's somehow wicked or sinful
I'm gonna suppress that within myself and then I'm gonna
I'm gonna be angry at all those homosexuals that I
see out there in the world and that's super counterintuitive
because your mind doesn't know that it's doing this suppression
all of the mind knows is the mind just knows
there's all these evil homosexuals out there who are corrupting
our children in our society it's very counterintuitive to be
able to to change your perspective to see that oh
could it be that that stuff that I'm demonizing out
there he's actually stuff that I myself and and climbed
to do could it be that that this is why
I'm getting triggered by it could it be that that's
why I'm so angry at those people out there and
sure enough that's how anger works it's a projection denial
of course is another very counterintuitive psychological mechanism because when
you're in denial you're of course in denial that you're
in denial so most people who are in denial they
kind of look inside and say well look but I'm
not in denial so I must not be in denial
but of course if you were in denial you would
be so in denial that you would be in denial
that you're in enough which brings us to example of
self-deception self-deception works in the same way most people don't
bother to introspect and look at their own self-deception most
people they see self-deception out there which of course is
just a projection if you're triggered by all the self-deceptive
and the deluded people out in the world that's only
because you yourself are self deceived but of course the
person looks inside and says wait a minute leo I'm
looking inside and I'm perfectly rational all my beliefs are
scientific and valid I'm not self to see you but
of course that is the self-deception that's so counterintuitive skepticism
is also counterintuitive a lot of skeptics also do do
this sort of projection game where they are skeptical about
all the other stuff out there but they never turn
their skepticism inwards it's very counterintuitive to be skeptical first
and foremost about your own beliefs and ideas and your
own skepticism rather than directing your skepticism as a weapon
out at the world it's also very intuitive to think
that everyone thinks like you and it's very counterintuitive to
realize that actually no there are people out there who
have a different type of brain who have a different
type of personality who literally experience reality differently than me
and think totally differently than me and that this is
the result of a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication morality
is also very counterintuitive if you truly want to be
moral you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving
up all morality all of your moral rules give them
all away throw them away and then you will truly
be moral but if you go around touting your own
morality and telling people how moral you are and how
immoral they are that immediately tells me that you're actually
not embodying your morality because a truly moral person would
never do that because true morality is not based on
rules it's not a self image that you adopt it's
not a list of 10 commandments that you follow that's
super counterintuitive especially for stage blue people spiral dynamic stage
blue does not understand this and this is actually why
Spile dynamic stage blue ends up creating so much evil
in the world because when you think you're so righteous
and good and so moral you will go and kill
people in the name of your morality which is precisely
what creates evil so twisted happiness is extremely counterintuitive because
by seeking happiness you are already unhappy to be happy
you need to be happy with whatever is happening right
now in the present moment and that's totally counterintuitive because
most people think that to be happy I need to
chase something or I need to create a circumstance in
my life I need to get into a particular happy
state to be happy and that's why they're never happy
because they're always looking for happiness in the future when
happiness can only be found in the present which means
that you literally need to be happy when you're sad
or you need to be happy when you're suffering and
that's very counterintuitive most people don't think it's possible to
be happy when you're sad or when you're facing a
problem or when something's going wrong in your life but
it is you just have to retrain yourself and that's
very counterintuitive God and the devil are very counterintuitive most
people think that well you couldn't have two more opposite
things God is one thing the devil is the opposite
right wrong God is the devil the devil is God
but again good luck explaining that to a stage blue
person on Spile dynamics death is also a very counterintuitive
thing possibly one of the most counterintuitive things I've ever
experienced in my life is the realization of what death
is you think death is the worst possible thing that
could happen to you it's the thing you fear the
most death is the worst possible evil and yet when
you actually experience it and realize what it is you
realize that death is Nirvana death is love death is
the greatest pleasure you will ever experience in your life
and then that's so counterintuitive to people it's counterintuitive even
to to realize that you can die and and still
come back and talk about it enlightenment is extremely counterintuitive
it's counterintuitive that the self is unreal it's counterintuitive that
you were never born it's counterintuitive that by surrendering all
knowledge you will actually end up having the deepest knowing
of the universe through not knowing you will end up
knowing that's super twisted our society treats not knowing as
a negative when actually not knowing is the deepest wisdom
that you can have not knowing that's what enlightenment is
people think that enlightenment is that I get to know
everything when actually it's kind of the opposite enlightenment is
that you you realize you know nothing and through knowing
nothing there's an inversion a going a full circle and
then you realize that you also so in a sense
know everything paradox is another counterintuitive one paradox people have
a negative opinion of and they think that paradox is
somehow illogical and somehow it's a mistake what they don't
realize that paradox is a core feature of reality and
that's very counterintuitive and that paradox is not a mistake
when you're doing logic and you encounter paradox that's not
a mistake that's because logic is full of paradoxes because
reality is trans logical it's counterintuitive to sacrifice your queen
in a chess game and that's actually what makes the
greatest chess games I love looking at chess games you
can actually find YouTube videos of this maybe I'll post
a good example of this where some brilliant chess grandmaster
the most brilliant ones they can see so far ahead
and they're so counterintuitive in their strategies that they will
sacrifice their greatest pieces and end up winning the game
that's always amazing to watch it's like a stroke of
genius and that's generally how you want to approach your
whole life most people are so worried about losing their
queen in life that um they end up losing their
King in the end and you want to opposite you
want to surrender your greatest pieces and really focus on
on the stuff that needs to be protected and through
that you will end up winning it's counterintuitive to explore
other points of view it's counterintuitive to assume that all
religions are true most people assume that all religions are
false and that's wrong all religions are true and that's
very counterintuitive it's counterintuitive to question materialism it's counterintuitive to
to have a long time horizon it's counterintuitive to become
a monk and to reject food sex alcohol partying and
success and to go live in a cave it's counterintuitive
to consciously seek out pain for the purposes of spiritual
purification it's counterintuitive to put yourself in the challenging situations
it's counterintuitive not to multitask most people multitask focusing is
very counterintuitive focusing on just one thing it's counterintuitive not
to let go of emotions most people hold on to
emotions it's counterintuitive to see failure as an opportunity most
people get derailed by failure get demotivated turn into victims
it's counterintuitive to be inclusive most people want to be
exclusive it's counterintuitive to embrace change most people want to
resist change and deny change it's counterintuitive to give your
product away for free in business like I do with
actualize don't worry I guess it's super counterintuitive the way
that I do my videos because I got put I
put some of my deepest stuff out there totally for
free the kind of stuff that most people would charge
hundreds and thousands of dollars for in the self-help industry
I give it all away for free and that's super
counter to it it's also very emotionally difficult to do
that it's scary to do that because then you got
to worry about money it's counterintuitive to question assumptions it's
counterintuitive that bombing terrorists doesn't solve terrorism it's counterintuitive that
prohibition of alcohol doesn't stop alcohol but actually increases demand
for alcohol or for other kinds of drugs which is
why the drug war is such a miserable failure it's
counterintuitive that micromanaging produces worse results worse work than if
you actually trained your employees to work independently it's counterintuitive
to admit when you've been wrong or made a mistake
most people want to deny it it's counterintuitive to ask
wait a minute how could I be deluding myself it's
counterintuitive to notice your own hypocrisy your own self biases
and your own double standards usually we just notice the
hypocrisy and self biases and double standards of everyone else
but not ourselves we see their selfishness but not our
own selfishness we see their corruption and evil but not
our own corruption and evil it's counterintuitive that hard manual
labor pays less than white-collar work I remember when I
was young when I was a teenager like this this
really bothered me for some number of years I remember
I just I couldn't understand why the people who are
like working out in the fields picking strawberries in the
heat for 12 hours a day and like the construction
workers who are building bridges in the dirt on the
side of the highway in the heat why do these
people earn the most money why is it that the
CEO earns the most money that was so counterintuitive to
me I just didn't understand that because I would I
kind of assumed that the harder the work was the
moat the more despicable the work then the more they
should pay you for it because nobody wants to do
it and actually it's kind of the exact opposite of
that it's so weird he's counterintuitive enough to justify yourself
people love to justify themselves it's counterintuitive not to try
to change people oh man in relationships that's one of
the number-one mistakes is trying to change the other person
it's counterintuitive not to judge it's counterintuitive that money sex
fame and success don't produce happiness it'll take you several
decades to learn that lesson if not longer it's counterintuitive
that achieving your goals does not produce happiness that's so
counterintuitive because you think that the whole point of me
pursuing my goals is to become happy and then you
realize after you've done it for a long time that
it never works no matter which goals you achieve you're
always still unhappy because again happiness is never found in
the future it's always only found in the present and
you will never be happy until you deeply deeply fathom
that on a cellular level it's counterintuitive to be playful
and humorous during serious times it's counterintuitive to select a
good romantic partner most people select the entirely wrong romantic
partners both men and women do this women will select
the biggest [ __ ] who's the worst for her
and Men will select the most attractive and beautiful woman
that they can who's also probably the worst for him
it's counterintuitive to stay positive in a negative situation it's
counterintuitive to love those who harm you it's easy to
love people who never did you wrong would you still
love me if I harmed you of course not you
would hate me most you would the only reason you
think you love me is because I'm doing everything to
help you and as soon as I stop helping you
even for a second you're gonna start to hate me
that's how it works for most people it's counterintuitive to
forgive it's counterintuitive to study many different religious traditions it's
counterintuitive that Yogi's and monks understand deeper than academics and
PhDs it's counterintuitive that you're not your body it's counterintuitive
that abstract metaphysical questions actually have enormous practical consequences it's
counterintuitive that truth is directly accessible you would think it
wouldn't be but it is no mind is also highly
counterintuitive the state of no-mind you would think that if
you were in a deep state of no-mind all the
time that this would make you the least effective person
in the world and you would be bad at your
job and you would be bad in your relationships and
you would be blad bad with your planning and your
decision-making actually the exact opposite you are the most effective
in a state of no-mind which is why professional athletes
they train themselves when they're going through their routines or
like a martial artist when a martial artist is in
the ring and they're fighting or a boxers fighting what
do they do they sort of psych themselves up in
such a way that they enter a state of meditation
and no mind their mind is silent so that they
can just execute they can be in total flow no
thinking going on they are one with their actions rather
than having to logically think through every little detail of
their actions and in fact when you tell an athlete
who is going through their routine to start to think
about how they're doing their routine you ask them hey
can you tell me what you're doing that actually kills
their performance that's so counterintuitive it's counterintuitive that a chemical
like five amino DMT can produce enlightenment and yet it
can it always just makes me giggle when I see
enlightened masters and Yogi's and teachers and various Buddhists and
Christians and so forth when they hear about five Meo
DMT and how it produces enlightenment they all say no
leo is faking life but it's not real enlightenment so
counterintuitive you can't understand five Meo TNT unless you've actually
done it and experienced it for yourself I know enlightened
masters who will deny the power of five Meo DMT
and claim that it can't possibly produce enlightenment because enlightenment
is not a chemical well guess what five mm you
know DMT really isn't a chemical either that all gets
recontextualized once you're inside the trip and the last thing
is that it's counterintuitive that you are God how's that
for a [ __ ] counterintuitive mind [ __ ]
that you are God super counterintuitive especially for stage blue
people who believe that they can't possibly be God because
God is the thing that created me but that's too
deep to go into here and to explain so anyways
that's the whole list there's a lot of stuff there
I would encourage you to listen through this list again
because I went through it rather quickly now of course
you might say well Leo this is a 90 minute
long video so that wasn't quick it's still very quick
for the amount of content that was packed into this
list I could spend 90 minutes talking about every single
item on this list and in fact in some cases
I have many of my episodes what they do is
they take one of these items from this list and
then they just go into an hour or two of
elaboration on it talking about this counterintuitive point and then
when you learn about that at such a depth then
you say aha oh now I understand what I've been
doing wrong in my life in this facet of my
life and why I've been not getting the results I
want it's often scary to do the counterintuitive thing it's
scary to go against the naive common sense that you
have it's scary to go against the heard and it's
scary to go against your own fear ignoring fear in
itself produces fear that's how sticky fear is and it's
scary to go against your sort of base biological instincts
in programming so it's not enough just to know about
these counterintuitive moves you also have to be able to
execute the move see it's not enough for example to
know that you should be facing your fear you have
to actually face your fear which is a whole nother
step now most people don't even know that they have
to face their fear in order to conquer their fear
but even if you learn about it it's still not
enough you got to go one step further on all
of these points there's always a deeper step to go
down it's the one you're resisting and hit so why
is reality so counterintuitive well it's a tricky question the
way that I explain to myself is that reality is
nonlinear which means that it tends to fold in on
itself it's got a lot of interconnected variables and these
variables end up sort of folding in on themselves the
output from one system ends up being the input to
another system and this creates all sorts of chaotic and
twisted dynamics which is why naively changing a system which
is nonlinear often produces the opposite result systems often backfire
which is why good intentions are not enough you must
also understand how these systems actually work which is where
Systems thinking comes in and if you want an understanding
of what that means go check out my episode intro
to systems thinking where I explain that in a lot
of detail and also I have a whole subcategory on
my book list with specifically books about systems thinking go
check those out those are some very profound books that
will move you up to stage yellow inspire dynamics so
let's conclude by giving you my top five most counterintuitive
moves in life if you can manage to accomplish these
you will live remarkable profound life that almost no human
being ever lips precisely because they never it never occurs
to them to do this so number one is to
pursue truths that all truth at all costs even at
the cost of your survival and your self agenda very
counterintuitive to do that a lot of people tell themselves
that they pursue truth but they actually don't they confuse
the pursuit of truth with the pursuit of their self
agenda and these are two almost polar opposite things you
need to separate these out and to be able to
pursue truth even when yourself an agenda is threatened in
that process number two is to live selflessly commit your
entire life to living selflessly for others and for the
world and not just to satisfy your own little petty
needs step number three is to love unconditionally don't limit
your love to any one person or any one thing
radiate love love the stuff that normally people would hate
love that number four is to don't seek material pleasure
in other words reject hedonism super counterintuitive and number five
is to die die while you're still alive face your
own fear of death head-on and experience what death really
is which does not mean suicide so no suicide don't
physically harm yourself ever take good care of your body
but pursue death face it and find out what lies
on the other side of death that's possible to do
and if you do it you will live an extraordinary
life so in conclusion always remember to be looking for
that counterintuitive move even though I gave you a long
list here by no means is this comprehensive in fact
what I want you to do is I want you
to in your notes in your commonplace books perhaps if
you're keeping one which you should be start to make
your own list you can use my examples but then
create your own list of where you find the counterintuitive
moves in life if you're an artist if you're a
programmer if you're a film director if you're you know
an academic or a scientist or whoever you are wherever
you work if you're a businessperson start to make a
list of counterintuitive moves in that domain and also in
the other domains of life and that will help you
to really grasp this topic deeper alright that's it I'm
done here that's the end please remember to click that
like button for me and come check out actualize that
org that's my website there you will find the book
list my life purpose course my blog with various exclusive
insights that you won't find anywhere else and the forum
and the last thing that I'll say is that you
have to be very careful with these teachings with actual
eyes that are on teachings actualized Org is not to
be confused with an ideology nothing I say is to
be turned into an ideology nothing I say do I
want you to believe on blind faith that's a very
nasty trap I'm telling you these things because I want
you to verify them for yourself these things are things
that I have verified for myself in my experience or
that I'm in the process of verifying you know some
of these things take a while to verify you don't
verify it in a day sometimes it can take you
a year or five years or ten years to verify
something like enlightenment for example or one of these other
points you know so got to work at it but
then you got to verify it so actually has that
Org is based on the principles of empiricism you're testing
stuff out except rather than expecting other people to test
it for you and to deliver the results to you
you're you're doing the experiment internally on yourself you're testing
out your own emotions you're testing out anger and sadness
and fear and suffering and you're actually checking easly is
what Leo's saying really true about fear and anger and
suffering and is it really true if I take ten
days off and do nothing that I'll be creative is
that really true you you don't know until you do
it I mean it all sounds nice when I say
it I can convince you of anything I can come
up here and spout all sorts of [ __ ]
and convince you of it just because it's easy to
convince the mind all you have to do is spin
a good story and the mind will get easily suckered
into anything so you have to test this stuff don't
just believe me and just because I'm saying this don't
don't say all well yeah because leo is saying that
this stuff could be verified that means that ah that
that it must be true then no go verify it
what you might discover is that it's not true for
you because you have a different personality you have a
different brain type you how you see the world in
a different way than me you make different assumptions than
me you have different experiences than me you live in
a different part of the world than me right and
maybe you also discover just mistakes I make mistakes and
more often than just making mistakes I discover deeper and
deeper truths so stuff that I said five years ago
a lot of that stuff it's true in a sense
but also like I've outgrown that now that teaching could
still be helpful for you depending on what level you're
at but you know I'm always out growing my own
teachings because that's how it is so you've got to
really verify this stuff for yourself don't just get seduced
by my sweet words don't get seduced by my stories
and my reasoning or any of that none of that
makes any difference at all all stories all reasoning all
logic all evidence all it's all [ __ ] none
of it makes any difference the only thing that matters
is what you can verify in your own direct experience
is it true for you is enlightenment true for you
it doesn't matter whether I'm enlightened or not that doesn't
help you at all is it true for you do
you know what the word is pointing to is it
true for you that chasing food and sex and money
and cars doesn't make you happy check check you must
check because that's the only way you learn like doing
math the only way you learn math is by doing
math you will never learn math just by listening to
lectures about math so really hold yourself to this this
is I'm telling you this is probably the number one
key in order to get actualized at org information to
actually be working in your life you must be verifying
it testing it embodying it all the time and constantly
being on the lookout like a hawk for your mind
just taking this information on as a belief system that's
how religions get created and if you're not careful you
will turn actualize that org into a religion that's your
doing not my doing I've told you from the very
beginning that everything I say is nonsense all of my
words are just words they're just beliefs and concepts and
ideas they're just Maps they're not the territory I've told
you that from the very very beginning but have you
actually grasped that and are you actually now doing the
work that is required if you understand what that really
means make sure that you are so we don't get
this religious ideology nonsense going and stick around for more
and the idea behind actualize that org is that I
give you all this conceptual information but then yeah you
got to do all the hard work of embodying it
and also verifying it and through that your life transforms
and if you don't do that nothing really changes but
there will be a lot more concepts to come still
tons and tons of topics that we haven't covered not
even remotely covered that will change your whole life but
only if you act on them so stick for those
two out for those and make sure you act you
