            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PgJmngka9io' target='_blank'>What To Do Next After Learning About Enlightenment</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Enlightenment's impact on emotional state</b>: The idea of enlightenment can shock individuals, often causing emotional reactions like sadness, depression, and emptiness. Leo encourages acknowledging these emotional reactions but refrains from interpreting them as ravaging your life or being hard to deal with. Over time, one will desensitize to these initial reactions.
</li><li><b>Skepticism towards enlightenment teachings</b>: When confronted with these new enlightenment teachings, viewers should remain skeptical, understanding that Leo could be wrong or lying from their perspective. Such skepticism leaves one in an unresolved state which Leo claims to be beneficial for overcoming pre-established certitudes that may have unknowingly caused problems in one's life.
</li><li><b>Avoid rash decisions following enlightenment teachings</b>: Its important to resist making rash decisions or drastic changes in life following these enlightenment teachings. While these teachings provide a new perspective on life, they do not warrant drastic changes in behavior. Misinterpretations of these teachings could, paradoxically, lead to actions grounded in previous illusions rather than breaking free from them.
</li><li><b>The position of viewers post-enlightenment video</b>: Viewers of Leos video on enlightenment have gained knowledge but have not achieved enlightenment, and their life's circumstances have largely remained the same. Drastic actions like quitting jobs or leaving families will result in suffering, and enlightenment does not justify neglecting responsibilities or mistreating loved ones.
</li><li><b>The persistence of life responsibilities</b>: Despite intellectual awareness of spirituality and enlightenment, responsibilities continue to exist. Paying bills, maintaining decent human relationships, fulfilling obligations to families, and other routine activities are still important parts of reality and are not made irrelevant by the concept of enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>The limited immediate effects of the enlightenment video</b>: The enlightenment teachings provided in Leo's video do not cause immediate enlightenment or drastic changes in viewers' lives. The video is intended to provide information for those wishing to embark on a journey towards enlightenment, not serve as a catalyst for rash, radical life changes. It's important for viewers to continue maintaining their current lifestyle, activities, and responsibilities.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Healthy Habits and Routines</b>: After learning about enlightenment, one should continue their good health habits and regular routines like going to the gym. It's crucial not to confuse the new spiritual perspective with how one Handles their day-to-day activities. 
</li><li><b>Personal Development and Spiritual Alignment</b>: Enlightenment or spiritual alignment is the most advanced stage of self-actualization. However, each step in one's personal development, no matter how small, contributes to reaching this stage. It's essential to understand that even if one seems not ready for this level, each stage of growth builds towards this goal.
</li><li><b>Addressing Basic Life Issues</b>: It's important that basic life elements, like financial issues, relationship problems, or health concerns, are handled efficiently before focusing on spiritual alignment. If someone is dealing with critical problems, their priorities should first lie in solving these issues.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Enlightenment Timeline</b>: Spiritual enlightenment is a long-term journey that can span years. It is not a quick process, which is why it's crucial to handle the ordinary responsibilities of life such as maintaining a job and paying bills during this period. 
</li><li><b>Fundamental Personal Development</b>: If someone has significant issues in life causing them distress, they may need to work on basic personal development before being ready for spiritual alignment. This might include finding a better job, starting a business, or improving their relationship status. They need to be in a calm and stable life position to focus and do the spiritual alignment work effectively.
</li><li><b>Unavoidability of Internal Struggles</b>: Moving to a different place or environment doesn't make one escape from their internal struggles and sufferings. The ego and the illusion of self come with the person wherever they go, which is why essential personal development work and ensuring a comfortable state of life is crucial before spiritual alignment.
</li><li><b>Receptiveness to Spiritual Enlightenment</b>: Ideal spiritual alignment work requires a certain level of emotional stability, open-mindedness, and a clear, focused mind. People in dire life circumstances (e.g., homelessness or living in threatening environments) may not be receptive or able to carry out the commitment to spiritual growth. Therefore, it's necessary to first stabilize one's living conditions to create a conducive environment for pursuing spiritual enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Pacing oneself on the enlightenment journey</b>: Leo Gura compares the journey of enlightenment to learning math, suggesting that those new to the concept are in the "first grade," whereas enlightenment is like learning calculus. He emphasizes the importance of pacing oneself on this journey and handling the fundamentals first before leaping into more advanced stages.
</li><li><b>Dangers of extreme paths</b>: Gura warns against two potential extreme paths: completely quitting one's life to pursue spiritual enlightenment 100%, which is risky and can lead to detrimental conditions, and outright rejecting the idea of spiritual enlightenment, thereby choosing to stay oblivious or 'asleep'. 
</li><li><b>The Middle Path</b>: Gura proposes adopting a middle path. This involves not making drastic changes to one's life, keeping existing responsibilities such as family, work, school, self-help, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Meditation and mindfulness are recommended for fostering inner peace and focus.
</li><li><b>Basic issues as obstacles</b>: Stressing that issues like money problems, relationship conflicts, depression, or anger are fundamental hindrances that need to be addressed before progressing towards spiritual enlightenment. 
</li><li><b>Flexibility of Enlightenment Journey</b>: He emphasizes that one does not need more than 60 minutes daily for enlightenment practices, and that such time can be found merely by cutting off unproductive activities like needless internet use or excessive partying. 
</li><li><b>Stopping ego-driven pursuits</b>: Gura advises viewers to stop chasing external markers of success such as money, fame, sex, or love, all of which he identifies as distractions created by the ego that can quickly fill up a person's schedule and obstruct the path to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Eliminating Distractions</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of eliminating distractions from one's life to make room for enlightenment. This includes cutting back on media consumption, unnecessary activities, and futile pursuits such as chasing money, fame or love. 
</li><li><b>Depression Post-Realization</b>: He acknowledges that realization of the truth might initially cause a period of depression, but reassures that this stage is temporary and one will bounce back with time.
</li><li><b>Ego's Reaction to Enlightenment</b>: Leo warns about the ego's potential reaction to enlightenment. This reaction may manifest as a rebellious phase where one rejects the concept of enlightenment, turning their back on the path, and intensifying the pursuit of material desires and pleasures in life.
</li><li><b>Caution against 'Wasting Years'</b>: Leo warns against getting stuck in cycles of materialistic pursuits which may feel fulfilling due to ego-driven needs, but will ultimately lead to an unsatisfying life.
</li><li><b>The True Self</b>: Leo reassures that the realization of non-self, although scary, is a beautiful and liberating truth. He underlines that this realization is good news for the true self because it is an essential step in truly understanding one's existence.
</li><li><b>Promises of the Enlightenment Journey</b>: He reminds the viewers of the promises associated with the journey towards enlightenment - eternal happiness, eternal peace of mind, and immortality. He urges viewers to understand the profound nature of these promises and see the process in a positive light.
</li><li><b>Taking Control of One's Actions</b>: Leo reinforces the importance of actively working towards enlightenment rather than being discouraged by the perceived difficulties. 
</li><li><b>Sharing the Enlightenment Message</b>: Leo urges viewers to share the teachings of enlightenment, making the world a more peaceful and better place. He invites viewers to sign up for his free newsletter for ongoing videos on enlightenment and other personal development topics.
