hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
video we're talking about something very important I want to
talk to you about how to use books to transform
your life and to take your personal development to a
whole new level a whole new level what you can
do with books and the impact that just a simple
habit of reading books on a weekly basis can do
for you is enormous let's talk about that and at
the end of this video I'm going to introduce six
of some of the most important books that I think
you should be reading and also what's really cool is
that I've been working really hard to create a list
of all the books that I've read in the last
five years and I've read over 150 books amazing books
on self-help productivity success finances health relationships so there's so
much covered here and I'm going to share six of
my top books but really also I'm going to be
launching this master list of 140 and I keep I'm
going to keep expanding that list over the months and
I'm going to hope to grow it to 200 books
so that's going to be available to you if you
go to actualize that org slash books you're going to
get 12 freebie ones and then if you want to
get the full list it's available for a very very
low price anyway so let's talk about what books can
do for you why are books important why am I
even excited about talking about this it's very exciting because
to me what's really important in mastering your own life
is to be able to see 10 steps ahead you
want to develop that ability to see 10 steps ahead
when we're bored in life when we're growing up in
our teens we don't know much about life we're just
stumbling around basically like a blind person just feeling and
groping in the dark and seeing what we can grasp
and through this means you know our parents help us
or teachers help us our friends help guide us society
helps to kind of guide us and Corral us and
and put us down these tracks but as you're going
into your career into your higher education as you're getting
to more serious relationships you're starting businesses you're working on
your health so you're doing all the stuff you need
answers and you need wisdom you need the ability to
think and to see to strategize about your old life
very practically this isn't just philosophy or theory or something
that was written in science book this is something like
more about okay what do I have to do to
reach the kind of goals that I have in my
life how do I actually accomplish it how how have
other people accomplished it and this is where books come
in because if you just read a couple of books
that's nice if you watch a couple of my videos
that's nice if you maybe go to a seminar once
in your life that's nice or if you watch and
purchase an information product somewhere audio product video product it's
also nice but there's nothing quite like immersing yourself and
slowly building up this giant grand mental model of how
life works that's the whole point of a story that's
what I want to convey to you through these videos
is I want you to have a really accurate really
rich robust mental model that will allow you to make
informed choices it allow you to follow your values in
life it will allow you to achieve your goals to
find happiness and fulfillment all of these things these things
aren't easy to find especially considering that you're your own
unique person you have your own values your own set
of priorities in life and so you've got to custom
tailor whatever information you're finding out there to you so
that it's working for you and it's feeling nice for
you well to do that what you got to do
is you got to start putting this giant jigsaw puzzle
into place that's how I like to think of it
think about it as though you have this giant thousand
piece jigsaw puzzle when you're born and all the pieces
are flipped over and randomly scattered around and you don't
even know what the final picture should look like and
as you're born and you're going through life you're starting
to assemble these pieces this is just something that naturally
starts to happen and you're getting little faint glimpses into
what's right in this situation what's right in that situation
what do I want here how do I deal with
that relationship there and you're starting to put these pieces
into place but most people they have a very scattered
jigsaw and I would say they only have a couple
of percent less than 10% of the jigsaw puzzle pieces
put into place even when they're in their 40s in
their 50s they just don't have it because they haven't
spent the time nor have they immersed themselves in the
right information and wisdom which is contained in these books
to do it so the value of reading these books
is that once you start to read 20 50 100
200 books what starts to happen is that like a
lot of stuff gets interconnected in each of these little
pieces of the puzzle get put into place for you
and what's interesting is that every one of us has
our own puzzle no one has the exact same puzzle
so this is something that only you can do for
yourself you can't outsource this to somebody else you can't
just find some guru you can't just use all my
videos to do it now my videos are good even
if you watch a lot of them they'll get you
a lot of this jigsaw puzzle thing into place except
what's going to happen is that you're going to be
missing the finer details because what I'm doing in my
videos is I'm giving you broad overviews I'm painting with
with broad broad strokes I'm I'm using generalities when you're
reading a book first hand there's there's something different there
and I want to outline some of the value that
you get from doing that so here's why it really
is important to read lots of books one is that
it's a deeper source of information when you're reading this
book there's so much information even one of these books
that I'm going to share with you that you can
read it multiple times you can read a five or
ten times and still not mine all of it out
so there's a lot for me to cover that in
videos I would have to shoot twenty or a hundred
videos on that one book so that's the level of
depth that we're talking about here when I'm giving you
information in a video those are broad strokes I can't
capture all the nuances and those nuances they're fascinating and
they're also important because sometimes it's the little details that
really matter and when I'm telling you the details that
I feel are important that's not necessarily the important details
that you are going to need when you read a
book you might get something different out of it than
when I read a book so it's not smart to
just rely on me to do all the reading for
you and then to how to regurgitate you want to
take this stuff into your own hands at least if
you want serious result in your life this is how
you do it the next point is that these books
they're written by amazing people much more amazing that I
could ever hope to be and even you could hope
to be these people are world-class experts PhDs researchers like
literally geniuses of all the billions of people that have
ever lived these are like the best of the best
of the best people writing these books millionaires sometimes billionaires
write these books Yogi's enlightened masters like amazing business leaders
politicians inspire inspiring people very creative artistic people write these
books so if you choose the right books then you're
getting wisdom from just like amazing brilliant minds amazingly written
full of like wisdom and practical advice stuff that these
people have gone literally a lifetime through of world experience
and they've distilled their own best principles and practices and
golden nuggets and tips and now they put them in
this book format now you can read that what's nice
about that is that when you do read that it
convinces your mind on a whole new level and then
inspires your mind and motivates your mind on a whole
new level than just listening to me because honestly I'm
not the most successful person in the world like I'm
not that exceptional I'm not going to really wow you
with the stuff that I've done in my life like
I'm still working I'm still pretty young so I hope
to get a lot more success going forward and maybe
I'll get there 20 or 30 years from now but
right now I'm pretty pretty average and I don't have
a PhD I've done any research I'm not enlightened and
I haven't earned millions or billions of dollars so that
doesn't make me the most credible source I mean the
information that I'm giving to you it's all very accurate
it will transform your life if you listen to it
but see your mind doesn't work on that your mind
works on oh what's persuasive what gets me fired up
what triggers me emotionally and so part of that of
course is the like the gravitas the expertise of the
person the the inspirational accomplishments that this person has accomplished
so when you read a biography for example of Mahatma
Gandhi or mother Teresa or Winston Churchill or Benjamin Franklin
like these kinds of people like they inspire you these
are amazing extraordinary people that's why I love to read
from these experts because it does convince your mind in
a whole new level and if you're not reading these
books and you're just listening to me it's okay but
you can take it to another level the other benefit
of doing this is that over the long term as
you're reading these books even though you know reading one
book might not transform your life immediately the day that
you meet it what tends to happen is that if
you invest long-term in your own self and you read
every single week and you read every single month and
every single year then after a few years of doing
this like you said like I said you get this
mental model built up and the value of that is
that you know all the answers you still struggle you're
still going to have struggles in life usually gonna have
problems you're still going to fail in places but at
least you're going to know the the ways that you
should be doing things and you're going to be able
to do like a self diagnosis so you're never going
to become stuck in life I find that even though
I have a lot of challenges still in my own
life and I'm still working really hard a lot of
aspects of my life the one thing that I get
solace in and that gives me a lot of confidence
and comfort is that I literally do know like a
little bit about almost every aspect and facet of life
at least the facets that are really important to my
life and so I feel like I can't really go
down a dead-end not anymore like I know so much
about business and marketing and success principles and what happiness
is and about consciousness and enlightenment and about relationships and
about sexuality and about biographies and about history I know
so much about this stuff that it's pretty hard for
me to get lost in life I just don't see
that happening and even if I do like really screw
up somewhere make a really bad turn I can do
a self diagnosis and I can autocorrect this is really
important because some people they can really go down the
wrong road get really stuck and then not know what
to do and this is what leads to making really
horrible business decisions really horrible relationship decisions really horrible career
decisions like life decisions that can really do you cost
you lots of time cause you lots of money cost
you lots of just like pain and emotional heartache so
you can avoid a lot of that stuff by reading
these best principles again this is the wisdom of the
ages right here we have over three thousand maybe even
four thousand years of recorded history civilizations from the ancient
Egyptians all the way up to modern times and from
from 3,000 years ago all the way to the modern
times the best experts and sages across time have written
down their most important understandings of life in these books
so we literally know it all at this point sure
there's still stuff in science that we don't know that
is being researched actively every day but most of the
stuff that's important to living a fulfilling life to being
successfully extraordinary successful all that stuff has been known all
that stuff has been regurgitated and written about over and
over and over again and literally you can go through
and find who are the most successful the most credible
the most amazing people the most articulate people on these
subjects and then read those books and you get that
wisdom really quickly without having to make all the same
mistakes that they have made so this is a really
great way to to shortcut your way in life so
those are some of the benefits and what I want
to do with this list the reason I worked really
hard I spent many weeks here compiling this list going
through my whole book list giving you reviews putting ratings
on on each one of these books how important do
I think it is to your own development into your
own success because what I wanted to do is I
wanted to save you a lot of time this list
of 140 books and it's going to grow to even
more it'll take you quite a bit of time to
read it if you want to read all those books
it would probably take you two or three or five
years to get through it and it will take you
thousands of hours now I know you don't have that
kind of time I have that kind of time because
I do this professionally but you don't need to be
reading all hundred forty books to get the benefit there's
something called the 80/20 principle and that means that 80%
of your results in whatever you're doing in your life
is coming from only about 20% of your effort so
using this principle here apply to this reading list what
I want to do for you is I want to
give you kind of the best of the best even
of this list so that you can go through and
if you only have a couple of hours to read
every week you could be reading like the best of
the best of the best stuff that's out there and
not just stuff that's wise but also stuff that's very
practical I tend to favor and rate highly the books
that are filled with immediate techniques that you can go
and apply right now concepts that are just super fundamental
and responsible for your results not in just one area
of your life like a relationship problem but in all
areas of your life there are certain things in yourself
and your own psyche that you can work on that
will fix simultaneously many many areas of your life if
you just fix the root right that's why I like
working on inner game that's why I like working on
mindsets the subconscious mind working with beliefs because these things
tend to cascade and have ripple effects throughout your whole
life when you just fix like a problem in your
subconscious mind it tends to ripple through so what I've
done here is I've gone through and I've found the
best books from not just my own experience I mean
I've gone through and I've read lots of Amazon reviews
and of course I've filtered all these books out through
my own understanding and by reading them but I've also
solicited advice from world-class experts millionaires successful business leaders even
Yogi's so I've solicited advice from all these people to
see what are the books that they recommend and then
I've incorporated that in advice I've taken it I've read
those books and I seen okay is this really a
good book and then if it was and I added
it to this list and I gave it a high
rating so that's the value that you're that you're getting
here from this list one thing that I do want
to mention is don't be cheap with your personal development
and don't be cheap with buying books I like to
have actual physical copies of books and one thing that
I said to myself I remember I was very deliberate
about this about five years ago when I started this
journey as I said even though some of these books
you know buying 140 books that's pretty expensive that goes
into the thousands of dollars and I have spent thousands
of dollars on but I said to myself this is
one area of my life that I'm not going to
be cheap in I tend to be pretty frugal person
I try to save money where it's not it's not
giving me any good benefit but with books I tend
to overspend I tend to buy more and more books
sometimes I have ten or twelve books lying on my
bookshelf that I haven't even read just because I want
them there so they're motivating me and anytime I have
some spare time you can just go grab one of
those book and start reading it so don't be cheap
with your personal development in the end a book only
costs very very little $10 $20 like $30 is the
most you'll ever pay for a book but yet this
book that costs let's say $20 can have thousands if
not even millions of dollars of wisdom in it so
now imagine what happens if you have a stack of
those books and you're going through that stack every single
week imagine the benefits that has long-term for you it's
quite enormous so don't be cheap with that right it's
considering your short-term cost versus your long-term gains and reading
books is something that's not necessarily an immediate gain although
some books can give you amazing transformational like aha moments
right off the bat but most books it's about that
long-term building of mastery and expertise and that building that
grand model of life that you need to have to
really be successful the other thing that I think is
really important is categories of life right studying success is
something that I love so reading a book on success
or productivity is awesome but there's a lot more than
just that to self-help I think to be successful life
you need to be a really well-rounded person you don't
want to be too narrow-minded and so to this end
what I did is I categorized all the books on
my list into 16 major categories and I'm probably gonna
be growing the categories and changing them around to make
them even better but right now I have about 16
of them and I want to talk a little bit
about each one here because I think it's important to
discuss why these categories are critical to your success so
of course the first and most important category is success
psychology there's been a lot of amazing books written about
how to be successful in life how to be more
productive more efficient so success in productivities these two categories
are really important to study the next category is happiness
what is happiness how does happiness work especially right now
in the last 30 years there's been a lot of
research done in the positive psychology movement about what happiness
is it is good scientific research but there's also lots
of classic wisdom from thousands of years ago from both
Western and Eastern traditions about what happiness is and almost
nobody understands what happiness is it's a very counterintuitive concept
that's why I like shooting videos about it because it
it challenges some of the notions that society feeds you
and happiness is very different from what society tells you
it is so studying happiness and reading books on that
is very important there are some amazing critical books that
you must read about happiness that I'm really happy to
share with you on this list next is life purpose
for me life purpose is the whole reason that I
got into this thing with actualized org is about how
to create a passion life how do you find that
one thing that you get married to in your life
and I don't mean a person but I mean your
career your work what is your going to be your
creative contribution in life and what are all the challenges
with pursuing it because there are lots of challenges even
once you discover what your passion is you have to
go out there do the hard work and you're gonna
have a lot of limiting beliefs a lot of things
in your psychology holding you back from doing that so
there's important books you need to read on that the
next critical category is relationships and sexuality I find that
most people are horrible in relationships and they're not too
good with sex either so studying what is the difference
between the male and the female mind what are the
communication gaps that exist in intimate relationships how do you
build better friendships so not just intimate relationships but of
course platonic relationships fit into this category as well so
all of these things are really critical to understand also
how do you date better how do you attract that
man or that woman of your life that you want
to make your life lifelong partner how do you do
that how do you become really good with sex how
do you explore your sexuality in ways that the average
person has never explored and you can get like amazing
fulfillment out of doing that so that's a really area
that I'm really passionate about is this relationship and sexuality
category and I have amazing books on that I'm so
excited to share those with you the the next thing
is consciousness spirituality and enlightenment this is huge this is
something that I'm really immersing myself in right now this
is where you go after you do a lot lots
of kind of practical personal development is that you get
more into the more abstract ethereal consciousness work and enlightenment
work there's amazing books I have books that will shatter
your whole worldview if you read them unconsciousness just absolutely
amazing and it's not just theorizing it's not just philosophy
these books will get you amazing results in your life
because once you start to master your consciousness this is
like the most fundamental root of all your suffering and
problems in life is your ego and when you start
to work with your ego directly that's incredibly powerful so
I'm very excited about those the next category is health
and nutrition very big once you start to get into
self-actualization work one thing you're going to realize is that
oh I gotta get my health into shape the average
person in the society in America is horribly out of
shape destroying their body really setting themselves up for disaster
later on in life so once you become more aware
and you get other aspects of your life into place
your health if it's not being optimal right now then
you're going to want to optimize it and I have
good books on that the next one is money and
finances money is the currency that allows you to live
life and to do the things that you want to
do in life and money is a really tricky one
because a lot of the reasons people struggle with money
is because they have limiting beliefs and unrestorable mindsets about
it it's not so much about going out there and
earning lots of cash it's more about developing the right
mindsets that then allow you to conserve your money properly
earn more of your money properly and domestic properly and
I have amazing books on on that as well the
next category not quite as practical and as tangible but
it's still I think very important it's what I call
social science social science and his I think that to
develop a really solid mental model you have to incorporate
understanding of history and science and there's both the physical
sciences literally you should understand a little bit about physics
you should understand a little bit about mathematics and logic
and you should also understand the social sciences what's going
on with economics what's going on with psychology what's going
on with sociology and anthropology you got to know this
stuff it helps it's like the glue that cements all
the pieces together and of course going back in history
and taking the lessons of history is really important because
what reading history will teach you is it'll teach you
wisdom and judgment so that you're going to have a
really good idea of how to discern between what are
the situations that are really going to screw you up
one of the situations that are going to work out
really well one of the lessons from history it's also
going to inspire you it's going to show you trends
it's going to show you how to distinguish what a
trend is versus what a fad is so I think
that's important it's also extremely fascinating to me to study
all that stuff and lastly I think the most one
of the important categories is biographies biographies like we said
are written by these amazing human beings like the cream
of the crop of of all of Society of over
thousands of years so from these biographies you can read
and pick apart the lines and the minds of amazing
people creative people political people amazing business leaders sages spiritual
leaders like there's so much to mine and these biographies
they they show you the struggles that a human being
goes through in life and you can learn a lot
from that by reading it it's basically like living an
alternate life so the more biographies you read I find
it's almost like you've lived through somebody else's life through
their eyes and you've seen what they've seen so when
you read twenty or thirty biographies like wow you've got
so much more so much more stability in you as
a human being because it's like you've already lived through
30 different lives so those are the categories and there
are more categories but I think these are the most
crucial if you study all these and I've got books
in each one of them many many books then you're
going to be really solid what I want to encourage
you is I want to set a challenge for you
here if you're resonating with this and you're really excited
about taking yourself to the next level then come into
this challenge the challenge is to read one book per
week for a year so that equals 52 books in
one year it's not that hard to read one book
per week you just got to set that intention have
a stack of books and I've got you covered there
so we've got this list know what you need to
be reading pick the right books for you and then
just get to work and just steadily chip away at
it imagine the competitive advantage that you would have if
you read 50 books a year and then imagine if
you did that for five to ten years just think
about it that's 200 books maybe even 500 books just
think about what that could do for you across all
these different categories of life what would I do -
for your success what would that do for your relationships
what would that do for your career for your business
for your money for your health this would really transform
all those areas and it would just make you so
much more grounded as a human being think about the
competitive advantage this gives you over your colleagues at work
or competitors in your business or the competitive advantage it
gives you over other mates in finding that right girl
or boy that you want in your life or in
raising your kids it's amazing what this can do for
you so what I've got here and what I want
to share with you is I have six books from
my list these are some really foundational books that I
think almost everybody has to read and one of what
I want to do is give you a quick overview
of each one of them alright so let's start with
that and the first book that I have here is
called mastery by George Leonard this little book is my
top book of all time this is the most important
book I think that everyone has to read it's short
it's simple but it's packed with amazing wisdom about how
to become a master in anything in your life how
do you develop proficiency at it how do you become
world-class at so whether it's a hobby a sport a
game that you like to play like chess or poker
or your career a martial arts a golf or tennis
you know there's so many different areas of our lives
that we want to get good at how do we
do it and what are all the pitfalls involved so
here in this book George George Leonard he talks about
the mastery curve and a lot of the counterintuitive notions
that that we have about how mastery works mastery isn't
the way that we think it is when we start
and there are a lot of pitfalls and he talks
about the three common archetypes of failure that happen in
this mastery process and he also tells you how to
cultivate more of a mastery mindset so this one is
really critical to your success the next book is meditations
by Marcus Aurelius this is a just ago gem of
a book just packed with wisdom and it's over 2,000
years old these are the private Diaries and personal meditations
of a Roman Emperor one of the noble Roman emperors
this is one of the only surviving accounts of a
Roman emperors own writing and here we have a whole
book of it it's very readable and it's all about
stoic philosophy Marcus Aurelius was a stoic and Stoics had
a very old-school hardcore way of seeing life because 2,000
years ago life was very harsh and the issues they
dealt with was how do you live a virtuous life
how do you live a noble life when everybody around
you is doing stupid stuff or do even doing evil
stuff how do you avoid the pettiness of society keep
yourself grounded on course and how do you deal with
serious things like emotional disturbances from death so if people
are dying around you how do you deal with that
how do you ground yourself and keep yourself calm and
even minded something called equanimity how do you develop and
keep equanimity how do you find fulfilment in the simple
pleasures of life how do you deal with the chaos
of life because inevitably you can't control every aspect of
life how do you deal with those kinds of things
tons of wisdom about that right here the next book
is called authentic happiness by Martin Seligman Warren Seligman is
the father of the positive psychology movement he's one of
the fathers and he is doing a lot of research
right now University research about what happiness actually is a
lot of his research is distilled in this book right
here and this is cutting-edge research about how does happiness
actually work what are the counter to ative aspects of
happiness the stuff that we don't understand about happiness one
of the common pitfalls that people make he has surveys
in here he also has a great website his university
website that has some amazing surveys on it and one
of the things that's really important about this book is
that he he tells you the importance of understanding your
own top strengths as a human being he has a
survey in here to help you find your signature strengths
because one of the ways that he defines happiness is
living in alignment with your strengths so what are your
top strengths most people have no idea I didn't know
until I started reading this stuff and actually taking these
surveys so once you do find out your strengths then
you can start to align with those and develop that
authentic happiness next the six pillars of self-esteem by Nathaniel
Branden this is the ultimate book on working on your
self-esteem issues and your self-confidence issues so many of us
given the way that we grew up the way we
were teased or the problems we had in our childhood
as we were growing up have come out with low
self-esteem insecurities things that we're not confident in we might
feel like we're not good enough we might like we
might feel like we don't deserve happiness we might feel
like we can't be in a relationship we might have
issues being intimate with other people we might feel like
we are chronic failures and we are just filled with
self-doubt well this book helps you to address all your
self-esteem issues it goes into a lot of depth and
then you Brandon devoted his whole life to studying self-esteem
so he is the guy to listen to he's also
got great exercises in here and questions to help you
understand where your self-esteem issues are coming from next the
five love languages by Gary Chapman this book is critical
to having successful their relationships most of us find it
difficult to communicate with the opposite sex especially an intimate
relationship we tend to have a disconnect with the opposite
sex and this book it focuses on how love is
communicated so the premise here is that there are five
ways that human beings communicate and also receive love these
called the love languages and you need to know what
your top love languages and you also need to know
what your partner's top love languages most times you two
have different love languages and so this creates a communication
barrier because the length the language that you're communicating in
is usually the way that you like to feel love
but that doesn't mean that the other person will be
receptive to it and vice-versa so this book helps you
figure out what your love languages you can also figure
out your partner's a language and it gives you ideas
for how to communicate love languages so you can get
better at it and so that you can get better
at speaking the other language and then you get this
a much smoother relationship going and finally the sixth book
that I'm sharing here is called the righteous mind by
jonathan hate this is a book on social science and
really a social psychology and what it what it what
it asked the question here is why are good people
divided about politics and religion if you've ever noticed when
a political problem or a religious problem gets brought up
at the dinner table it tends to cause frustration and
bitterness and arguments and people tend to be very dogmatic
about those things why is this the case it's very
fascinating Jonathan Haidt he's a brilliant writer it's very easy
to read this book a very fascinating he presents some
of the research he's done he's a moral psychologist on
morality where is morality coming from what is responsible for
our moral decisions and it's not at all what you
think he goes into a lot about how the brain
works and he goes in a lot about the logical
brain but is the emotional brain and one of the
interesting discoveries that he shares here is that morality doesn't
come from the logical brain it comes from the emotional
brain so read this book to understand morality to understand
politics and religion a little bit more to understand why
people bicker so much to understand also the blind spots
in yourself this is one of those books that you
read to really open and expand your mind to make
you less dogmatic sometimes people ask me leo you talk
about being more open-minded how do I develop more open-mindedness
well by reading books like these these books show you
that the beliefs that you think you have that are
very solid actually aren't as solid as they appear to
be and this this gets you to be more open
open to new ideas open new perspectives so those are
