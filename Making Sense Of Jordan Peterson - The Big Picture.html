[Music] hey just in case you're not aware i did
launch a new second actualized channel recently called actualizedclips if
you're not aware that go check it out there's a
link down below subscribe all right now let's get into
the serious topic of making sense of jordan peterson this
is going to be an advanced very nuanced analysis of
jordan peterson why are we talking about him and who
is he well jordan peterson is a very well-known public
intellectual uh psychologist professor academic he has a lot of
content on youtube he has a very big following he's
made a lot of waves in the cultural zeitgeist in
the last four or five years or so and he
has a lot of influence on young people he teaches
psychology personal development type stuff self-help stuff some religious and
spiritual topics and he has some political takes which are
probably the most controversial part of his work so we're
going to be covering the full gamut here of all
of these and i think it's important because he has
such a big following a lot of people listen to
him trust him rely on on his ideas and opinions
and there are important traps that i want to point
out about that now this analysis here is going to
be nonpartisan it's going to be non-ideological i'm being very
deliberate to set aside all of my biases and prejudices
and to be very accurate in the analysis so i
will be as even-handed as possible i'm not just going
to be coming at it from a sort of a
bashing of jordan peterson and that's a lot of what
the critiques of jordan peterson are there's a lot of
critiques of him on youtube he's been critiqued to death
and in some way i feel sorry for him because
it's hard to take all these slings and arrows um
it's not easy to be him um but i mean
he's compensated well for it he's makes millions of dollars
and he has a big audience lots of clicks so
there's pros and cons to that lots of fame but
uh but anyways what i see and i actually have
i must admit i fell into this trap a bit
myself is that i see a lot of critiques of
jordan peterson's work coming from the left especially progressives and
socialist types of people because they object to some of
his conservative political positions and in that sense i too
object to some of his political positions i think that
his political part of his work is the weakest of
his work and you might be wondering well like leo
in the past you've said negative things about him yeah
i have mostly related to his political takes and to
his misunderstanding of progressivism so we'll be talking about all
this in a lot of detail i'm just kind of
setting this up for you um don't worry there's going
to be a lot of explanation and logic and evidence
that i will provide so so the problem though is
that jordan peterson's work is predominantly psychology and spirituality and
philosophy and self-help type stuff and i mean actually it's
not a problem it's a great thing and recently to
do this episode properly i went and i watched some
of his non-political stuff and i was actually quite surprised
at how good it is so if i was just
looking at his political i mean his philosophy and his
psychology there's a lot of good useful stuff there and
i can see why people love it and people get
value from it i've gotten value from it for example
he talks a lot about the big five personality profile
you know psychological test and i learned that from him
some years ago and that was that's very useful and
valuable to know he has a lot of this kind
of like technical psychological understanding um and actually a lot
of the stuff he teaches is very much what i
teach psychology philosophy even delving a bit into metaphysics and
epistemology spirituality that's what i teach that's my passion i
just come at it from a different perspective and a
different angle so if you're a jordan peterson fan and
you're following his work uh don't be threatened by by
this this is not going to be some sort of
partisan critique of him uh i will help you to
understand why jordan peterson's work resonates with you why it's
resonating in the cultural zeitgeist why he's so popular and
then i will also talk about various shadows within his
work limitations and how you can go beyond those and
really things that he is not able to teach you
because he doesn't fully understand yet and and i'll explain
that to you so this is not to bash jordan
peterson that's not the point here the point is simply
to give you a very big picture context of what's
really going on why people are so into jordan peterson
and also things they get wrong about jordan peterson bo
i'll be talking about things that conservatives get wrong about
jordan peterson and i'll be talking about things jordan peterson
gets wrong about himself and i'll also be talking about
what progressives get wrong about jordan peterson and i'll also
be talking about what jordan peterson gets wrong about progressives
so we're going to cover this from all angles here
all right but to do that we need to introduce
the model called spiral dynamics fans of mine should be
already very familiar with that but if you're new and
you've never heard of spill dynamics i have like a
10 hour series on spiral dynamics search for it you'll
find it watch it but i'll give a little brief
recap of it here because it's going to be central
for being able to make sense of the big picture
of what's going on politically culturally and intellectually in our
society and how jordan peterson fits into that so what
spiral dynamics is is a it's a psychological model coming
from the field of developmental psychology and jordan peterson himself
talks about certain aspects of developmental psychology such as uh
um various stages of childhood development piaget and things like
that maybe you've heard us of those things um but
he from what i understand he doesn't understand sprawl that
makes he's not even aware that it exists um so
these stages i'll be using to describe him these are
this is something i'm introducing to the situation to help
us make sense of it all right so spiral dynamics
is a model that was developed by claire graves and
by don beck and christopher cohen and this model maps
the psychological development and evolution of the human psyche and
it doesn't just do that at an individual level it
also does it at a collective level for entire cultures
and societies across the last let's say 2 000 years
of human history and so what's interesting about this model
is that it tells us that there's a very predictable
set of stages that a psyche goes through and these
stages are defined by one's values at each stage your
values are different and they evolve and they expand they
become more complex and nuanced with each stage think of
each stage as kind of moving upwards but also these
stages are not mutually exclusive in the sense that you
move out of one stage and you leave it behind
into another they build on top of each other so
really think of it like a building a skyscraper each
floor builds on top of the next so what are
these stages they're color coded to make them easier to
remember i'm not going to mention all of them spotlight
is a very complex model it can take you 20
30 hours to start to understand it's very nuanced this
is just a summary here a basic summary this is
all you need stage red we'll start there that's the
lowest one we'll be talking about here stage red next
stage blue stage orange stage green stage yellow and stage
turquoise so that's like six stages so stage red is
you might think of it as the warlord stage this
is back during the ancient roman times when city-states were
attacking each other conquering and pillaging and enslaving each other
it's that kind of mentality a lot of that exists
for example today with drug cartels in mexico they tend
to be very violent and they tend to resolve their
differences with physical violence and domination it's a very egocentric
stage we might call it egocentric red once society has
had enough of that it transcends that stage and moves
into the next one which is stage blue stage blue
is very easy to understand it's the religious stage these
are the religious ideologues not exclusively religious ideologues but that
is a good stereotype of it think of it as
the uh the mike pence's of the world or the
ned flanders's of the world so think of ned flanders
i don't know do you zoomers even watch the simpsons
anymore do you even are my are my references outdated
hopefully you know who ned flanders is so i mean
what is netflix ed flanders is the sort of stereotypical
stage blue he is this sort of good samaritan he's
a good christian he follows all the proper christian christian
protocols and rules and he he obeys all the laws
he's he's very conscientious he's very dutiful he's very disciplined
and very religious and he's all about family values and
following the proper norms etiquette personal responsibility part of a
community like a church community that he goes to this
is prototypical stage blue now of course stage blue is
not limited to christianity it can also include islam or
any religion it doesn't matter that's just sort of like
a flavor difference of what religion you happen to subscribe
to but generally stage blue are theistic people who are
god-fearing people who believe in an afterlife and are worried
about upsetting their god whatever god they pray to and
they take that stuff seriously it's not a joke to
them that grounds their life then once you exhaust the
limits of that stage you evolve the next stage which
is stage orange stage orange is the materialistic scientific rationalist
logical success-oriented stage think of as the sort of prototypical
example of this think of the wolf of wall street
or just wall street in general people who are only
after material success money fame personal achievement they're not constrained
by religious morals because they think religious morality is just
some sort of superstition from our ancestors it's unscientific it's
irrational these are people who pride themselves on their rationality
and their scientific understanding of the world and they subscribe
to a materialist worldview they look at the world as
a mechanical system like a clockwork that can be manipulated
to one's own personal advantage and so they do that
now what's important to understand is that each of these
stages you have to be careful not to judge it
as good or bad they're not good or bad each
stage can have healthy and unhealthy manifestations of it each
stage has a whole value set and this value set
is like a world view and it really shapes how
you see reality each stage is like being in a
different reality a bit it's like having different colored glasses
on with each stage and then you upgrade those glasses
and you see the world differently and it colors everything
that you do it colors what you think is worthwhile
to pursue what you think is meaningful what you think
isn't meaningful what you think is true what you think
is false and so on and these chain these things
change quite radically as you move up the stages but
it's important to understand that you can go overboard with
any stage for example you can have religious fanaticism that
goes into terrorism or into racism and nationalistic like nazism
at stage blue if it gets out of hand that
doesn't mean stage blue is evil just because nazis are
evil or whatever you might think likewise with stage orange
stage orange can be a healthy stage and it's all
these stages are necessary but it can also become toxic
sort of like you see in wolf of wall street
and some of the abuses on wall street and various
kinds of predatory capitalism where drug companies are exploiting you
and other companies are exploiting you and forming monopolies and
these sorts of things and where in general our whole
society becomes about just the pursuit of money and success
and that becomes very shallow and hollow and then once
that stage is exhausted you can move up into stage
green now stage green is the stage that jordan peterson
has the most problem with and i think his followers
have the most problem with which which is the social
justice warrior stage this is the stage of hippies people
who smoke pot people who are more loose people who
are maybe quasi spiritual maybe a bit new agey people
who are concerned about equality and fairness in the world
stage green is very much worried about all the oppression
that is happening and all the inequality in the world
it's worried about the poor people it's worried about the
animals sage green has an expanded sense of compassion there's
an opening of the heart when you get to stage
green and you start to realize how selfish you were
your whole life only worried about you or your little
tribe and so stage green expands its circle of concern
to include not just oneself or one fit one's family
or one's church or one's religion or one's nation but
the entire globe stage green cares about not just one's
own culture but all cultures that's why it's very multicultural
it cares about not just one's own race but all
races not just one's own ethnicity all ethnicity not just
one language all languages that's a very significant shift in
perspective and orientation in the world stage green includes a
lot of the socialists a lot of the social democrats
a lot of the progressives uh some liberals it includes
um the post-modernists the cultural marxists that jordan peterson rails
against that's all stage green and then there's yellow and
other stages we'll get to that as we keep talking
so let's just work with these stages why did i
just spend 10 minutes explaining this to you you might
think because if you understand this you're going to understand
everything that's going on with jordan peterson and with yourself
and with the culture wars and the entire political situation
that's been happening over the last five or ten years
it's very very helpful for making sense of reality so
why is jordan peterson's work so popular and why does
it resonate with people so much because especially in western
developed countries in america in canada northern europe the center
of gravity of our culture and our society is roughly
stage orange some people skew a bit from orange to
blue and some skew a bit from orange up to
green and so what we have in our culture is
we have a culture war between these two factions people
have segregated themselves into these two factions the ones that
lean a little bit more green are fighting against the
ones that lean a little bit more blue and the
ones a little bit more blue are fighting against the
ones that are a little bit more green so what's
characteristic of all these stages is that when you're in
this stage you're not aware that you're in this stage
and therefore when you look from your stage to another
stage especially if you're looking multiple stages across or even
just one stage across the world view of that person
seems so radically different from yours that you tend to
think of those people as stupid crazy criminal or insane
because it doesn't make sense within your worldview for example
when a stage blew religious ideologue looks at a social
justice warrior gay trans whatever person socialist they look at
that and they think that person is insane and then
when a when this socialist person looks back at the
stage blue religious ideologue he thinks that religious ideologue is
very regressive and outdated and traditional in his worldview and
so both of them misunderstand each other and then this
is what creates conflict it's simply a lack of misunderstanding
and refusal to move up the stages and to integrate
all of the stages into yourself remember it's not that
blue is worse or green is better it's all a
matter of perspective and all of them are necessary so
to have a healthy green you have to actually build
it on top of a healthy orange and a healthy
blue you can't just reject orange and blue and that's
a mistake sometimes green people make so back to the
point here society's center of gravity let's say in the
developed world is around stage orange maybe even skewing a
bit more green and where jordan peterson comes in is
that he talks a lot about the values that are
latent within religion and within ancient traditions the bible and
other spiritual texts he talks about that a lot why
because what's happened is that a lot of especially youngsters
these days zoomers who are in university and especially in
academia academia is a stronghold for stage green that's the
postmodernism stuff that's the gender rights stuff that's the anti-racism
stuff that's the antifa stuff all that socialism marxism all
of that and jordan peterson worked and grew up sort
of in that environment he's made his career in that
environment teaching in that environment teaching to kids to youngsters
in that environment and what he's noticed is that those
youngsters at stage green they lacked a foundation in stage
orange and stage blue because they were reacting against it
these stages is actually very easy because these stages are
sort of a cultural milieu in which you are born
and into which you are indoctrinated like a fish into
water and so if you grow up in a very
liberal part of the country progressive part of the country
a big city or you go to a big university
then you're just gonna you're gonna be fed the sort
of ideology of progressivism and stage green that value system
but you're going to probably miss out on valuable and
important lessons from the orange and blue and lower lower
value system and then because of that your life will
be lopsided and you will not be able to find
a sense of direction in your life you might get
lost in moral relativism not knowing what's good what's bad
anymore you might get lost in the confusion of gender
binary non-binary gender fluidity where you're not even sure you're
if you're male or female this confuses confuses you as
a kid when you're young and then you're trying to
make sense of all this and it's difficult and then
because of this you're not getting the kind of personal
success that you want in your life and then you
might get depressed you might get anxiety you might um
have relationship problems you might not be able to do
well in a in a marriage you might not be
able to raise your kids properly and all these sorts
of things that jordan peterson rightly points out and this
is a legitimate concern and in this sense he's doing
good and he's serving an important function because a lot
of people in society these days are missing out on
those traditional values think of stage blue traditional values as
what your grandparents were educated into and maybe even your
parents things like family values fear of god being a
good person being loyal being dedicated and hard working waking
up on time doing your chores on time being dutiful
being responsible being honest being polite basically ned flanders now
you might say to yourself well i don't want to
be like ned flanders that's ridiculous yeah it's a caricature
ned flanders is a caricature you don't have to be
ned flanders that's not what i'm suggesting but what you
should see is that there's value to some of the
qualities of ned flanders now he takes it too far
every one of these stages can take it too far
but what jordan peterson is actually pointing out to you
if you're stage green or even uh above that or
even below whatever but what he's pointing out is that
you've probably missed out on important lessons from stage blue
and then when you actually hear that from him because
you don't get it anywhere else in the culture because
the culture has moved on from blue and has sort
of neglected blue and so what jordan peterson's whole function
is in in society as a public intellectual is to
just remind us like hey guys don't forget about stage
blue there's important stuff there don't just throw it out
throw the baby out with the bath water sure you
might you might think that god doesn't exist or you
might think that some of the stuff in stage blue
isn't very good or superstitious but it's not just pure
superstition it's not just old hokey ideas there was actually
something important there for example the ability to discipline yourself
and to have work ethic this is important and if
you don't develop that you're not going to have a
healthy stage green after all how can you become this
effective socialist and marxist and fight against racism and other
things when you can't even discipline yourself to wake up
on time in the morning or to go to work
or to handle your finances this is where jordan peterson
gives you advice such as clean your room and of
course that's correct that's correct advice you need to be
able to clean your room but there's more to it
we'll discuss that as we go there's more to just
being a good human than cleaning your room and taking
care of your own personal stuff but since you are
sort of the atom of your life everything in your
life hinges upon you if you don't get this thing
right here if you can't discipline yourself you can't wake
up in the morning you can't feed yourself properly you
can't be dutiful then you can't really grow beyond that
and it's going to lead to dysfunctions within your personal
life and also in your family life and in your
society if everybody's doing that and that's what jordan peterson
is really trying to point out to you and that
is valid and that is important the mistake that stage
green and orange people have made is that they have
dismissed the importance of stage blue they've demonized it and
made a shadow out of it and what i mean
by that is that there are certain aspects of stage
blue that they don't they don't like and it's easy
to make a straw man out of any of these
stages so the straw man that we can make out
of stage blue is that they're fascists they're racists they're
nationalists they're nazis they are intolerant they're hateful this is
the typical straw man that progressives make of stage blue
conservatives and it's easy to make that straw man because
when you look through human history you can see a
lot of the excesses of stage blue which were very
nasty and murderous and oppressive you see things like slavery
and racism and nationalism and xenophobia and genocide ethic cleansing
these all stem from stage blue you see holy wars
wage from stage blue because at stage blue a society
is theocratic it tends to believe that its religion is
the only true one and all the other ones are
satan worship and so naturally then it was to defeat
them and have a monopoly on religion so what happens
with these stages is that the stage is played out
to the hilt until it becomes so extreme and so
excessive that all of us collectively recognize that you know
it's gone too far and that happened for example with
stage blue over the last couple hundred years we've had
so many holy wars we've had so many genocides we've
had world war ii effectively started by stage blue nazis
um and many other examples like this that could be
cited we've had all these examples and we've seen that
it's it's too limited it produces too much suffering and
so america itself was actually founded on sort of a
radical stage orange idea of religious tolerance america is not
founded on the idea that america is exclusively christian it's
founded on the idea that we've we've had societies in
the past where they were theocratic and it led to
suffering and evil and so now what we're going to
do is we're going to stop we're just going to
stop like right from the beginning we're going to stop
this at its root this idea that you should kill
people for differences in religion and so now today very
few people in america and in the developed world get
killed for differences of religion we expect religious tolerance that's
actually written into the constitution because the framers of the
constitution were actually pretty advanced cutting edge stage orange thinkers
and back then stage orange was not a very common
stage the constitution is not a stage blue document but
anyways so um so we've evolved beyond that but now
we're living in a sort of materialistic stage orange world
view and that's great there are some great aspects to
that because it's more scientific it's more rational and it's
true that there were certain superstitions and irrational aspects that
were unscientific and even untrue in the stage blue world
view that's correct and the stage blue worldview tends to
be very dogmatic and intolerant at its extreme and that
becomes a problem so you transcend that with stage orange
you have a more global mindset a more scientific mindset
and that's good and you might think well great that's
it we we're done but we're not done because and
here's where jordan peterson comes in is he would say
now all you're living for is you're living for materialism
you're living this never-ending rat race of acquiring more and
more fame sex money and success and while some of
that is good it becomes a problem because your life
then becomes hollow your life is not about anything deeply
meaningful or spiritual at stage orange you've de-spirited your life
and reality you've demystified everything to death to the point
where now life is purely utilitarian and even though you
might think that's a good thing it actually comes back
to bite you in the ass because your life loses
meaning and depth which is why jordan peterson talks a
lot about values and meaning and depth and a spiritual
component to life because what he's really hearkening back to
is that old-timey traditional stage blue and what he wants
to tell the orange and green people is that look
you guys are overlooking something it's not as simple as
that our ancestors lived with these original uh religious ideas
for thousands of years because they were idiots and just
superstitious and unscientific and irrational there was some of that
there was plenty of that but also there were deep
truths contained within these religious traditions that gave meaning and
purpose to life beyond merely material existence and if you
ignore that that will create a dysfunctional life and a
dysfunctional society it will lead to things like the the
breakdown of the family unit it will lead to sort
of hollow political activity that isn't grounded in anything deeper
and it will just leave you like a leaf blowing
in the wind going back and forth not knowing which
way to go not being able to discipline yourself in
your life and and order your life towards some sort
of higher vision and see if you're someone who didn't
have that in their life and jordan peterson comes along
and tells you about this for you that's a big
aha moment you say ah aha that's what i've been
missing i grew up in this stage green culture in
this stage orange culture i didn't even really know or
think deeply about stage blue or that it was valuable
or important and i've been just floating around i haven't
been able to make anything in my life and then
because of this i was depressed and anxious and nihilistic
and uh i wasn't able to have proper intimate relationships
and i wasn't able to build a proper career and
these sorts of things and then and now that jordan
peterson has shared these insights with me now i can
move in some direction and that's very good and very
useful so what's the problem well the there are multiple
problems here we're going to discuss this in layers the
first problem is that even though he's teaching you these
things jordan peterson himself has a stage green shadow as
i would say he himself is a very nuanced and
sophisticated thinker unlike many progressives smear him as he is
not a racist he's not a sexist he's not a
homophobe he's not a transphobe he's not a fascist he's
not a crypto fascist he's not a nationalist and he's
not a religious fanatic even though he says he believes
in god effectively and he sort of comes from the
judeo-christian worldview that he was raised into i believe so
um i would put jordan peterson somewhere around uh orange
slash yellow he actually has some very sophisticated tier 2
stage yellow thinking abilities but he can't fully go into
stage yellow because he's stuck with a shadow a very
significant shadow of stage green and that's holding him back
obviously he's he's very much mastered stage blue as well
um the healthy aspects of stage blue and that's that's
one of the things you can admire about jordan peterson
is that he is a good role model of healthy
stage blue he doesn't take it too far he doesn't
take stage blue into nationalism or fascism or racism or
sexism or these sorts of things if you think he
does as a progressive and you disagree with me consider
the possibility that you yourself have a stage blue shadow
and you're not looking at the situation objectively you have
biases that are clouding your vision but let's wait about
those biases let's talk about jordan peterson's shadow so what
is this shadow what is a shadow well he talks
about shadows the shadow is basically any aspect of consciousness
or reality which you disown and deny as being part
of yourself it it's something you call other to you
and something you despise and hate and you refuse to
integrate into yourself so for example if you think hitler
is an evil monster then hitler is your shadow by
making him your shadow you refuse to integrate him and
to really fully understand where he was coming from now
don't get me wrong i'm being very nuanced here i'm
not saying that hitler is an angel and that there
aren't serious problems with hitler there are very serious problems
with hitler but if you think he's just pure evil
and a monster you've turned him into your shadow you
can turn anything in reality into your shadow so what
jordan peterson has done is he's turned stage green into
his shadow the social justice warrior types and the problem
fundamentally is that those of you who are following jordan
peterson precisely because perhaps 80 to 90 of his psychological
material non-political lectures and things are very good psychology and
you should learn that the other 10 to 20 percent
is coming from his shadow he can't really help but
to exude his own the shadow comes through in his
work in his talk and the way he carries himself
in his attitude in his world view he can't help
you can't help it nobody can your shadow will come
through if you speak long enough and so his shadow
comes through but most of his audience are not subtle
enough to understand they don't make these fine distinctions between
stages and shadows and things they don't understand and so
they get indoctrinated with his shadow they get corrupted by
his shadow he kind of sneaks it in there he's
doing this unconsciously i'm not saying he's doing this deliberately
and um and that's a disservice to the people following
him because then you are infected with his shadow and
that becomes your shadow and this is especially problematic if
you lean conservative because jordan peterson has certain conservative leanings
and biases it's especially problematic if you lean conservative because
it's just going to reinforce his shadow against this stage
green is just going to be reinforced it's going to
turn into a confirmation bias into your own mind in
your own mind and then you're just going to buy
the whole thing hook line and sinker and you yourself
will get stuck at stage blue and orange and can't
advance further the point of this whole conversation is to
unleash your mind from all of the obstacles so that
you can get to the higher stages beyond green to
yellow and turquoise so where does jordan peterson's shadow come
from and what is it exactly well jordan peterson understand
i mean he's he's fairly old so he grew up
during the cold war era he talks a lot about
totalitarian regimes in soviet russia and in china maoism um
marxism the old school marxism soviet communism stalinism and all
of the evils of this and you know a common
framing by conservatives is that you know communism has killed
100 million people in the last century and so he's
coming from this perspective and when you're coming from this
perspective and you see college kids talking about socialism you
see he makes a conflation between the two and he
thinks that what's going on in universities today on university
campuses with gender fluidity and gender equality and sort of
anti-racism and antifa movements and and mark cultural marxism this
course stuff that this is just a rehash of what
happened in soviet russia during the the the red revolution
there and this is a very big mistake from this
he creates a shadow out of green because he misunderstands
green anything you misunderstand about reality becomes your shadow if
you don't like it and so this is a very
common conflation that's made deliberately by many conservatives especially on
fox news oan and all the the talk radio and
even on youtube conservative youtube they keep making this conflation
between stage green socialism or social democracy versus the old
school style venezuelan or um uh sort of russian soviet
or maoist communism when actually that sort of maoist stalinist
communism that wasn't staged green that was stage blue that's
the crucial mistake that conservatives make and they make that
mistake because they're paranoid the way they frame in their
mind what stage green is they're so scared of it
because they conflate it with the evils of the last
century that in their mind that justifies opposing it and
demonizing it at any cost they're not looking at it
objectively so what stage green actually is is it's not
the the communism of old of your granddaddy what it
is is it's more like the social democracy of the
northern scandinavian countries yes it could be socialism but it
doesn't even have to be socialism the scandinavian countries are
not truly socialist they're social democracies they still have free
markets and so on and really they're good places to
live the happiness index in northern europe is the highest
in the world the level of corruption in northern european
countries is the highest or i'm sorry the the index
for the level of corruption which means that the higher
the indexes the lower the corruption in the country is
actually higher than in the us that means the us
is more corrupt than nordic countries and levels of social
equality and fairness are better in nordic countries than they
are in the united states the nordic countries are under
no threat of turning into a stalinist dictatorship and to
frame them in that way is a deep misunderstanding of
human psychology not just politics human psychology and cultural psychology
that's the power of this spiral dynamics model that i
shared with you so you have to be very careful
about straw manning these different stages it's very easy it's
very easy if i wanted to straw man stage green
i could say oh they're all communists and they're all
like antifa and they're all going to turn violent and
they're all going to go crazy and they're going to
tax us to death and then that's going to lead
to the destruction of of america yeah if you frame
it that way in your mind then yeah it seems
stupid but that's not what stage green really is you're
misunderstanding it see i could also straw man stage blue
i could say that if we follow jordan peterson's advice
of stage blue and we go back and we start
to study the religious texts and so forth we're all
going to become irrational superstitious we're going to bring back
the witch trials we're going to start burning wishes at
the stake and we're going to uh turn into nazis
because of nationalism we're all going to turn racism and
then we're going to bring back slavery see that would
be what it's like if i was very paranoid stage
green and i made a shadow out of sage blue
even though conservatives like to say that 100 million people
were killed by communism again you have to be very
careful with how your mind is cherry-picking the data and
the facts maybe that's true but you also have to
weigh it against how many people have been killed in
the last century by capitalism how many wars were started
by capitalism how many trillions of dollars have been lost
how many people have been exploited in sweatshops all around
the world how many people have had their incomes siphoned
off how many people have suffered under opiate and died
from opioid addiction which is pushed by by giant capitalistic
corporations with predatory marketing and so forth how many people
have been scammed of their life savings how many people
have lost their retirement savings in wall street crashes and
and ponzi schemes how many democratically elected foreign governments were
deposed and undermined into totalitarian dictatorships and theocracies by u.s
intelligence agencies for the purposes of advancing capitalist interests of
giant multinational corporations you see so this idea that capitalism
is innocent it's not millions many tens of millions of
people have been exploited and deeply pained and even killed
by capitalism so it's not so obvious how to weigh
these things properly so don't just my point here is
not that capitalism is is evil or that socialism is
great my point is that these things are much more
nuanced and complex than you think and they're more nuanced
than jordan peterson portrays them to be and that concern
that conservatives portray them to be and that it's very
easy to make straw men out of these different stages
so you have to be very careful and this is
not just a mistake jordan peterson makes it's a mistake
his followers make it's a mistake conservatives make it's a
mistake progressives and liberals make too because most of the
critiques of jordan peterson that you will find on youtube
are going to be reactionary critiques coming from stage green
which has developed a shadow out of stage blue and
stage orange and therefore they're not able to properly understand
jordan peterson and the value that he brings therefore they
discount any of his value and that is incorrect and
that's why we're having this conversation so that we can
make these distinctions in your mind so that you have
a clearer picture and you don't fall into these simplistic
traps and shadows and then you're free to move up
and grow yourself more which is ultimately what we all
want jordan peterson wants that i want that we all
want that it's just a matter of how do you
do it and it's trickier to do than than most
people think so jordan peterson talks a lot about for
example that stage green is bad because it wants equality
of outcome and equality of outcome is something like we
need to have an equal number of men and women
bricklayers we'd have equal salaries for men and women regardless
of how hard they work or how qualified they are
and of course that's ridiculous but that's a straw man
of stage green that is not really what stage green
wants what stage green is about if you really want
to understand stage green stage green before we actually get
into that let me let me bring in another point
that jordan peters talks about a lot which is hierarchies
he rails against stage green for wanting to level all
hierarchies and he says that there are natural hierarchies and
hierarchies are important and he criticizes stage green for demonizing
all hierarchies as being oppressive and just all about power
and he counters that by saying that the majority of
hierarchies are not corrupt they're not oppressive they're not about
power they're about competence so what he means is that
if you go to work and you have a boss
chances are your boss is not your boss because he's
some sort of power-hungry tyrant who domineered everyone in the
workplace and put himself at the top and crowd himself
king but rather he got promoted from within because he
was the most hardworking the most loyal to the company
and has the most experience and takes on the most
responsibility and therefore he's your boss because he knows more
than you he's willing to take on more responsibility than
you he's willing to work longer hours than you and
therefore he should get paid more than you that's only
fair that's how he would portray the situation and that's
generally true i would say but the way that a
stage green person would counter that is by saying yes
that's generally true but that's only true maybe in 80
of the cases let's say 80 of hierarchies are actually
valid and genuine based on competence and merit and they
don't need to be destroyed but that still leaves 20
which are corrupt 20 percent in which the person holding
the position of power is only holding that position not
because he's the most creative or the most selfless or
the best qualified but because he's an [ __ ]
and he's entitled based upon inheriting it from his family
or something like that or just by playing manipulative political
games and honestly there's a lot of truth to that
there is maybe 10 or 20 percent of people in
positions of power who only got there because they are
sociopaths and sociopathy is actually a very effective strategy for
gaining lots of power and wealth and sex and fame
and the epitome of this is of course donald trump
what is donald trump if you look at him objectively
he is not qualified to do almost anything the only
thing he's good at is spin [ __ ] and
con artistry that's his skill but that is not a
legitimate skill that's a corrupting skill he's not actually competent
at anything he does every single one of his businesses
fails including his presidency he's not competent at governing he's
not competent managing people he's not confident of hiring people
he's not competent at finding loyal people who have a
high integrity because he has none himself and so because
of this um and yet look and yet in our
society the way our society is structured he was still
able to rise so high and achieve so much and
and get hundreds of millions of dollars well i mean
he inherited 450 million dollars from his daddy is that
truly competence that's what the progressives would say and here
jordan peterson has a problem because he doesn't sufficiently acknowledge
that a significant number a significant percentage up maybe up
to 20 or even more of our hierarchies and our
social systems are corrupt in this way and that this
hurts a lot of people down below jordan peterson portrays
it as stage green wants to destroy all hierarchies and
maybe a few radical and dumb stage green people do
want that but the majority of stage green people do
not want that if you look at the way that
the scandinavian countries are structured there's still plenty of hierarchy
you're not getting rid of hierarchy anytime soon that's not
something you need to be paranoid about but we do
want to level some of the bad corrupt parts of
hierarchies we did that in the past for example there
used to exist monarchies now they're almost all gone what
happened well we recognized that that was a corrupt hierarchy
it was oppressing lots of people hurting lots of people
and we rebelled against it collectively as a society and
we we said no and today we're happier for it
right do you want to live under a monarchy do
you have a problem with the monarchy then you got
a problem with hierarchy and this isn't just about government
it's also about institutions it's also about academia um a
lot of academia is corrupt like the professors and the
administrators of many universities they're not there because they're the
most intelligent and competent people they're there because they're the
best at bringing in business at doing marketing at using
shady manipulative tactics through corruption through just family lineage through
their wealth that they inherited through the last name that
they have a lot of the ivy league schools are
all about that it's all about the sort of legacy
model it's not about truly which students are the most
intelligent it's really like getting into harvard you'll have a
better chance getting into harvard not if you're more intelligent
but rather if your daddy went to harvard that's how
it works and if he can give them a million
dollar donation that's how it works so is that a
competence hierarchy no [ __ ] no that's really corrupt
and it's not healthy for our society that's what stage
green is concerned about and stage green is also concerned
about the influence of materialism in our culture especially money
and politics the way money corrupts everything the way that
you can just buy anything you want with money including
power and crush people underneath you see stage green to
understand it you have to radically expand your sense of
empathy and compassion for other people and even animals for
that matter which is why veganism is is very prominent
stage green because you expand your compassion you start to
empathize with the suffering of others the suffering of the
poor the downtrodden the marginalized the minorities the third world
countries you start to care about these things you want
to help all of these uh people and and beings
um and so you become more open and you become
more sensitive to how the capitalist system is rigging the
game in such a way that it becomes very difficult
to succeed or advance yourself as an individual for example
stage green person looks at the health care system in
america sees tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily not
because they can't afford health care but because our health
care costs are so much more than they need to
be compared to other countries like in europe like our
prescription drug costs uh you know a drug that costs
in europe ten dollars might cost a thousand dollars in
the u.s and the only reason that is is because
of the health care cartel or mafia that has been
entrenched and established in america purely for profit now we
ask ourselves is that a healthy way to structure society
is that a fair way to structure society where just
because some giant multinational pharmaceutical company has billions of dollars
in the bank it can exploit it can buy politicians
bribe them to change the laws change the tax system
such that everything advantages that company that company becomes a
giant monopoly buys up all the smaller companies jacks up
the prices on all the drugs and then your mother
who has cancer can't even afford to pay for her
cancer medication and then she dies is that a society
you want to live in of course the answer is
no do you want to live in a society where
for example a giant chemical company has so much wealth
and has monopolized so much of the market it has
so much power that it can buy its own senators
it can pay those senators to deregulate chemist chemical regulations
it can then it's then allowed to dump metric tons
of mercury and lead and arsenic from its chemical production
facilities directly into streams and lakes and ponds and oceans
from which your fish and your food and your water
comes from and then your kids drink the water supply
into which was dumped arsenic and radioactive materials you know
upstream they dumped it then it went downstream into your
water supply and then your children drink this and then
your child develops a mental disorder like adhd or autism
or some sort of retardation or autoimmune conditions and disorders
or cancer and then your child has to live with
that and then you have to care for that child
for the rest of your life is that a society
you want to live in the answer is obviously no
but the problem with jordan peterson's politics and with conservative
politics is that they don't acknowledge this problem because in
their world view everyone should be just responsible for themselves
this is the sort of libertarian worldview it's the idea
that well we're all just individuals man i'm gonna do
what's good for me and you do what's good for
you and then uh everything will be fine but it
won't be fine because if i'm just an individual and
i'm just behaving selfishly as though i'm not part of
a community of 8 billion people then i can amass
billions of dollars and i can dump radioactive material and
poison into your water supply and you won't be able
to do anything about it because you're just an average
person you can't sue me i've got a hundred lawyers
that i can afford you can't even afford one and
what good is suing me gonna do once your kid
already has cancer and dies are you gonna get satisfaction
from winning a suit against me and even if you
do i'll pay you 50 million dollars but you know
how much i earned from dumping that poison into the
water supply i earned a billion dollars so to me
to pay you 50 to get a billion no problem
that's effectively what libertarianism leads to so what stage green
wants if we're going to steal man stage green what
stage green wants is it wants a more fair society
it does not want equality of outcome what it wants
is actually it wants equality of opportunity so jordan peterson
here misunderstands and mischaracterizes stage green because he doesn't integrate
it properly he says that sage green only wants equality
of outcome no what stage green is doing in stage
green is looking at equality of outcome in order to
judge whether there is truly equality of opportunity you see
because how do you measure whether equality of opportunity exists
how do you measure whether our society and our social
system our police system and our military and so forth
are academic systems how do you measure that these systems
are actually fair and honest and uncorrupted well one way
to do it is to actually look at the outcomes
you can't completely ignore outcomes now that doesn't mean that
everything has to be split down the middle that doesn't
mean in the way jordan peterson says that we need
to have an equal number of of bricklayers men and
women that's a ridiculous straw man no reasonable intelligent stage
green person is asking for that if they are they're
being stupid but they aren't asking for that what they're
asking for is a redress of the corruptions of the
past it was true that there was slavery in the
past it's still true that even though slavery is gone
and official segregation is gone there are still racial problems
within these various systems we can debate about to what
degree it exists there and what kind of remedies need
to be taken to correct it but the stage green
person generally errors on the side of giving benefit of
the doubt to the marginalized and to the downtrodden the
stage green person wants to rectify some of the inequities
of the past the conservative stage blue and orange person
says now we don't need to do that that's stupid
and the reason they feel that way is because they
lack the empathy that comes online at stage green see
if you had a child who was gay or trans
or had cancer or was poisoned by a by a
pharmaceutical company or was addicted to opioids because of the
predatory marketing that these giant companies like purdue pharma did
um now they're out of business uh if that happened
to you you would suddenly develop a lot of empathy
but if you live a comfy life with a decent
amount of money where you're not bothered by these things
these things haven't personally touched you yet then you can
you can act as though these things are not important
so hierarchies are not bad we will not be flattening
all of them that's not going to happen stop fear-mongering
about that but some hierarchies do need to be questioned
because they are oppressive is everything oppressive no the majority
things are not oppressive in society but some things are
and those things are worthwhile to to question and to
change and that's what progressives ultimately want see when you
see it in this light all of a sudden progressivism
and social democracy doesn't seem so radical so the problem
is when you start to portray people like bernie sanders
and aoc as though they are antifa thugs who want
to take over the country through a revolution maoist style
and then you know execute all the capitalists and then
put in a totalitarian regime i think that jordan peterson
honestly has that kind of fantasy in his mind about
what the excesses of stage green are and that is
precisely incorrect and i think the danger is that if
you watch too much of his political talk he will
sneak that sort of paranoia into your mind one of
the mistakes that jordan peterson makes is that because he
worked his whole life in this stage green bubble of
academia he was overly exposed to the excesses of stage
green through academia and he overestimates how much of that
is a problem globally and specifically even in in canada
or in america the majority of the world is below
stage blue in their development stage blue or below and
the majority even in america is stage orange stage blue
it's not even at green yet so the idea that
green is the dangerous stage this is a misguided idea
yes there can be dangers to green i'm not dismissing
that yes sometimes green can even be violent for example
with antifa sometimes they'll throw a brick through a window
sometimes they maybe even kill somebody but you have to
understand that every stage kills people and in general the
higher your stage the less people you kill so if
we're going to be comparing numbers of how many people
killed who then and the dangers based upon that then
i could easily make a straw man out of stage
blue and i could say well the things that jordan
peterson is teaching is going to lead to white nationalism
and fascism and it's going to lead to many people
getting killed and that is actually the greater danger the
danger jordan peterson misunderstands the danger the danger is not
that we're going to go to hog wild on stage
green and then totalitarianism will be installed in america the
danger is actually that we're not going to go green
fast enough and that many people will suffer and die
needlessly from that and also that there's going to be
a backlash from stage blue and then if you enable
stage blue too much that actually turns into what we
see with trumpism and the kind of stuff with the
with the riots of um um you know of the
capital the insurrection of the capital now if you're concerned
you'll say oh leo but uh but what about antifa
yeah antifa is creating problems for stage green and i
wish it didn't exist because it makes stage green way
too easy to demonize into straw man if antifa didn't
exist that image problem would be gone but it does
exist so there are excesses but the excesses of antifa
pale in comparison to the excesses of stage orange and
stage blue a lot more people die of stage orange
and blue than a stage green this is what's being
missed also what's being missed is that every stage comes
in a certain sequence and you cannot skip stages and
you must go through all the stages if you want
to get to the higher stages and that this entire
process is inevitable therefore this idea that if america right
now is center of gravity orange leaning a little bit
green already evolved out of stage blue what does that
mean based on this model it means that in the
next 50 years the country is moving in this direction
so what you need to come to accept as a
conservative is that no matter how much you whine and
[ __ ] and moan and kick and scream no
matter what excuses you make no matter how you vote
no matter how much you resist you can even start
a civil war if you want but none of that
will prevent the country from moving towards green over the
next 50 years it's going to happen you can't change
that you can only resist it and slow it down
and if you do you're going to create more suffering
and more people will die and be harmed as a
result of that we are facing genuine and real problems
in the world that cannot be solved at stage orange
the limitations of orange are becoming abundantly clear with climate
change with pollution with giant corporate monopolies with wall street
with crashes of the economy these things are not sustainable
and this will not persist into the future society must
find solutions beyond that if you can't see and acknowledge
that you're stuck and this is a big problem with
jordan peterson's politics and with some of the some of
his fans who follow him for that reason now not
all of his fans follow him for the political stuff
i think a lot of a lot of his fans
just like him for the psychology stuff they might not
even know his political opinions very much if they only
watch his psychology lectures i've i've personally met people like
that who don't even know jordan peterson's politics the problem
is that if you keep listening to him long enough
you will eventually imbibe his politics you'll absorb it through
osmosis without even consciously realizing what happened because he rails
against stage green quite a bit he sneaks it into
to almost all of his talks in one form or
another whether he's talking about equality opportunity or hierarchies or
lobsters or whatever he sneaks it in there or he
talks about feminism or he talks about gender fluidity and
he sneaks it in there so what's not being acknowledged
is that if we're at stage orange the next stage
is green and we have not realized or actualized green
yet so this idea that well i don't like green
therefore let's just skip green to yellow it's not gonna
fly that means you created a shadow that's gonna create
dysfunction suffering death and evil if you do that instead
what needs to happen you need to recognize that you
have certain biases and prejudices you have certain fears of
stage green you need to set those aside you need
to work on really understanding green integrate it and then
we can move on to yellow but that's not going
to happen collectively for another 100 years we've been facing
over the last 10 or 20 years as society is
starting to inch towards green we've been encountering so much
backlash and resistance from sage blue and orange that's effectively
what happened for example um with the whole maga movement
all the alt-right movements and we have many movements around
the world now towards authoritarianism why is that because as
the whole world is shifting more and more towards green
people are scared of it they don't understand it the
media is fear-mongering to them about it and therefore the
way they vote is they vote regressively and then this
leads to some of these sorts of regressive nationalistic movements
we see around the world we see it in russia
we see it in germany we see some of it
in in poland in brazil in in in china and
elsewhere this is not only an american problem now am
i really worried that we're going to go into fascism
no not in the developed world in america in canada
and so forth there's never going to be fascism it's
not a legitimate concern because what you have to understand
is that human psyches are all evolving together there it's
not a legitimate concern that we're gonna go back to
soviet communism because we've we've already exhausted that and seen
its limitations and grown beyond it the socialism of today
what conservatives call socialism is really more like social democracy
it's more like scandinavia and scandinavia is a pretty good
place to live now it's got its problems i'm not
saying it doesn't have its excesses you can you can
cite me some articles and examples of excess in scandinavia
sure but i can cite you a lot more of
the excess of stage orange in america and if you
were the average person you would rather live in scandinavia
than you would in america see america is really great
to live in if you are like in the top
five percent then it's awesome you're so free just to
do anything you can buy politicians you can buy corporate
jets you pay low taxes you can avoid taxes you
can do tax shelters you can do capital gains and
like it's just it's a it's a it's a wonderland
for the rich but if you're not in that top
five percent then it's not so great so if you
if you were randomly rolling the dice like before you
were born you're gonna choose where to incarnate should i
incarnate into america or into scandinavia you would you would
be stupid to pick america because the chances that you're
gonna roll that dice you're not gonna get snake eyes
you're gonna get something else and uh you're not gonna
be in the top five percent and in that case
better to live in scandinavia so this is something to
keep in mind now um see the reason that the
country will inevitably move towards green is because orange is
unsustainable what we're doing with co2 emissions what we're doing
with the markets the wealth gap inequality that's happening between
the rich and the poor all of these things are
unsustainable they can only continue maybe for another 30 years
maybe for the next 30 years we can still keep
pushing orange but the more we push it the more
it's going to break down and eventually it will become
so unsustainable that everyone will start to acknowledge that we
got to go green and it's already happening but there's
also backlash because many people don't understand what's really going
on they're clueless about this model they're scared people in
the media are feeding them paranoia uh and and these
fantasies of evil socialism and communism from the cold war
era these are biases and holdovers from the cold war
era and and this is making people so confused that
they don't know how to vote properly or think properly
about these issues so green is going to happen the
only question is will you resist it or not why
resist why not open yourself to it understand it and
then whatever limits and problems there are we'll deal with
them why don't you trust that we can deal with
them why are you paranoid about it that would be
my question jordan peterson why do you have so little
faith in mankind and of course he would say well
because 100 million people were killed in last century yeah
exactly 100 million people were killed in the last century
based on stage blue and orange and actually way more
were killed because we didn't even count orange fully into
that stage don't be so preoccupied about the the boogeyman
of green that you overlook the evils of the current
system the current system truly does have plenty of evils
in it now here's another problem with uh with jordan
peterson's take on things is that he talks a lot
about individualism versus collectivism and he frames it as though
collectivism is is dangerous whereas individualism is the most important
one and this is a this is a very deep
misunderstanding of of this dynamic of this duality and i
want to help you to correct that misunderstanding so today
conservatives generally lean more towards the individualistic sort of libertarian
worldview where they think that well don't blame society for
your problems you're just being lazy take responsibility get disciplined
clean your room get your house in order bootstrap yourself
make something of yourself earn the money and then you'll
have it and stop whining and complaining that's the sort
of conservative worldview it's about taking personal responsibility for things
now the collectivist more green world view is more like
we're not just individuals we're a society we're a community
and not just as an america or as canada or
as europe but as the world when one country pollutes
the oceans it pollutes the oceans for everybody when japan
dumps radioactive waste from fukushima into the ocean it goes
everywhere in the ocean not just around japan everything is
interconnected we're living in a globalized world with internet where
cultures are all intermingling where people are speaking different languages
to each other just like like never before where you
can call a friend in in africa from america in
seconds and it costs you nothing where the internet has
interconnected everything where cheap air air travel around the world
is easy and fast and convenient where viruses travel from
one country to the next and no no borders in
this kind of world you have to acknowledge that we
are a collective we are not just individuals if you
treat the world as though everyone just an individual a
little atom you are missing the crucial emergent properties that
result from social networks and i'm not just talking about
the internet i'm talking about the entire planet our economies
are not distinct economies they're all interconnected together and so
this libertarian fantasy this conservative fantasy that i'm just an
individual and as long as i get my own house
in order then everything else will be okay as jordan
peterson tends to to feed you that idea this is
there is some truth to that it is very important
to work on your own life and that's what i
teach the most i teach so much about turning inwards
and taking responsibility for your life i teach all these
things because of course they're extremely important but what i
also recognize is that it's not about individual versus collective
it's both it's the yin yang relationship the two serve
each other here is why here's the example that will
explain this for you let's say i'm struggling in school
i'm like 18 years old i'm struggling in school to
to make something of myself to succeed to get good
grades to get into a good university i'm struggling with
that i have maybe adhd i'm depressed i'm anxious i'm
having these problems i come to jordan peterson and he
says put your life in order mister you got to
clean your room you got to get disciplined you got
to maybe start going to church you got to read
some books and you got to watch some of my
lectures and you got to you got to know find
some meaning in your life and stop wasting your time
worrying about these collective issues about capitalism and socialism and
racism and and gender rights or you know corporate greed
and predatory capitalists not worried about this stuff because that's
not your problem you can worry about that after you
fix yourself okay that sounds good in theory but what
if the reason i'm having problems is because i have
adhd i can't focus i can't meditate i can't even
sit down to read a book for 10 minutes because
my mind is just going crazy and the reason that
is is because of the lead and the mercury in
the water that i've been drinking in my public water
supply for my entire life for 18 years is that
something i can fix is that an individual problem or
is that a collective problem and are we just supposed
to allow that to keep happening and be quiet about
it i'm just supposed to ignore that no that's a
that's a systemic collective problem and if you think that
this is something exaggerated example it's not at all autism
adhd depression even criminality autoimmune disorders these are all directly
linked to heavy metals that you consume in your food
and in your water where these heavy metals come from
they come from a lack of regulations for giant corporations
and pollution you know in the 1970s or so before
regulation was passed by the us government all gasoline was
leaded gasoline today when you go to the gas station
you see it says unleaded gasoline everywhere why does it
say unleaded because you can't have leaded gasoline anymore why
not because regulation was passed in the 1970s or so
i don't remember the exact date roughly that time because
research was done which found that there's a direct correlation
between the amount of lead in a child's brain tissue
and his propensity to become a criminal later in life
the correlation is so strong that it's like a factor
of 10 or 20. that means that if you have
a certain level of lead or mercury in your brain
your propensity to become a criminal a violent criminal is
going to increase by 20 times think about that think
about how significant that is is that a problem you
can solve as an individual as a kid as a
teenager no this is a problem that's happening to you
you don't you're not even aware that it's happening to
you maybe this is the first time in your life
you're hearing about it and it's already been happening to
you for the last 10 20 years you're just hearing
it from me this is just one example there are
hundreds of examples like this another example might be that
let's say you're trying to bootstrap yourself in life you're
working hard and so forth but you're not even able
to find affordable housing you're not able to buy a
house you're not even able to rent a house because
in your area all of the real estate has been
bought up by wealthy hedge funds who are just looking
to speculate and make profit off of real estate such
that the rent is sky high you can't afford it
and then you're forced to move to a worse part
of the country to a cheaper part of the country
or maybe even go homeless is this your own personal
problem well to a certain extent you are responsible for
keeping a job and paying rent and so forth so
it is a personal problem um maybe if you worked
a little smarter and harder you would be able to
pay your rent but even if you did that you
would still be getting screwed and exploited and predated upon
by these giant capitalistic hedge funds because these billionaires acquire
so much money they want to invest that money to
earn even more money and this keeps widening the the
wealth gap in the country eroding the middle class this
is not good for the country it's not good for
real estate prices it's not good in many different ways
and then on top of that these rich people they
avoid paying any tax upon these profits because they just
funnel it into various offshore accounts so acknowledge that these
are serious legitimate problems and that individualism and collectivism they
fit together like yin and yang black and white you
need them both and the way that these spiral sages
work is that they alternate between individualist and collective stages
so for example stage red is individualist stage blue is
collectivist stage orange is individualist again stage green is collectivist
and stage yellow is individuals again so don't get stuck
on any one you're going to be jumping between them
as you grow and develop yourself in your life you
can't just say that because collectivism was tried back in
soviet russia or maoist china that collectivism is now evil
this is this is a preposterous straw man and a
deep misunderstanding of human and cultural psychology jordan peterson does
make some valid points about for example problems with gender
fluidity and the breaking down of certain traditional structures for
example he would say that it's a problem when you
start playing with gender identities because it can make you
confused and then it can break down the family unit
such that it's hard to raise children it's hard to
even keep a marriage because it's hard for you to
even like that traditional role of male and female which
is very strong in stage blue that starts to break
down as we evolve and it starts to create maybe
problems people are confused about their sexuality or they're sexually
dysfunctional they don't have sex as often or as soon
as they should they they don't have children that creates
problems perhaps because family and children and a marriage actually
is a deep source of fulfillment in most people's lives
and if you're missing that component you're missing out on
an important part of life he would say and that's
generally correct even though you can play with gender identities
and come up with new ones and such things the
problem is is that that's not necessarily going to be
very functional and it may not even make you fulfilled
as fulfilled as you think exercising freedom willy-nilly is does
not in and of itself make you fulfilled and it
might actually start to erode important building blocks of society
which is the family a cohesive family is important when
you don't have a solid family structure then every individual
that's born is sort of born crippled and dysfunctional but
even though that's true the reality is is that that
family that sort of classical traditional family unit of your
grandparents and maybe your parents it didn't just break down
simply because of stage green it broke down because of
its own inherent limitations it started breaking down maybe in
the 1960s people became more sexually promiscuous homosexuality was more
acceptable people started experimenting partying drinking doing drugs having more
sex because part of stage blue is a repression of
sex it represses the sexual instinct tries to control it
very rigidly that has its prose it has its cons
you can't keep a thing repressed forever so eventually pandora's
box was opened with stage orange sex became this material
thing whereas in stage blue sex was more of a
sort of a traditional family thing and in fact you
know the best example of stage blue people is that
these are people who believe that you should not have
sex with anyone unless you're married to them stage orange
says oh [ __ ] all that that's stupid i'm
gonna i'm gonna have sex with as many people as
i want the more the better stage green is is
also very open with sex and it starts to experiment
with different kinds of sex and so forth but the
problem is that that was going to happen anyway you
can't just constrain the old traditions and keep them in
place forever it was going to break apart anyways so
what i would say to counter jordan peterson is i
would say again don't get too paranoid we will figure
out new structures for how to raise kids how to
maintain families it's not going away man mankind's not going
to have stop having sex any time soon and it's
not going to stop having babies anytime soon and yes
there will be a period of adjustment where we're not
sure you know maybe how to do it as well
as our ancestors did it or whatever but there was
also benefits because we're not as sexually repressed as we
were in the victorian era like i heard stories in
the victorian era where a woman would have some sort
of gynecological problem um like a cancer or something and
uh or a pain and ordinarily like today we would
just she would just go to a doctor to a
gynecologist and she would get it fixed but she couldn't
she couldn't do that in the victorian era because all
doctors back then were men they weren't women you can't
have a woman doctor back then and it was part
of the patriarchy um and then um so so that
was that and but but then also you say well
so what well so what people were so sexually repressed
back then especially women they were supposed to be ladies
proper ladies that she couldn't go to a male doctor
and open her legs to her and in fact she
would there was a quote that i read where the
doctor said you know come on over i'll take a
look and the woman you know said you know i'm
a proper lady i would rather die before you know
i show my my privates to you see that's a
real problem that's that's stage blue gone too far too
restrictive too unreasonable so now you understand the the shadow
now you understand a little bit more about the political
stuff uh in general what i would say is that
jordan peterson makes good points but oftentimes he over exaggerates
them and he puts that fear into it and that's
in in general the the problem with the conservative mindset
is that it's too fearful it's too paranoid it's too
closed to new ideas it's too attached to the old
traditions and that's part of part of the reason for
that is because there's actually differences between the conservative brain
and the the liberal brain the conservative brain is more
wired towards fear it's more closed jordan peterson himself talks
about this and that's correct there's truth to that now
does that mean that all fear is legitimate no some
fear is legitimate but be careful not to turn it
into paranoia all right now it's time to get into
the real juice of this conversation that was all the
political stuff that's not what's most important now this is
what's really really most important and it is how to
get you from green and even higher and this now
goes to we're setting aside all the political stuff and
we're going to be just talking about the psychology and
the philosophy and the epistemology and the metaphysics of jordan
peterson's teachings and what is lacking there there's so much
to say it's hard to know where to begin so
a big thing that jordan peterson talks about is values
he talks about the importance of meaning in life and
he frames it as a hierarchy and he talks about
god when asked does he believe in god he says
well i act as though god were real which is
a complex and clever way of saying that he does
but you see jordan peterson is sort of stuck in
a bind the bind is that on the one hand
he deeply intuits that there's something more to life and
to reality than just pure materialism he intuits that and
it's obvious to me there is a spiritual dimension to
life he knows it he knows it's very important he's
trying to guide his audience to that realization but he
himself does not know how to put his finger on
it and how to explicitly tell you what it is
he alludes to it and that's why he uses a
lot of references from movies and old pinocchio cartoons and
myths and allegories from the past from the bible and
from elsewhere because his argument is that basically what you
need in life is you need an overarching hierarchy that
gives structure and meaning to your whole existence and for
that you need some sort of top value at your
hierarchy he would say that traditionally in traditional cultures that
top value was god but the problem jordan peace and
has is that even though intuitively he thinks god exists
he can't really say that god exists because he has
this identity and career he's built up as a scientist
professor academic public intellectual and it has gone out of
vogue to say that god exists in intellectual circles in
universities as an academic because if you say that they're
gonna ask you well where's your proof and if you
say well i don't have any proof it's just a
gut feeling they're going to laugh at you and say
that oh you're one of those superstitious irrational people and
they're going to kick you out and you're going to
lose all credibility professionally as an academic so he can't
come out and say that and he also values science
too he's not just doing it for show he he
also values the methods of science he believes in evolution
evolutionary biology he uses this for his arguments and so
forth so his challenge personally that he's struggling with is
he's struggling how do i integrate the gut feeling i
have that god is important and it might even be
real but i don't know what it is i don't
know how to prove it versus science is real and
rationality is true and that's important too how do you
reconcile these two things he can't quite tell you and
he himself doesn't know because actually he's gotten himself stuck
with the stage green shadow so here let's really dive
deep are you ready for this one of the biggest
things that has him stuck with stage green and the
shadow is that stage green this is what he talks
about as post-modernism most of the people who listen to
him have no idea what post-modernism is it's a very
complex and nuanced topic i actually have episodes about jacques
dereta post-modernism deconstruction and non-duality you can go check that
out but anyways the summary of it is this is
that the difference between modernism versus postmodernism is that modernism
had a sort of objective view of reality there's a
objective way that things are there are men there are
women there are atoms and molecules chairs and tables in
the world things are how they seem and how we
think of them that's roughly the modernist view and we
can think about them rationally and there's good things in
the world and there's bad things in the world then
the postmodernist came along and started questioning all that and
said wait a minute maybe these are arbitrary biases that
we have maybe this stuff isn't actually absolutely true but
it's subjective maybe it's relative maybe if you're living in
the middle east your culture is the best for you
relatively speaking and if you're living in america your culture
is the best for you relatively speaking but then if
you're living in japan or china american culture is not
the best for you and that's not because any one
of these people is wrong or deluded it's simply because
they have different points of view and likewise for example
if you believe that there are only men and only
women and this is a physical biological fact well that
might be true for you because that's what you believe
whereas if you believe that gender is fluid and you
can change these things around and that these are not
biological facts that's what's true for you because it's relative
now the modernist would say no no what are you
talking about it's not relative these are biological facts there's
xy chromosomes and it just it's what is in your
it's baked into your dna and likewise a modernist would
say there's black people there's white people it's crystal clear
everybody knows the difference what's the problem the problem is
that these rigid categories that you create eventually they all
start to collapse because actually they're not grounded in anything
objectively true because actually relativity is at play within reality
reality is a relativistic system at many levels and there
is something called social construction where we construct various illusions
such as money in order to help mankind do what
it does we even construct things like the border around
the country what is a country a country is a
social construction there's no such thing as america we constructed
it in our minds and so the postmodernists take this
very far and they try to relativize everything so jordan
peterson has a instinctive reaction against this and many conservatives
do they're frightened by the implications of total relativism relativism
run amok and so part of the part of jordan
peterson's biggest critique of stage green is that you can't
just relativize everything if you relativize everything everything loses meaning
and value and then you're lost and you don't know
what to do and then you fall into a sort
of nihilism and depression and then you can't build a
good life therefore jordan peters would say that you need
to construct some sort of hierarchy for your life of
value and meaning so that you know what to do
what your priorities are and you gotta you gotta pick
one of these values to put at the top of
your of your pyramid of of priorities and that value
could be god in the literal sense or it could
be god in the poetic or metaphorical sense where for
example if you're a wall street executive and all you
care about is money jordan peters would say that means
money and success is your god and if you're a
scientist that is hyper rational and uh quantitative and you
know science is is your purpose in life then he
would say science or mathematics is your god rationality is
your god or if what's most important to you is
taking care of your family and raising children he would
say family is your highest value family is your god
and so on and so he would say you know
pick one of these things then orient your life towards
that now he tells you god is the highest value
but he doesn't tell you why because he himself doesn't
know and the way he frames it is in this
sort of mythological poetic allegorical sense where he says that
well probably the bible and many of these myths and
stories from the past they're not literally true they're not
true in the scientific sense because he can't say that
the bible is scientifically true because he's he's a scientific
person but also he doesn't want to give up the
bible completely so he's trying to hedge his bets here
which is a tricky tight rope walk to navigate but
he manages to do it somehow and so um so
the way he does it is by saying that well
these are stories that contain lessons from our ancestors that
are valuable that have been discovered over centuries and millennia
and that what religion is really about is it's not
about some literal story being true scientifically it's about just
wisdom psychological wisdom that is important to kind of ground
your psyche and give you direction meaning in life that's
what it's about and the danger of stage green relativism
and post-modernism is that it breaks all of that down
and it makes you believe as though like well anything
goes i'm free to do anything i'm free to be
a man i'm free to be a woman i'm free
to cut my dick off i'm free to dye my
hair purple i'm free to change my race i'm free
to get surgery i'm free to jump off a cliff
like i'm free to do anything and it doesn't matter
what i do and he would say but it does
matter what you do because if you jump off a
cliff you're not going to be happy some things make
you happy some things don't and religion tells you which
things make you happy and which ones don't as it
was discovered by your ancestors for thousands of years so
wouldn't it be wise of you to follow that religious
stuff and so now you might say well leo that
sounds pretty good that sounds pretty smart so what's wrong
with that so isn't relativism dangerous and a problem doesn't
it lead to nihilism and inaction it can but again
everything can take and be taken to its extremes everything
can be misused everything can become unhealthy when it's out
of proportion so healthiness depends on proportion not really the
thing itself per se so you know if you if
you drink too much water you're going to die that
doesn't mean water is bad just means you got to
know how much water to drink and when to stop
so here's the thing now we get to the real
crux of the situation this is what jordan peterson really
doesn't understand about god and about values and about meaning
this is the thing he's resisting this is his biggest
shadow and if he could get over this he could
really become an amazing teacher the problem is that jordan
peterson has a misunderstanding a fundamental misunderstanding of what religion
is and where it came from and why it exists
religion is not a collection just of parables and allegories
and myths with some sort of practical way of adding
a little bit of meaning to your life it's way
deeper than that religion its ultimate source is the insights
of the most advanced mystics that have lived throughout human
history these mystics were able to reach radical expanded states
of consciousness superhuman states of consciousness from which they became
conscious of the ultimate absolute truth of what reality truly
is of what consciousness is and then once they accessed
these truths they shared them with mankind and suggested that
mankind try to pursue these shroods for themselves but because
mankind the majority mankind was ignorant and delusional and too
selfish the truths were misunderstood and misinterpreted and turned into
dogma and ideology and myths and stories because the actual
states of consciousness cannot be communicated nor can they be
scientifically proven nor can they be turned in any kind
of scientific algorithms for how to access them and they
can be only accessed by very exceptional hardcore individuals who
are willing to question reality very deeply to levels that
would threaten most other humans how do i know this
because i've actually done it i've reached those levels of
consciousness that are written about in the bible in buddhism
in islam in hinduism in jainism in um judaism all
of these religions and spiritual traditions talk about the same
ultimate truths which is otherwise known as god allah buddha
mind buddha nature whatever you want to call it so
here's how it really works you start thinking deeply about
the nature of reality and you start questioning it philosophically
you start questioning epistemology and metaphysics you start questioning what
reality is you start questioning what you are and what
your mind is and you start to deconstruct everything you've
learned from your culture you deconstruct religion you deconstruct schooling
you deconstruct political ideology you deconstruct science you deconstruct all
your economic ideas you deconstruct everything and you remove your
mind you free your mind of all attachments and all
biases because you want to really get to the truth
of things you stop believing in anything including beliefs in
science and other things and you delve deeper and deeper
and deeper into the relativity of reality you sort of
recognize that all culture all cultural norms all languages all
scientific systems all models all maps all books everything i've
learned it's all relative it's not absolutely true and then
you start wondering to yourself well what is absolutely true
and you go deeper and deeper and deeper that you
start questioning yourself with a deep profound corrosive skepticism which
takes over your entire mind this is not just something
you do on your spare time this consumes you it
drives you mad it drives you into nihilism and solipsism
and skepticism and cynicism and it's very difficult psychologically on
you it's very threatening because all of your attachments even
things like the idea that you should have a family
or that family is even good you question that the
idea that money is important you question that you even
question the idea whether life itself is important and you
surrender your attachment to life itself and if you continue
down this process all the way down and you deconstruct
your entire mind and psyche what happens is that you
go beyond psychology and you go into metaphysics and you
go into pure consciousness and then what you become conscious
of is that your ego mind and your entire identity
as a self completely collapses as though it never even
existed your self-image of you as a biological human it
collapses the colors and sounds and things still stay the
same your body still stays here but your self-image your
psychological psyche self-image it all collapses into nothing and with
that collapses the idea of a physical objective reality and
when this happens it feels like you've gone insane because
there's no more difference between sanity and insanity good and
bad right and wrong everything collapses into pure relativity and
when that happens it's the most counterintuitive and astounding thing
because you would think well leo what you're describing here
sounds like the height of madness and the worst possible
thing that anyone could wish on themselves why would anyone
do this why not just live a normal good life
but you don't appreciate what happens when you lose yourself
when you lose yourself when you lose your mind when
you lose any notion of an objective external reality and
what i'm describing here is something that jesus did that
the buddha did that happened to muhammad that all the
great mystics of the past have done when all of
that collapses your mind collapses what are you left with
you're left with consciousness nothing but consciousness all that exists
is consciousness this is consciousness the material world that you
thought was solid and real it was always just consciousness
infinite consciousness absolute consciousness this consciousness is the absolute truth
it's not a belief it's not an ideology it's not
wishful thinking it's not something you program your mind with
this is the result of removing all programming from the
mind destroying the mind entirely transcending the mind entirely and
so a very twisted paradoxical thing happens is that even
though you go deeper and deeper into relativity and you're
as you're doing this all meaning and value is lost
and here's where jordan peterson shadow comes in is that
he's not open to this process he's not open to
deconstruction because what he's worried about is losing value and
meaning he thinks you need that to live a good
life but here's what he doesn't understand is that if
you go all the way down this rabbit hole and
you lose all meaning and all value what happens is
that literally all meaning and value collapses the difference between
good and bad collapses and it disappears and then what
happens you're not left with neutrality you would think maybe
oh it's just neutrality no what you're left with is
you're left with god consciousness you're left with absolute good
you're left with infinite love you would say infinite love
that makes no sense why would why would absolute relativity
and the collapse of all values and meanings lead to
infinite love well because the logic of it is this
is that what value is what meaning is is to
value or prioritize one thing over another thing it's to
say well i like vanilla ice cream but not chocolate
ice cream so vanilla is on top of chocolate or
to say i like men more than i like women
or vice versa or to say i like capitalism over
socialism or vice versa you're valuing things or to say
i like family above career or career above family and
this is the whole illusion of life is thinking that
there actually are differences between these things that these things
are important so when you become infinitely conscious when you
lose your sense of self you realize that all of
these valuations and meanings that i was creating these were
false substitutes for pure infinite consciousness and love which is
what reality has always been and can't be anything other
than that because what love is is it's not a
human emotion love is the recognition that all values and
biases are purely selfish and completely relative and it's the
surrendering of all that and the transcendence of that into
absolute truth which is love the reason absolute truth is
love is because when you stop selfishly evaluating things and
attaching meanings to things like thinking that well life is
good and death is bad or sex is evil and
drugs are evil or you know that person is good
and this person is evil when you stop making these
judgments what you're left with is not neutrality what you're
left with is the recognition that everything is of equal
value if everything is of equal value if everything has
no value that's the same thing as to say equal
value equal value is the same as no value and
no value is the same as infinite value the value
of absolutely everything in the universe becomes infinite you become
one with the entire universe literally and you recognize that
the only thing that was keeping you locked into a
finite set of value is because you were valuing one
thing over another thing you were making these distinctions and
you were making judgments and it's these judgments that have
ruined your life and made you unable to be happy
and fulfilled and also separated you from god and from
love so what jordan peterson does not understand is that
god exists not in a poetic metaphorical way god literally
exists you are god this thing that is conscious right
here right now you being conscious that's what god is
i'm not talking about the human you the human you
is an illusion i'm not talking about your self-image that's
an illusion i'm talking about this state of consciousness that
is occurring right here right now as i'm speaking you
are conscious of colors and sounds this is a field
of infinite universal consciousness love is not something you feel
love is the recognition that you are everything that you
are one with everything that you accept and surrender to
everything without judging it or resisting it and the reason
that god is the top of the hierarchy is because
god is truth and god is love and the reason
for that is because there's only one god there's only
one thing in the universe which is the universe itself
reality is itself therefore to say that god is the
highest value is just to say that reality is the
highest value why is reality the highest value because there's
nothing outside of reality because reality is infinite anything you
imagine outside of reality is a part of reality by
definition of how reality is defined therefore the highest value
is simply infinity or everything which is to say love
this is something jordan peterson intuits but does not understand
and cannot explicitly tell you because he's not conscious of
these things the highest value of all life for all
life forms in the universe is love this is not
just a hippie saying this is not a stage green
new age teaching i'm talking about absolute truth you can
become directly conscious of this for yourself and if you
just think about it intuitively it makes sense too what
have you been chasing your entire life love that's it
as a child what did you want from your parents
love what did you want from your mother and your
father love what did you want from your girlfriends and
boyfriends love what did you want from your teachers love
what did you want from the video games you were
playing and the movies you're watching love what did you
want from life love what do you want when you
eat food you want to love the food what do
you want to do when you're hanging out with your
friends you want to love your friends you want to
do loving things with your friends to your friends have
them do loving things to you even if you're doing
science you're doing it out of love it's a love
of the exploration of the nature unit the universe you
love science anything you're doing in reality if you're doing
it for the right reasons you're doing it out of
love and then it's just a matter of how exactly
will it be manifested for some of you it will
be art for some of you it will be business
for some of you it will be sex for some
of you it would be raising a family for some
of you it will be lecturing and teaching for others
of you it will be exploring nature for all of
us the highest value is love and the reason that
is is because there's nothing else in the universe but
love the universe the physical universe your physical hands are
a manifestation of love that's what you recognize when you
collapse the self and your mind but you cannot understand
this without collapsing yourself and your mind the only thing
that is preventing you from recognizing infinite love all the
things i just said is your selfishness your ego and
your attachment to a human identity and your attachment to
biases for different values you value one thing over another
thing if you keep doing that and you insist on
doing that and you refuse to surrender that you will
never awaken to the fact that everything is love if
you are resistant to relativity you will never awaken to
infinite love and infinite love is not a relative thing
infinite love is absolute and i said leo so you're
contradicting yourself you're saying that it's all relative and then
now you're saying it's absolute which is it it's both
it's a paradox because it's a synthesis of every distinction
it's a synthesis of every duality reality is one god
is one you are one there has only been one
thing happening in your consciousness your entire life you this
bubble of consciousness is all that there is there's nothing
else it's one the only thing that was creating the
illusion that there is more than one is your imagination
and that's what god is god is an infinite field
of consciousness of pure unlimited imagination it's all powerful imagination
it's imagination that's so powerful that it can even imagine
that it is not imagining reality and that becomes what
you consider reality physical reality is a dream it's purely
imaginary but you don't think it's a dream because you're
imagining that it's not a dream accepting this for most
people is very very threatening and radical because it erodes
and deconstructs all power structures all hierarchies all value systems
even your idea of sanity and physical reality all of
it gets deconstructed not as a philosophy actually actually when
you fully collapse your mind you actually go through a
process of death and rebirth this is not a metaphorical
poetical death and rebirth you actually go through death you
literally die the idea of you dies forever and you
say oh my god that's that's awful it's only awful
if you judge it to be awful but when you
realize that your judgment of it as awful is itself
an illusion what happens is that everything collapses into an
infinite singularity of pure love and then what happens is
you discover god and you discover heaven that's what heaven
is heaven is not a nice place somewhere in the
clouds where they feed you grapes and give you endless
orgasms heaven is nothing other than the realization that there's
no difference between anything there's no value to anything there's
no meaning to anything because everything is empty and meaningless
everything is so meaningless and so valueless that it goes
full circle into infinite meaning infinite value absolute value absolute
love this is what every religious teaching has been about
since the dawn of civilization but most people who are
reading these teachings and interpreting them are too unconscious and
too selfish and too corrupt and too biased and too
fearful to understand the teachings and to actually do them
you can't understand these teachings by reading them or memorizing
them or by aping them through some ten commandment process
you can only do it by literally deconstructing your mind
and your reality losing your sanity diving completely into nihilism
relativism until you lose the sense of physical reality and
then you die and then you're reborn as god and
then you are a walking god amongst men and men
look up to you as though there's something special about
you and there is you fully awoken to yourself as
god the universe has awoken to itself as infinite love
and infinite consciousness and absolute truth and the game is
done you recognize that all of your life was just
a game that you designed to allow yourself to awaken
and give yourself the gift of infinite love and you
cannot appreciate the gift of infinite love unless you've lived
without it which is what your life is you have
separated yourself from infinite love from god so that god
could give you the gift of infinite love which is
just to say that you are giving yourself the greatest
gift in the universe and what is the greatest gift
in the universe the universe itself i know it's a
lot to take in it's a lot to stomach it's
unbelievable it sounds crazy it sounds insane what i'm describing
now is a stage turquoise level of very profound profound
consciousness and development that nobody you know has experienced your
parents haven't experienced this your teachers haven't experienced this the
public intellectuals you listen to on youtube they haven't achieved
this and the only way you can understand this is
by going through it yourself personally you have to lay
your head on the chopping block and get it chopped
off you have to lose your sense of self before
you can discover the highest value in the universe so
as it turns out the only obstacle to the highest
value in the universe is your limited conception of yourself
if you were to surrender your limited conception of yourself
which you're terrified to surrender you call that death if
you were to literally surrender that you wouldn't die what
would really happen is that your sense of self would
expand from the finite self to the infinite self and
then you would become illuminated enlightened awake when you see
pictures of jesus or the christian saints depicted in the
bible or on stained glass windows or on various kinds
of you know christian iconography they depict a saint with
a halo around his head or even this kind of
burst of of yellow light you know behind jesus's head
shining forth in all directions evenly what does that represent
that represents a human being who has died the finite
self in that human has died and collapsed his mind
the very notion of a physical existence has collapsed in
his mind the idea that he was ever born or
will ever die has so collapsed in his mind because
it was just imaginary he collapses so deeply that he
became an infinite point of pure consciousness and love and
that is what is depicted by that halo it is
not merely a metaphor or a myth it's more like
literal you literally become an infinite singularity of love and
consciousness that's what god is you become god realized and
that is the highest value because that is the highest
state of consciousness that consciousness can take and everything that's
happening in the universe whether it's you going to work
you eating a cheeseburger you driving your car you having
sex you chasing money these are all just branches and
tangents off of the pursuit of love you're doing all
of these things as poor substitutes for the seeking of
love that's all you've ever saw it when you go
you seek a hamburger you're seeking it for the love
it gives you that you feel when you consume it
when you're having sex with your spouse or partner same
thing but these are all finite material experiences of love
they're all limited the love you have for your mother
your father your child your spouse you might think that
that's a lot of love it's not it's nothing it's
it's like a drop in the ocean it's nothing when
you surrender all that and this is the this is
what's so counterintuitive you have to have the courage to
take the leap of faith to surrender all of your
attachments and all of your biases for fear for your
mother for your father for your children for everything everything
you love you have to give up so that you
can gain it all back and the entire universe as
infinity and so long as you're too attached and too
scared to give it up if you're too attached to
give up jesus or the bible or your religion or
allah or muhammad or the buddha you'll never actually realize
what they realized in buddhism they have a great saying
which goes when you meet the buddha on the road
kill him because the final thing that will hold you
back from complete god realization is your attachment to the
idea of a buddha or a guru or a jesus
who is above you anything you think is above you
is a limitation to your true self because that's a
shadow that you have not integrated nobody is above you
or below you because you're everything and you're everyone how
can anyone be above you and jesus told you this
jesus said he is the son of god does that
mean he's the only son of god no of course
not what it means is that his body was the
incarnation of god and all physical objects are the incarnation
of god and your body is the incarnation of god
all equally none above the other jesus told you the
kingdom of heaven was within was he speaking metaphorically no
was he just saying that because oh well if you're
just meditating and you're happy by yourself then that's the
that's heaven no he was telling you literally that you're
god that you're love but you didn't understand because you
weren't conscious enough so this is the biggest oversight in
jordan peterson's work and i don't blame him it's not
easy to to accomplish this feat the reason he hasn't
accomplished it is because he's too stuck with the relativist
shadow he's too afraid of it he's afraid that if
he goes down this road he's going to lose his
mind and he's going to lose all meaning his whole
life with collapse his family will collapse his career will
collapse all of that and that's true it might all
collapse this is threatening stuff see you have to you
have to think like this if what i'm saying is
true it's not talked about very much in society or
when it is it's talked in corrupted ways the way
that religion talks about it why is that well because
either it's false and i'm deluding you or it's because
it's so rare and so threatening that any time a
single individual accomplishes this it becomes impossible to communicate because
anyone you try to communicate it to who's just sort
of like normal a normie who buys into consensus physical
reality you try to communicate it to them and you
they think you're insane so it becomes virtually impossible to
communicate because see people want to ask you for like
proof like leo prove it to me if this is
true prove it but you see you don't understand the
depth of the problem it can't be proven to you
in a scientific manner because science itself and the notion
of proof itself is something that your mind is constructing
to to create a physical illusion you have to deconstruct
proof and science and no one can do that for
you i can't do it for you you literally have
to surrender your life and of course what's the last
thing you will surrender your life you're terrified fundamentally the
thing that is holding you back is fear of death
the thing that's holding jordan peterson back is fear of
death but also fear of relativism fear of stage green
fear of post-modernism fear of socialism fear fear in general
is the only thing that holds you back from god
and from love because fear is the contraction of consciousness
away from love whenever you fear anything in reality what
you're subconsciously saying to yourself is that thing is bad
i don't want that thing i reject that thing i
reject death i reject uh terrorism i reject uh slavery
i reject hitler i reject all these things and the
more you reject what you're doing is you're creating shadows
out of that you're rejecting yourself because there's nothing in
the universe but yourself so the universe is rejecting parts
of itself and because of this you are tormented and
you struggle because of this you have health issues jordan
peterson faces health issues recently where are those ultimately coming
from a lot of those kind of health issues especially
autoimmune disorders come from not merely physical problems but from
the stress that your body and psyche lives with every
day you're not even conscious of this stress because it's
just a a constant for you the stress of just
surviving and judging and hating and rejecting parts of yourself
disowning parts of yourself and battling with your shadow shadow
boxing with yourself your entire life this is very stressful
on the psyche it leads to disorders and diseases it
leads to dysfunction the diseases that this leads to are
not only individual they're also collective because you see the
fundamental disease is selfishness and egotism the the fundamental disease
that plagues jordan peterson is his own self just as
the fundamental disease that plagues you is your own self
and then the fundamental disease spreads itself through your words
deeds actions and thoughts and emotions all across the globe
and it synergizes with the selfishness of all the other
people eight billion people on the planet and together we
have now a host of collective problems and dysfunctions and
disorders as all of our collective egos and selfishness and
fear synergizes with itself resulting in war genocide slavery violence
exploitation corruption disease pollution where is all this coming from
it's coming from the self the limit itself it's coming
from bias this is what jordan peterson really wants to
communicate to you but he can't because he himself has
not gone through the process of deconstructing his own mind
and reality he could do that but i'm not gonna
hold my breath so that's why i'm stepping in and
filling in some of the gaps it might have i
don't know maybe it sounded too like i've been very
negative on jordan peterson this whole time but actually i'm
not negative about him i think he's doing important work
i think a lot of people are at the point
in their life where they need a lot of stage
blue foundation that they don't have a healthy one a
healthy one and so he's he's fulfilling that function but
we also equally need people to help fulfill the function
of stage green healthy healthy stage green that's where the
progressives come in we also need healthy stage orange a
little bit of capitalism is not such a bad thing
and when you integrate all of these and then you
go beyond that to the higher stages that's when your
life completely transforms you think that you've you've watched some
jordan peterson videos and your life has improved you ain't
seen nothing yet watch what happens when you fully integrate
these three stages of blue orange and green and then
you move beyond that into what's called tier two tier
two is a whole order of magnitude beyond the lower
stages and then you can go even beyond that into
this infinite love that i'm talking about i'm pointing you
towards what jordan peterson wants you to pursue which is
god or the highest value right so i've articulated to
you as clearly as it's possible to do using language
you can't do better than this using language but language
of course is insufficient why did i talk about this
is it for you to believe me and to become
a cult member no i talked about this as a
vision for what is possible for you that is the
function of religion the function of religion is to show
you your highest potential and what is your highest potential
your highest potential is infinity of course your highest potential
has no limits whatsoever that's what i've shown you here
today hopefully you've understood that now it's up to you
to decide whether you want to pursue that but also
be patient you are not going to be able to
understand or to actualize what i just told you in
a few months or even in a few years it
took me a few decades to reach this level of
understanding and consciousness and i'm still not done i'm still
growing every single day so my point to you is
that if jordan peterson has introduced you to this idea
of self-improvement and self-help and psychology that's great now you
recognize how important psychology is now let's take it to
the next level yes psychology is important yes self-help is
important spend a good five ten years developing that great
but what's even more important is epistemology metaphysics philosophy and
spirituality and ultimately consciousness and truth that's even more important
it's more fundamental and so predominantly what i focus on
with my teachings with actualize.org is that i cover basic
self-help sometimes as well you'll find plenty of practical episodes
that i have recorded in the past but once you've
gotten the basics of your life down and you really
want to reach your full potential you really like how
serious are you about life if you really want to
see what's possible you should you must transcend psychology and
go with me into consciousness work it's not an ideology
it's not a belief system it's not a cult you
do the work for yourself and you discover the things
that i say are true for yourself and if you
don't discover it's true then it's not true it's only
true if it's true in your direct experience and the
bulk of my work is to help people to deconstruct
their mind in ways that people like jordan pearson cannot
because they're too afraid to do it see my special
gift or power if you want to say i have
one is that from a very young age i was
so skeptical of everything that i believed nothing i questioned
absolutely everything until it killed me literally i questioned the
very fabric of physical reality until it killed me and
i was happy to do it because i knew that
all of these things that people were believing in were
just constructions it was just all [ __ ] it
was just stories it's all stories physical reality this is
a [ __ ] story your birth is just a
story your death is just a story science is just
a story your brain is just a story atoms and
molecules these are all [ __ ] stories that you're
imagining you don't need them have the courage to go
for what's really true and how do you know what's
true i actually have a video called how to discover
what's true but um go watch that but uh in
short how do you know what's true you question absolutely
everything and whatever survives that process is what's true and
if you question everything and nothing survives and you destroy
the entire universe with your questioning that's what's true the
entire universe was imaginary and of course that's exactly what
will happen and the only thing holding you back is
just your fear and your laziness and your complacency and
your being a sheep following all these other people including
jordan peterson you're just one of his sheep but hey
you know i recognize the importance of of moving people
up the spiral you you cannot just take someone and
leapfrog them across all the stages to the very top
your psyche can't handle that if you experienced the levels
of god consciousness and love that i've experienced you would
be vomiting on the floor and you might even pass
out and you might even die because it's it's so
extreme it's taken me years of laying the groundwork and
deconstructing my mind and my reality to be able to
reach these levels of consciousness and understanding and so what
i do is i just i guide people serious people
to do that for themselves and the only way you
can do this is if you're very serious this is
not a casual pursuit it is dangerous there are risks
your life is at risk and that's precisely why you
know people like jesus and the buddha these were not
moderates these were very radical people that's why they're so
rare it's very rare to find a person who's willing
to to destroy and throw away his entire life and
even the physical world and his own sanity to reach
something like truth most people just want to live a
comfortable life but at the same time how comfortable are
you the problem is that when you're living a comfortable
life it's not very comfortable the most comfortable life counter-intuitively
is to surrender your life then you'll have comfort until
then you're going to be whining and moaning about every
little thing that rubs you the wrong way and you're
going to be shadow boxing with yourself your whole life
you're going to be miserable and look at jordan peterson
a lot of times you just look at his face
and he looks miserable he doesn't look like a happy
man he doesn't laugh a lot he holds bitterness and
anger inside of him and fear now this is not
a personal attack on him these are just normal human
emotions that people have and i would say that in
fact he's better at handling them than most people i
think most other people would be less developed than him
and handle it worse given the amount of pressure and
fame that's upon him that's that's not an easy burden
to carry but but also um don't fool yourself with
this idea that oh well leo if i just if
i just kind of play it safe and i just
pursue money and just a family and some sex and
some of this kind of stuff my life will just
be good right no your life will be miserable your
life will be mediocre even if you become mega successful
jordan peterson is more successful than most people can dream
of he makes millions of dollars every year does this
make him happy no of course not does this make
him loving no all the same bitterness and problems and
shadows are still there your shadows will stay with you
no matter how rich you become no matter how much
sex you have no matter no matter what country you
live in what house you live in that's not an
ultimate solution to anything the only ultimate solution is to
give up yourself quit quit resisting take the leap of
faith and discover that you're god that's the only thing
that's worthwhile to do in life everything else is tangents
and distractions and avoidance of that but it takes a
very rare individual to be able to actually do it
but if maybe you are such a rare individual or
you're thinking you might be you found the right place
watch my videos my videos will help you to deconstruct
your mind in ways that i think very few other
teachers and gurus can help you to do that's my
specialty that's what i love see what i love is
deconstruction it does help if you're going to be deconstructing
everything to actually love deconstruction rather than to hate it
it's a beautiful thing what i'm talking about is not
nihilistic or depressing even though it might sound that way
to your ego it's actually the greatest beauty the greatest
joy there is nothing else quite like it all right
so that's it now you got an idea see doesn't
this make sense of things for you doesn't everything make
sense now all the culture wars the progressives the conservatives
the maga people the socialists the capitalists jordan peterson all
of religion look at how much we explained you might
think yourself well leo this took a long time this
took two and a half hours yeah it took two
and a half hours to explain all of [ __
] life to you if you can't see the value
in that then i don't know how to help you
you've got something wrong with your head there's a trade-off
between depth and length and also commitment how committed are
you to this work i recommend you make this this
moment this video i may i recommend you make this
the the turning point for the rest of your life
see you got a little bit of taste of it
here for two hours now i recommend you devote the
rest of your life to this kind of work this
is what life is about you want the most meaningful
life counter-intuitively paradoxically this is it the meaning of life
is to deconstruct all meaning and to surrender all meaning
and then to take it all back through infinite meaning
and love and then enjoy your life that's it you
