            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6RaA5eQlCsU' target='_blank'>Judgment - How You Ruin Your Own Happiness</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Judgment</b>: Leo Gura explains judgment as the process of labelling and evaluating aspects such as people, objects, situations, and even oneself based on preference and usefulness for survival and reproduction. He highlights that this process causes a division in what is fundamentally an undivided reality.  
</li><li><b>Judgment and Happiness</b>: Gura argues that constant judgment leads to an unhappy existence characterized by criticism, cynicism, and a continual striving for change or improvement. He posits that judgment opposes happiness, which is being content in the moment, leading to constant resistance and struggle in life.
</li><li><b>Problem with Judging Good and Bad</b>: Gura discusses the issue with categorizing things as good or bad. While it may seem common sense to do so, this mindset leads to the pursuit of what is deemed better or best, creating a never-ending cycle of seeking improvement. This results in constant action without overall satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Being Overly Judgmental</b>: Gura notes the negative repercussions of being overly judgmental, including a lack of contentment, constant need for change, and recurrent dissatisfaction. He emphasizes the importance of dropping judgment to accept reality as it is, rather than continually seeking to alter it.
</li><li><b>The Unending Pursuit of Satisfaction</b>: Leo Gura relates humans to hamsters running on a wheel, constantly chasing but never reaching satisfaction. He highlights that constant judgment, be it of people or things or situations, inhibits satisfaction because our minds continuously seek 'better.' Gura stresses that such a mindset makes you unsatisfied even with the best things in life as your divisive mentality will always find faults and nitpick things, entrapping you in a never-ending cycle of dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Effects of Unconscious Judgments</b>: Gura underlines the significance of noticing how much we judge things, often unconsciously, like judging a person for their appearance, or labeling situations as good or bad. He cautions that these constant judgments eventually lead to internal dissatisfaction and a toxic disposition that can affect others, leading to toxic relationships.
</li><li><b>Reality Is Neutral</b>: Gura recommends treating reality as neutral, refraining from assigning labels to entities which are, in fact, creations of your own mind. These labels influence your behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, thereby impacting your mood. He advises consciously reducing judgments and to train to disengage from such label-slapping behavior.
</li><li><b>A Self-actualized Perspective</b>: In the context of self-actualization, Gura stresses that truly self-actualized people do not constantly make judgments or view things through a selfish lens, instead, they see reality for what it is. Demonstration of a 'what's in it for me' approach to situations leads to dysfunction and unhappiness, while deriving pleasure and happiness relies on being with the reality, without any expectations, judgments, or criticisms.
</li><li><b>Macro and Micro Judgments</b>: Gura differentiates between 'macro' judgments (conspicuous judgments made against others) and 'micro' judgments (subconscious judgments made against situations and objects). He gives an anecdote of going through everyday tasks such as cooking and highlights how people fall into the practice of making subconscious judgments during these tasks, causing a restraint from appreciating the task and living in the moment. 
</li><li><b>Mental Retraining for Less Judgmental Thinking</b>: He emphasizes working towards reducing both types of judgments to achieve successful self-actualization and deriving strength and happiness by just being with reality. As a commitment to personal development and growth, Gura encourages his audience to subscribe to his newsletter for regular thought-provoking content.
</li><li><b>Judgment as a Neurotic Behavior</b>: Leo argues that making both macro and micro judgments, particularly judgments based on "utility" or usefulness of things can lead to neurotic and unsatisfied behaviors. An example he gives is an individual making judgments while cooking, such as judging the size of a plate, or criticizing the contents of their fridge.
</li><li><b>Beauty and Absence of Judgments</b>: Leo uses the example of witnessing a breathtaking sunset. In such a situation, individuals often forget to judge and just experience the momentbeing one with reality. The lack of judgment in this situation, he argues, brings fulfillment and peace, not necessarily the beauty of the scene itself.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness Exercise</b>: Leo recommends an exercise of mindfulness over a few days. The task is to simply notice and be aware of one's judgments, without trying to stop or control them. He urges the viewers to be conscious of judging situations, objects, and people around them. Recognizing these judgments is a step to understanding the impact they have on ones daily life experience and how it leads to dissatisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org and the Newsletter</b>: Leo encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter on Actualized.org. The newsletter offers weekly resources on personal development and self-actualization. He emphasizes that the continuous growth mindset, which he often calls hobbyist of personal development, requires consistency and regular reminders. This is why he insists that the viewers sign up for the newsletter which will inform them about new articles, videos, and resources every week. He concludes by expressing the value of these resources for achieving both internal happiness and external success.
