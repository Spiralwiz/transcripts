hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org and
in this video blog what I want to talk about
is the topic of strengths vs. weaknesses and specifically the
question of in personal development in getting more success in
your in your in your career and your relationships in
your health is it better to work on your strengths
or is it better to work on your weaknesses and
the bigger question is of course just your overall happiness
in life are you gonna be happier if you focus
on the weaknesses in your life the things that you're
not good on or are you gonna be happier by
focusing on your strengths so there's some interesting research that
that goes and covers both of these topics and looks
at which of them is is better so the first
and probably the most important research is by Martin Seligman
who was the father of the positive psychology movement now
and what he actually has on his website authentic app
authentic happiness calm is he has a strength to sadness
assessment and there you can go on and take the
character strengths assessment and it'll literally tell you the top
strengths that you have as as your personality type so
it'll tell you if your strengths are being generous or
being grateful or being open minded or bring curious or
being artistic some various strengths and then of course there's
the common idea that we want to work on our
weaknesses too right so a strengths for example if a
strength of yours is is working with people and interacting
with people and you get a lot of joy from
that and also comes easily to you then that's a
strength now a weakness of yours for somebody else that
might be a weakness right maybe you're an introverted shy
person and therefore working with other people comes as a
struggle to you and the question then is is it
better to work and fix that weakness over times I
can make you happier or is it better to focus
on the strengths there's actually a lot of compelling evidence
to show that working on your strengths not your weaknesses
is the best way to be happy because working on
your on your weaknesses is pretty and if you've ever
tried to do this in your life is working on
weakness then you've known how difficult it is to do
this right so maybe you've had trouble with Fitness maybe
you've had trouble with with shyness and introversion maybe you
had trouble with with other parts of your life like
character traits that you notice are deficient in you and
working on them can be very challenging because it's it's
unnatural it's not your natural way to be so you
have to you have to really persevere and you have
to discipline yourself you have to retrain your mind basically
through a lot of consistent action to to become to
become better at that weakness and often times it's really
hard to bring that up to the kind of level
that your strengths are at whereas with your strengths let's
say you're someone who's really good with people and you
naturally love being extroverted and talking to people and working
with people and collaborating and cooperating in that case that's
a strength of yours and if you design your life
to run and alignment with that strength that can be
a really powerful source of joy for you and just
increase your overall happiness so if you're working if you're
an extroverted person and that's a strength of yours and
you're working someplace right now where you're not able to
collaborate with people you're not able to talk with people
let's say you're just working in a in a cubicle
for nine hours every day well you can see how
that can become a problem because you're not really realizing
and using your fullest gifts and that's really what happiness
is a lot of happiness is about at least the
quality kind of happiness that you can get in life
is by putting yourself in situations where you're using your
gifts to your full potential so if you are that
extrovert person finding a job or that extraversion is actually
serving the company and it's serving your managers and it's
serving the public is a good thing it's going to
make you feel really good when you put yourself in
that kind of position or if you have some other
kind of strengths maybe you're a very athletic person and
that's a strength of yours so if putting yourself in
a position where you can always be athletic you can
always be moving somewhere where you're not sitting in front
of a computer and maybe conversely for the kind of
person that likes to be alone and that likes to
work by himself or herself and likes to have a
lot of quiet time then being stuck in an office
where you're costly having to go to meetings and hobnob
with people that might irritate you and your greatest strength
might be being by yourself and having time to think
things through and be more logical be more analytical you
know whatever that might mean for you and then in
that case if that's your strength then aligning your life
so that that strength is accentuated it's great because it's
a strength of yours right so it's gonna come very
naturally very easily to you when you do that you're
gonna feel good because you're gonna feel like your natural
talents or gifts are being being used so with personal
development from my experience what I found is that really
it's not an either/or choice it's a false choice to
say that you're either gonna have to work on your
you're gonna accentuate your strengths just focus on that or
you're gonna focus on accentuate it or improving your weaknesses
really what you got to do is if you want
a stable level of happiness and also success in life
what you really want you're gonna want to work on
both but I think you're gonna want to start by
aligning your life with your strengths that's the most important
thing you're gonna get your biggest bang for your buck
by aligning your life with your strengths so if you
go to authentic happiness calm and you take that character
strengths survey it's a it's a pretty comprehensive survey and
what its gonna give after you take that result it's
totally free it's gonna give you the result and what
you're gonna get is you're gonna get a list of
your like top five strengths and what I found is
if you take those top two strengths that you have
and you start to to become really aware of those
strengths you first of all consciously now take them on
as your personality because before what they were they were
strengths of yours but you didn't you weren't conscious about
them and now you are and what you're gonna do
is you're gonna start to look for ways to align
your life and to live those strengths on a day
to day basis so you could ask yourself a question
like how can I include more of these strengths in
my daily routine or how can I do more things
throughout the week that will allow me to to really
live into these strengths and that might mean that you
have to adjust the role that you play at work
that might mean that you have to adjust the role
that you have in a relationship that might mean all
sorts of things depending on your strengths there's like over
30 or 40 different strengths on this survey so that
is gonna be a great source of happiness because right
now if you're not aligned with your top two strengths
and you're not doing that on a daily basis which
is really important is doing it on a daily basis
making it habitual then you're not getting all the satisfaction
that you could be out of your day to day
and then you're not as happy as you could be
so there's a lot of potential for growth for you
there if you're not doing that already but then once
you've got those pieces in place I feel like you
really take yourself to the next level and to live
a charged life not just a comfortable life you're not
just gonna want to be living in your strengths you're
also gonna be wanting to look outside and try to
round out your personality because what I found is that
the more rounded you become as you as you grow
you basically look at your deficiencies and see that they're
there limiting you in certain ways right and in fact
I've also found that it can be the case that
a deficiency or a weakness that you have is going
to limit how much you can accentuate your strengths how
much you can live your strengths so sometimes working on
your weaknesses is important especially I think when you see
that those weaknesses are holding you back from living that
charge kind of life this your the thing is that
the comfortable life that you're living if you're just living
your strengths and you're not taking care of any of
the weaknesses that you have you're going to be limited
in how far you can go in your life and
you're gonna let me be limited with the peak experiences
they're not gonna experience as much growth overall and those
weaknesses can really be holding you back so if you
have a certain weakness don't let that limit you and
keep you in a certain in a box because that's
what a lot of people do is they're boxed in
by their weaknesses by their limitations and even though they
might be having a they might have a job for
example where they're living their strengths the weaknesses still kind
of handing them in so maybe they're shy and reserved
and that shyness and reserved Ness they just say well
you know I'm a shy reserved kind of person and
so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna try to correct
that I'm not gonna work on that at all I'm
just gonna focus on being very very introverted and I'm
just gonna sit and lock myself up in my room
and do the work that I want to do and
I'm gonna be successful that way I think the fact
of the matter is is that you can be successful
that way but that's actually a bad thing because a
lot of times you can get success by being very
laser focused and that's what success is about is about
channeling your strengths and focusing them and producing value that
you can then get to the people therefore you get
value back and return but that doesn't always lead to
to ultimate happiness if you want to really work on
your happiness and fulfillment in life beyond just success which
you've got to do is you've got a look at
where your weaknesses are holding you back from really being
the best that you can be so maybe that shyness
that you've got is holding you back from actually going
out and sharing the message that you have I don't
personally for me that's being the case I tend to
be an introverted person and over the last few years
as I've recognized the limitations that that introversion has placed
on me I've really committed to working those weaknesses out
and what happened is that throughout most of my like
my teenage years and then my early career what happened
was that I was really bought into the fact that
I am an introvert and I'm totally happy with that
and I'm just gonna work on my strengths of introversion
and so I wouldn't have any problem locking myself in
a room and working hard and doing all this stuff
and not socializing and I felt honestly good about that
I didn't feel like I needed a lot of extraversion
but what I found is after I discovered that what
I wanted to really be doing with my life is
to share some of the some of the wisdom that
I've discovered through all my research on personal development going
out there and sharing that information which what I'm doing
right now I've discovered that I need more extraversion because
being as interpreter introverted as I was I was starting
to see the limitations of that for example I started
to notice that well I would need to be able
to go out and interview people because interviewing people gives
me more understanding about how personal development works it's hard
to to really know personal development just from your own
personal experiences especially if you want to help other people
you want to go out there and see what are
the differences what are the similarities so being able to
interview people means you have to be more social which
is something that I wasn't comfortable with also I noticed
problems with relationships that I was having I wasn't having
the kind of a dating life that I wanted to
have I wasn't even having the kind of a just
a social life that I wanted to have with friends
and even simple things like being able to have just
like a random chitchat with a stranger or like a
store clerk so I found that that was holding me
back and and then of course you know public speaking
was something that I wanted to get into and I
saw that I needed to get into it I needed
to break out of my shell together public speaking so
I could be a better communicator better deliver that message
and also being a better leader being able to lead
people with with ideas and understanding how to lead them
through words through speech through emotions so for me that's
been a journey and it's been really hard because being
very introverted that was a weakness of mine is going
out there and socializing that was like an uphill battle
for me had to struggle through it and I had
to keep struggling and I'm still going through that process
right now it's still very challenging and what I've discovered
though is that if I really want to live into
my full potential and live the kind of life that
I envisioned for myself the kind of life that I
see myself living five ten years from now I really
see the importance of working on the weaknesses because if
all I did was I focused on my strengths in
this case let's say introversion and I'm also very logical
analytical person if I just focused on those then I
would be limited in how much impact I could have
I couldn't really be doing what I'm doing right now
and what I'm doing right now is still something that
I'm growing into a nun developing my speaking skills my
communication skills so all that stuff I would be limited
in messages that I could that I can do so
maybe if my work was being a programmer for example
maybe that wouldn't be as important but because I chose
to go into speaking and coaching and motivation the personal
development then and I have this blog I had to
add to really commit to this idea that I had
to work on my weaknesses too and as I've been
doing that for the last three years or so I've
really taken a taking this to heart that I'm gonna
fix this introversion extreme introversion that I had I found
a lot of benefits a lot of benefits by having
a better dating life better confidence better better friends more
being more social just being even more comfortable when I'm
at the store and I'm having a random conversation with
a clerk or going to get a haircut and being
able to instead of what I had before was I
would just sit there in silence and sit there in
some awkward situation here now I'm able to have a
decent conversation actually have fun being able to flirt and
be able to crack jokes that kind of stuff it
just makes me happier to be able to do that
so in this case working on my weaknesses was really
really great and I'm still going to continue to do
that even though it's challenging so that's the trick is
that if you if you're living a comfortable life then
you're gonna tend to not want to work on your
weaknesses because we're here on your weaknesses is challenging it's
much easier to focus on your strengths but back to
this idea that really it's a false dichotomy it's not
gonna be the case that you work just on your
strengths or you work just on your weaknesses you really
want to do both because for example for me even
though I'm trying to be more extroverted I'm going out
there I'm socializing and pushing myself on that front I'm
also spending a lot of my time on my strengths
one of my biggest strengths as being is being open
minded and analytical and being a critical thinker I think
that's my top strength and so the way that I
work on that is by all the reading that I
do all the research that I do all the studying
that I knew all the note-taking that I do these
these blogs or I do a lot of analysis writing
articles that sort of thing so all of that is
working on my on my analytical strength and that analytical
strength is going to be really the thing that gets
me material success so that's if you're trying to build
a good career or a job or a business or
be successful with money then that's where your strengths are
gonna come in and working on those and really focusing
on those and for me doing that right now is
really rewarding it's it feels more natural it feels easier
much easier than going out there and socializing and a
lot of times I have this trade-off between do I
want to go and go out and hang out with
friends and spend a few hours doing that or do
I want to spend those couple of hours you know
reading a good book or shooting a video or taking
some notes something like that and a lot of times
I will prefer to do the thing that I'm strong
in so I want to be analytical I'd rather sit
and read a book for two hours then go out
there and socialize at a bar with some friends for
two hours but I also realized that if I want
to get to where I want to get to if
I want to live the kind of life that I
imagined for myself 10 years from now where I'm not
there doing speaking and I'm influencing people and I know
a lot about personal development I'm able to communicate that
effectively and I'm also having the kind of friends that
I want and I'm also having the kind of relationships
that I want I realize that I need to go
out there and push push my push myself on the
introversion front and push myself out of my comfort zone
there so it's a balance and it's tough it's something
I have to work through and I'm always kind of
tempted to to go one direction or the other so
the bottom line here and Evan Pagan talks about this
is that if you want to be really successful in
your career or in your business focus on your strengths
because your strengths when you focus on them they start
to generate value that value that you're generating for other
people so in your job if you're a greater programming
focus on that if you're great at being analytical focus
on that if you're great at interacting with people focus
on that and then you're gonna tend to you can
tend to see that if you do that and you
set up circumstances properly then you're going to get the
financial rewards in the success that comes from that but
if you want to be a well-rounded person overall and
you see yourself stifled in certain ways and limited in
certain ways by by other factors in your life like
factors that are not brought up to the same level
as your strengths then those are your weaknesses and to
get the best personal development not your business side handled
but your personal development you're going to want to look
at your weaknesses and you don't want to round yourself
out as it as a human being and both of
those things I think should be pursued the question is
which of those is right for you at this moment
right now if you want to work and focus more
on your career in your business then you're probably gonna
want to take that strength assessment and take a look
how do you incorporate more of those strengths in your
day to day how do you incorporate more that in
your business life in your in your in your career
at your job and that's gonna make you really fulfilled
and then if you're if you're struggling if you're seeing
that you're struggling that you're pretty good with your career
and your business and you're happy with that and maybe
you're struggling in certain areas of your life like maybe
you have a trouble with the work-life balance and you're
not having the kind of relationships that you want to
have or you're not having the kind of friends that
you want to have or you're lacking in some area
of your life or maybe something is hold you feel
like something is holding you back at work then maybe
look at your weaknesses and take a look at what
you're not so good at if you take that strength
survey on authentic happiness calm then you're gonna you're gonna
see they're gonna list your weaknesses as well and so
that's probably going to give you a few immediate realizations
about areas in your life that could be improved if
you worked on those weaknesses and then you can come
up with ways to work on those weaknesses and and
get those a little bit up and more in line
with your strengths and then you'll find that once you've
got your strengths and your weaknesses kind of at the
same level or you at least you bring up your
weaknesses you're gonna have less struggle in your life and
it's also a great growth process because as you're struggling
to overcome your weaknesses even though it's much more challenging
than working on your strengths you're gonna find that you're
growing you're realizing new things you're learning new things about
yourself that you haven't really known before and you're gonna
get a lot of reward from that you're gonna be
a lot of fulfillment from that even though it is
gonna be challenging so the bottom line is work on
both your strengths and your weaknesses it's not the case
that one is better than the other it's gonna really
depend on what your situation is and over the course
of your life you're gonna find that you're gonna have
points in your life where you're working a lot on
your strengths you're gonna have points in your life where
you're gonna be working on a weakness you're gonna have
points in your life where you're doing a combination of
both and so that's something that you're just got to
feel out and figure out what's right for you in
this particular moment time so go ahead and take that
strengths assessment if you haven't it'll tell you about your
strengths your weaknesses it's free it can be found on
authentic happiness calm so that's it for this video if
