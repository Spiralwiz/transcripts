[Music] how to get laid part two the mechanics and
the outer game the techniques this is what you've been
waiting for but make sure you go watch part one
for the foundation the theory the overview so everything i'm
gonna be talking about here has been rigorously field tested
by myself and by other guys for thousands of hours
for for years and for decades so this stuff definitely
works and the way you can know if it works
is by going out and field testing it yourself by
all means don't believe anything that i say as gospel
go try it and see what girls actually respond to
positively versus negatively if you do that a lot well
you'll realize that the things i'm talking about here are
quite accurate so again to sort of put this in
a bigger picture understanding let's clearly explain what game is
not and what game is because there's a lot of
misconceptions about this so what game is not game is
not about tricking women into sleeping with you game is
not about using canned pickup lines game is not about
being fake what game is game is learning how to
approach just doing a solid direct confident natural looking approach
requires a lot of practice and experience women don't seem
to understand this women just expect men to be able
to approach in a smooth way like from birth no
this this takes thousands of approaches to be able to
do uh a very smooth natural effortless approach for most
guys especially those guys who are sort of anti-social and
who don't have a lot of experience socializing game is
also learning how to flirt how to be playful and
how to be emotional one of the biggest problems that
us guys have is that we're very logical especially those
of us who have logical careers where we are doing
philosophy computer science programming engineering lawyers doctors actually some of
the best provider guys the guys who have some of
the best jobs who make some of the best money
business guys entrepreneurs women would love to date these guys
the problem is that these guys are so logical that
the woman can't connect with them emotionally and so these
guys generally don't know how to flirt so learning how
to be emotional with women right off the bat this
is one of the biggest aspects of game that you
gotta master another aspect is learning wit and verbal skills
now this is closely connected to flirting but be how
to be witty and how to have good verbal skills
this is something that a lot of men lack and
this holds you back from being able to attract the
quality women that you want women are very unforgiving when
it comes to your verbal skills you might be an
awesome guy in all other respects you might have a
great career you might work out you might be very
healthy you might be into spirituality and all that stuff
but if you don't have the right verbal skills you're
not going to attract her in a certain sense this
is very shallow of women to judge a guy so
harshly on verbal skills alone because you know verbal skills
if you think about it you don't necessarily need great
verbal skills to be successful in life now of course
it's helpful but there are many jobs where verbal skills
are not important but women predominantly judge you on first
appearances and your verbal skills so this needs to be
developed another aspect of game is learning how to be
highly social and calibrated just being the kind of guy
who can walk into a room and schmooze with everybody
small talk with everybody in an easy effortless way this
is difficult for many of us introverts but this is
highly attractive to women and it's necessary in order to
well just to talk to a lot of them and
also becoming very calibrated what this means is that you
need to gain a deep enough base of experience to
the point where you can understand the subtle cues that
women are sending you see women are very implicit rather
than explicit they don't tell you exactly what they're feeling
what they're thinking many times why they like you or
why they don't like you and a lot of times
women will send you mixed signals or they'll give you
very subtle social cues but if you lack the necessary
experience then you're going to misread those cues you're going
to miss those cues you're not going to know does
she like me or not does she not like me
or not does she like it when i touch her
is she ready to be kissed is she ready to
follow me home to my bedroom like how do you
know these things well the only way you can know
these things is by reading subtle cues because you can't
explicitly ask her like well are you gonna have sex
with me you can't ask a woman that even though
she might want that you see but you can't make
it explicit and the problem for us very logical men
is that we tend to be simple-minded we want things
to just be clear and explicit we don't like these
sorts of like games that women play where they're sending
up sending us little subtle you know signals but we
don't really know what it means so you have to
become the kind of guy who can read those cues
who's very socially experienced to do that the only way
you can read those cues is through lots and lots
of trial and error and social experience and then once
you're calibrated in that way then you can be smooth
and natural until then it's going to be very awkward
so this is calibration this is a huge component of
game calibration everything you do every technique you use or
whatever every mechanic it has to be suited to the
woman you have to be responding spontaneously to how she's
feeling right like you might want to physically escalate on
her give her a hug but then if you give
her a hug and and she gives you a cold
look you got to be able to be wise enough
to say ah okay so that hug wasn't done at
the appropriate time i have to warm her up first
a little bit before i can hug her again or
whatever you see and a lot of guys are missing
that another aspect of real game is being smooth and
natural making women feel comfortable around you you can think
of game as just like removing all the awkwardness from
meeting a stranger and getting romantic with a stranger quickly
usually there are sort of there's a sort of an
awkwardness when you meet somebody new and a lot of
times for most people who are inexperienced it can take
days and weeks of interacting with somebody new a stranger
to make them feel like a friend well game is
about befriending somebody very quickly and in fact you can
use these skills not just to befriend women but to
befriend men once you learn these skills you'll be able
to sit for example in an airplane and just schmooze
with the guy sitting next to you for example for
a few hours and he's gonna like become your best
friend using these skills that like very very quickly he'll
turn into your best friend just talking with him in
a sort of a smooth natural way but very socially
calibrated and making him feel comfortable and making the woman
feel comfortable and of course a big component of this
is making her feel comfortable with your physical touch so
a big aspect of game is learning smooth physical escalation
how do you start to physically touch a woman quickly
after meeting her in such a way that doesn't creep
her out and it feels totally natural and normal to
her and in fact it puts a smile on her
face and she loves it how do you do that
that takes practice and some some theory another big aspect
of game is learning how to deal with logistical problems
this is a huge aspect of game in a sense
this is the biggest aspect you deal with after you
get your verbals down and you're able to approach then
it's all about handling the logistics because women will throw
a lot of logistical obstacles to you there will be
her friends you have to deal with she's going to
have work in the morning she's going to have various
kinds of excuses for why she can't be with you
and all this sort of stuff and you have to
deal with that and figuring out how like how do
you get to her place how do you get her
to your place how do you make her comfortable about
all that so it doesn't seem creepy or weird or
awkward another aspect of real game is busting your negative
limiting beliefs and just building core inner confidence in yourself
starting to feel like you're an attractive guy starting to
feel like you're not a loser you're not a loner
and that when you go into a club or a
bar or any kind of social environment you feel like
you're coming from a place of high self-esteem you don't
feel like you're some sort of wallflower or you're the
odd one out but you feel like you can be
the center of the room you can hold attention and
you're comfortable with that so that's a lot of the
inner game stuff we talked about in part one and
the final aspect of game is and this is sort
of an advanced aspect it's finding your authentic style of
game it's not about copying me or some other pickup
artist or whatever out there and using his techniques you
gotta ultimately find what is the most natural and congruent
way for you to express your romantic feelings towards a
woman let's say you're sitting at a coffee shop and
you see a beautiful woman walk in and like to
you it's almost like love at first sight like you
really feel like there might be some connection there of
course it's just based on physical appearance but you know
sometimes you get that sort of like love at first
sight sense but then you're sitting there and you're all
in your head about you know well how do i
approach her what do i say to her what kind
of style should i use should i be physical should
i be loud and obnoxious should i be quiet should
i be cool should i be chill like what style
do i use right and so and then what verbals
do i say do i just copy some line i
heard somewhere on the internet but see that's not authentic
to you so when i first began learning game one
of the mistakes that i made is i didn't realize
how important it was to find my own unique style
of game and so i would use various lines or
i would use the style of other guys not realizing
that they don't fit my style so if you're more
introverted if you're more low energy you've got to find
a style that suits that you can't just be copying
high-energy extroverts because then when you try to pull that
off it's not going to be congruent it's not going
to be natural and she's going to feel that from
you and she won't get attracted to you so ultimately
the deepest aspect of game and probably the most rewarding
is finding your own personality and that takes work it
takes a lot of practice to find your own unique
personality and to be able to express yourself now you
know a lot of women actually recognize this uh and
if you ask a woman like for some dating advice
she's gonna say something like hey you don't need all
this complicated theory and all these techniques all this pickup
stuff all you need to do is just be yourself
that's what women will tell you that's their number one
dating advice just be yourself and of course they're right
where they're wrong though is that they don't understand how
difficult it is to be yourself they say that as
though that's easy and that that comes with no practice
no that requires thousands of hours of practice for many
guys to to be yourself just to be yourself in
the end at the very end of this game journey
learning game you're just going to be yourself but you're
going to be like your highest self not your weak
little pathetic inexperienced self right your your most confident self
your most experienced self your most mature self your most
conscious self the self that has really gone deeply inward
and and kind of smoothed out your various rough edges
the not awkward not shy not fearful self but the
confident bold self with high self esteem your own self-love
will shine through you which right now you're rusty with
that's going to take some years for you to discover
what your authentic style is you don't even know that
yet because you're so inexperienced it's sort of like if
you're trying to become an author or a filmmaker for
you to really be at the peak of your game
as a filmmaker or a musician for example you need
to find your authentic style and you would think that
well that's easy you should be able to do that
it's just a newbie but no for a filmmaker or
a musician to really find their style that can take
years of exploration you can make films that every film
you make it doesn't quite it doesn't quite align with
what you really wanted to say as a as a
creator it can take years and decades to really hit
your stride and find out what is the the unique
creative vision that you're offering with your with your work
likewise what are you really offering to the woman in
terms of your energy your masculinity finding that core that
is true game and that is what women find highly
attractive and it's very rare within men because most men
have not done the work to find their authentic style
and don't think of it as a style of game
think of it more a style of expressing your romantic
feelings towards a woman because you're a guy it doesn't
matter whether you have game or don't have game the
fact is you have romantic feelings towards women if you're
a heterosexual guy with a normal healthy you know hormone
system you have romantic feelings towards women but the problem
is that you don't know how to express them in
an authentic way because you're afraid she's going to reject
you you're afraid you're going to look creepy you're afraid
your friends will judge you you're afraid you're going to
screw it up and so you might want to escalate
on a woman you might want to kiss a woman
but then you're afraid it's like she likes me i
like her should i kiss her now or should i
wait an hour or kiss her later what if it
goes awkward what if she reject me like right so
at the end of this game journey you're going to
clear all that up to the point where when you
really feel genuine attraction towards a woman and you want
to kiss her you're just going to go and kiss
her and it's going to be no hesitation and it's
going to be smooth and effortless and she's going to
respond in kind very well because of the confidence with
which you express your authentic passion towards her and then
your passion towards her will turn into her passion towards
you and it's gonna turn into a beautiful romance you
see but this takes a lot of practice this is
not effortless it's not natural to begin with now let's
also address this point again of you know but leo
isn't pick up creepy because this keeps coming up look
being naturally social flirty and fun and charismatic isn't seen
as creepy at all by other people it's highly attractive
it's just seen as a charming extroverted guy but if
you take a guy who doesn't naturally have these to
begin with or he has lack of experience and therefore
is deficient in this department and you try to teach
him the skills society and people will look at you
and look at that whole situation say oh that's creepy
because they expect you to be able to either naturally
be good at this or if you suck at it
then just keep sucking at it for the rest of
your life they don't give you the leeway to actually
practice this stuff and to become non-creepy it's like either
you're classified as a creepy guy or a cool guy
and nothing in between and there's nothing you can do
to churn from a creepy guy into a cool guy
in fact if a creepy guy tries to turn into
a cool guy that is creepy and that's what makes
you a creep and you'll forever be a creep that's
how society and women tend to look at this situation
um but of course we need a solution where we
can turn creepy guys into cool guys how do you
do that well through this process that i'm teaching here
uh you see the problem here is that human sexuality
because it is so linked to survival is so central
to our survival and it's coded so deeply into our
subconscious minds that for most people sex and dating is
totally unconscious they take no responsibility for how sex happens
most people do not consciously go about saying okay i
suck at sex i suck at flirting i suck at
dating i suck at kissing whatever and i'm gonna deliberately
consciously practice these things and become good at this when
you try to do that very oddly society looks at
you like you're a creep but actually you're doing the
right thing you're taking responsibility you're taking ownership of the
problem rather than just letting it happen however it happens
and so one of the challenges that women have in
understanding this whole process of getting better with women the
reason a lot of times they don't understand it is
because i notice that a lot of women simply don't
take any responsibility at all for sex they're just operating
completely on autopilot now a lot of guys do that
too even a lot of so-called natural guys guys who
are good with women it's just like they're on autopilot
and so what ultimately you will find is that most
people in life are on autopilot about everything not just
dating but about their finances their family situation their marriage
their children their business their career everything's on autopilot everything's
unconscious and then teaching a person how to make it
conscious you know when you first try to make a
conscious it's a little bit awkward and weird there's effort
involved it can be it can be seen as try
hard you are a try hard you're trying hard to
improve and it takes a lot of work because there's
a steep learning curve within all these different domains to
improve on all these things um but what people don't
realize is that after years of effort eventually it becomes
natural it becomes second nature becomes effortless and then when
people interact with you they say oh leo you were
always this very charismatic person you were always extroverted you
always had this great speaking ability and these great verbal
skills and you were always good at flirting and you
always had a good sense of humor and you were
always intelligent and you were always very conscious it's like
no i wasn't that required enormous work you just don't
see the work you're seeing the tip of the iceberg
you're seeing the results you're not seeing the work that
i do behind the scenes and the work that i
do behind the scenes a lot of times it's ugly
it's painful it's brutally emotionally challenging and most people aren't
doing it and that's why of course most people are
mediocre and this is how you rise up out of
mediocrity but be careful because a lot of people as
you're trying to rise up out of mediocrity and to
improve yourself they're going to just call you a try
hard or they're going to call you weird or they're
going to say oh stop doing that you don't need
to do that that's so unnatural not understanding that natural
is something you develop you know there's nothing natural about
knowing mathematics there's nothing natural about reading um there's not
even anything not natural about like writing a lot of
the stuff we learn most of stuff we learn in
school is highly unnatural the only reason it feels natural
to use because you've gone through 12 years of schooling
drilling that [ __ ] into your mind and now
it's very natural to you and it just seems like
oh it's all effortless but it wasn't effortless when you
were learning language when you were learning to write and
to read and to do math and to do long
division this was highly unnatural painful difficult stuff if you
think back to your school days and so it is
with learning to flirt with women all right so step
number one for this is um now we're getting to
the outer game you need to find the best locations
for approaching women in your city bars clubs malls shopping
centers cafes colleges streets parks whatever you need to do
some research spend the next month researching these areas that
means you gotta pull up google maps find the densest
population areas where people hang out where there are women
in your city and uh and visit these areas make
a whole list of 10 20 30 40 50 different
areas in your city where approaching might be possible and
then you have to drive there walk there explore the
area and look are there women there where are the
best times is it during the evening is it during
the afternoon during the weekdays during the weekends you got
to figure all this [ __ ] out and make
a list of your locations this in and of itself
simply holds a lot of guys back they just don't
know the best locations in their city for doing approaching
and if you don't have good locations then you're not
going to be motivated to approach you're not even going
to know where to go to approach you need to
make this conscious and deliberate don't just expect some beautiful
woman as you know your as you're going to mcdonald's
to be there sitting at the table waiting for you
she's not going to be there you need to go
where the women are and you got to research that
and if you don't have these areas in your city
then it's time to move cities and in fact this
is one of the biggest things and best things you
can do for your game is move to a big
city where there are places where lots of beautiful women
congregate and there is high volume and abundance rather than
scarcity if you really want to learn game this is
what you must do now at first you can have
excuses for why you can't move leo i got a
job i got a career i can't move i can't
afford it i don't want to do it it's a
hassle i got a house i got an apartment i
just renewed my lease these are all excuses how badly
do you want to get good with women what you
should realize is that it's worth moving even if you
have to break your lease even if you have to
sell your house it's worth it why do you want
to live in such a lame city where there are
not the abundance of women and the quality of women
that you want why are you living in this city
you could find a new job you could find a
way to transfer yourself somehow you can make it work
if not immediately then within six months within a year
or so forth i literally broke my lease when i
was in dallas because i was so serious about this
and i wanted to move to vegas i literally broke
my lease halfway through i paid a penalty of several
thousand dollars then i paid an additional several thousand dollars
just in relocation expenses to relocate um i had to
pay a slightly higher rent because in dallas i lived
with a roommate and then in vegas i didn't have
a roommate i lived by myself um so my rent
was a little bit higher and uh it was a
hassle to move all my stuff drive all the way
there do all this but at the same time it
was also exciting and actually moving cities is one of
the best things you can do for your personal development
because once you get stuck in a city for too
long you fall into a rut it's it's good to
move around every five ten years move to a new
city experience life in a different city experience different city
cultures this is good for you aside from what it
does for your dating life now what are the best
cities you can move to for game well of course
very much depends on where you live around the world
many of you guys live in different countries different on
different continents but if we're talking about the united states
the best cities are new york las vegas miami austin
la if we're talking about internationally you know just look
at the biggest cities london for example is great um
there are many big cities in europe that would be
great and in spain in maybe in germany maybe in
the scandinavia you can find big cities um with opportunities
uh as far as in asia i'm less familiar with
with the scene there but just you know basically you're
looking for the most dense metro areas essentially with a
good nightlife and also hopefully with a good you know
cafes streets bars during the day shopping centers malls college
campuses this sort of stuff so i ideally you pick
a city that has great night game and day game
opportunities of course living in a big city is more
expensive although some big cities you can find affordable affordable
big cities um you can have roommates you know rather
than focusing on all the reasons why you can't do
it focus on how can i do it because i
need to do it and what you'll realize is that
moving to a big city like this if you're trying
to learn the skill set is one of the most
important things the single most important thing you can do
so do it do it if you're serious and if
you don't want to move then you're you're not serious
in which case you probably shouldn't even be learning this
skill set because the only way you're going to get
payoff for learning the skill set is if you're serious
this is not this is not a joke here this
is not something you dabble in this is something you
do seriously and you you commit a significant chunk of
your life to at least for a few years to
get good at it now let's talk about the difference
between day game and night game what does this mean
well day game just means gaming during the day night
game means game gaming during the night the key difference
is that during night game there's going to be alcohol
we're talking about bars and clubs mostly during day game
we're talking about things like college campuses sidewalks shopping malls
cafes this sort of stuff there are some important differences
between the two during night game what's great about it
is that you can get a lot of approaches in
the volume the abundance is what's great about night game
uh also the fact that people are drinking this does
help it loosens people up it's a more high energy
environment this also means that you can get away with
a lot more than what you can with during the
day you can be less socially calibrated so this is
great for for newbies who are still kind of socially
awkward people will tolerate you a lot better at night
than they will during the day during the day you
have to be very very socially calibrated and sort of
like chill at night you can practice more ballsy approaches
you can practice physical escalation a lot more there's a
lot more girls to approach um [Music] they're a little
bit looser they're a little bit less in the logical
mode of thinking that they are during the day and
they are more in the party mode that they are
during the night now one of the downsides is if
you're a low energy person then you might not actually
like that because your low energy game is not going
to be enough to gather the get the attention of
girls who are you know drinking and dancing and stuff
at night but also what's so powerful about night game
is that this is where you cut your teeth this
is where you really learn uh because these are some
of the most difficult situations you're in a very loud
club there's a lot of girls they're dressed up some
of them are very beautiful very intimidating what's great is
you have a lot of targets a lot of opportunities
and if you get a blowout it's not a big
deal you can just move on to the next one
and also of course with night game since it is
night time you have a chance of actually pulling the
girl home or going to her place and making something
happen exactly that night with day game i actually love
day game day game is amazing it sort of suits
my personality better than night game um i've got i've
done a lot of both of course i've done a
lot more night game just because there's a lot more
volume at night during the day game the biggest problem
that i find is that it's difficult to find in
most cities an area where there are lots of attractive
women that you can approach during the day usually if
i do day game it's like i approach one two
three maybe four women in a span of a few
hours like let's let's say you go to the a
very busy mall even at a very busy mall there's
a lot of women there but the the number of
women you would actually want to approach and date is
going to be quite few at least it is for
me i have pretty high standards and there's just not
that many beautiful women walking around all dressed up you
know during the day and what i find during the
day is that you have to do a pretty direct
approach and i want it to be an honest genuine
approach such that if i'm if i'm directly approaching a
woman at a mall during the day i have to
be genuinely attracted to her and that to me that's
just pretty rare that's not very common uh even if
i go out deliberately and spend three hours at the
mall walking around i'm only gonna see a handful probably
three or less women that i would be genuinely attracted
to and want to date and so this does present
a problem because it is difficult just to gain enough
approach experiences just from day game really to get good
at day game because i was doing a lot of
night game that helped me then to translate those skills
into day but if i was only doing day game
i would not have enough experience and so i'm assuming
you're going to run to the same problem but you
know some cities are really good for that for example
new york la london these cities like very large cities
can present amazing day game opportunities maybe even better than
night game now what's great about day game though is
that women are are much less approached during the day
than at night at night they're getting hit on by
drunk eyes all the time and it's kind of cliche
to hit on them but during the day a guy
who can do a very smooth natural easy approach on
a beautiful woman during the day this is pretty rare
and then flirt with her this is pretty rare so
if you have that kind of skill set you're definitely
going to make a very good impression on her and
uh and you're going to need a lot fewer approaches
during the day than at night to actually make something
happen now another problem with day game is that it's
rather unrealistic to pull a girl home and sleep with
her the same day during day game usually during the
day women are more logical they're not in a party
mode uh they're also usually busy they're going somewhere they
have plans and usually you don't have a lot of
time to talk with them usually even if you're lucky
a girl will give you five ten minutes of her
time during the day and then she has to run
off somewhere so this is not ideal at night what's
awesome is that you can you can hook a set
you can you can talk to a girl for hours
for one hour two hours three hours this gets you
an enormous amount of experience talking flirting laughing having fun
dancing this sort of stuff you can do that for
three hours with one girl in one night you can't
you can't gain that same level of experience during day
game so anyways these are some of the pros and
cons actually i find day game i would prefer to
do it day game if there was enough girls around
to do it with um uh because actually i'm not
that i'm not like that interested in one night stands
from day game you're not gonna be getting so many
white knight stands you're gonna be basically collecting phone numbers
and setting up a lot of dates and so i
actually prefer that i think most women prefer that too
because most women if you think about it like if
if her mom or her dad asks well how did
you meet your boyfriend and she's going to say would
she rather say well this charming guy you know chatted
me up at the mall or would she say oh
i was drunk and having you know fun with my
girlfriends and then this guy pulled me home from a
bar or from a club you know which one does
she want to say how she met you it's going
to be from a day game approach it's more socially
acceptable than it is you know partying at a nightclub
um although really if what you're looking for is the
most sex you're going to get that from night game
so now let's move on to how to actually do
an approach how to approach a girl we're going to
go step by step in sort of the right order
that you need to do it in so the first
thing you got to do before you even approach her
is you got to scan her up and down really
look at her look her face look at her body
and ask yourself how much do i like her is
there a genuine attraction there and believe it or not
this actually takes some some skill and some practice i
remember i would actually go to malls and i would
walk around a mall just looking at hundreds of women
walking by like a very busy mall on a weekend
and i wouldn't even approach i would just look and
i would just scan girls and say would i sleep
with her and how confident am i that i want
to sleep with her and i would do nothing else
and i would just scan hundreds of girls like this
just to build my internal radar system for what i
actually want in a girl physically because us guys were
honestly we're very physically um oriented when it comes to
our initial attraction towards a girl now of course i'm
not saying personality is not important and other factors aren't
important they are but when you're first making your approach
you got no idea of her personality you got no
idea about her career or whether she's spiritual or she's
a drug addict you don't know anything she could be
an alcoholic you don't know how do you know who
you approach well you got to approach a girl that
you're genuinely attracted to at least during the day now
during the night maybe you can do some warm-up approaches
on girls you're not really interested in just to socialize
you can do that too but like for example during
the day if i'm approaching a girl i have to
be sure that i genuinely like her because when i
open her directly i'm going to do a direct open
like i'm going to be complimenting her and i'm going
to be i'm more than just a compliment i'm going
to be in a frame of mind where i am
attracted to her and i want that energy to be
communicated authentically to her if i think she's adorable i
have to feel she's adorable and i have to say
that to her right if i'm saying it i have
to feel it otherwise there's going to be incongruence there
and she'll she'll sense that and there's a difference you
know some girls for example i find them adorable other
girls i find them cute other girls i find them
sexy other girls girls i find them beautiful and depending
on like those little subtle distinctions i will compliment her
or open her in that in that way and if
i don't it's gonna it's gonna come out awkward so
find out what your type is does she have to
be tall short what do you care about different guys
have very different standards for what they want in women
so part of this journey for you is finding out
what you really want in a woman what is your
dream woman and also you have to find that point
where you see a girl and then you're a little
bit attracted but you're not sufficiently attracted and in that
case you have to say no i'm not going to
approach i'm not willing to sleep with her and then
that's that it's actually very helpful to be clear and
kind of binary like up or down yes or no
would i actually want to sleep with her would i
enjoy that would that make me satisfied if it's yes
then you do an approach and if no then don't
do the approach um now again there are some exceptions
here in terms of like when you're first starting off
and maybe you don't have a lot of beautiful women
around you you might want to lower your standards a
little bit just to gain some experience and if you're
at night during the night time you can also lower
your standards a bit just because you're socializing you're not
necessarily for example doing a direct approach on every girl
if you're just doing an indirect approach and you're just
socializing you're just talking [ __ ] and just having
fun and kind of partying then you don't need to
do this but like during the day you wanna you
wanna do this uh also the next step is don't
overthink it so you're going to go into your head
and start to think of like oh no i don't
know what to say should i approach now should i
wait she's on her phone oh no what do i
do you have to basically shut off your mind and
clear your mind of all thoughts all these sorts of
doubts that you have does she have a boyfriend does
she have a husband oh no cut all that [
__ ] off and then you walk straight to her
don't delay don't wait for the perfect opportunity walk straight
to her you're definitely going to fear and feel anxiety
and fear as you're doing this because you're not going
to know what to say you're not going to know
how she's going to react you don't know if she
has a boyfriend or whatever but you push yourself to
approach her and then the next step is you get
her attention firmly this is not even the opener yet
this is just getting her attention so it's very important
that you don't do half-assed approaches this is a big
mistake that newbies make is they they try to do
a a meek 50 or 80 percent approach you have
to do 100 approach that means you're clear with yourself
you're approaching her right now and she's going to be
clear that you approached her there's not going to be
any ambiguity of like what does this guy want did
he does he want to talk to me or not
is he going to talk or not did he touch
me or not it's like no you're approaching her directly
and you get her attention and usually the way you
get her attention is just saying something like hey and
a pause hey excuse me and a pause that pause
is crucial before you can start running some game on
her or even giving her some line or some opener
or giving her a compliment about how beautiful she is
first you get her attention hey excuse me can i
stop you for a moment and then have her stop
if she's walking stop her and then a silence and
then eye contact make strong eye contact and silence the
mistake that newbies make here is that it's like hey
excuse me i thought you were beautiful no first you
get her attention right especially like during the day she's
off in her own world thinking about her own chores
she's got to do she's walking through the mall shopping
and thinking about something else you're about to hit on
her that's a very different frame of mind right so
you got to give her a little bit of time
to adjust to what's happening here she doesn't know who
you are you could be trying to sell her something
you could be trying to sell her you know mormonism
or religion or a cult or some sort of you
know product at the the uh at the mall or
whatever she doesn't know who you are or what you
want so hey excuse me stop strong eye contact a
pause get her attention and of course crucially you smile
hey excuse me stop smile i'm not doing it so
well right now it's a little bit of a fake
smile um but you smile because what you'll find is
that when you when you stop a girl like that
a lot of times she gets a little bit scared
or freaked out because she doesn't know what's happening so
you gotta smile to reassure her that there's no threat
or danger to her once you got all that down
now you can deliver your opener and what should your
opener be this is where a lot of guys screw
up is that they spend a lot of time overthinking
what the right opener should be as though looking for
the perfect opener is the thing that's going to get
you laid it won't this is a huge mistake it
doesn't really matter what your opener is your opener can
literally almost anything i'll give you a very simple one
here in a second but i want you to understand
that the the opener is not important because the opener
just gets the conversation going the real [ __ ]
is keeping the conversation going that's what's really difficult and
then eventually leading it somewhere more serious than just conversation
so most of game is not in the opener don't
get overly preoccupied about the opener so a standard opener
that i like to use which is very effective during
day game although hey you can use it during night
game as well is you you stop her you get
the eye contact and all that and then you tell
her hey you know i know this is very forward
but i just saw you and i felt very attracted
i wanted to come over and speak to you something
along those lines or it's like hey excuse me i
know this is random but i find you cute i
found you cute as you were walking by and i
would regret it if i didn't come talk to you
hi my name is leo what's your name and this
gets the conversation going something like that this is a
very standard very straightforward very direct very honest sort of
opener if you're genuinely attracted to her and maybe there's
something you like about her you you can customize the
opener a little bit more if you get more advanced
like maybe you like her sense of style her dress
maybe you like her hair ask yourself before you approach
her like what is it about her that made you
attracted to her now if it's something like her tits
um then you probably don't want to mention that um
but you know if you can find sort of a
non-sexual thing about her that attracted you to her then
you can say that it's like i saw your hair
and i thought it was really beautiful i like your
sense of style and then describe her style to her
or maybe it's more of a like you can even
do an opener where it's like you say like look
i saw you walking by i know this is kind
of crazy but like and i don't i don't even
know how to put my finger on it but something
about you your energy just i felt very attracted by
your energy stuff like that like that can be sort
of it's kind of vague you know and a lot
of a lot of times for us guys it is
like that we see a girl and it's like we
don't exactly know what we like about her what we
find attractive about her but just holistically like something draw
draws us to her and you can literally say that
to her as the opener of course introduce yourself have
her introduce you herself to you and then get the
conversation going the next step is to be very at
ease and relax this is crucial because when you first
start doing these approaches you're going to be so scared
you're going to be so anxious and tense and the
problem is that any anxiety or fear within you is
going to translate to her she's gonna see it and
read it in your eyes and you might have a
very stiff posture in body language so you have to
learn to just relax and be at ease and very
chill especially this is a daytime approach you want to
be super at ease so that she feels completely disarmed
and relaxed because you're completely disarmed and relaxed and you're
not nervous you're not stuck in your head you're not
mumbling now of course when you first start doing this
you're going to be very nervous and mumbly and all
this sorts of stuff and you'll get plenty of blowouts
but as you practice it more you're going to get
better the next thing you want to do is you
want to be very happy and playful you want to
be coming from a happy place not some depressed place
be happy be there to have fun with her it's
a frame of mind that you teach yourself to enter
into you also want to be as genuine and honest
as possible about your feelings your intentions and so forth
the next step is rather than asking her a bunch
of interview questions about what do you do and where
are you from and this sort of stuff it's better
to make statements about her and make informed guesses for
example just by looking at her she might be standing
there in a certain kind of dress with a certain
kind of hairstyle maybe she has some tattoos maybe she
has some piercings maybe she has she's carrying a bag
from a store where she just bought something you can
make statements and inferences based on that so this is
very observational and it's very dependent upon the specific girl
you're opening so she might be standing there with with
a certain you know bag from a certain store maybe
she's standing with a bag from the apple store and
then you make some assumptions or you maybe tease her
a little bit based upon the fact that she has
a you know apple store bag in her hand what
does that mean about her or she has a certain
dress maybe she's dressed in all black or maybe she
has a very flowery dress what does that mean about
her so you can make statements and your statements they
don't even have to make much sense you you can
look at her and you can kind of do like
a cold reading say you know you look at the
kind of girl that is interested in um you know
you look like you have a very corporate look about
you do you work in corporate see that's a statement
rather than a question a question would be like where
do you work that's not so good because that puts
you into a very logical interview mode whereas if you
make a statement or an assumption about her that's a
lot more interesting to her and it'll get her to
engage more emotionally you can also make like more humorous
joking types of statements about her like maybe she has
sort of a little bit of a hippie vibe going
and you might say oh you you like to smoke
that weed don't you i get that sense from you
and see it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong
maybe she's never smoked weed in her life but the
fact that you say that now this gets her more
like interested because you see that's not just a logical
boring interview question um that's like a an assumption you
made about her now she wants to know why do
you think i smoke weed or maybe she says yes
i do and then you can connect on that you
might say oh i smoke weed too or you might
say oh we that's bad for you girl you know
something like that then you can tease her on that
or whatever or you might say well i don't smoke
weed but i like psychedelics and then you can get
into the conversation of psychedelics um like that and then
see very quickly then you can go into like a
deep territory rather than just ask her questions about like
what do you do for work how old are you
where'd you go to school stuff like that for example
you can make assumptions about her what you think her
major is like oh you look like you're a uh
you're um you know a psychology major or you look
like you you're uh a communications major or a philosophy
major or whatever and you don't have to be right
it doesn't matter whether you're right or wrong it's uh
it's gonna be more interesting either way than asking questions
so make sure that you're not being too logical but
rather you're trying to be as emotional as possible with
her communicate with her on an emotional level on a
more intimate level if you're going to ask her questions
ask her more interesting more intimate questions than questions like
where do you work for example you can ask her
the question of like what are you most passionate about
in life see that that's a much more interesting question
or what do you like most about yourself that's a
much more interesting question like nobody in the last month
has asked her that question you see and and then
when she gives you some response you can take that
response you can riff on it you can either tease
based on it or you can actually learn something about
her and kind of find a common connection between you
two like maybe what she likes about herself is her
generosity and then you might say oh that's interesting you
know i find that same quality for example in my
mother but the problem is that maybe she's too generous
and then it feels like she's not doing enough for
herself because she's being too selfish or selfless rather and
then see and then and then the girl can say
oh yeah i'm like that too right and then now
you've got something to talk about that's not just some
boring work topic next you want to start to flirt
i'm giving you just broad strokes here i'm not going
to tell you how to flirt exactly here you're going
to have to learn that but you have to learn
to flirt and you're going to have to exhibit some
sexual intent and you do this through teasing you never
say anything sexual per se but you tease her and
you make her feel like this is not a business
interaction this is not a friendly interaction you're not asking
her for the directions to the nearest starbucks or to
the restroom that's not what this conversation about this is
the beginning of a dating opportunity here that needs to
be very clear without actually saying that i want to
date you you practice this more and you get better
and better at communicating sexual intent a lot of sexual
intention has to do with the eye contact and the
frame that you're setting here uh for example you might
you might throw out a line such as like oh
you seem like a troublemaker you know she says something
you're like oh i can tell you're gonna give me
trouble see just by saying that already like who says
that you you would never she would never hear that
in a business conversation she would never hear that from
her mother she's not gonna hear that from some guy
selling her some product at the mall this is a
this is this is obviously a sexual conversation although very
subtly sexual it's like no you're a troublemaker and then
just pause it like that and then move on to
some other topic another thing that's very helpful here is
act like you're above her so rather than putting her
on a pedestal and assuming that she's the beautiful one
and she's the prize when you're engaging with her be
so confident now this this can come off a little
bit narcissistic and egotistical but be so confident that you're
just assuming that you're higher value than her which means
like you are bringing the value you have a lot
to offer here that means you don't have to talk
very fast and you don't have to sell yourself to
her by telling her all of the great things about
you but rather you assume already that you're a very
attractive highly valuable guy and that she's getting an opportunity
to meet you even though you approached her that's the
kind of frame you want to take so don't give
all your power away don't overly compliment her give her
one compliment if you say she's cute or she's beautiful
or you found her attractive that's enough you don't need
to keep fawning over like oh my god you're so
beautiful it would be so amazing if i could date
you please will you date me like no the frame
needs to be that she would be lucky to date
you even though you opened her and you're screening her
rather than her screening you so when you're talking with
her and finding out about her life and her career
and what she's passionate about and all that you're suddenly
screening her like you're judging her in the sense that
like you know she might tell you that all uh
i'm into meditation and then you ask her oh yeah
what kind of meditation and then maybe she tells you
like she's she's into something and then you're like oh
okay and then but you're see you're evaluating like maybe
she's meditating but she's a poor meditator and then you
kind of subtly judge her for it and tease her
it's like are you a good meditator or you just
meditate and actually you're falling asleep when you meditate it's
like i'm going to judge the quality of your meditation
girl i'll teach you how to meditate see this this
frame of like you're the guy you're the leader you
know more than her you're more experienced than her that's
the frame now at first you might have to fake
it till you make it it might not be true
at first but as you develop your game and you
become very confident in yourself and also you develop your
life as well and you gain more life experience it's
actually going to become true that you're more experienced than
her and you're a better leader than her and she
has someone to look up to that's ultimately what the
girl wants she wants to date a guy she can
look up to who is confident assertive can lead her
who is a little bit above her in value now
next you want to keep the conversation going as long
as possible keep talking and talking and talking make it
as emotional as possible and keep it going as long
as possible during the day it's probably not going to
last more than 5 10 15 minutes at night it
can last a lot longer keep plowing keep plowing the
point is that you want to build a bond between
each other the deeper the bond the more solid will
be the phone number that you get at the end
or the more likely she is to follow you if
you're going to bounce her to some new location grab
a drink with her the more likely she's going to
be interested in that if your conversation is less than
five minutes most likely your phone number is going to
flake and she's not going to follow you anywhere and
therefore it's not going to go anywhere it's to waste
your time so you keep the conversation going as long
as possible and then at the end as you're sensing
that it's wrapping up or she tells you that you
know i got to go i got a class i
got to get to or i got to get to
work or whatever then you push for first you try
to do an instant date for a coffee or a
drink if she has time you can convince her to
go grab a coffee at the nearby starbucks and if
you're like at a mall always know where the starbucks
is because you're gonna try to walk her to the
starbucks and continue talking to her sit down because if
you can sit her down for a coffee at a
starbucks at a mall you can talk with her for
20 30 minutes there and that's like a date almost
you're doing an insta-date this is the ideal situation this
is going to be your most solid chance for success
with her but a lot of times girl will be
busy she's not going to be interested in that she
doesn't have time therefore you you grab a number take
her number text her the next day and try to
set something up the problem is that it's going to
be very flaky you're going to have a very high
flake rate from these numbers the flake rate is going
to be probably over 70 percent that means 70 of
girls simply won't respond to you the next day after
you get their number and what that means is that
you didn't build a deep enough connection you weren't emotional
with her enough or sometimes you know you're just not
her type she didn't find you attractive that happens too
that's okay not every girl's gonna find you attractive um
she might not have been single a lot one thing
that i like to do during the daytime is i
will explicitly ask a girl are you single and i
will ask this within the first five minutes of the
conversation because i don't want to waste my time a
lot of times girls will have boyfriends and i want
to know immediately if she's single then that's going to
end the conversation right i mean if she's if she
says she's not single that's going to end the conversation
right there during the day uh if she says she's
single then first of all that's very explicit like she
knows exactly what you're interested in if you're asking that
question second of all it gives you a sense of
confidence to know explicitly that she's single now she can't
give you a sort of a boyfriend excuse later because
she already said she's single and then that sort of
opens the door for you so don't be afraid to
ask a girl if she's single or not you can
do that within two minutes of meeting her and in
fact i usually do that to save myself a lot
of wasted time because sometimes what happens is you can
talk to a girl for 15 minutes and at the
end of it you ask for a phone number she's
like oh sorry i have a boyfriend it's like but
why the [ __ ] were you talking to me
for 15 minutes clearly this was a dating opportunity situation
this was not a you know a business conversation but
sometimes girls will just forget to say they have a
boyfriend because they don't want to upset you or they're
afraid that it's gonna you're gonna get mad or something
like that so just ask them if they're single so
basically push for a coffee or a drink uh bounce
her around if you can grab a phone number if
you can and hey i mean you can even go
for a pull which means you know you you you
bounce her to for a drink then you take that
date and you you convert into something else you can
kind of stroll around the mall together you can do
some window shopping together you can go to stores together
and eventually you can invite her to your house that's
a little bit difficult to do during the daytime it's
easier during the night so that is basically how you
do an approach and how you how you convert it
into something uh like a dating situation now all of
game can be summed up as follows approach be playful
express your romantic desire so that she's clear about that
so that you're not friend-zoned lead her towards a coffee
a drink walking around getting an ice cream lead her
bouncer to different places she has to get comfortable following
you because eventually she has to follow you to your
bedroom and stay with the girl whatever you do stay
with the girl as long as possible now of course
if she tells you to leave then you leave you're
not going to be a creep who clings on if
she's asking to leave but as long as she's not
asking you to leave you stay with the girl as
long as possible literally and this is a magic line
this magic line will get you laid especially during night
game the number one strategy for getting late at night
is you find a girl you approach her you're play
playful with her you express a little bit of your
romantic intentions towards her you move around with her and
then as she's you know going with her friends or
she's going back home or whatever here's the magic line
you tell her you say can i come with you
wherever she's going you say can i come with you
can i come with you she says she's going to
meet her friends can i come with you she says
they're going to get a drink can i come with
you she says they're leaving the club can i come
with you she said they're going to go uh grab
some some food after the club can i come with
you she says she's going home can i come with
you she walks into her bedroom can i come with
you because by the end of the night she's gonna
wind up in bed she's gonna be in somebody's bed
probably her bed and if you're in her bed when
she's in her bed this is how you get laid
it's not rocket science and usually what you'll find is
that if a girl is interested in you a lot
of times a girl will be interested in you but
she's a little bit kind of like if she's interested
but she's not going to work very hard to make
something happen she's just interested but you're gonna have to
handle all the logistics to make something happen and sometimes
the easiest way to handle logistics is to simply ask
can i come with you and just go wherever she's
going and a lot of times she'll just say yes
you can come with me it's like we're all getting
drinks we're gonna take shots together with my friends great
i'll come with you and i'll take a shot okay
once that's done it's like okay now we're going for
food great can i come with you for food i'll
get some food too okay come on along because if
she likes you she's gonna she's gonna want you to
come along she's enjoying your company now of course this
assumes she's enjoying your company now if she says no
i don't like you then it's over right so obviously
you're not trying to be so pushy that you're trying
to do something against her will see the thing is
that girls are not going to lead you to sex
you have to lead them to sex and there's nothing
wrong with that that can seem like it's kind of
creepy but it's not creepy it's just that girls are
not going to take responsibility for making things happen you
have to do that as the man and like the
easiest way to do that if you don't want to
set up all the logistics yourself which you should try
to do but if you're kind of lazy or she's
not willing to come with you because she's not comfortable
enough with you then just ask her can i come
with you and a lot of times that will that
will allow you to overcome many of the logistical hurdles
okay so here's a sort of a high level structure
of a successful pickup you approach directly and you grab
her attention then you deliver your opener it doesn't matter
what the opener is literally the opener can be something
as stupid as i don't know i hate facebook that
could be your opener i mean like experiment with stupid
ridiculous nonsensical openers it doesn't matter what you open with
because you need to teach yourself that the quality of
your opener does not determine whether she's gonna like you
get attracted to you or sleep with you stupid openers
can work as well as very sophisticated elaborate openers in
fact the more you overthink your opener the worse it's
going to be the less natural it's going to be
sometimes go out to the club and just try very
stupid openers now during the daytime you don't want to
use very stupid openers you just want to be more
kind of casual and normal and chill and direct and
just tell her you saw her and found her attractive
that's enough for a day game opener during the night
time you can experiment with some stupid obnoxious openers um
man i mean i could tell you like really obnoxious
openers that i've used and they've hooked really well so
probably the most obnoxious opener i've ever done is actually
like a ridiculous opinion opener but you have to understand
i'm going to tell this to you right now but
you have to understand that i was completely congruent and
i was a very high energy state when i delivered
this opener which is why it worked you would not
want to try this if you're just a newbie and
you're scared and you're not going to deliver this congruently
so a lot of a lot of the power of
the opener is how congruent you can deliver it so
basically the opener that i used the most obnoxious one
i used is something like there are two ladies sitting
at the bar and i walk up to them and
say hey ladies excuse me i need your opinion on
something what's your opinion on glory holes are you for
or against obnoxious ridiculous opener you would not normally want
to use this but uh you want to experiment a
little bit with some obnoxious openers just to see how
far you can push it so now you might think
like oh oh my god leo you this kind of
opener surely they hated you no um that girl by
the time i finished that opener and then five minutes
of just plowing with funny [ __ ] that i
said after the opener that girl was ready to go
home with me and after five minutes that's how well
that opener worked um but it you have to understand
it wasn't the opener that did the magic it was
the energy i brought into it how congruent i was
this was towards the end of the night late in
the night i've already done a bunch of approaches and
i was just having fun i was really in a
fun mood and i was i was just joking and
after i delivered that opener just joke after joke after
joke after joke after just plowing her with [ __
] jokes right so what you don't want to do
is just walk up cold to two girls sitting at
a bar and like hey ladies what do you think
about glory holes and then just dead silence and you
don't follow up with anything else and you're not in
a fun mood that's going to be ridiculously creepy and
you'll get immediately blown out and maybe they'll even call
security on you you don't want to do that um
so it's not so much about the opener it's about
the opener and then how you carry yourself after the
opener you have to keep talking you don't just leave
a dead silence after the opener you have to understand
that after you open a girl she still doesn't know
anything about you and she's not going to be carrying
the conversation for you your responsibility after the opener is
to carry the conversation like ninety percent ten percent maybe
even ninety five percent five percent that means you're going
to be talking 95 of the time she's gonna be
listening and she'll be responding five percent of the time
that's during the first few minutes of the interaction so
it's not enough for you to have a great opener
you got to follow that opener up with 95 other
verbals to keep it going you're sort of jump starting
her then once you jump start her and she she's
attracted and she's interested and she's having fun then she'll
start asking you questions she'll start telling you stories and
then it'll become more of an even 50 50 conversation
but don't expect her to carry the conversation in the
first few minutes after you open her because she doesn't
like look let's say you're walking down the street and
i just stop you as a guy you're a guy
and i'm a guy i just stop you and i
say hey i really like your hair man it's cool
and then i just dead silence like that's my opener
and then dead silence and then i expect you to
carry the conversation see it's not going to go anywhere
you're not going to carry that conversation because you're not
invested in me you don't know what i want you're
doing your own thing in life i haven't done anything
sufficiently to to grab your attention and to make you
invested in a conversation so i would have to not
just tell you like i have to do something like
look i really like your hair and then you know
oh i saw somebody else you know my friend has
the same sort of haircut and then blah blah blah
blah blah and i have to keep plowing and plowing
and plowing and plowing for a few minutes and get
you a little bit of a sense of who i
am and where i'm coming from and what i'm interested
in my passions are and so forth and then you
could get invested if you are interested in this conversation
you can invest you can start asking me questions and
then it could even out to a 50 50 conversation
and even then i could get you to start asking
me and doing most of the talking but at the
beginning of that i have to plow it's going to
be 95 me talking so be prepared for that all
of that is just to say that don't over emphasize
the opener so continue on with the structure of a
successful pickup so you approach directly grab your attention you
do the opener then you do strong eye contact and
you square up to her what does it mean square
up to her it means that you're face to face
rather than like let's say her face is pointing in
this direction and you're setting like at an angle maybe
like this or you're like this you want to be
face to face and close to her right so you're
squared up it's direct don't do indirect approaches where you're
standing behind her shoulder somehow trying to talk to her
because then she can just like it's kind of awkward
for her to even have her face tilted over her
shoulder listening to you because she's going to get tired
she eventually she just move her face away from you
and cut you off that way you want to be
face to face with her looking her straight in the
eyes and a lot of sexual intent can be communicated
with your eye contact work on your eye contact next
you want playful for flirtation with sexual intent but you
don't want to make sex explicit so don't explicitly talk
about sex just implicit another way to call this is
to wear this is man woman interaction you want a
man-woman interaction this is not a friend zone thing we're
not friends we're not business colleagues this is man to
woman you have to learn how to communicate man to
woman immediately if you decide you're attracted to this woman
and that's why you're approaching her make statements and do
cold reads rather than asking questions plow plow plow keep
talking keep talking keep talking and free associate free associate
based on what she says riff back and forth with
her she says something tease her about it riff on
it free associate jump topics you don't need to carry
a single logical thread through your conversation you can jump
around you can say nonsensical things you can joke around
it doesn't have to be like an interview in fact
the less like an interview the better it is eventually
you're going to reach hook point hook point is when
you can clearly tell that the woman is attracted to
you i'll talk more about what hook point is how
it's reached and how to tell that you've reached it
in part three of this series after hook point you
wanna start to get serious about physical escalation physical escalation
there's something called the kino escalation ladder you can research
it you can download the pdf and read it basically
there's a sort of a ladder of physical escalation that
happens to get a woman comfortable with your physical touch
so that it's not creepy learn how to physically escalate
the the most basically the way it works that you
start with the most innocuous non-sexual physical escalation and then
you build up more and more and more towards more
sexual things and this is also a great way to
communicate um sexual intent without being explicit about it and
it's a great way to heighten the man woman interaction
so usually when i when i approach a girl i'll
tap her on the shoulder like this this is sort
of like the beginning of the physical escalation uh because
it's it's the most non-sexual non-erotic part of her body
people will tap each other on the shoulder frequently it
has no sexual meaning usually and so that's a great
way to get somebody's attention you can tap them on
the shoulder like this or even when you're speaking with
them you can put your hands on her shoulders like
this but you don't want to keep them there you
can kind of put them there for a few seconds
take them off just get her comfortable with you touching
your shoulders or touch one shoulder uh the other thing
you can do is you can just poke her not
in a creepy way but in a funny way like
you say a joke and then she's laughing she's giggling
and then you just poke her like this in the
shoulder a little bit and then once you do that
and she's comfortable with that and she you see she
has a smile on her face then you can poke
her in the in the belly for example um or
poke her in the leg poke her in the thigh
a little bit you know what's nice about a poke
is that it's like boom in and out done she's
not thinking about it you're not thinking about it um
and then you can keep escalating more and more and
more and then your your your physical touch becomes more
erotic and more sexual as it goes on for example
you can you can give her a hug you can
give her a hug without saying so or you can
ask her or you can just tell her i want
to hug you like she says something like oh i
want to hug you come here girl and then you
just hug her and then let her go um usually
when you start off you want the physical escalation to
be very kind of quick in and out rather than
letting it linger and then as you see that she's
comfortable with it you can let it linger more now
the key to physical escalation here's the magic key is
that it needs to be calibrated to her mood and
the way you tell her mood is by her face
you watch her face as you do the physical escalation
and you notice her reaction if she's smiling if she's
giggling if she's laughing and you touch her and she's
still doing that great that's a clear sign a clear
green light that you can keep doing more if however
she gives you a cold look if she's not holding
eye contact with you if her mood changes to something
negative then you know that you over escalated or that
she's not comfortable with you or that you need to
back off and make her more comfortable with you by
talking with her and then try the escalation again and
see if that's going to make her smile so basically
you're not escalating in a way where you're trying to
push yourself on her right definitely not if she's frowning
then you're doing it wrong and then you don't escalate
any further but if she's smiling push it see how
far you can escalate so one of my favorite ways
to escalate is to grab her by the hips pull
her into me pull her hips into mine um grind
her into me front to front uh and if she's
smiling during all this great then you can rub her
you know rub her sides rub her hips rub her
legs rub her ass hold her ass grab her ass
squeeze her ass if she's still smiling keep doing that
um you can verbalize some of the stuff or not
a lot of times i'll do this without even verbalizing
it or you can you can ask her you can
politely ask her like as you're for example holding your
hips you can ask her politely can i squeeze your
butt and a lot of times she'll say yes and
then you do it of course if she says no
then you don't do it um you can you can
even ask like what i will often do is this
is of course this very heavy physical escalation i'm talking
about right now this is mostly night game not day
game you're not going to be doing this kind of
thing during during the day but at night game you
can get very physical very quickly it'll it's shocking actually
how fast you can do this within 30 seconds all
this can be done within 30 seconds at night with
the right girl um but of course it assumes she's
attracted to you right so you have to reach hook
point don't be grabbing her hips before reaching hook point
that's going to be creepy so you you reach hook
point here she's obviously attracted um you know a lot
of times if i see a girl with amazing tits
at night and you know i'm holding her by the
hips uh we've reached we've reached hook point and i
really like her tits i'll just be very authentic about
it like you have amazing tits uh can i squeeze
them and almost always they say yes you'd be amazed
at how how rarely they say they say no and
this gives you just a great excuse to physically escalate
even even harder um of course you have to understand
this is all being done with her permission whether explicit
or implicit a lot of times it's just implicit and
the way you understand that it's implicit permission is she's
smiling right that means she likes it she might even
say no but she's still smiling that means she still
likes it she just doesn't want to come off too
[ __ ] and that's all fine then you can
back off a little bit and then try again in
five minutes like that uh and then really the physical
escalation can get really obnoxious like really obnoxious i could
tell you stories about physical escalation that that would be
so graphic that it would probably get me banned from
youtube all with her permission right you have to understand
all with her permission uh okay so you do some
physical escalation then you build rapport you build rapport intimacy
and emotional connection this is huge it's not enough just
to physically arouse the woman and just to get her
attracted that's the first step but then you gotta build
rapport she has to know you and start to trust
you she's not gonna sleep with you if she can't
trust you if she's not comfortable with you she has
to know about you you have to tell her about
yourself your life your dreams your passions your your whatever
whatever you're doing she has to be able to trust
you share stories about your life ask her stories about
her life build that intimate connection stick in the set
as long as possible if this is night time try
to make it go for an hour or two hours
if you can next you're gonna have to start to
think about handling logistics you have to figure out what
is this girl doing where did she come from how
did she get here who is she with what are
her friends doing where is she going tomorrow does she
have work tomorrow is she available tonight what are her
plans tonight where is she staying what hotel what house
does she have roommates all of these are known as
logistics find out the logistics if you're trying to sleep
with her that night so the way you do this
is you just literally ask her logistics questions throughout the
entire interaction and you can begin to do this rather
quickly within the first five minutes so one of the
common logistics questions that you ask first of all you
ask who are your friends how do you know each
other where are you staying are you a hotel are
you a local how did you get here did you
drive did your friends drive is there a car here
did you take a taxi did you take an uber
what are your plans later tonight are you hanging out
with your friends are you free how long are you
planning to stay out tonight till the very end are
you leaving in five minutes where are you going where
are your friends going do you have a roommate do
you live alone figure all this out figure out whether
it's easier to take her to your place or to
go with her to her place be open to both
possibilities depending on whatever is easiest so you should know
all these things probably within 30 minutes of meeting her
if you intend to make something happen that night and
then as you find those things out you have to
in your own mind kind of make some calculations as
you're talking to her like okay so she's here with
her friends her friends are all drunk and they're lost
or maybe she's lonely she's by herself and she's she
has no plans tomorrow she has no work tomorrow okay
she's free she's available she likes me she got here
by an uber that means we can take my car
we can take an uber back to my place or
whatever right you have to calculate all these things in
your head as you're talking to her if you want
to make something happen that night uh handling her friends
is also going to be a significant chunk of the
structure of a successful pickup here because most girls at
night they go out with their friends chances are her
friends are there a lot of times the friends don't
want her to leave a lot of times the friends
will want to party or do other things or create
drama so you have to basically find out about her
friend's situation befriend her friends don't ignore her friends uh
but also don't waste too much time on her friends
focus on the girl handle her friends and uh find
a way to make it comfortable for her to leave
her friends at the end of the night if that's
what you want or if she refuses to then go
with her and her friends because in the end you
have to understand that at the end of the night
she's probably going to be sleeping in a bed separate
from her friends and all you gotta do is be
in that bed now actually that's not always true a
lot of times like example in vegas girls will actually
stay in the same room or even sleep in the
same bed if they're you know best friends or something
they're going to share a hotel room this is a
problem because you're not going to have sex with her
if her friend is sleeping right next to you guys
so find out if she's alone in her room or
if there's friends sleeping in the same room because that
does present a problem then you have to take her
somewhere else so after all that you have to lead
her you have to move her around and see if
she's going to follow you and you begin just by
moving her around the venue move her a couple of
feet from the bar move her to the bar away
from the bar move her to the dance floor dancing
is a great way to get her to move around
with you and to follow your lead dance in different
parts of the club or the bar um go to
the back go to the dark areas go to the
front go to the outside areas if there's an outside
area just basically bounce around move around and see is
she comfortable following you because if she's not going to
follow you then she's not going to follow you home
and if she is comfortable following you then keep leading
her further and further until eventually you get to your
place bounce around to new locations so maybe from that
bar bounce to a different bar if there's multiple bars
on the same street bounce around to multiple this is
going to make it feel like more of an adventure
and more like you're not sticking around in the same
place it's gonna make her feel more comfortable and familiar
with you as you do that maybe after the bar
bounce her to some taco stand get some tacos or
get an ice cream or get a drink or get
a coffee just bounce around if there's an after party
go to an after party and then eventually you pull
to your place or to her place once you pull
her to your place or her place on the bed
or on the couch you do more physical escalation more
erotic physical escalation make out with her uh get into
fingering her and then ultimately sex and that's that's how
the whole process works from a sort of high level
there's really three phases to this whole process there's the
attraction phase there's building rapport and then there's the seduction
phase so the attraction phase starts from your approach to
hook point hook point is the point where you know
she's attracted to you that means she's willing to sleep
with you if she's comfortable with you and you are
able to isolate her in a location where sex can
happen so once you reach hook point after that and
usually hook point only takes five minutes to reach then
the rapport phase in the report phase you need to
make her comfortable with you you need to make her
feel like she knows you and that she can trust
you and that you're not some dangerous guy or some
weirdo the rapport phase can last 30 minutes to an
hour to two hours this is almost like what you
would be doing on a date really getting to know
each other at a deep level so that's the report
phase and then once that is done now she trusts
you she's attracted to you the only thing that's preventing
you from sleeping with her is the fact that you
two are not isolated in a room together and you
haven't sexually aroused her enough yet so isolate her in
a room that's going to be a challenge that's where
all the logistics stuff comes in isolate her in a
room by herself with you and then begin the seduction
and actually that's the easiest part is once you isolated
her the seduction usually is the easiest part now sometimes
what happens is that you isolate her you begin your
seduction and then she gives you last minute resistance which
means that she says oh i don't want to have
sex with you i barely know you and blah blah
blah blah i don't feel comfortable what this means is
that you didn't build enough rapport earlier you have to
go back and build more rapport if you build enough
rapport then she's not going to say those things to
you she'll be willing to have sex with you on
the other hand if all you do is you build
rapport but you skip the first attraction phase what's gonna
happen is that she's gonna friend zone you building rapport
is like becoming deep friends but there's not the raw
sexual attraction so it's a good idea to to do
these in the right order first five minutes of an
interaction is attraction get her attracted that eliminates the possibility
of any kind of friend zone then spend the next
hour or two building rapport then after that spend all
your time trying to isolate her from her friends and
so forth and then you can seduce her and she
will be happy to sleep with you now sometimes what
happens is that these these will actually the order of
these phases will actually kind of get inverted and twisted
and this can actually trip you up and cause problems
but it can also work as well for example i've
had it like recently i was at a club on
halloween and this girl like it just immediately hooked immediately
hooked like raw um sexual attraction like within seconds right
and she was dancing with me i was dancing with
her and we were like moving around the club and
we went to the dance floor like within a minute
she started grinding on me she was grinding on my
dick for like 30 [ __ ] minutes like crazy
attraction crazy physical escalation very very fast it was completely
on um she was very turned on she was very
horny i was very turned on as well like everything
was going good and then i basically tell her let's
get out of here um follow me and she's like
okay let's go and so i walk her out of
the club walk her to my car but the problem
is she didn't even know my name uh it it
just went so hot and heavy so much physical escalation
so much attraction right off the bat that we didn't
have any time for rapport because it's a very loud
club on the dance floor you can't even talk so
the mistake that i made there is that after all
the dancing and grinding and [ __ ] i should
have realized that the stages were sort of inverted the
faces were inverted here that we we missed the rapport
uh stage i sort of went straight to seduction on
the dance floor skipping rapport and then try to pull
her and it didn't work she didn't she ended up
coming home with me and the reason that happened is
because what i should have done is after all the
dancing and grinding i should have taken her to a
quiet place in the club sat her down and just
built rapport for 30 60 minutes and then she would
have trusted me enough to come home with me um
but you know what sometimes you can literally pull a
girl in five minutes sometimes the raw attraction is strong
enough she's down enough that she'll just come home with
you without even building any rapport without even knowing your
name that's happened to me as well um literally five
minutes uh you can pull a girl in five minutes
i've done that um but generally speaking that's not a
solid strategy uh it's that's not going to be consistent
what you want is you want to build your game
consistently rather than just depending on you know fluke luck
or hail mary's that you know occasionally land in your
lap all right so here are the top things that
you want to learn in field this is a list
write all this stuff down and basically as you're going
to be going out you're going to sort of have
to check off each item on the list and start
to get experience with it specifically you're going to be
like training these are like isolation training exercises for you
so first of all approaching without excuses and man you
have so many excuses for why you don't approach girls
so you got to be able to train yourself to
approach without any excuses secondly is a strong direct approach
no meek approaches no half-ass approaches if you decide to
approach a girl you're approaching her you're grabbing her attention
she has to hear you she has to give you
her full attention so do that go spend a week
or a month just practicing strong approaches with no excuses
next is squaring up to her face to face this
is part of what a strong approach is don't be
talking over her shoulder or behind her back square up
to her full attention on you next work on strong
eye contact laser strong eye contact unwavering eye contact uncomfortable
eye contact your eye contact should be so strong and
so sexual she should be looking away from you because
she can't hold that much sexual eye contact with you
practice that for a month next is smile practice smiling
when you open this is huge it's a it's a
disarming mechanism because if you're not smiling she doesn't know
you might be a [ __ ] rapist or a
serial killer next is when you're speaking to her especially
when you open firm vocal tone and be loud so
she can hear you enunciate clearly don't whisper don't mumble
don't babble very firm and also don't supplicate don't be
like hi nice to meet you do you want to
date me not like that it's like hey i wanted
to meet you i think you're beautiful like that like
firm strong clear assertive practice that for a month also
practice slowing down your speech and your movements when you're
anxious and nervous especially as a newbie and you're opening
a girl you're going to want to tend to talk
very fast and slur your words and mumble and bumble
and move frenetically like this practice going out for a
month or for a week and just opening slowly allowing
space and room and silence pauses between when you get
her attention like hey i wanted to meet you i
think you're beautiful you see those pauses those are very
important instead of saying like hey i wanted to meet
you i think you're beautiful that doesn't let her register
all that also those pauses are necessary so that you
can react to what she is feeling and thinking and
saying because you might say hey and then she might
not yet have given you her full attention then you
have to wait it's like hey she's talking to a
friend hey tap her on the shoulder hey get her
full attention that might take you 10 seconds to do
once you have her attention then you say you know
i wanted to talk to you and then she gives
you more attention and then you say i think you're
beautiful and then you listen and and look at her
face how is she reacting to what you just said
and then you riff on that and you improvise based
on that this is all extremely improvisational you see so
slow down your speech and your movements so that you're
like you're not flowing like water you're like a rich
thick maple syrup or honey that is slowly pouring onto
the girl that's how you want your speech to be
also work on being very relaxed and present present with
her experiencing her rather than stuck in your head thinking
about what to say next and you got to really
relax you got to be comfortable in your own skin
especially when you're at these very loud nightclubs one of
the most challenging things about loud nightclubs like in vegas
here is that they just blast you with ear splitting
music and everybody is in this high energy state and
you just don't feel comfortable you can barely hear yourself
thinking sometimes in these clubs and so what you have
to do is you just just stand there for 10
minutes in a club and just absorb the energy let
it fill you up become comfortable you have to be
so comfortable in that environment that can be difficult for
us introverts because we don't like that very high stimulation
but you can train yourself to get much better at
that i've been forced to here in vegas because we've
got some really obnoxious clubs but then actually you can
use that to your advantage because those obnoxious clubs then
allow you to escalate very very quickly that's the beauty
of them that's why they're they're so loud to begin
with um other things for you to learn in field
be positive be playful and self-amusing have fun be there
to have fun first and foremost you got to be
having fun if you're having fun she'll start having fun
with you don't take any of this too seriously make
jokes entertain yourself while you're there entertain yourself more than
you're entertaining the girl the next step that you want
to work on is building state building state means putting
yourself into this this fun relaxed very social state it's
almost like getting drunk but you're not drinking the way
you build your state is by approaching approaching approaching approaching
getting blowouts having successes it doesn't really matter whether you
have a success or a blowout it's going to keep
building your state the way that you fail to build
state is by getting in your head and not doing
approaches and then getting more and more in your head
or if if you get blown out then getting in
your head and not doing more approaches building state is
crucial you want to make you want to get to
a point where you're able to build your state every
night you go out with a few approaches a few
warm-ups and then you're in state and then from that
state that's when your best approaches will happen it's very
hard to to have greater approaches unless you're in state
um and especially the way that i do it i
i all the nights that i've gone out hundreds of
nights that i've gone out thousands of girls that i've
talked to over years i haven't had a single drink
so when i go out to the loudest clubs and
i have the most fun i don't drink at all
i'm completely sober and that's what i recommend for you
don't drink build your state sober and what happens is
that you'll realize that you can build your state so
well you can get so good at building your state
without drinking that you can literally have more funds sober
than most people in the club have when they're drunk
and in addition to that you'll have your full wits
about you and it's the best of both worlds and
also you're not destroying your liver and your health and
you're not wasting a bunch of money on drinks every
drink in vegas cost like 25 i've spent thousands i've
i've i've saved thousands of dollars of not buying a
single drink a lot of times i have so much
fun and i'm in such a good state in the
club not always but on on many nights that girls
actually won't believe me when i say that i don't
drink in fact that girl on halloween um when i
was when i was pulling her to my car um
she told me we can't go in your car you're
drunk and i said i don't drink and this hurt
this um sometimes you know sometimes this this so shocks
girls because they expect you just to be drinking that
they don't act they literally don't believe me uh this
is actually a great thing you want to have so
much fun at the club that people think you're drunk
but you're not actually drunk this means you're doing it
exactly right now you're not a build state uh the
next thing you want to work on is sexual intent
and man-to-woman interaction make sure that within five minutes of
talking to a woman it's clear to her that you're
talking to her in a man-to-woman way with sexual intent
then if you can do this you'll never get friend
zone ever again the next thing to practice is physical
escalation and the kino escalation ladder go research that and
read it and practice it i spent an entire month
or two when i first started gaming where i would
go out for an entire month and all i did
was just work on physical escalation i would try to
escalate as quickly as possible i did that in vegas
i did a 30-day challenge in vegas back in like
in 2013 where i just learned really solid physical escalation
game and to this day i have really good uh
physical escalation game it's my favorite way a lot of
times to open especially in loud clubs physical escalation tends
to be very polarizing it either hooks immediately or the
girl just rejects you this is this is actually kind
of good because you can quickly go through 10 girls
eight of them will reject you no problem and then
two of them will hook really hard and then you
clearly know that it's on whereas with verbal games sometimes
it's a little bit you're kind of in the gray
zone you don't really know what's happening of course the
downside here is that you are forcing her to basically
decide immediately whether she is uh attracted to you and
sometimes a girl will reject you just because you sort
of you go in too hard and too fast where
if you did some kind of slower more indirect verbal
game over 10 20 minutes then maybe she would open
up to you more but he or she rejects you
um so you do lose more girls with physical escalation
if you do it right off the bat but that's
one of my favorite ways to open i just enjoy
it like i found that um you know going back
to that point about finding your authentic style for me
my ethnic style is that i love to do physical
escalation especially when i'm really genuinely attracted to a girl
i just immediately want to get very physically touchy with
her and since that's authentic to me it tends to
work really well if i'm in that mood and i
really find her attractive now if i don't find her
attractive then physical escalation doesn't work so well because it's
not congruent so congruency here is a very important principle
we'll be talking about that more in part three the
next thing you want to work on is asking screening
questions and handling logistics so get good at asking logistics
questions where are you from how do you know your
friends where are your friends what are your plans where
are you staying what hotel what do you live alone
blah blah ask all those questions get good and just
instinctive about asking all those questions as you're flirting with
her you you sprinkle them in throughout the conversation over
the course of you know 20 30 minutes you don't
ask them all back to back that would be too
awkward um and all you'd be surprised i remember when
i first learned this idea of of logistics questions i
was like wait a minute you can girls will answer
these questions for you doesn't that is that kind of
weird why would she answer these questions um that was
my first sort of doubt about that and then when
i actually started practicing it i realized that there's like
never been a single girl who has not answered my
logistics questions ever like girls answer logistics questions so easily
uh it's not even a problem [Music] the next thing
you want to work on is flirting small talk and
not running out of things to say this is a
huge topic i'll cover this in part three more i'll
give you a whole section about how to not run
out of things to say the next thing you want
to work on is not asking boring questions instead making
statements cold reading making observations about her observational openers are
really good observation while you're talking to her is really
good to keep the conversation going the next thing you
want to work on is being emotional rather than logical
that means being dramatic expressing negative emotions if she tells
you something you don't like react with negative emotions like
i don't like that it's like what do you like
oh you like like oh you're from you're from alabama
i don't like alabama alabama's stupid something like that you
know express negative emotion you don't have to always be
positive with a girl sometimes exaggerate your expressions and be
hyperbolic you know sometimes she says something it's not like
i'm i hate that thing but i'll play it up
a little bit like oh i really hate that thing
it's like you voted for trump i [ __ ]
hate you you know something like but it's it's done
in a playful way i don't really hate her it's
just we're playing we're teasing we're flirting um experiment with
push pull challenge her be challenging don't just be a
pushover be challenging if she says something you know tease
her on it another thing to work on is talking
about yourself us introverts we suck at this we suck
at talking about ourselves we think it's egotistical or narcissistic
or that nobody would want to hear but really the
secret to extroverted conversation is that extroverts have no filters
and they talk about themselves endlessly that's their secret so
you got to learn to be like an extrovert and
just talk about yourself talk about what you ate today
talk about your job talk about your career talk about
your dreams talk about your future talk about where you're
going for vacation next month talk about your spirituality talk
about your psychedelic experience just like talk about yourself this
will fill up a lot of room and time in
the conversation and also she gets to learn about you
as you're talking about yourself and then she can get
interested like you might start talking about how you're gonna
go do some meditation retreat next month in hawaii and
she might be interested in that and learning more about
that she'll start asking you questions but if you don't
tell her that she won't know how to ask you
about it she's not going to ask you like oh
are you meditating next month are you taking a vacation
next month she doesn't know she can only know these
things and she can get a sense of what questions
to ask if you plow her with some stories about
your life and what you're doing next work on charisma
become more charismatic become more expressive with your face with
your voice with your hand gestures charisma you could there
are entire courses online you can take about charisma entire
youtube channels about how to develop charisma entire books have
been written about how to deal charisma practice that next
practice improvisation and free association so when she tells you
something you free associate off of that you know she
might tell you that she went on a walk with
her dog and then you hear the word dog and
then you think about hot dogs now you start talking
about hot dogs that's free association see it's not a
direct logical connection to go from a dog to a
hot dog and then we're talking about hot dogs i
can think about that and i can think about some
sort of movie that involves hot dogs see and then
we we leap now we start talking about movies as
we're talking about movies we might talk about star wars
and then we're talking about stars and we're talking about
astronomy and as we're talking about astronomy we're talking about
black holes and we're talking about black holes we might
talk about um you know racism black racism we start
talking about that and then we're talking about racism then
we start talking about trump and then we're talking we're
talking about trump and then we're whatever and then like
see you develop this giant threat of conversations from doing
free association rather than staying on a single thread and
you can also multi-thread conversations so you're not just talking
about one thing at a time but you're talking about
you know one thing and then you jump to a
different thread then you jump back to the old thread
and this way you have multiple threads running practice that
practice self-deprecating humor rather than trying to brag to her
you know disqualify yourself and tell her like all how
horrible you are that that flips the script um next
work on not saying anything sexually explicit so when i
first started game i was a bit obnoxious and sometimes
i would sprinkle sexually explicit things into a conversation and
what i found is that usually this blew me out
and it ruined the mood one of the things that
makes girls immediately repulsed by you is being overly sexually
explicit and vulgar so just don't go there don't make
rape jokes don't talk about how you're gonna have sex
with her don't talk about who you had sex with
like this sort of stuff this is generally not good
don't don't talk about glory holes don't talk about porn
like just stay away from these topics they're not necessary
the next thing to practice is not bragging and not
trying to impress her if you have an instinct for
doing this stop doing it stop talking about how rich
you are what kind of car you have what kind
of house you have this is not necessary in fact
go back and practice the self-deprecating humor instead next practice
dealing with her friends get good at befriending her friends
one of the best ways to do this is if
you see a friend give a compliment to the friend
like oh i like your purse i like your dress
i like your earrings i like your necklace i like
your hair you seem like a fun fun friend you
seem like you're a good friend you seem like you're
a good friend to her find out a little bit
about the friends find out their names find out what
they do how they know each other talk with them
a little bit then get back to your girl so
that your friends her friends see you as a cool
guy not some weird rapey creepy guy then they're much
more likely to let her go with you at the
end of the night if her friends don't know anything
about you they're gonna [ __ ] block you at
the end of the night and you're gonna lose your
girl to her to your to her friends the next
thing to practice is not ejecting from set stick in
the set to the bitter end stay in there if
she's if she says she wants to go get a
drink stay with her if she says she needs to
go find her friends stay with her if she says
she's leaving the club stay with her as long as
she's okay with it um a lot of times you
know a big thing that i struggled with is i
would talk to a girl for five ten minutes then
i would try to grab a number and run out
of the set as quickly as possible because i was
afraid i was going to screw it up or that
i was going to rise things to say like no
plow that set to set to the bitter end practice
number closing get get smooth at asking for her number
such that you're not hesitating and you're not fearful it's
like hey girl i want your number give me your
number i'm going to see you again like that whatever
have her punch the number into your phone always get
her number don't give your number to her get her
number always um practice insta-dates especially if you're doing day
game before you ask for the number first try for
an insta-date so you're talking to her with her for
10 minutes everything's going great then you say hey there's
a starbucks over here it's just a a couple hundred
feet uh you know down this way let's go over
there grab a coffee we'll keep talking see if she
bites uh try to get her interested in that if
she says no i gotta go then you get a
number but don't ask for a number first before you
try to instigate insta dates are crucial for day game
next you gotta work on leading moving and bouncing around
don't just stand in one place at the bar where
you opened her and just talk for two hours and
not move that's stupid you talk to her for 10
minutes then you move her two feet talk to her
for 10 more minutes then you move her to the
other side of the bar talk to her for 10
more minutes then you move her to a different bar
or dif you know usually a bar will have multiple
bars in the same building go there and just keep
moving her around like that get her comfortable with that
get comfortable yourself with leading her get comfortable bouncing to
different locations get comfortable bouncing from a bar to food
from food to the park from the park to your
place and so forth another thing to practice is managing
your own mood and self-doubt a lot of times you'll
go out and sometimes you'll be in a good mood
other times you'll be in a bad mood you won't
even want to talk to girls but you have to
do it anyways you have to put yourself into a
positive mood sometimes you're going to be depressed sometimes you're
going to be heartbroken sometimes i would go to a
club and i would be heartbroken because some girl broke
up with me the other day or because um [Music]
or i would be depressed because of some other thing
that was happening in my life or something else was
on my mind some business problems so forth you gotta
manage your own mood get all that [ __ ]
out of your mind get all the self-doubt out of
your mind or sometimes i would just be in a
deep self-doubt where i would be thinking like well you
know i've been going out for the last week and
i haven't been having any great results and now i
feel bad and i'm doubting myself maybe i'm not attractive
anymore maybe i'm getting too old maybe whatever maybe i'm
not a uh maybe girls don't like me as much
as i thought i did maybe this whole thing is
not gonna work maybe pick up doesn't even work maybe
it's all scam right you get it these self-doubts you
have to be able to manage these remove them from
your mind put yourself into a positive mood and go
approach so learn to do that the next item on
the list is building rapport intimacy get good at this
remember to do this even if the girl likes you
even if she makes out with you let's say you're
walking through the club and a girl just jumps on
you jumps in your lap starts making out with you
and grabbing your dick this will happen if you go
out to clubs enough and then you're thinking okay awesome
this is amazing let's pull her home no go build
some rapport and some intimacy find out something about her
share something about yourself share life stories share your passions
find out about her as a person then pull her
have some stories in your own life that you're good
at telling you have stories stuff that has happened to
you crazy stuff interesting stuff scary stuff fun stuff adventurous
stuff you've done have some of those stories in the
back your mind and get experience sharing those stories with
people this reveals stuff about you try to find stories
that reveal things about your character and who you are
authentically i'm not talking about fake stories i'm talking about
real stories from your life like maybe you know i
could tell you a story like back when i lived
in dallas in the middle of winter i saw a
little dog a little stray dog in the middle of
like a cold ass winter just like shivering under my
car and uh i saw this dog and it was
i immediately realized this dog a homeless dog in the
middle of winter it's gonna die out here so cold
like below zero it's gonna die out here no food
um no warmth so i caught the dog under my
car and brought it into into my apartment and then
tried to you know feed the dog and all this
sort of stuff i can go to a whole story
about that and eventually we found we couldn't find the
dog's owner the dog didn't have any tags but eventually
my neighbor saw that i took in this dog i
didn't even know how to take care of dogs it
was the only dog i ever took care of my
neighbor gave me some dog food i fed her i
felt i mean i fed the dog and um and
then eventually we found a new owner for the dog
to adopt the dog right so like a story like
that that tells you something about my personality tells you
that i'm compassionate that i care about animals blah blah
blah blah something like that you tell a story like
this to a girl now she knows something about you
she can trust you now now i didn't make that
story up that actually happened so have some of those
those those stories have happened to you in your own
life it's just that a lot of times you you
forget about them and then you don't actually talk about
them with new people that you meet because you're too
in your head and you forget about those stories or
maybe you think those stories aren't interesting i mean this
story about this dog is not particularly interesting but it
does tell you something about my character and you feel
like now you know me a little better than you
used to the next thing you want to practice is
getting good at dealing with [ __ ] tests the
more attractive the girl the more she's going to should
test you what a [ __ ] test is is
basically she's testing you for congruence and for the strength
of your frame so when you come up to a
girl and you're all confident you have a loud voice
and you're assertive and you're flirting and you're doing all
this and you're telling her all these stories about yourself
and you're you're presenting yourself as this cool high status
high value guy okay but what if you're faking it
what if you're lying what if you're putting on a
front and actually you're this shy scared guy who's just
puffing himself up like a strong guy see the girl
needs to test for that and so subconsciously she has
ways of testing you um i'll give you a story
about probably the strongest [ __ ] test that i've
faced which was actually with one of the most attractive
girls that i ever cold approached so this ridiculously attractive
girl like a she was basically like a nude model
um i saw her sitting at a chipotle style fast
food place i walk in there to get my mexican
food this was some years ago and she was there
it was it was dead quiet it was only her
and me she was getting her food she was about
to sit down i see her she's like in her
sweatpants and sweatshirt from the gym she just came out
of the gym uh getting her mexican food and i
can just tell that like she's ridiculously attractive even through
all the sweatpants all that [ __ ] i can
just see it i'm like god damn i gotta open
this girl this is like amazing you don't usually see
a girl like this out of chipotle um so i
get my food i'm thinking like how do i open
this girl she's sitting there at a little circular table
just eating her food so i say [ __ ]
it i'm just gonna go and sit down so i
just sit down right across from her at her little
table this kind of shocks her i just sit down
start eating my food and start talking about myself just
as though you know very casually as though nothing is
happening i just start talking about myself um i talk
and talk and talk eventually she gets a little interested
starts asking me some questions and so forth i mean
clearly it's obvious to her that i'm hitting on her
um it was a very ballsy approach to do um
i almost didn't do it but i did and then
but but she was very attractive and she was very
very entitled and clearly you know a lot of guys
hit on her and so she started [ __ ]
testing me she was her ethnicity was half she was
mixed raised she was half thai half german very interesting
mix uh so we started talking about thailand and so
forth and we started talking about this this in thailand
they have this notion called ladyboys which are like i
guess they're thai boys who turn themselves into girls basically
trans trans folk so basically they look like girls but
they have dicks so we started talking about that and
she said that basically the point was that she said
that she was one of these lady boys and actually
she had a dick she said it so convincingly that
for a minute she almost convinced me that maybe it's
true and it phased me because when i sat down
i was very confident i was talking very confident and
then she sort of like threw this monkey wrench into
my game and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking to
myself like i didn't really express this externally but internally
as she's telling me this i'm i'm thinking like is
she for real or not and i wasn't sure and
it sort of like threw me off my game and
it made me um like waver in my confidence and
but eventually i i concluded to myself that this is
a [ __ ] test and and so you know
she started talking about her dick and i and the
way i passed the [ __ ] test was i
said don't worry girl i i love dick i'm gonna
love your dick anyways all right and and just continue
continue running my game and it worked great eventually she
asked me for my number so that's how that went
um so yeah girls will should test you like this
they're trying to see like how much they're able to
unground you and if they can unground you then they
realize oh he's just sort of like a weak man
posing as a strong guy and then they lose attraction
but if they try to like unground you and they
see that you're stable you're like a rock then this
actually makes her feel comfortable and secure around you and
that's what the feminine wants from the masculine the next
thing to work on is handling [ __ ] excuses
and token resistance a lot of times girls will send
mixed signals and will give you token resistance and token
nose like um you know you you lean in to
kiss her and she smiles and just kind of like
coily pushes you away now she's not rejecting you per
se she's just like not ready and she's giving you
some token resistance this doesn't mean she doesn't want to
be kissed she doesn't want to be kissed but you
try again in five minutes or she can give you
[ __ ] excuses about why she has to go
like she has to go to work she has to
go to a class in five minutes it's a lot
of times that's just [ __ ] now sometimes she
doesn't have to go or sometimes she has a legitimate
excuse she has to go to work or whatever um
but a lot of times their excuses are [ __
] uh so just one very pointed example for you
uh a wingman of mine who's quite good here in
vegas he just told me this story recently so so
he he opened this girl in vegas talking to her
she's really into him everything is going great uh clearly
it's on and this girl just keeps telling him you
know after like an hour of talking and like we're
not having sex tonight we're not having sex and she
just keeps telling him this like three times three times
in the night she she told them we're not having
sex and he's like okay girl i'm not even trying
like okay we're not having sex eventually though they wind
up at his place and they're on the couch and
they're making out and all that and the girl just
sort of like shoves them and says why haven't you
[ __ ] me yet and this is a very
experienced wing of mine this guy has thousands of approaches
under his belt like extremely experienced but even he was
taken aback by this because like girl why are you
sending me these [ __ ] mixed signals you told
me three times we're not having sex tonight and now
at the very end of the night you're upset at
me that i haven't [ __ ] you already of
course guys are confused by this so girls will play
these games with you now does this mean that if
a girl tells you we're not having sex tonight that
she's always lying to you no sometimes she really means
it so it can be difficult to sort the wheat
from the chaff so it takes a lot of experience
to learn what are the legitimate concerns that a woman
has in sleeping with you and what is the [
__ ] there's a lot of [ __ ] with
women because they don't want to come off as [
__ ] not in their own minds they don't want
to think of themselves as [ __ ] but also
they don't want to look like [ __ ] in
front of all their friends so they come up with
stories and excuses for why they can't come home with
you and blah blah blah blah with all that being
said ultimately if at the end of the night if
she says i don't want to have sex with you
and she says it in a firm tone then don't
have sex with her i'm not telling you to to
rape women here or to force them into anything that
they don't want to do it's just that women aren't
always honest with themselves about all the [ __ ]
and excuses they make up when they're dating guys and
actually interested in sleeping with guys but they can't be
explicit about it so this is something you'll learn as
you get more experience with women is that there's a
lot of [ __ ] and games that women play
it's not just guys that are playing games in fact
if women didn't play games guys wouldn't need to learn
game the reason guys need to learn game is because
the reality is for most of us guys look you
think we like all this game stuff we don't if
i had it my way i would see an attractive
woman and i would just walk up there and say
hey you know what i like you let's [ __
] that would be the simplest most authentic most honest
most truthful way of communicating my experience and what i
actually feel for her but see if you tell that
to a woman you're never going to get laid in
your entire life you can't walk up to a woman
and just say hey i like you let's [ __
] even though that's authentically what us guys oftentimes think
so we have to play games the way the reason
we have to play games is because they want us
to play games because sex is taboo and you can't
be explicit about it and if you tell that to
a woman she's gonna think you're a creep does that
actually make you a creep no it just makes you
a [ __ ] uh an honest guy honestly us
guys within three seconds we know if we want to
have sex with you that's just the truth um but
we can't be honest about that because if we were
we would never get laid so yeah it's a game
it's called a game it's called game for a reason
because both sides play games who plays more games well
i'm not going to get into that you also want
to learn some text game i can't get into that
it's going to take too long you want to learn
how to set up proper dates that might be a
separate video on itself you want to learn how to
complement women basically when it comes to complementing women i
give compliments very rarely and when you compliment a woman
try to compliment her on anything other than her physical
appearance or her sexiness because this is too obvious try
to compliment her on her personality thinks you like things
about you like about her spirit her soul these sorts
of more deeper compliments maybe her style her dress these
are all better than just saying hey i love your
tits or i love your ass don't that's that's not
a that's not a that's not a good compliment and
uh and lastly work on telling her why you like
her and why she's special so this is huge for
getting a girl to sleep with you for a girl
to want to sleep with you she has to feel
like she's special to you and not just like any
other girl or that you're just using her body to
gratify yourself so for you to genuinely be able to
tell her why you like her you have to find
out some stuff about her and make a mental list
as you're getting to know her about the stuff that
you really like and also have a list yourself as
things you like in a girl for example i like
it when girls um love animals i find that adorable
so if i find out that a girl likes animals
that makes me like her more i like girls for
example who are into psychedelics if i find out that
a girl likes psychedelics i'm much more interested in her
i like it when when a girl is very open-minded
obviously because i'm very open-minded i like it when a
girl is into spirituality and meditation and understands things about
love and god and so forth you know it's kind
of stuff that i teach i like it when a
girl is into eating healthy i like it when a
girl is into personal development right so these are some
just a little bit of some of the list of
the things that i like in a girl personality wise
and so if i find out that the girl hits
any of these points i want to make sure that
i i reflect that back to her to say i
really like these things about you and then when she
hears that then now she feels like we have more
going on here than just me wanting her for her
body and then she's much more willing to have sex
all right so that's a lot of stuff that i
just gave you that long list of stuff it's going
to take you years to practice all of those in
isolation and to dial in all those aspects of your
game don't worry don't get too overwhelmed by this so
you don't need to you don't need to be able
to execute on all of those points in order to
have good game and to get results and in fact
don't be thinking about all those points when you're going
out at night you can't learn all of that at
once so here i'm going to give you a shorter
list of just the basics to start with here are
the basics the most pare down list of what you
need to do to get some results to get started
as a newbie so number one find clubs bars and
malls to go to that are good for approaching number
two go out actually go out number three approach consistently
get over your approach anxiety bust through it and build
state number four do a solid direct approach no meek
half-ass approaches number five work on strong eye contact squaring
up smiling and strong firm assertive voice number six be
positive and put yourself into a happy mood as you're
talking to girls number seven keep talking keep plowing flirting
and do not eject from the set early keep talking
until she blows you out until she tells you to
leave and finally always try to end the interaction with
an insta-date a phone number or bouncing her to some
new location this this is a small list this is
a much shorter list this is what you got to
focus on as a newbie to get started these are
the the fundamentals everything else is like filling in the
details getting a little bit more technical and you know
perfecting various aspects of that but this is the core
this is like the 80 percent uh this is rather
the twenty percent that's going to get you the eighty
percent of the results here now of course as a
newbie you're starting this one of the biggest questions you're
gonna have is leo how do i deal with approach
anxiety i'm too scared to approach is there a magic
pill to get rid of my approach anxiety well there
isn't the only way to get rid of approach anxiety
is to approach you feel the fear and you do
it anyways and you keep doing it doing it doing
it doing it all night long until you get 20
approaches or 30 approaches into the night after about 10
approaches the approach anxiety should go away as you gain
state it doesn't matter if it's a successful approach or
a failed approach you will still gain state and the
approach anxiety will go away and then the next night
the approach anxiety will be back and you have to
do it all over again and you do this night
after night after night after night after night after night
after night hundreds and thousands of times i've done thousands
of approaches and if i go out tonight i'm still
going to have some approach anxiety the first few girls
that i talk to because i'm not going to be
in state i'm going to be in a logical mood
and it's just gonna be there so the approach anxiety
doesn't really go away you just you just sort of
stop taking it seriously and you learn to just act
despite whatever anxiety you have this is how it tends
to work there's no magic solution there's there's nothing you
can do to to get rid of your approach anxiety
forever and now you can approach any girl without any
hesitation and no fear and no anxiety no there's no
such thing you do it despite your fear it takes
a lot of practice you will get a lot of
rejections and you will have to face the emotional pain
of rejection now most of the times the rejections are
rather innocent it's like the girl will just wait hand-wave
you away or she'll just turn her back on you
or she'll just give you sort of a face like
this and reject you that way in the end these
rejections are meaningless they have no substance to them but
they don't really matter um but still some nights you
know you might get rejected 10 times in a row
and you might feel like you have a shitty night
and there's going to be a sort of a self-doubt
there an emotional pain maybe you're going to start to
get in your head about how you're not attractive you're
too bald you're too fat you're too short or whatever
and you think that that's why these girls are rejecting
you we have to remember that some nights are just
going to be bad nights and some nights are going
to be good nights and you should expect that about
one-third of girls will hate you if you're doing this
right one-third of girls will be neutral to you and
just kind of be friendly and then one-third of girls
will love you roughly that's how it's gonna break down
now why will one-third of girls hate you well because
you're bringing out if you're doing this correctly you're bringing
out your authentic personality and your authentic personality it's coming
out strong and clear and sharp and your authentic personality
is not for every girl about a third of girls
will just not find your type of personality very appealing
they won't like your energy they won't like your mood
they won't like your sense of humor whatever fine that's
fine that's good you don't you don't want 100 of
girls to love you you also don't want 100 of
girls to be friendly to you because that means you're
not being sharp enough with the delivery of your personality
and also you're not you're not being sexual and intentful
enough if 100 of girls are just friendly towards you
this is actually a problem because it means that you're
not being direct enough and you're not you're not being
polarizing enough you want to be polarizing enough where you're
sorting the wheat from the chaff and you're forcing the
girl to make a decision about whether she is willing
to sleep with you and maybe about a third of
them will be if you follow it up and do
everything else correctly no which of course you won't you're
going to screw up the logistics many times so in
reality you won't sleep with a third of the girls
you talk to but at least that the other girls
you talk to should be fairly romantically receptive to you
and get attracted to let's say so when you go
out and you experience these rejections um focus on the
small successes rather than focusing on how one-third of girls
rejected you or hated you focus on the one-third that
loved you and that hooked and that were attracted and
were willing to sleep with you even if they didn't
so a lot of times you'll see a girl get
attracted to you but she won't sleep with you for
many stupid logistical reasons she has work tomorrow her friends
took her away whatever so at the end of the
night focus on the girls that hooked and realized that
all those girls would have slept with you if a
little bit of more time was possible and maybe the
logistics were better and her friends weren't in the way
and her car wasn't whatever in a problem and so
forth that should give you a self-esteem boost that you
know tonight two or three girls would have slept with
me that's great focus on that rather than the other
10 girls that didn't like you or didn't want to
talk to you or whatever remember that it's not your
goal to get every girl to love you it's your
goal to actually be polarizing and to get a handful
of girls to really really get attracted to you that's
your goal and get used to having massive failure you're
going to have a lot of failure in this process
failure is how you learn there's going to be a
lot of interactions that are going well then you screw
it up because you say something wrong or you do
something wrong or you escalate something wrong or you try
to bounce her and it fails or whatever she should
test you and you fail that's how you learn commit
to doing at least a thousand approaches before you quit
you got to really hang in there and be persistent
massive persistence is key here also what's key is finding
some good wingmen this is crucial for emotional support the
wingmen are not so much there to help you pull
although they could be but the wingmen are there to
give you camaraderie so that you don't feel all alone
in the club or in the bar and even when
you get blown out or you have a bad night
the wingman is there for emotional support you can chat
with the wingman you can [ __ ] talk with
them you can just have you can have a lot
of fun just with your wingman you can have more
fun with your women than with your girls you can
transfer that fun you're having with your wingmen into the
interactions with the girls now some nights will be absolutely
brutal some nights you will walk home crying i had
a few nights where i would literally drive home crying
in my car when i first started game because it
was that brutally difficult because i was just so hopeless
i thought it would never work i was so bad
at it my skills were so bad that i thought
this was never going to work and if this isn't
work what will work nothing will work if does this
if this doesn't get me laid nothing will get me
laid so you start to lose hope it becomes very
emotionally challenging some nights what you have to remember is
to stick in there and that no one night defines
this process for you remember that you're not doing this
for the sex you have to have a larger vision
than just sex or just even girls you have to
have a large positive vision that will keep you going
out consistently what is your large vision well your large
vision is that you're going to grow yourself into this
strong man you're going to develop amazing game you're going
to become charismatic you're going to become much more social
and you're going to transform your whole self doing this
for a period of years and so you got to
become your own greatest cheerleader here nobody else is going
to cheerlead you you have to cheerlead yourself so if
you have a shitty night you have to at the
end of the night you have to tell yourself well
yeah tonight was a shitty night but you know what
my shitty nights they they i still learn lessons here
what are the lessons from the shitty night and oftentimes
what i find is that after my shittiest nights the
next nights are oftentimes my best nights because it forces
me to double down and to work even harder the
following night and to not take my knights for granted
for example i might go out and this particular night
i'm in a bad mood i only do one approach
instead of 20 the way i wanted to only one
and i feel shitty at the end of the night
for only doing one approach but then because i feel
so shitty the next night when i go out i
remember that experience of having that one approaching how miserable
i felt for doing that one approach the next night
i go out i'll do 20 approaches because i would
rather do 20 face the anxiety of doing 20 than
having a night where i only do one and then
feeling shitty about it for the rest of the day
so keep reminding yourself of this larger vision and keep
telling yourself this is going to be worth it you're
going to get better but it's a very very steep
learning curve and that you're at the beginning of the
learning curve so it's okay if you have some horrible
brutal nights don't judge yourself on a daily basis judge
yourself on a monthly basis see yourself improving every month
if you keep going out consistently you will be improving
every month you'll see your interactions become longer they hook
harder you're escalating better your verbals are getting better you're
becoming more funny you're becoming um in you're entering state
faster your approaches are stronger and clearer you're gonna see
this over a period of months but you may not
see it day to day there is variability between your
days some days are just gonna be bad days some
days are gonna be very slow some days you're gonna
walk into a club or a bar and there's gonna
be anybody that hardly anybody there worth opening and you
still gotta make something of it stick in there now
how do you get started with all this if you're
extremely shy and you have social anxiety to the point
where it's hard for you to even talk to a
stranger this might be too much for you what i
explained above so you got to break it down into
baby steps so first start with basic socialization practice the
way you do this is you go to malls and
stores or shops and you just talk to clerks and
to cashiers go to a empty mall where it's not
busy and just spend a few hours trying to chat
up the mall clerks at the department store it might
be an old lady she might be 60 years old
just chat with her non-sexually of course you're just gonna
chat with her find out about her life try to
make the conversation interesting rather than just boring and just
get to know her socialize with her see how long
you can keep the conversation going you might even make
her feel good about her day give her a compliment
tell her you like how she dresses or you like
her smile or something like that and just see how
far you can make it go um as a store
clerk she's basically obligated to talk to you so you
know start this way do that for a month if
you need to in order to get socially comfortable enough
that you can actually start to go out to bars
and clubs and do something more with sexual intent behind
it with younger girls that you're actually attracted to also
when you're at the grocery store and you're checking out
start chatting up the the cashier there see if you
can make her talk about herself make her laugh it
could be guys too i'm not saying necessarily just girls
you can do it with guys if it's a guy
clerk talk to the guy clerk find out about him
try to make a conversation going talk to strangers if
you're in a taxi talk to the taxi driver if
you're an airport talk to the guy sitting next to
you you can actually go to parks sit on a
park bench near somebody near a stranger just strike up
a conversation try this first you can also go to
meetup groups use meetup.com to find local meetup groups and
just start socializing with people who are interested in similar
things to you uh realistically you're going to need this
before you if you're a total noob and you're really
deficient in your socializing you're very introverted and have social
anxiety you're going to start here before you start to
get into more romantic sorts of socializing also what really
helps is to find a few good wingmen using the
internet forums and so forth find a few good wingmen
who can a demonstrate how to do approaching you can
watch them doing it this is very helpful and b
they can give you that emotional support and when you're
feeling down or you don't know what to do they
can give you some advice if they're more experienced than
you and the other thing you can try here if
you're extremely shy is and this is actually how i
started the first time i went to a club in
my entire life i went there and i didn't have
any intentions of actually talking to girls per se i
just went there to dance i literally went to the
club i didn't drink the music was playing and i
just danced for like two or three hours by myself
on the dance floor you know there's a bunch of
people around me but i wasn't there with friends or
anybody and i just danced and i enjoyed the music
and i had fun and actually what happened was that
i was in such a good state after two hours
of dancing i was covered in sweat from dancing um
really enjoying the music feeling good in my body and
then what happened was that a girl approached me she
started dancing with me just because i was having so
much fun by myself dancing and she actually kissed me
uh just out of the blue i didn't i didn't
do any game on her i didn't even try i
didn't even go to the club with that intention the
reason that worked is because i was in such a
good state this shows you the power of state and
the power of actually enjoying what you're doing so make
sure when you're going out you're actually enjoying the process
as much as possible now how long does it take
to get results well if by results you mean sex
then like i said earlier in part one it took
me about 450 approaches to get my first lay from
i was doing both night game and day game at
that time most of those approaches were night game but
this first result came from day game so that's what
it took me that's probably what it would take most
newbies it takes about five to ten thousand approaches to
get good and consistent if you're doing 20 approaches a
day times three days a week times four weeks that's
240 approaches a month or 2880 approaches in a year
that's a really good number aim for that aim for
20 approaches three nights a week four weeks a month
for an entire year if you can manage that that's
almost 3 000 approaches in a year that's a lot
it's going to be very difficult for that first year
but once you get past that first year now you're
going to develop a little bit of decent game and
some nice self-confidence you're going to shatter many of your
limiting beliefs and you're going to get some results maybe
you'll get 3 to 10 lays out of those 3
000 approaches and you should be happy with that that's
a pretty good result now it's going to take an
enormous amount of work it's going to be very difficult
and you're still not going to be very consistent by
the end of that year but you will have a
solid enough understanding of how game works and you're going
to know all of your own deficiencies and where you
got to work up to and what your sticking points
are you're going to know all of that by the
end of that year and then you're gonna be in
a nice position to keep going and keep growing and
then you know as you work up to five thousand
to ten thousand approaches that's where you're gonna start to
develop some serious consistency and then that's where the serious
results the serious results come i would say at the
10 000 approach mark if you get there but very
few guys will get there because it just requires so
much work but if you do the payoff will be
enormous so i recommend you go out two to four
nights a week if you can or move to a
city where that's possible consistency here is key is key
find places with lots of women be careful about watching
and listening to too much theory there's a lot of
pickup theory online and you can get lost in thousands
of hours of listening to theory i've basically given you
all the theory you need for now start going out
and approaching based on just these three episodes that are
going to be part of this series when it comes
to drinking i recommend you don't drink at all completely
avoid it it's unhealthy it'll ruin your brain it'll ruin
your liver ruin your health it'll cost you thousands of
dollars in the end and it basically gains you nothing
and it's not going to improve your game uh in
fact it's going to lose you learning opportunities because you're
going to you're going to be sloppy with your game
when you're drunk and you're also not going to retain
reference experience and memories as well when you're drunk it's
completely unnecessary so don't drink i i never drink so
it's definitely doable uh try to enjoy the steep learning
curve rather than wishing it away rather than wishing this
whole process to be easy take on the challenge of
the steep learning curve and use it to just make
yourself a stronger man at the end of your nights
every night analyze your sets and ask yourself what went
well what went poorly and what did you learn what
new distinctions did you make that night do this every
single night for years and your game will blossom and
you will create very fine and very accurate distinctions and
then this is ultimately how you learn see my episode
called learning equals making distinctions that episode actually is very
crucial for helping you to learn game or really anything
but especially game try to work on one sticking point
every single night for example if you're going out tonight
work on your eye contact or work on squaring up
or work on um physical escalation or work on you
know push pull verbal techniques or work on being more
funny or work on being more comfortable and relaxing your
body or work on making uh observational openers so you
observe the girl and you make an opener based on
what you observed about her and keep practicing that and
usually what i would do is i would even stick
for an entire week or an entire month on one
single sticking point for example when it comes to physical
escalation that would probably require an entire month of going
out every single day for a month just working on
physical escalation to really lock that one in if you're
talking about eye contact at least for a few weeks
you've got to be every single night working on eye
contact the whole night just that to lock that one
in and then just keep doing that week by week
by week with different sticking points until you develop some
sort of you know solid game it's important also that
you distinguish between attraction versus relationships so everything i'm talking
about in this series called how to get laid is
basically what i would call attraction this is not relationship
advice and how you act and the game that you
use to get attraction is not something you got to
be running inside of a relationship people get this wrong
so what i mean by the attraction is basically i'm
talking about from the point where you meet her to
the point where you sleep with her the first time
that entire thing i'm going to call like the attraction
phase of your interaction with a woman so this attraction
phase includes the attraction the rapport and the seduction all
the way up to first sex then after first sex
and then really multiple times of sex then it starts
to get into relationship territory there is no relationship without
sex so um once she has sex with you the
entire dynamic flips around because the problem before she has
sex with you she's not invested in you at all
she has no loyalty to you at all she will
likely not return your phone calls or your texts she
doesn't care about you at all basically until sex once
sex happens now she's invested in you now she cares
now you can convert that into a girlfriend situation into
a real relationship especially after you have sex with her
multiple times once that happens you don't need to keep
running some sort of crazy elaborate game on her you
can relax and chill out a little bit and just
kind of trust the things we'll go find and just
there then we transition into relationship advice relationship advice is
a whole different can of worms i'm gonna have videos
specifically on relationship advice and how to handle that stuff
there's a totally different set of challenges there that have
nothing to do with with game pretty much um the
reason we got to run game is to spark her
emotions because otherwise she's too logical to have sex with
you women do not have sex based on logic they
have sex based on emotions so even though you're you
you could be an amazing guy you could even want
to pay for her you could even want to support
her you could even want to have children with her
you could want to be the best boyfriend in the
world to her but none of that matters to her
unless you stimulate her emotions enough for her to get
how to have sex with you and then she's invested
until then she's not invested in you so to do
that we got to get you out of your logical
head and we got to get you approaching and we
got to get you physically escalating and taking the lead
and being assertive and having strong eye contact and good
vocal tonality and good body posture and some flirting skills
and knowing how to lead how to pull and how
to close all these things and then you can have
your relationship and in the relationship you could have love
and all this beautiful stuff romance yes relationships are awesome
i'm not against relationships at all but to have that
relationship first you gotta attract the girl all right that's
it for part two stay tuned for part three in
part three i'm gonna talk about more about the hook
point how to tell when the hook point is reached
how quickly you can reach the hook point and how
to tell if she's attracted to you i'm also going
to talk about the top 25 principles of game it's
a very important list i'm also going to talk about
a list of the top 30 biggest newbie mistakes that
newbies make i'm going to talk about how to not
run out of things to say that's a big problem
that many guys face other miscellaneous tips and i'm going
to finish with talking about the ethics of pickup and
how to avoid some of the toxic aspects of the
pickup community that i've been critical about in the past
and how to avoid abusing this newfound power that these
skills will grant you all right that's it the last
thing i want to mention here is my life purpose
course if you are going to be working on games
seriously you also should think about finding your sense of
life purpose that's what my life purpose course is about
it's over 25 hours of exclusive content that you don't
find on my free channel that focuses specifically very practically
on how to help you to find your sense of
life purpose and align your career with that and really
your entire life with that it's like it's like your
life without a life purpose is like you're like a
slug with no spine and then with a life purpose
you develop a spine you develop a sort of an
arc a sort of a overarching structure to your whole
life that orients you and having a sense of life
purpose is extremely attractive to women when when a man
has this kind of life purpose and your life purpose
is the thing that creates endless motivation that you use
for building your business your finances your career your health
and your relationships and for developing game it's not enough
just to be doing personal development piecemeal like oh i'm
going to improve a little bit of my muscles and
i'm going to improve a little bit of my nutrition
and i'm going to improve a little bit of my
game it's like no you want to have an overarching
sort of narrative and direction to your entire life a
really big picture perspective for your entire life and the
life purpose course helps you to do that so i
recommend that as you're learning game you're also developing your
sense of life purpose and this sense of life purpose
is what gives you that solidity that strength that confidence
that clarity of what you want in life women love
this this is ultimately the deep inner game you need
to be attractive to women because what women are looking
for is that sense of stability a man who knows
what he wants who has values and principles that he
follows a man who's like a rock grounded and then
she can orbit around that the feminine energy can wrap
itself around that and that produces a beautiful dynamic but
it takes a lot of work to find your life
purpose and to align with your life purpose and there's
a lot of ways you can screw it up so
the life purpose course check that out it basically takes
you step by step through the principles and the techniques
and the process that i use to find my life
purpose and to to use that to basically build out
my entire life and to have motivation for all the
stuff that i do and that i teach you
