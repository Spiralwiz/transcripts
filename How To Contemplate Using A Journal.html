[Music] in this episode I'm going to show you an
extremely powerful technique for how to derive deep existential truths
about reality for yourself and also psychological truths as well
not just existential ones and this is contemplation by using
a journal it's a simple technique and I'll share it
with you in a minute but let me just underscore
the importance in this work of seeking the truth for
yourself not through books not through videos not through belief
systems or ideologies and not even through my own teachings
but for yourself and this is something that I've been
saying really for years now from the very beginning honestly
I'm tired of saying it at this point and that
is what I've been saying is that you have to
seek the truth in your direct experience and not just
take my word for it and not to believe me
beliefs and ideology is the biggest trap in all of
this self actualization business and really if I was doing
the greatest service to you I would begin and end
every single episode with a disclaimer all of my videos
all 300 or so videos that I have each one
of them would have a disclaimer at the beginning and
at the end which would tell you that nothing that
I say in these videos is actually true all of
it is just beliefs it's all just mental masturbation and
theory it means absolutely nothing for you unless you are
able to go and to discover rediscover these truths in
your own direct experience and that you are at a
great risk of falling into the trap of ideology but
you know it's boring for me to say this over
and over again and honestly to me this is just
obvious it's so obvious that this is like step number
zero in any inquiry into the nature of reality or
life or anything like anything you do in life must
begin with step zero in that you are falling into
beliefs and ideologies which are not your own that you
need to make your own by going out there and
actually tracing what's true in the real world and seeing
if that matches up with what you were told in
some video or in some book or by some belief
system that is the essence of truth seeking so either
you will do that or you won't if you won't
I guarantee you that you will be diluted and you
will make many grave mistakes and you will limit yourself
and how high you will be able to develop and
how conscious you can become and you will not find
the ultimate truth and there will be many other truths
now I'm not just talking to the ultimate truth there
will be all other minor truths which you will also
never find and be deluded about so you'll be deluded
on many layers both the ultimate layer and all the
intermediate layers as well so that's how important this is
the reason I don't say this in every single episode
is like I said because it's honestly it's so obvious
to me and also because it's it's rather boring and
monotonous to say this all the time so let's address
this problem with this technique using a journal to contemplate
now you might wonder leo but why should I contemplate
when I can just get the answers from a video
or from a book or from you what's the point
of actualize that org if I can't use the answers
that you're giving me it's just like with math with
math to understand math you must actually do math it
does not help to just watch a video about math
you will not understand math that way nor will it
help for you just to get the answers to a
math problem you will not understand math that way you
must actually go through the pain of doing the math
and that's precisely what differentiates a deluded person from a
self actualizing person from a conscious person the difference is
that the conscious person actually goes through the word and
it takes work and the reason that most people don't
do it is just because they're mentally lazy it takes
time it takes effort to actually derive answers for yourself
most people are just like most kids in school what
they do is they just copy answers from the back
of that of the math book they don't actually go
through the problems and of course because of that they're
poor mathematicians except with mathematics it's okay you can be
a poor mathematician and still do well in life but
you cannot be poor at tracking the truth and do
well in life you cannot so that's why you got
to start to drive this stuff for yourself this is
critical this is absolutely critical and this one simple technique
which I'm going to show you here today can transform
your whole life this is really the essence of self
actualization right here so listen close how do you actually
contemplate properly well first you need some method for contemplation
now I have an episode in the past that I
shot called contemplation where I went into depth about contemplation
and there I just sort of assumed that you would
be contemplating in your mind and that's a good way
you can contemplate in your mind but the problem is
that it's very easy to lose track of what's going
on there you can get lost in monkey mind loss
and your fantasies and ideas so what I have for
you now is just a a more rigorous technique which
is you will be using some sort of note-taking device
either a pad of paper like this some legal pad
this is just very simply go to Walmart and buy
a whole box of these and some pens and pencils
and and that's really good or you can use a
digital format like if you're using OneNote like I talked
about in my commonplace book episode maybe you want to
keep your journal there but there's actually some important benefits
to just having an analogue system in this case because
with your wit with a digital journal system you're gonna
be on your phone or on your iPad or something
doing this it's not ideal because you have all those
distractions notifications and games and apps and all this emails
and all sorts of weird stuff when you're contemplating you
just want to be all by yourself completely focused on
your thoughts and that's why just a simple pen and
paper system works so great that's what I tend to
use rather than using my commonplace book which is what
I use for most of my other forms of note-taking
and various other journals that I have but I make
a distinction between other journals that I keep and contemplation
and you'll you'll understand that as I keep explaining how
this works so you get your notepad and then you
go and you sit down in a quiet place and
you set aside a good chunk of time 30 to
60 minutes the reason you want to chuck a time
at least that big is because you're gonna have to
build up momentum and your mind is gonna be lazy
and that's one of the biggest obstacles you'll encounter when
you start to contemplate is that your mind is lazy
its distracted it wants to run off and do other
stuff rather than to actually contemplate and when you first
start doing it you're gonna be rusty at it you're
not gonna be able to just come up with answers
right on the fly so it'll probably take you 10
15 minutes just to get in the groove so you've
got to set aside that time and then what you
do is at the top of your page you write
the question that you will be contemplating for this entire
chunk of time so to focus your contemplation here you're
not just going to be contemplating and daydreaming random questions
you're gonna pick one question what's one question that's important
to you that you really want to get to the
bottom of for example maybe you want to know what
is a thought that would be a good example and
then you're gonna start to contemplate this so I'll be
giving you many examples I'll give you a whole list
here of various questions you can contemplate but let's just
start with this example to explain how this works so
what is a thought you write us at the top
of your page and now you start to wonder and
think about this but very importantly you have to start
thinking from Ground Zero which means you have to throw
away all your preconceived ideas and beliefs any cultural teachings
that you acquired anything you learn in school or university
any books you've read and including even all of my
teachings whatever you've heard for me about what thoughts are
throw all of that away the point and the essence
of contemplation is to sit down all by yourself and
to think about a topic or a question completely from
scratch not relying on anything from any external source so
you're going inside and you're really working through the problem
in the same way that you might be working through
a math problem or a logical proof and so you
start to question what is a thought and as you
do this it's very critical that you don't just speculate
or philosophize about what a thought is but that you
ground yourself in your direct experience and in concrete examples
so what do I mean by this let's really go
through this so if I'm thinking what is a thought
the first thing that I need to do is I
need to ground myself which means I need to actually
find an example of a thought in my direct experience
now with thoughts fortunately it's very easy because hey what
is the thought is itself a thought so as I'm
thinking what is a thought well I could say to
myself oh is what is a thought a thought oh
yeah it is okay so that's the thought so I
already got an example to work with right there and
even to say that I have an example to work
with that's another thought so now I got two thoughts
to work with and in fact I can come up
with thoughts right on the fly I can think of
a a red apple or a tall tree and all
those are thoughts and that's good and see what you're
doing there is you're actually grounding yourself you're not speculating
you're not coming up with some theory of what a
thought is so a mistake in contemplation would be to
start to like bring scientific theory into this and to
say well I know from stuff that I learned in
college about neuroscience that what I thought really is the
thought is just some is it's just neurons in the
brain and there's there's chemicals and I read all this
stuff about myelination the nerves and different neurotransmitters like epinephrine
and norepinephrine and serotonin and dopamine and all this and
this creates a thought and the neurons are linked in
some way and then something happens bla bla bla bla
bla that is not contemplation that's you regurgitating stuff that
you've learned so we're really pushing ourselves to think from
scratch as though you are the first person ever in
the history of mankind who has ever thought about what
a thought is and if you put yourself in a
position then you realize you can't rely on anybody else
you can't rely on a text book or some religious
teaching or some scientific thing you you saw on some
documentary or in some video so all you really got
to work with is direct experience you have a thought
sink of a red apple okay that's a thought right
there so what is that and then you question and
you sit and you kind of stew in it and
you let your mind observe what a thought is be
careful not to go too quickly or to jump to
conclusions the key with proper contemplation is that you are
raising a question you're bringing an example to mind right
now in your direct experience you're training your awareness upon
that object like the thought of a red apple and
then you're just observing you want to observe the mechanism
of what that is notice how a thought is arising
in your mind to do that you don't think about
thoughts you observe thoughts that's a very important distinction if
you start to think about thoughts you're you're off into
speculation territory whereas if you're observing thoughts that's where you're
actually learning what a thought is and this right here
is really the essence of science maybe you were taught
and maybe you think that science is some sort of
grand theory building exercise or it's an exercise in doing
laboratory work or maybe you thought it's like posing a
hypothesis and then proposing an experiment and testing that validating
and falsifying it none of that is really the essence
of science the essence of science is what we're doing
here in contemplation you are taking an actual object in
the real world as it is occurring without any opinions
or ideas about it and you're just observing what it
is how it arises and what it's doing and the
difficulty with that is that you have to be able
to set aside all of your own stuff and baggage
and your emotions and your projections and all that to
observe an object just precisely as it is and it
can require a lot of observation of a very simple
object to finally get to the bottom of what it
really is so I might think of a red apple
and then I might just sit there for a minute
and just kind of keep bringing that red apple back
into my mind because I bring it up that it
disappears I bring it up it disappears so I just
maybe keep doing that for a minute and I just
wonder what what is this red apple and then maybe
I bring to mind some other example I think yellow
lemon and I bring that a couple of times it
to mind it's like okay so that's another type of
thought so we've got two thoughts we've got a red
apple and a yellow Apple or a yellow lemon okay
so are these are these different thoughts or is there
only one kind of thought how many kinds of thoughts
are there and so then at least the next questions
I think now I think about that and so I
now have to bring to mind all the different kinds
of thoughts that there are there are thoughts about physical
objects there are thoughts about intangible things like love and
there are thoughts about all sorts of things right so
I start to think about that and then I start
to wonder if I bring to mind a red apple
right now then I bring to mind a yellow lemon
then I bring to mind a red apple again so
that's two red apples so was the first thought of
a red Apple was that diff was that a different
thought then my second thought of a red apple or
are they the exact same thing what's the difference and
then I don't speculate about that again I sit and
actually observe in my direct experience what's the difference so
maybe I'll bring up a red apple a third time
and a fourth time and a fifth time and I'll
wonder are they really different or are they the same
thing and what really differentiates spots from physical objects is
a physical object also a thought there's an idea that's
interesting or is there really a boundary there so what
is the boundary what's the difference between an object and
a thought can we say that an object is or
that a thought is a kind of object that's interesting
and see you can take it into a million different
directions you could ask all sorts of ancillary questions like
where do thoughts come from and you don't speculate about
where thoughts come from because look a thought is something
you have therefore you don't need to speculate about where
it comes from it's happening in your direct experience right
now you're thinking thoughts every second of your life so
where do thoughts come from you don't ask me you
don't go look in a book or watch a video
you check your direct experience and if you can't get
it in your direct experience no book no video no
cheating is gonna cure that because you've got the most
pure form of it already happening inside your mind you
have direct access to your own thoughts so if you
can't figure it out that way you ain't ever gonna
figure it out and no amount of teachings will we'll
fix that for you see this you see why contemplation
is so important then you start to question any assumptions
you have about thoughts like maybe you have an assumption
that thoughts occur inside the brain and then you have
to ask yourself is that true do I actually find
in my direct experience that thoughts are occurring inside the
brain or is that an idea that I just acquired
from my culture or from my schooling maybe you have
some other assumption like that thoughts are something that only
human beings have you got a question that is that
true how do I know that only human beings have
thoughts and you wonder about that you always keep grounding
yourself in direct experience you keep bringing up examples concrete
ones and you actually observe the mechanics of what's really
going on try not to anticipate the answer but instead
rather open your mind and start off by admitting that
you don't know what the answer to the question is
you don't actually know what a thought is you don't
actually know what an object is you don't know what
good and evil are you don't know what reality is
you don't know what God is there's so many things
you don't know but of course this is one of
the one of the trickiest parts of contemplation is to
get your mind to understand first and foremost that you
don't know that is like step zero of contemplating because
if you think you already know then there's not gonna
be any genuine curiosity within you to contemplate a thing
because hey you already think you know it so what's
the point of contemplating Italy oh I already know what
I thought is why would I waste my time why
would I waste an hour of my day contemplating what
I thought is right because you think you know but
actually you don't what you'll be amazed to discover is
that you haven't actually thought about any of these things
almost ever in your life until you sit down with
a pad of paper and a pencil and start to
actually contemplate so let's go through a few other examples
just so you really I want you to really get
a sense for what I'm doing here when I'm contemplating
so let's contemplate the question what is an object what
is an object so first I'll write that down on
my pad of paper and then I'll try to get
myself to admit that I don't really know what an
object is I mean sure I can bring up examples
of objects apples and trees and cars and people and
blah blah blah but what is an object really that
starts to open up some room for me to wonder
and then I'll start to ask other ancillary questions about
what objects might be and I'll bring to mind a
concrete object for us to work with so maybe I
have a pencil in my hand the pencil that I'm
using to to take these notes so I'll look at
this I'll look at this pencil and I say wait
so is this pencil an object yes this pencil is
an object okay what else is an object so I'll
look around the room well there's a couch there's a
table there's a glass of water there's a lamp there's
there's a cat there's something else there's a human being
sitting there whatever okay so those are all objects so
what is the common denominator between all those and I'm
not gonna speculate I'm gonna actually I'm gonna give myself
a minute to really wonder about that's a profound question
what is the common denominator between all these things that
we call objects is it their separateness like the lamp
is separate from the coffee table but what is separateness
let me wonder about separate separation I mean who determines
what is separate from something else like for example on
my coffee table I might have a bottle of vitamins
now is this bottle of vitamins is it one object
or is it a hundred objects because the vitamin bottle
has a bunch of pills inside let's say it has
a hundred vitamins inside so what is that who is
determining whether we count this as a single object everything
that that's encompassed by the bottle or a hundred different
objects all the little individual pills inside so then you
will wonder so our objects a subjective notion or an
objective notion mmm that's very interesting could it be that
my human mind is actually projecting the notion of objects
out onto the external world and that they don't really
exist where does one object begin and another one end
so for example you might say well the coffee table
is clearly separated from the lamp and that's how we
distinguish those two different objects but there's air connecting the
table and lamp so is the air then a third
object and speaking of which air air is an interesting
example because how many objects of air are there one
are you gonna say there's only one object of air
in the entire world meaning the entire atmosphere so that
means that the air in this room is the same
object as the air in the next room as the
air outside as the air in Australia in China in
Antarctica in Europe and everywhere else is that what you're
saying and then where does that object end because we
know the air goes up high to the atmosphere many
miles but then at some point it ends but where
precisely does it end and so what distinguishes the air
object from let's say the vacuum of empty space and
as the vacuum of eppy space is add an object
or is that something else and if it's something else
that means what we have now two types of things
in the world we have objects and we have other
stuff what could be other than objects and then you
might wonder what about a thought is a thought and
object are there tangible objects and intangible objects how do
you distinguish those two and again you don't speculate you
actually bring to mind examples so bring to mind an
example of a tangible object that's easy let's say a
lamp or a table and then an intangible object like
let's say the number one or the thought of a
red apple that would be an intangible object or it
may be air or maybe a vacuum something like that
or maybe the mind what is the mind is the
mind an object is consciousness an object see so you
sit there and you think about all this you can
you can see that you begin with this one question
simple question of what is an object and then it
starts to flower into clusters of other questions ancillary related
questions and you start to wonder about all those and
what that's generally what you find with contemplation is that
one question leads to ten more and each one of
those leads to attend more and so starts to expand
very quickly and you can kind of get lost in
the weeds but remember to kind of keep your mind
on the ball which is the original question so don't
stray too far keep going back to what is an
object but also keep bringing up these different examples and
and these other questions just to kind of help you
to understand what an object is and now you might
sit there and do this for 60 minutes but you
might not feel like you've resolved this question that's okay
don't expect to resolve it in 60 minutes it could
take you a year to really get to the bottom
of what an object is the key here is not
to get to the bottom answer as if there is
some sort of simple answer that you can write as
a sentence like an object is blank and you can
just fill in a blank with something and then you
got the right answer it's like you passed some sort
of test that's not what contemplation is about the real
value of this work is in having your mind go
through and explore the nooks and crannies of all these
different questions and all the different possible answers and even
if you don't come up with some ultimate answer to
this question that doesn't matter because you've still extracted the
value you still groan your mind will have matured because
just you simply spent an hour to exploring this question
let's consider another example what is evil so I will
write that down at the top of my page and
then I will think about it I'm gonna make sure
that I don't fall into the trap of just going
into mental verbal diarrhea where I just start to write
a bunch of stuff on my page right paragraph after
paragraph mindlessly that's not contemplation contemplation is you sit for
a minute or two and just think about the question
you bring a few examples to mind you bring a
few more ancillary questions to mind and only after you've
pondered a little bit then you can write down some
answer then you could think about that maybe write down
a little bit more but see it goes slowly you're
not just filling up page after page after page with
with mental verbal diarrhea you need to what gain what
I call traction your mind has to actually track reality
so the way we do that with this question is
with what is evil we would say okay so what
is evil well the Bible says evil assisting and society
and my culture says that evil is something else and
science maybe say maybe says that evil doesn't even even
exist so who's correct well all of that is just
external sources forget all that let me focus on what's
actually in my direct experience is there evil happening in
my direct experience right now maybe probably not if you're
just sitting contemplating okay so what's the next best thing
if evil is not happening right now can I bring
some evil to mind what is some evil that happened
to me in my life where I thought something was
really evil so let me go back into my mind
and actually go through my past find a specific example
or maybe somebody who broke into my car and stole
my things and that to me seemed like evil or
maybe there was some politician that I saw on TV
who was charged with corruption and bribery and I consider
that to be evil okay so let's go with that
example this bribery case that was clear evil who says
so am I saying that bribery is evil or is
my society saying that bribery is evil is evil found
as an objective law of the universe or is evil
something that human beings have created and are projecting in
other words is evil subjective or is it objective if
it's objective how so where is that law actually written
in the universe is there like some deity up in
the clouds that is holding this law in place or
is it like a physical law the way you might
imagine the law of gravity or something or some Newtonian
law something Stinney in law what is it or is
evil something that we just come to as a social
consensus so you think about all these things and maybe
you write down some answers but then you ask yourself
that answer that I just wrote down is that actually
true how do I know that's true could this just
be a cultural thing that I picked up as I
was growing up could it be that in some cultures
bribery is actually not considered evil mmm then you start
to think about that and you sort of think about
the role that culture plays then you might say are
there any examples I can think of that our evil
cross culturally in every single culture maybe you'd say murder
is is that but then you might wonder what is
murder after all murder happens every single day in every
single country all around the world and in many cases
this murder isn't considered evil there are many examples of
murder which isn't considered evil murder in the name of
self-defense murder in the name of fighting some war to
defend your country a pre-emptive attack or even things like
euthanasia doctor assisted suicides or for example putting a dog
or a cat to sleep who's sick take them to
the vet put him to sleep that's not considered evil
by beddy-bye many cultures and many people so what are
these distinctions who is making these distinction than you think
about all that and you think about are there degrees
of evil or is evil just a binary thing and
if there are degrees who determines what these degrees are
and is evil for a human being the same thing
as evil for a lion or for a dog or
for an ant or for an alien in outer space
why does the concept or notion of evil exist at
all what is that about could the notion of evil
be serving some sort of hidden purpose or agenda could
i or my mind be using the notion of evil
for some purpose what is the purpose of evil what
would happen if I removed the notion of evil from
my mind and so all of these things are just
kind of pondering and thinking about and you keep jotting
down various answers to it and don't be afraid to
write down a wrong answer this is a very kind
of rough imperfect process this contemplation oftentimes when I'm contemplating
I'll write down an answer then just even as I'm
writing it I'll immediately realize all this is nonsense but
still it can be useful to write it out write
out the nonsense because it's very useful to write out
the nonsense and then to look upon it and to
realize no this doesn't this doesn't make sense this is
contradictory or it's just silly or I can come up
with examples that invalidate what I just wrote and that's
good that's exactly what you want that's how your learning
is by writing down answers and then realizing that no
these are way too simplistic and they don't actually shop
with what I'm experiencing in my direct experience let's consider
a third example what is personal development and by this
question I don't mean personal development as a feel like
the self-help field I mean what does it mean to
actually develop oneself as a human being what does it
mean to grow what is the difference between an undeveloped
person and a developed person now can you see the
power of knowing the answer to that question or of
just exploring that question after all if what you're trying
to do in life and the reason you're watching all
these videos of mine is because you want to develop
yourself personally yet you have no idea what personal development
actually is other than maybe stuff that I've told you
then what are you really doing you're pursuing something you
have no idea what you're pursuing so of course you're
gonna be very inefficient at pursuing it so you write
down this question the top of your page and you
start to think about it and here you have to
be very rigorous not to speculate because you've got a
lot of ideas about stuff that I've said about personal
development but you need to actually bring to mind in
your own life examples of personal development and work with
those rather than things that I've said so you might
maybe bring to mind an example of an undeveloped person
in your mind maybe a friend of yours from from
high school or something that you think was a very
undeveloped person and then you bring to mind some other
person who you think is very developed person and now
maybe you compare both of them and you say what's
the difference between these two and then you actually you
look you see well the undeveloped person acts like a
jerk and maybe they're very ideological they're closed-minded they're not
very contour not self reflective they don't introspect yada yada
yada what about the developed person what are some of
the qualities that make him seem developed well he's not
emotionally reactive he's more open to new ideas willing to
admit that he makes mistakes he's able to say that
he's sorry bla bla bla whatever right and so you
compare this and then you see okay so what's the
cut what's the common thread what is the essence of
personal development like if I wanted to increase my own
degree of personal development by 10 percent what would have
to happen what would that look like and then you
write down your answers and you keep exploring this question
keep asking these ancillary questions like are their degrees of
development how many degrees of development are there is there
just one component personal development or there multiple components dispersed
development mean like becoming a more loving human being is
that it is that is that all that person of
all it boils down to is just becoming more loving
or does it also boil down to other components like
education reading books can you develop yourself without reading a
single book can you be personally developed but not loving
and you think about that and you bring examples to
mind and so you try to kind of like play
in your mind with all these different scenarios and you
try to get to the essence of what this thing
called personal development is so that's how you contemplate this
process of actually sitting down and doing this is where
the rubber meets the road this is where you get
your results this is where you get your understanding you
do not get understanding from merely listening to me you
do but it's a miniscule amount compared to how much
you will when you start to go through this contemplation
process especially using a journal you'll feel it you'll feel
when your mind gets what I call traction with these
issues and it will feel amazing because in 30 minutes
by sitting there with this notepad and thinking about one
of these questions in 30 minutes you will get more
traction and more understanding and clarity than you did in
perhaps 5 years or 10 years of your life on
this question and that's simply because you've never actually bothered
to systematically rigorously think through the question maybe you've had
it in the back your mind but you never actually
sat down and thought it through here are some starting
assumptions for contemplation assumption number one you are full of
assumption number two nothing your mind says can be trusted
assumption number three all beliefs and teachings are false assumption
number four only direct experience is true and assumption number
five the truth is not fragile which means that you're
not gonna hurt the truth by questioning you're only gonna
clarify the truth with rigorous questioning so you don't need
to be afraid about doing something wrong in this contemplation
process you can do no wrong all you can do
by asking questions is just get more clarity and anything
that's false will get purified in the light of awareness
and questioning now you might say leo but how do
I know that all these assumptions that you said these
five assumptions that they're actually true and their answer is
of course you don't I gave them to you as
assumptions an assumption is something that you used to start
your inquiry because you got to start somewhere and your
starting place is always imperfect so you can start with
these assumptions but then that doesn't mean you take them
on faith that means you can question them too in
fact you could sit down for an hour and write
this question at the top of your page am i
full of and spend an hour thinking about that is
it true that you're full of what are all the
ways in which you are full of is that a
good assumption to ground your self inquiry in or in
this case you're contemplating in and that's how you test
if what I'm telling you is correct if these assumptions
are correct now maybe you discover after a few hours
and think about this to actually know I'm not full
of and that will be a discovery for you but
to go through that process is important if you just
say no leo I'm not full of you're full of
if you say that then you haven't see you're just
defending yourself you're just playing ideological games you haven't actually
gone through the process you haven't done any work you
see so what I'm really trying to get you to
do here is I'm actually trying to get you to
do some work but of course you're lazy and you
don't want to do any work so that's the whole
game that we're playing here all the time with actualize
that already I keep trying to get you to do
work and you keep trying to come up with reasons
excuses for why you shouldn't do work or why you
don't need to do the work because you already know
everything and because nothing really can be changed in your
life see how the game is played let's clarify what
contemplation is not contemplation is not speculation and guesswork contemplation
is not justifying your existing beliefs which is very tempting
to do contemplation is not building new beliefs these answers
that you're deriving from all this questioning it would be
a mistake to say okay Leo I did an hour
of contemplating I got my answer and now I'm gonna
believe that answer as though it's the truth that would
be a mistake that's not the point the point is
actually to go through the process and to see how
complicated a nuance all these questions are and while you
might get some clarification that clarification is good but clarification
is different from belief make sure you're not using contemplation
to build new beliefs or to build some grand narratives
and theories that's another mistake that's not contemplation building theories
that's something else that's a constructive process contemplation is more
of a destructive process you're breaking stuff down contemplation is
not daydreaming fantasy or imagining stuff contemplation is not proof
or coming up with arguments or debates against critics maybe
there's someone you disagree with philosophically politically ideologically economically maybe
there's somebody you disagree with about enlightenment or about spirituality
maybe you disagree with me and so you think that
you can sit there and you can write some kind
of argument against me to rebut me to debunk me
that is not contemplation contemplation is not opinion izing or
justifying existing opinions and contemplation is not the pursuit of
success or practical advantage so especially if you're a stage
or type of person then you're really into a pragmatism
and you're really into personal achievement and success and so
you might say I'll leo yeah I like the idea
of contemplation how can I use contemplation to become more
successful to improve my business and to have more sacks
and to be better at speaking and to do this
that's not contemplation contemplation is about pure understanding of what
a thing is you're interested in just what it is
not what it can do for you not how you
can become enriched and by it but just by what
it is you have a trust that in having a
deep understanding of what things are at a fundamental existential
level that this will resolve many of your existing problems
in life your problems in life don't come from lack
of chasing after success for the most part for some
of you it does but for for the most part
it comes from a lack of deep understanding of what
things are and in fact if you're gonna use contemplation
to try to pursue success you're actually gonna do the
opposite of seeking the truth and understanding you're going to
be trying to use contemplation to somehow find better ways
to manipulate reality and that is actually one of the
major sources of all of your problems in life is
that you're such a manipulator and you're always looking for
practical advantages but happiness doesn't come from practical advantage it
also doesn't come from success and if you doubt me
about that then contemplate what is happiness so let's reiterate
what contemplation is contemplation is observation seeing how a thing
works its deconstruction breaking down ideas and beliefs it is
awareness and what I call going meta that means that
as you're contemplating you're also observing the process of contemplation
itself and as you're observing the process of contemplation itself
you're also observing that so you're sort of observing yourself
observing yourself observing yourself you're observing yourself thinking you're observing
yourself deconstructing things contemplation is self reflection you are always
kind of like looking at your role what is your
role in understanding these questions so it's not like you're
just asking these questions in a sort of objective manner
as though you're floating above the whole universe looking down
upon these questions know you're intimately involved with these questions
if you're asking a question like what is happiness that
that that's a very intimate question you see you're not
above and beyond that because if you're very honest you
will notice that you care about your own happiness very
much very much you're completely attached to your own happiness
but that takes self-reflection to see that contemplation is questioning
assumptions contemplation is questioning beliefs teachings and culture contemplation is
thinking completely independently for yourself and it's the desire to
know the truth at any cost and that's very important
you're going after the truth even if you're afraid of
what the consequences will be and when you really go
deeply after the truth there will be some scary consequences
because all of us spend a lot of our time
being in denial suppressing and repressing all sorts of truths
that we don't like about ourselves ugly things things that
we lie to ourselves about things that we don't want
to admit to ourselves things we've done wrong ways we've
been selfish ways we've been dirkson and so that's ugly
stuff that you're not gonna want to discover about yourself
but in this process if you're really pursuing truth all
that will come out and so if all you care
about is pursuing the truth only when it's pleasant then
as soon as you get to the really deep truths
the true that can actually transform you you see you're
gonna stop because those aren't gonna be pleasant truths so
keep that in mind okay so let me give you
a list of things to contemplate I gave you an
even larger list in my other contemplation episodes you can
go check that out here I want to give you
two some very practical questions you can get started on
right now maybe this entire month you can start contemplating
these what is meaning what is science what is evil
what is ego what is a concept what is a
belief what is truth what is evidence what is a
symbol what is language what is fear what is happiness
what is identity what is thought what is conflict what
is duality what is a boundary what is reason what
is culture what is judgement what is an object what
is value and that's just tip the iceberg I mean
there's hundreds of questions like this that you can keep
asking yourself you could spend the next 20 years of
your life every single day doing this one practice and
if you do you will completely transform your whole life
I deliberately left out the really hard questions questions like
what am i what is reality what is God because
I want you to avoid these for now I want
you to just build a habit of just doing ordinary
level contemplation not self inquiry self inquiry for me is
is separate from contemplation now you have to understand that
this word contemplation different teachers and different traditions use this
word in different ways what I mean by contemplation is
that you're sitting down and yes you are thinking you
are using your mind and I don't just reserve this
for the purposes of attaining enlightenment some traditions will talk
about contemplation for the purposes of enlightenment in which case
really they're talking about something like self inquiry and that's
good there's nothing wrong with that I advocate that in
other areas that's a very powerful method but really you
got to build up to that most people are not
ready to do that kind of level of contemplation that's
like the deepest levels of contemplation those questions like what
am i what is reality what is God I deliberately
want you to avoid these for now because to really
answer these questions you have to actually have a profound
mystical experience an expansion of consciousness you're not going to
answer these questions just by coming up with verbal answers
and it can take you years to really get to
the bottom of these so we don't want you to
get stuck we want you to start with easy ones
and as you get good at just ordinary contemplating then
you can go and maybe tackle some of these really
deep ones I want you to also understand that there's
a lot of different stuff that you can contemplate there's
not just one purpose to contemplation like enlightenment that might
be like the ultimate purpose per se but even if
you become enlightened that doesn't mean that you've answered all
the smaller questions that doesn't mean you understand what an
object is or what culture is or what science is
or what let's say reason is or what language is
see those need to be deliberately contemplated in and of
themselves independent of whether you're pursuing enlightenment or not and
there's value to understanding what those things are which is
why there's more to this work than just the pursuit
of enlightenment now you might wonder Leo how his contemplation
different from self inquiry when you're doing really profound self
inquiry you're going to need to transcend your mind you're
gonna need to transcend thinking and of course transcend writing
even whereas with the contemplation that I'm talking about I'm
talking about a more general notion of contemplation for me
contemplation just means thinking about how life works or some
facet of life and that does involve the mind now
maybe if you really contemplate some facet of reality very
deeply you could transcend the mind you can kind of
go into this very hyper intuitive mode and maybe even
beyond that just kind of mystical experience about it but
but generally what I'm saying here is something much more
simple and basic you can get enormous benefit to your
development just by doing ordinary contemplation using ordinary thinking using
the mind and you know some spiritual teachers will say
the mind is evil the mind is bad you got
to transcend the mind that's true when you're going like
balls to the wall for enlightenment that's true you do
got to transcend the mind and the mind will be
a big obstacle but before you get there you got
a lot of work to do so I mean if
you're at the point where you are ready to transcend
the mind by all means don't let me stop you
transcend the mind but probably you're not at that point
and there's probably a lot of growth you can get
from just starting to use your mind properly people make
this mistake of thinking that all transcending the mind means
that I don't think about anything no that just makes
you stupid transcending the mind means that you you learned
how to use the mind you know how to use
the mind but then you can also go beyond the
mind on command so to speak you can then have
some sort of trans rational experience mystical experience then you
can come back you can still use the mind to
figure stuff out in your life and to think about
existential facets of reality that maybe you didn't access with
this mystical experience you can think about that you can
think about what science is what languages you can think
about what did that experience mean for my life and
for politics and for society should be structured and for
all the sort of stuff right that requires the use
of the mind so um so yeah I've first learned
to use the mind properly before you you go transcending
the entire thing here's some additional questions that you can
ask these are more personal I would call these more
psychological questions whereas the other questions I gave you were
more existential so question like how am i full of
how am i lying to myself what truths am i
refusing to accept how am i evil how am i
corrupt what do I fear what do I whine about
how do I play victim how am i self biased
what are my conflicts of interest how do I cling
to my culture what beliefs do I hold sacred how
am i a hypocrite how am i arrogant how am
I being a weak human being and so on and
so forth you can help with all sorts of psychological
questions to ask yourself here's what successful contemplation requires open-mindedness
radical open-mindedness fearlessness brutal self honesty careful observation impartiality the
ability to step outside of your agenda that's what I
mean by impartiality holding no ideas sacred you should be
really willing to question any idea especially all of your
pet ideas all of your pet philosophies and your pet
scientific theories and your pet ideologies and your pet economic
beliefs political beliefs social beliefs beliefs about men and women
and gender and all of this stuff successful contemplation requires
not knowing really getting into a place where you start
to become conscious that you don't know the answer to
these questions it requires radical self-reliance you are here all
alone there's nobody to help you nobody's gonna give you
the answers you are relying completely on yourself your own
mental faculties to deliver the answers to you your severing
that umbilical cord from me from books from teachers from
YouTube and from culture and that can be a scary
thing and lastly successful contemplation requires genuine curiosity you have
to be curious about the question are you curious why
aren't you curious these are profound questions what is a
thought I mean you're having thousands of thoughts every day
and you've had them for decades in your life and
you still don't know what a thought is you still
don't know what an object is despite the fact that
you're surrounded by just all the time you go purchasing
objects all the time you go chasing objects all the
time and you don't know what they are and you're
not curious about that you gotta find an intrinsic curiosity
get in touch with that don't just contemplate some question
because I told you that it's important to contemplate it
that's not gonna work you have to want to answer
the question you have to want to know what you
are you have to want to know what science is
that curiosity is the driver of this entire process even
when you just go to to pick up your your
notepad in the morning to do this process you already
have to be curious you have to be excited about
the fact that all I'm gonna I'm gonna discover potentially
I can discover something new today here are some traps
that are common to contemplation trap number one is taking
things as self evidence leo it's self-evident that reason works
or that science is true that's just self-evident it's self-evident
that logic is great it's self-evident that one plus one
equals two no it's not nothing is self-evident the only
reason something seems self-evident to you is because you blindly
believe it that's it that's the only reason or maybe
you've done an enormous amount of contemplating and hadn't had
many profound direct experiences and then something can seem self-evident
to you because you've you've inquired about it so much
but uh most people aren't there most people when they
say something is self-evident they're just using that as an
excuse not to question and investigate it another common trap
is trying to work towards the right answer it's like
maybe you're contemplating what a thought is but in the
back of your mind you already know what the right
answer is because you've watched so many Rupert spirit' videos
or Mooji videos or my videos or whatever else so
you read so many books that you already know and
so now you're just kind of going through the motions
to derive the answer that you already I know is
the right answer that's a huge mistake because there you're
you're robbing yourself of the actual discovery process you've got
to discover it for yourself so drop all those right
answers you might be shocked that what you think is
the right answer is actually not the right answer at
all if you would just go through the discovery process
the way you're supposed to oftentimes the right answer that
you get from me or from somebody else it's not
framed in a way that it will work for your
mind you see the right answer for me is not
the right answer for you because the right answer fits
in with my entire mental scheme of how I understand
reality and of course you have a different mental scheme
that you use to understand reality so for you the
right answer even though it will share probably some similarities
to to my understanding of a right answer to one
of these questions it will still be unique to you
that's why you can't just steal answers from teachers another
mistake is relying on external sources videos books teachers religions
and so forth another trap is thinking inside of your
culture you need to get really good at going outside
of your culture and starting to notice how a lot
of the stuff that you think is self evidence and
universal and just given and couldn't be any other way
that no really it's just part of your culture and
that there are many other cultures that are alive today
or that were alive a thousand years ago who didn't
believe what you believe what your culture beliefs they had
completely different understanding of reality and what helps with that
is actually it's a little bit paradoxical is to go
study other cultures go travel go read books eat different
types of food learn about different cultures so again I'm
not saying that you need to stop watching videos I'm
not saying you need to stop listening to teachers and
I'm not saying you need to stop reading books you
still got to do all that what I'm saying is
that when you're contemplating you isolate yourself you sort of
put yourself in in a bubble and you set all
that stuff aside and yes it is possible to both
yes is tricky of course all the stuff you learned
from all the books and videos will try to come
in there and will try to disturb your your pure
isolated contemplation of course it will that's that's a challenge
but hey you know what you can't escape that you
can't go through life not reading books not listening to
teachers not not watching videos that would be a terrible
strategy for going through life so you're learning stuff all
the time anyways even if you don't want to it's
going to be happening to you so you can't avoid
that so just develop the skill of being able to
kind of isolate yourself in the bubble and to set
aside all prior notions and teachings another big trap is
trying to build grand theories of everything using this contemplative
technique watch out for this you might start to follow
this trap of like starting to say oh so now
I understand what a thought is and now I understand
what emotions are now I understand what God is and
let me now write a book using my my journal
here let me just start writing a book about how
I think all this stuff fits together that is not
contemplation that's theory building and that's a very dangerous thing
you want to be very careful about that as soon
as you're starting to construct a lot of structure in
your understanding of reality immediately you should be very suspicious
because the mind and the ego loves to construct these
grand theories of everything and then get lost in them
confusing them for the territory so watch out that's probably
the number one trap of all philosophers especially Western philosophers
another trap with contemplation is false skepticism rationalism and science
and what I mean by false skepticism is that I
have a video that I shot a while back called
true versus false skepticism or I compare and contrast how
skepticism is used by the mind in a in a
partial way which makes it false skepticism and what that
means that you question things but you're actually questioning the
things you don't like and you're not questioning your fundamental
foundations your own metaphysics you're not questioning your own skepticism
you're not questioning your own ideology it's skepticism used as
a weapon to deconstruct religion let's say you're a rationalist
and you love to question religion well that's not gonna
cut it yes of course there's meant a lot of
within religion that's obvious what's less obvious is the within
your own rationalism start questioning that start being skeptical of
how you're using skepticism to cherry-pick and to actually build
your own rationalist narrative that's what you really got to
be skeptical about and the trap with science is is
that of course science is good there's a lot of
benefit we get from science but science fills us with
theories and ideas which we just accept unquestioningly so be
very careful about not bringing scientific rationalizations and justifications into
your contemplating be careful about now bringing evolutionary theory and
quantum mechanics and neuroscience and psychological studies you might have
heard elsewhere I'll be very careful about that those will
skew your results and the last trap of contemplation is
very simple one distraction I'd whole episode called distraction the
egos favorite defense mechanism and man it's a very pertinent
topic for this for this technique because when you sit
down with just a blank piece of paper with one
of these challenging questions your mind is gonna want to
turn to something else you're gonna want to grab the
phone you're gonna want to grab a book and read
or watch a movie or talk to a friend do
some texting look online do all the sort of stuff
all of that is distraction I want you to be
hyper aware of how you distract yourself from actually completing
a full 30 minutes or 60 minutes of solid contemplating
and try to fight that distraction when you contemplate properly
it should make you feel scared and uneasy you should
feel all alone like no other human being in the
world can help you with these questions that's right that's
good that's exactly what you want it'll feel uneasy at
first but then you'll get your footing and then actually
you'll kind of build a certain reliance and a certain
independence and autonomy which is exactly what you want you
want to develop intellectual autonomy so that you are the
CEO of your life in all the different ways both
in terms of your health and your relationships and your
career but intellectually as well you got to be the
CEO which means you're thinking this stuff through when you're
doing contemplation properly it should feel like you're cutting through
a lot of and at first that might feel uncomfortable
and bad but actually soon you'll develop a taste for
it and you'll actually feel good it's a really good
quality developing in yourself as a human being is to
be someone who cuts through not just other people's but
especially your own where you can just kind of like
reflect and you say yeah all this theorizing I know
is just and you just cut it out this process
will help you with that so what I recommend is
you start contemplating today and do so for the whole
week maybe you for the whole month start to get
comfortable with this process the biggest problem that I find
with contemplation is that the mind is just lazy and
it doesn't want to do it and it makes up
excuses by saying things like well yeah the contemplation sounds
nice but really there's no difference we meet contemplating and
me watching a video let me just watch a video
so much easier to watch a video than just sit
for an hour and contemplating and then you'll watch videos
after video after video after video and never contemplate anything
in your life and that would be a big trap
so here's my homework assignment for you I want you
to get a journal patent pad and a pencil or
pen and contemplate the following question for the next week
what is meaning where does meaning come from what creates
meaning that's it that's simple but there's a lot to
it there you can contemplate that one for a whole
week for sure and get a lot of juice out
of it a lot of profound insights so that's your
homework assignment all right that's it I'm done here please
remember to click that like button and also come check
out actualize that org that's my website you'll find exclusive
content there that you can't find anywhere else my blog
we're in posting lots of interesting videos and other kinds
of profound insights go check that out the life purpose
course the book list and the forum by the way
I just want to say a quick thing about the
life purpose course I hope you understand that my life
purpose course is like 95% exclusive unique content that I
have never spoken about anywhere else in all the other
actualized videos I think a lot of people don't understand
this they think that the life purpose course is just
me regurgitating the same stuff that I talked about in
the in the regular videos no that's not the case
at all the life purpose course first of all it's
extremely practical it's much more practical than my normal videos
because here we have a lot of time to really
dig into exercises a lot of exercises and techniques and
it's all geared towards helping you find your life purpose
which is a very practical thing and many of the
concepts that I talked about there I haven't ever talked
about ever anywhere else so that's done deliberately so that
there's a point in taking the course so I don't
repeat that material on purpose and last thing I'll tell
you is that start to think of personal development and
spirituality like athletics in athletics without training you get zero
results and that's basically how personal development works imagine how
good of an athlete you would be if all you
did is you sat around and you just videos or
read books about golf or tennis or skiing you would
suck it doesn't work at all it doesn't work at
all and after a certain point of watching these videos
about skiing or golf or tennis you just get you'd
get so inundated with all this theory that I would
actually do you a great disservice cuz you could talk
a big talk but you couldn't walk the walk so
it's extremely important that you start to do the practices
that I have talked about at nauseam really throughout my
entire history of episodes I've given you so many techniques
whether its various meditation techniques self inquiry techniques shamanic breathing
psychedelics various ways to contemplate and many many others you
know I've given you so many techniques visualizations affirmations reading
books and this and that I mean there's there so
much so much to do start doing that only by
doing all of that do you really then set yourself
up to gain value from these videos if all you
do is you watch the videos you will just turn
actualize that org into another religion into another ideology and
you will trick yourself into thinking that you're growing when
in fact you're not and that's a very big trap
a very very big trap huge trap I fall into
that trap myself I always have to be vigilant you
always have to be vigilant the ego is always turning
the practices into idol theory because that's what's comfortable and
safe for the ego the ego doesn't want you doing
all these practices it's uncomfortable it forces you out of
homeostasis it requires you to face uncomfortable truths and change
your lifestyle and change your relationships and like when you
really start to do this work your life will start
to change so quickly and so radically that it will
be uncomfortable for you you have to start to pace
yourself it's gonna be too much that that's a good
place to be at those of you who just sit
around watching and leaving comments and not actually doing the
work you're gonna get very lost and these things that
I say are going to sound two-seam they're gonna start
to seem crazy to you the reason they seem crazy
is because you're not growing with me you're not doing
the practices and you're not going to be able to
get to the most profound things that I want to
teach you to get to those you got to do
the practices that's where the real profound stuff is and
that's what drives me to release all this content so
really all this content is really just like dessert for
those people who are doing their practices and it will
deepen your practices it'll give you ideas and insights it'll
make you more excited about doing your practices and for
those of you who are new you got to watch
some amount of theory too to just start to get
like your bearings straight about what you should do in
life so don't feel guilty about watching you know 20
