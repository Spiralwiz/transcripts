[Music] happy new year 2022. this is how we do
new years in vegas now pay attention though because this
is a serious topic despite appearances of course appearances can
be very deceiving so this topic is a topic of
the fear of truth or the avoidance of truth this
is actually one of the highest insights that i've received
recently from a super conscious state of god realization and
awakening and that is the fundamental avoidance of truth that
all of us humans have this is a fundamental principle
of life is that you fear truth and everyone around
you fears truth and by understanding and studying this principle
and seeing it in action in your own life and
also all around you you start to get a very
good idea and understanding of why humans behave the way
that they do and all of the disastrous consequences that
are the natural consequence of that so let's explore all
this so what i want you to start to realize
is that you spend a lot of time and energy
running away from reality in many different domains we'll be
giving you a list of these domains running away from
yourself because after all what is the difference between reality
and self there's a deep connection there that most people
don't quite yet understand so truth is the highest value
why leo isn't that just a subjective opinion that you
have like maybe for for you leo truth is a
is the highest value but for other people it isn't
they have some other kind of value so leo why
are you saying that truth is the highest value no
truth is the highest value absolutely that's what i'm saying
and to appreciate this you need to become directly conscious
of what truth is which is not actually what this
episode is about if you want to understand the metaphysical
absolute nature of what truth is that's a deep topic
and i addressed that in my video called what is
truth go see that we're not going to be talking
about that here what we're going to be talking about
here is actually not the absolute level that's what that
episode is about but more the relative domain the more
practical this is a more practical episode about how you
avoid truth in practical ways in your life but fundamentally
the reason that truth is the highest value absolutely is
because truth is the only thing that's real truth is
reality itself and everything else simply isn't at all if
it's not true it is not it isn't so that
turns out to be pretty [ __ ] important uh
but anyways what i want you to notice is that
most humans don't care about truth for its own sake
they only care about it as a means to an
end towards survival and if it serves their pragmatic purposes
this is otherwise known as pragmatism in fact pragmatism literally
defines truth as that which is practical or which has
practical consequences and if it has no practical consequences it's
as though it isn't even real so it doesn't even
exist which is a complete perversion of of what truth
is and i've talked about that elsewhere i've talked about
pragmatism and the problems with pragmatism and how science has
permeated by problems of pragmatism so we've discussed that before
and i'll probably have a whole episode about pragmatism in
the future again because it's it's just it's worth isolating
that problem and focusing on it but again we're not
gonna we're gonna dwell on that here so the bottom
line is that if you want an exceptional life you
have to cultivate a deep value of truth you have
to really care about it in a way that most
humans around you don't so the way that you apply
this this principle that everybody is avoiding truth and afraid
of truth is that every day for the rest of
your life make the seeing of truth in every situation
a top priority for you forget about how you feel
forget about chasing pleasure forget about chasing money forget about
chasing sex and love and whatever else make truth your
top priority in whatever situation you find yourself in whether
it's going to be a relationship situation or a business
situation or whether you're in academia in education or you're
writing a book or you're working on your art or
in your spiritual work whatever you're doing and even when
it stings you and that's the thing is that truth
the seeking of truth will sting there's a sort of
a bittersweet quality to it it's not all sweetness and
this is what turns a lot of people off from
the pursuit of truth or from even caring about truth
in many situations and if you follow this one principle
and you keep applying it every single day you keep
remembering and reminding yourself that really your top priority every
situation is truth uh this will make you a very
unusual person it might also make you a rather unpopular
person see because most people avoid the truth for years
and decades which ends up snowballing into a tangle of
self-deception fantasy and dysfunctional coping mechanisms and is that not
a perfect articulation of the lives of most of your
friends family co-workers and acquaintances isn't that their life in
a nutshell a tangle of self-deception fantasy and dysfunctional coping
mechanisms is that not a perfect description of your own
life i mean hopefully you've made some improvements since watching
my content um but honestly i mean isn't isn't this
how you came into self-help in this situation and many
of you are still stuck in this situation and hey
i'm not above it too you know i i have
plenty of this going on myself that i'm that i'm
tackling too in fact the reason i had this insight
was because i was i was dealing with my own
avoidance of truth and so i i have plenty of
areas in my life where i avoid truth because it
stings and it's not comfortable but so again like like
we've talked about in the past you know the theme
of the counterintuitiveness of life the counterintuitive nature of life
i've whole episode about that um what's so counter to
about life is that you've got to open yourself up
to the unpleasant truths to the difficult aspects of reality
that's really what makes you a good and healthy person
a functional person and then the extent to which you
avoid that is the extent to which you're you're a
bad evil devilish and dysfunctional person and that's very counter-intuitive
it's counter-intuitive to pursue the truth without a clear explanation
of what it's going to get you how it's going
to serve you but of course the power of truth
is precisely in that it's not about what serves you
it transcends the serving of the self that's both the
[ __ ] of pursuing truth and also it's radical
power truth allows you to cut through [ __ ]
and a lot of what you see and encounter in
the world as you're growing up in your teens and
early 20s and 30s is your you're basically bombarded by
human [ __ ] all of the [ __ ]
that has been spun by society you're bombarded by constantly
in the media in the news via entertainment via your
friends when you're socializing via your family and so forth
in business and so when you set truth as your
compass and your highest priority this this gives you a
a a subtle power a subtle unspoken power it gives
you depth it gives you groundedness that most others simply
don't have and it's a subtle thing it takes years
for that pursuit of truth to start paying dividends but
when it does it really does take your life to
a new elevated level that other humans cannot access and
there's no shortcut to get there this is one of
those things the pursuit of truth is one of those
things that i've talked about in the past where like
you make a deep investment into this commitment towards the
pursuit of truth on a daily weekly monthly yearly decade-long
basis really for the rest of your life and and
it transforms you in a subtle way that's impossible to
then get with any kind of magic pill there's no
pill you can buy there's no amount of money that
you can spend at the store to give you the
kind of fruits and benefits towards your life and your
well-being and health and happiness that you get from living
a life committed to truth you see that's not something
you can read in a book it's not something somebody
can give you it's not something you can get in
a video even this requires daily investment little bit of
investment until it snowballs over years and decades and then
you're living a life aligned with truth that's very powerful
and nobody really teaches you how to do this i
mean like religion is supposed to teach you how to
do this but religion has been so corrupted and it's
so untruthful that of course the way the devil reworks
we've talked about this see my episode what is the
devil the way devilry works is that the devil precisely
co-opts and inverts the very core of of truth in
any situation and so of course the first thing that
the devil does is corrupt and invert and pervert that
teaching mankind through religion how to live a life in
alignment with truth religion doesn't really teach you that these
days in fact it's it's usually quite the opposite so
i want you to start to notice when you are
subtly avoiding a truth and then this is done through
introspection see my episode called developing introspection so you develop
a certain mindfulness and in inner attunement towards when you
are avoiding a truth and you can actually feel it
i'll give you a whole list of examples and things
will start to click right now it's a little abstract
um but anyways you feel when you're avoiding a truth
and then you your mind and your body naturally wants
to recoil away from the truth and turn towards a
different direction to distract yourself or to think about something
else and what you do is you say ah that's
the trick and then you're gonna make the counterintuitive move
to face the truth head on and to face that
that sting of the truth and that's the process you're
going to be doing essentially here uh over and over
and over again for the rest of your life and
this is what i suggest will create the good life
for you now again by truth i'm not just talking
about the absolute domain like god i'm talking about many
relative domains so for example i'm talking about business career
and life purpose how much truth alignment is there in
your work in your career in the way you conduct
business in the pursuit of your life purpose in the
impact you have on humanity and others with your work
other domains that are very important are relationships family and
communication the way that you communicate the way that you
relate to others whether it's intimate relationships or just friendships
or family how much truth alignment is there there another
domain is with your emotions and your motivations how truthful
are you about the emotions you're feeling and what is
actually motivating you we lie to ourselves so much about
emotions especially with with painful difficult negative emotions uh we
don't want to deal with it so what we do
is we fool ourselves or we suppress these emotions and
um we really avoid the difficult emotions for example you
might feel jealousy but jealousy or envy is a very
sneaky emotion it doesn't broadcast itself to you when it
arises within you as this is jealousy or this is
uh envy uh a lot of times with the emotion
of hurt being hurt by somebody else or by a
situation this is also a sneaky emotion because you feel
hurt but you you don't want to admit to yourself
that you're actually hurt so a lot of times what
happens is that the hurt is masked over by anger
so instead what happens is that most people they just
get angry and then they lash out when something hurts
them because really that veneer or that sort of armor
of anger is actually preventing a a truthful recognition of
a deeper vulnerability inside of you in that you were
actually hurt by this person or by this situation you
see and so by being more truthful you can you
can cut through some of that armor and some of
those other like defense mechanisms that you have also a
lot of your motivations you're not truthful about what really
motivates you to do what you're doing and clearing up
your motivations such that they are true and in alignment
with truth that's a big that's a big improvement you
can make to the quality of your life because if
if you're living based on untruthful motivations uh you're not
clear about what your motivations are or you're fooling yourself
you're deceiving yourself about why you do what you do
that's going to screw you up in a lot of
you know big ways and also subtle ways another relative
domain where this comes up is with your rationalizations your
opinions your worldview basically your epistemology your political positions very
few people are truthful about their worldview where it came
from why they're defending it the evidence and proof that
they bring forth to support their political positions or their
worldview or their beliefs about god or science or atheism
or whatever so people in general are very untruthful in
how they rationalize their own perspective and worldview and then
the way that they elevate and put on a pedestal
their own worldview relative to the other worldviews that exist
out there that are possible right you have a natural
bias in favor of your own opinions over the opinions
of others and over time this snowballs and this turns
into a into a very deep epistemic problem uh such
that your worldview becomes so self-biased and selfish and and
closed that you're not able to open your mind to
higher truths into higher dimensions and to higher possibilities it
closes you off from genuine spiritual pursuits and other deep
topics for example that i talk about with actualize.org most
people if you know if they just come in cold
to one of my advanced videos and they just listen
to it for five ten minutes the things they're gonna
hear me say are to trigger or offend them so
much because they're going to just butt up against their
own personal opinions beliefs their paradigms their rationalizations and worldviews
and their you know political positions and all that their
sort of naive epistemology it's going to it's going to
um be in such conflict that they're gonna turn off
the video and they're gonna leave and they're not gonna
get the possibility of all the growth and you know
insight that they could get for example from these videos
and this content another domain where truth is important is
with health diet and fitness i'll give you some more
examples as we go about how you lie to yourself
about the kind of stuff that you put into your
body the kind of food you eat and so forth
and um and then lastly i would say with spiritual
practices a lot of people get into sort of like
a new agey form of spirituality and they think that
now they're being all you know truthful and seeking god
and all this sorts of stuff but really it's just
another layer of of fantasy and self-deception and bullshitting yourself
and really not being truthful with yourself about your own
spiritual progress and then you can develop a spiritual ego
or you can develop a certain sort of a spiritual
um like facade of you being this new ager type
uh but really your consciousness has not expanded into the
deep realizations that would constitute true spirituality so i want
you to notice that a lot of times you enter
into a new domain of life like maybe you're starting
to take your fitness seriously for the first time you're
starting to go to the gym or maybe you're starting
to take your you know your dating life seriously for
the first time you're starting to go out and socialize
to clubs and bars talking to other people flirting with
people or maybe you're entering business for the first time
or you're entering self-help for the first time or you're
entering meditation or spirituality for the first time and what
i want you to notice is that you enter these
domains full of fantasies full of ideas of how you
think things will go what kind of results you'll think
you'll get what you think will work what you think
won't work and a big obstacle to your success in
all these fields is simply cutting through all of your
sort of like i would call them newbie fantasies and
hey i i was very guilty of this with all
these domains that i entered i had so many newbie
fantasies when i entered business i had so many newbie
fantasies when i entered marketing learning to market uh i
had so many newbie fantasies when it came to dating
and sexuality and understanding women i had so many newbie
fantasies about uh even what enlightenment is uh what god
is what spirituality is newbie fantasies about how to get
results at the gym or what kind of food is
healthy right so this is just the the nature of
things you're naive when you enter one of these fields
and it takes a lot of experience and usually trial
and error and research to figure out uh what your
fantasies are and um and so you can you can
take one of two tacks here one is that you're
going to be sort of a realist and you're going
to let reality pummel you you're going to fail over
and over and over again you're going to stick with
it and persevere in one of these domains and you're
just going to let reality just pummel you and completely
destroy all of your newbie fantasies that's painful though it
stinks it really stinks um like for example especially in
business really stings when you first enter business and you
think oh yeah i know how business works this is
easy and then very quickly the marketplace bludgeons you over
the head with truth about how business really works or
for example if you're trying to date women as a
guy and you know you're deficient in this area and
then you know you start going out there and start
talking to girls and getting phone numbers and stuff and
setting up dates and very quickly you'll get bludgeoned over
the head with the realities of how that works you
know girls won't be texting you back they'll be flaking
on you they'll be doing this they'll be doing that
you won't understand what's going on all of your fantasies
about what your close rate should be what kind of
girls you can get and all this sort of stuff
like um they're all going to get destroyed but that
that's painful that's a painful process because literally parts of
your mind have to die parts of your ego yourself
have to die as you're getting exposed to reality and
that's really what you fear that's really what you're avoiding
is you're avoiding the pain of the loss of parts
of your mind you thought you should relate to women
in this way and it turns out no that's wrong
that's exactly the opposite of how it needs to be
for you to have success in that area or you
thought you should do business in this way and it's
like no that it doesn't fly it doesn't work you
thought enlightenment was about this and then you realize no
it it's the opposite of that that here you see
and then you have to you have to let that
go or you thought religion was about this you thought
god was this and then it turns out god is
exactly the opposite of that or you thought this emotion
that you had here was was was about something and
then it turns out to be about something else or
your motivations you thought you were motivated by this and
then you actually realize oh [ __ ] no i
was lying to myself i'm actually motivated by that so
this is very practical stuff i'm sure if you've had
any success in your life where you have sort of
like built yourself from the ground up in some domain
of life you must have experienced this where your newbie
fantasies were crushed and that was painful and a lot
of people rather than going through the sting and the
pain of having their newbie fantasies crushed what they do
is they um they just quit because they can't handle
it their mind can't handle that and so they would
rather stuck in their old be stuck in their old
paradigms than let those paradigms go and reconfigure their mind
to think about this domain in a different way and
a lot of times that's what it takes to really
become successful in something is you have to learn to
think about it in a different and very counter-intuitive way
and you simply might not want to and therefore you're
going to stay a failure so here are some practical
examples real world examples of how you avoid truth for
example avoiding going to the doctor or to the dentist
have you ever had this where you're supposed to go
for a checkup but you keep procrastinating it and keep
delaying it because you're afraid you know what happens if
this test comes back like let's say you're gonna go
get an std test but in the back of your
mind you're afraid what happens if it comes back positive
see this is what i mean by the avoidance of
truth so as i'm giving you these examples the purpose
of these examples they're very specific ones is i want
you to recognize them in your own life and then
i want you to draw sort of a a more
abstract broader principle from this is that this is happening
all over the place in your life and you're usually
not noticing it until i'm pointing it out to you
all right how about this um i've actually encountered this
one uh with my mom um like for example sometimes
i'm filling out some forms for my mom helping her
like with her you know social security forms or you
know helping her sign up to some doctor or something
you know sometimes they ask you that what's your height
what's your weight so i asked her like on the
form okay so what's your weight and she's like oh
i don't know my weight i'm like well bye i
need to tell them your weight and she's like am
i i'm like how do you not know your own
weight and she's like oh well but um i don't
even want to get on the scale to look at
my my own weight because i'm not happy with my
weight so i don't even get on the scale and
i'm like good god you see the level of avoidance
here like it's just it's it's such a stark example
of the avoidance of truth because after all you know
getting on a scale to look at your own weight
does that change your weight does that make you fatter
no you're still the same weight whatever weight you are
right now is the way you are getting on the
scale that's just like looking in the mirror that's all
that is it's literally just self-reflection i've talked about self-reflection
before but think about getting on the scale is just
another form of self-reflection you're getting some info about yourself
but if you're not happy with your weight then you
might not enjoy the reflection that you see in the
mirror and so you avoid even looking in the mirror
and then the more you avoid it the worse it
gets because that scale keeps you honest if you see
a high number on that scale if you see that
you're 10 pounds heavier than last year and then 20
pounds heavier than two years before and 50 pounds heavier
than you were five years ago that's that's good feedback
that's telling you that you're letting yourself slide but if
you don't stand on that scale for five years then
you can just slide and keep sliding and sliding and
sliding and you don't confront reality really you're sort of
like living in a bubble of delusion about your situation
and then you don't have to worry about going to
the gym or eating healthier or seeing the doctor or
you know making whatever kind of changes because that would
be painful and you just want to avoid it and
you just want to like keep living life the easy
way now now notice here this example of not getting
on a scale maybe you you've done that yourself like
i remember when i was um overweight for much of
my life i was overweight i've posted pictures of myself
on my blog when i was 70 pounds heavier than
i am now um i didn't even like looking at
myself in the mirror i was that overweight and disappointed
with my own uh appearance and um and even photos
i remember i never took photos with like friends or
with family when i was overweight because like i just
didn't like looking at my own photos i was disgusted
with them but there was a sort of an avoidance
there too because i was like avoiding looking at myself
because if if i just stood there and looked at
myself i would feel so bad about myself that either
it would put me into sort of like a depressed
state where i would feel like a victim it's like
oh i'm fat and i can't do anything about it
or it would that pain would motivate me to like
want to go to the gym and so forth but
then i would have to like work really hard towards
that and i didn't like that either so i was
stuck in this place between being a victim and between
wanting to change something and then eventually i you know
the the tales the scales tipped and i and i
made some big changes but see you can probably relate
to this um almost all of us has probably struggled
with this kind of problem um but see not getting
on the scale being afraid to get on the scale
this is just this is just the tip of the
iceberg of a much larger dynamic do you see that
that's what i want you to notice here how about
this example avoiding looking at how many calories per serving
are on the box of whatever junk food you're eating
like maybe you got a a nice bucket of ice
cream there some haagen-dazs and you want to eat the
whole bucket but you're even afraid to calculate you know
maybe there's like four and a half servings per bucket
and each serving has like 300 calories and you're afraid
to even do the math of how many thousands of
calories are in that bucket so you just kind of
shut your mind off from that no you can actually
notice yourself playing this little game where you're just sort
of like it's almost like you're just sort of like
blinkering your own self you're putting blinders on your own
self so you don't even look at the back of
the box and you just sort of like in blissful
ignorance eat the ice cream while covering it up with
your hand you know the back of the back of
the carton so you don't even read it or you
might even go further and you might start to rationalize
to yourself like oh well you know yeah sure it's
300 calories per serving but i'm only gonna eat one
serving when of course you know you're gonna eat the
whole bucket not just one serving or you might even
say oh yeah you know i only ate one serving
but actually you ate three servings so you're lying to
yourself you know how deep to the bottom of the
bucket that you get you might say oh well you
know i only ate a third of the bucket actually
you ate half the bucket or two thirds of the
bucket and then you call that a third or you
call that a half see it's these games you play
um or you might even say something oh but this
is this is you know dairy free this is coconut
ice cream see this is not normal ice cream it's
coconut ice cream so it's yeah it has a thousand
calories but it's coconut ice cream it's dairy free it's
all vegan and all natural it's organic ice cream like
that um or you might you know justify yourself like
oh yeah okay yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna eat this
whole bucket but you know tomorrow i'm gonna go to
the gym and work extra hard tomorrow and of course
you don't tomorrow you miss the gym it's this kind
of stuff that i'm talking about um how about when
you eat a donut or some other kind of greasy
junk food and then you avoid the physical effects that
this has on your mood and on your body so
what you should start to notice is that when you
eat junk food you feel bad within the next 30
to 60 minutes your stomach might hurt you might get
sleepy you might get some brain fog you might feel
nauseous from the kind of you know greasy food you've
eaten or whatever overly sugary food and and then your
body is sending you these signals like oh stomach doesn't
feel good i'm feeling kind of nauseous i'm kind of
feeling lazy i don't want to work it you know
for the next hour and so forth uh but then
but what you do is you kind of shift your
mind you distract your mind away from actually feeling that
negativity in your body because you don't want to deal
with those consequences and instead like you turn on a
movie or you distract yourself with a video game or
something else so that you don't you don't you're not
even conscious or aware of these negative effects that this
food has on your body and then and then you
keep doing this day after day after day for years
and for decades to the point where you become this
numb zombie where you're eating this junk food and you're
not even aware of how this junk food is affecting
how you feel and then you might feel depressed you
might have brain fog you might have chronic fatigue and
other sorts of problems and you'll be wondering like why
do i feel so bad and you won't even connect
in your mind the dot that the dots that uh
like these these are the consequences kind of food you're
putting into your body because you're so in denial about
it because you want to keep putting that food in
your body you want to keep eating those donuts because
if you connect the dots too deeply in your mind
between the donut and how it makes you feel and
the effect it has on your health then you're no
longer going to be able to eat that donut you
see and that's what you're avoiding because you want to
keep eating those donuts or you're going to feel guilty
and then you don't want to feel guilty about it
so be especially aware of your rationalizations and justification i'm
going to have a whole episode about just rationalizations and
justifications because it's such a huge and important topic so
we won't go into it further here but just be
aware that a lot of the avoidance of truth is
accomplished through your rationalizations and this is why i'm so
critical of rationality and logic is because most people do
not comprehend the depths to which their rationality and logic
has been co-opted by the ego mind in service of
falsehood not truth people just tend to like naively assume
that rationality leads to truth when in most cases it's
the opposite of that rationality resides and comes from mostly
the left hemisphere of your brain if you're right-handed and
vice versa if you're left-handed and and it is uh
it is not an honest actor most of the time
and it's very very difficult to spot yourself bullshitting yourself
with rationality and logic and in fact there's a whole
game of truth avoidance that highly rational and logical people
play with themselves it's the game of pretending as though
rationality and logic is the end-all be-all and that it
is truthful inherently they play this game which of course
is false this is why these people can get very
heated in arguments and debates and they can present you
with all sorts of logical facts and scientific facts and
they can they can play this very kind of like
logical persona but the reality is is that they're bullshitting
themselves just as much as most other people are bullshitting
themselves but they're they're just doing it in a more
sort of like sophisticated sciency sort of way and so
i i've been very critical of that in the past
and people wonder like leo why are you so anti-science
again it's not that i'm anti-science it's just there's there's
a lot of [ __ ] within science you gotta
understand a lot of rationalizations and um it's mostly ego
games you gotta see it as that it's not really
about truth how about like when you're watching television and
then maybe some uncomfortable ad comes on maybe it's like
you know you see one of those ads from like
some non-profit group in africa trying to feed poor crippled
african kids or something and so they're like they're living
in this abject poverty and they're showing you pictures of
these little african kids you know missing limbs and this
and that and they have these sad faces and um
you know they're asking you for donations they're kind of
playing on your emotions uh and then what do you
do you you quickly change the channel i mean i
don't i don't watch tv anymore but i remember when
i when i used to watch tv when i was
younger i would i would switch the channel when those
ads came on because i didn't want to like deal
with that difficult reality like there are people living like
that meanwhile i'm sitting here watching my you know fiber
television on a big flat screen eating a bucket of
ice cream and being lazy and playing video games all
day like i'm doing that and then there's like some
poor crippled african kid with one arm and one leg
that's like mining uh lithium in some african mine that
they're showing me on television like see this is avoidance
of truth or maybe you've seen an ad that shows
you like these animals these poor animals that are homeless
and like uh being abused and in animal shelters and
they're asking you for donations you know same thing or
maybe you you've seen a video on youtube for example
like of factory farming sort of the evils of factory
farming like you know the behind the scenes sort of
documentary about factory farming or about global warming maybe showing
pollution and maybe even the the video or the documentary
is showing how your own actions are contributing to this
factory farming or there's global warming or maybe sweatshop labor
or something like this and you see this in i
mean it's it's horrific but at the same time it's
also true but at the same time you want to
keep eating your bacon you want to keep eating your
steak you want to keep eating your chicken uh and
you keep want you want to keep driving your suv
car and you want to keep buying your you know
your your products from walmart and from amazon which many
of which are like coming from sweatshop labor around the
world from third world countries so you just change the
channel or you switch off the video to something fun
you you switch to a music video to a cat
video to some comedy see it's it's too real it's
too much responsibility you don't want to integrate the full
scope of what reality is and reality is a brutal
thing that's why we call it reality you know one
of the sort of implicit definitions of reality is like
oh that's we say like that's real what we mean
when we say that that's so real is it's like
it's [ __ ] brutal like it's it's non-negotiable it
just is what it is even when it doesn't suit
you it's uncomfortable and that's reality and so a big
part of your work to become a good human being
and to live the quote-unquote good life is to open
yourself up to the full gamut of reality as it
is not as you need it to be to feel
comfortable see another example of truth avoidance is avoiding looking
a homeless person in the eyes have you done this
i'm sure you've done this you pull up at the
stop light and you're standing there it's a red light
there's some homeless people on the corner there he's looking
you in the eyes but you like want to like
look away because if you look him in the eyes
long enough it's going to trigger empathy in you it's
going to make you start to think about your life
and about how selfish and greedy you are how entitled
you are how comfortable you are here you are complaining
about some stupid [ __ ] in your life like
you didn't get you didn't get the playstation this year
see you're pissed off about that while you're sitting in
the car like i can't find my playstation and this
guy over here is sleeping in the middle in the
middle of uh freezing you know freezing winter homeless hasn't
eaten in a week addicted to heroin or whatever else
and here you are complaining about not being able to
get a playstation for christmas see but hey you want
your playstation you just want to play your playstation in
blissful ignorance in obliviousness because how are you going to
enjoy your playstation when you know that really that money
should have gone to that homeless person to get them
some shelter how about avoiding checking your phone your text
messages or your email or your voicemail i'm sure all
of you have experienced this i've experienced this one a
lot sometimes you're expecting an important phone call message text
or email from somebody whether it's a an employer a
job you apply to maybe it's your girlfriend or your
your husband or your children or you know your mom
or whatever they're supposed to send you an important message
uh but you're afraid of receiving the message you're afraid
of the bad news because it could either be good
news or it could be bad news and you want
it to be good news but you don't want it
to be bad so you're afraid to check your phone
like uh sometimes i've had it like where i will
text like i met a girl the other night right
a great girl very attractive whatever you know we decided
we're gonna go date we're talking about dating or something
like that then you know i text her and then
after i text her i'm afraid to check my own
phone because i'm afraid she's not going to respond to
the text or she's going to respond some sort of
negative manner to the text like you know i might
text her like you know when are you free this
week and then she either doesn't respond i'm afraid of
that or she responds like um in you know some
sort of dismissive way where basically it's not going to
go anywhere so but i mean this is just one
example i mean you've had this example with your phone
so just notice that notice the next time that you're
sort of anticipating some kind of message from somebody and
then it's alright maybe you see the like i've had
it where an email has arrived in my inbox and
the title of the email says something that i already
know i'm afraid to double click on that and so
i just procrastinate i leave that email unread for like
a week because i know that you know clicking on
that thing is going to be scary it's going to
be difficult i'm going to deal with whatever [ __
] is going to be you know in that in
that email and i want to deal with it have
you ever had that so so the reason i'm giving
you these very sort of like micro examples is because
i want you to actually use these kinds of micro
examples find them in your life and then use it
to actually develop a introspective capacity to introspect and to
notice what it feels like to be avoiding truth otherwise
it's just going to be like an abstraction i don't
want this to just be some principle in your life
that's just a pure abstraction you got to actually find
it and notice what it feels like to be avoiding
truth and you can start doing that in these little
micro examples and then from that you will learn what
it feels like in the in the larger macro examples
example would be avoiding an audit of your business finances
it's scary to audit your own business finances because you
might discover some you know some irregularity there you might
discover that your business is not doing as good as
it could be for example um i i notice that
i'm avoidant of every quarter i have to kind of
like go through my finances my business earnings and so
forth my profits and and you know tabulate them calculate
taxes see how many sales there were total how many
refunds blah blah blah blah right and so i i'm
always a little bit avoidant i notice myself being avoidant
of of doing that every quarter simply because it's like
well what if the business isn't doing so well this
year what if what if rather than increasing my sales
my sales are decreasing what if my web traffic is
decreasing what if my view count is decreasing what if
my subscribers are decreasing so sometimes i'm avoiding i notice
myself being avoidant of checking those stats and numbers and
yet see on the other hand if i keep avoiding
that and avoiding it and avoiding it and procrastinating and
pushing it off what ends up happening is that actually
you can destroy your business this way because if you
are losing sales if you're losing customers if you're losing
subscribers and viewers that's important feedback you want to receive
that feedback immediately so that you can adjust and make
course corrections and you have to do that in business
every business has to be adjusting to changes in the
marketplace and a lot of businesses what they do is
they become successful but then they get sort of complacent
and they're no longer looking at new trends in the
marketplace and they miss out on those trends and then
they get out competed and a lot of businesses go
bankrupt this way because their leadership is not on top
of the ball and is not being hyper vigilant about
you know new threats and new opportunities that are arising
in the marketplace and so in this way you can
slowly slide and slide and slide your way into bankruptcy
as a business then this leads us to the example
of addiction of course all addiction any kind of addiction
is basically just a coping mechanism and avoidance mechanism for
truth that's fundamentally what addiction is about whether it's food
addiction drug addiction sex addiction you're using it to avoid
painful emotions difficult emotions difficult realities in your life maybe
you have a shitty job maybe you have a shitty
family situation maybe you're getting shitty grades at school and
maybe or maybe you're you're overweight and you don't have
any um opportunity for dating people that you want you
don't feel attractive and so because of this see you
could buckle down and force yourself to really change in
each of these situations and to to get some sort
of positive results or what you could do is you
could um you could look for sort of an escape
hatch a release valve for dealing with the difficulty of
those situations those difficult emotions you what you're really avoiding
is difficult emotions and so instead you're going to find
a distraction which becomes your addiction it could be sex
porn food television internet phone drugs alcohol and so on
sugar um but i've talked about addiction elsewhere so i'm
not going to dwell on that another example is avoiding
um facing trauma in your life old trauma childhood trauma
trauma is difficult to process really this is the work
of therapy is dealing with old trauma kind of reliving
it looking at it from different points of view integrating
it forgiving people who traumatized you understanding it that's difficult
therapeutic work and so most people just want to avoid
that and again the avoidance of trauma is basically what
leads you then into addiction because facing the trauma means
dealing with negative emotions that are difficult and most people
don't want to do that instead they just want to
have fun and positive emotions and so you get that
from some addictive substance like alcohol cocaine or food or
video games whatever another avoidance of truth example is avoiding
facing your personal deficiencies and inadequacies so you can probably
relate to this there are deficiencies and inadequacies within your
personality maybe you're too arrogant maybe you're too much of
a pushover maybe you're a doormat maybe you're an [
__ ] a jerk um maybe you lie maybe you
brag maybe you cheat maybe you steal like whatever um
and so rather than actually looking for a root solution
to that and changing your own personality to address those
deficiencies and inadequacies what you do is you come up
with rationalizations or distractions and then that that just preserves
your deficiencies and inadequacies and then you get defensive about
it you create sort of armor to defend yourself because
other people will criticize you for your deficiencies and adequacy
then you'll come up with rationalizations for why really those
people are wrong and that you're right and actually you're
not deficient that people should love you for who you
are and blah blah blah blah but you're you're fooling
yourself you're you're not facing the truth here and you
know facing your own deficiencies and inadequacies this is difficult
to do because a lot of times we don't want
to admit when we're inadequate in something like maybe you
thought you were better at your job than you really
are and then it's difficult when your co-worker tells you
or your boss tells you that actually maybe you're not
as good at your job as you thought you were
this conflicts with your own sense of self your own
self image because here you are you thought you were
the best in the field and now evidence is showing
you that you're not the best in the field and
then maybe you're actually mediocre this threatens you and so
you get defensive and you avoid actually admitting that you
know maybe maybe my boss is right maybe i am
inadequate in this field if i admit that i can
then maybe study and work harder and train myself and
then become as good as i thought i was but
see that's bad news you don't want to work for
three years to only become as good as you already
thought you were this whole time but on the other
hand if you don't do that then you're never going
to become good and then you're going to spend the
next 10 20 years of your life playing this act
as though you are as good as you thought you
were and that you're not really inadequate but that really
you are and so you're going to be overcompensating all
the time and this is going to lead to all
sorts of dysfunctional patterns you see how this works how
about this example avoiding facing when your actions hurt others
so a lot of times what we do a lot
of what evil is in the world is people just
have selfish needs cravings and desires and then we go
about satisfying those and then as i go about satisfying
them to satisfy my own cravings and desires there's going
to be collateral damage that is done to others but
since i'm selfish and i just want to satisfy my
cravings and desires the most effective way for me to
do that is to avoid literally avoid seeing the hurt
that my actions cause to others in the pursuit of
satisfying my own desires and so i will block out
all the collateral damage that i do so that i
can just in blissful ignorance satisfy my desires and pretend
as though the satisfaction of my own desires isn't causing
harm to others and this is a lot of what
businesses do this is a lot of what happens when
you're very ambitious about pursuing money or success is that
you're so ambitious about money and success and material pursuits
that you're going to basically stab any anybody in the
back step on anybody's toes do whatever it takes to
you know climb the corporate ladder or to get your
result and sure you get you get your result in
your success but but actually you're avoiding the truth which
is that you're hurting a lot of people in this
process and in this process you basically become so sociopathic
in the pursuit of your ambitions and material you know
cravings this also happens with sex if you're a very
uh craving of sex and desperate for sex you are
going to cause a lot of collateral damage in your
pursuit of sex and you're going to rationalize to yourself
that oh actually you know i'm not causing any damage
they're the sensitive ones they're they're being unreasonable but actually
it's just because if you admitted to yourself and you
actually became conscious of how much suffering you caused others
through your sexual conquests and pursues you would have a
lot less sex and that's precisely what you don't want
to face that's the truth you don't want to face
another example is avoiding facing your physical appearance maybe there's
something about your physical appearance you don't like you don't
like your big nose you don't like your crooked teeth
or whatever you don't like some mole on your face
and you can notice yourself when you're looking in the
mirror sort of actually avoiding like your mind is so
sneaky it will look at your face and it'll avoid
that part of your face or your body or whatever
that you don't like and it's like you you wish
it was different but the reality is it's not the
reality is that your nose is the way it is
your teeth are the way they are that mole is
on your face or wherever and um and you don't
like it that's the reality and so you avoid facing
that and you can also avoid facing it by demonizing
it and by hating it so even the hatred of
it you might say well leo i hate my big
nose therefore i'm not avoiding facing it i faced it
and i hate it but that's not really true when
you hate your big nose you're actually not you're not
truly facing the truth of your big nose actually what
you're doing is you're avoiding it by hating it see
if you if you really faced it and accepted it
and there would be an acceptance there there'd be a
surrender to it to the truth of your big nose
or whatever else and then a sort of a peace
and a love would actually come from that not a
hatred so hatred is not is not the facing of
truth so be careful about that how about avoiding uh
facing your hair loss for you guys um maybe you
play this game you look in the mirror like am
i losing am i starting is my hairline recidivity am
i starting to lose my my hair and then you're
like ah no it's probably okay it's just i'm imagining
things but actually in the back your mind your hair
you know your hair your hairline is receding but then
you [ __ ] yourself like ah well it's not
it's not so bad i can i'm just imagining things
like this or maybe you even avoid looking too closely
at your hairline because you're like just like oh well
i'll it'll be okay it's probably okay i don't need
to look at it too closely or hey you know
even the fact that you're hating it again the hating
of the receding of your hairline that is not facing
the truth understand that it's very sneaky how you avoid
truth how about the example of avoiding facing some deep
problem you've been procrastinating on in your life like maybe
you know that you have been cooped up in your
home too much you need to go out there and
socialize and start dating the way i've talked about in
my series how to get laid maybe you know that
that's the right move for you but you just don't
want to start doing it it's too uncomfortable you're too
afraid to start going out to talk to strangers to
talk to girls to start to flirt you're just too
afraid of opening that whole can of worms so you
procrastinate and you make excuses and of course you have
to demonize you have to say like oh well leo
this will never work i'll never get laid it doesn't
work you know pickup doesn't work those things you've talked
about it doesn't maybe it works for guys with a
good looking jawline but it won't work for me see
you rationalize like this and this is avoiding facing truth
the truth in this case is that you have to
do an enormous amount of work on yourself to turn
yourself into a social person to become good at dating
for example as a guy you have to do a
lot of work and what you're really avoiding is the
doing of that work therefore you subscribe to various kinds
of black pill red pill in cell uh mgtow sorts
of ideologies you spent hundreds of hours on online forums
or watching various kinds of you know like black pill
anti-feminist anti-sjw videos on youtube just so that you can
distract yourself from actually going out of your house and
going talking to a girl and maybe getting rejected and
so you're avoiding facing the truth that hey maybe maybe
you're going to be rejected maybe you're not as good
as you think you are maybe you're not going to
get laid as much as you you know as much
as your friends get laid and maybe that's going to
make you feel bad and so you're avoiding that nobody
says that everybody gets laid equally some people get laid
more than other people get laid whether it's their looks
or their innate personality or whatever and you have to
you have to accept that that doesn't mean you can't
get laid it just means you're not going to get
laid as much as you know brad pitt gets laid
and you have to accept that and that's difficult to
accept because it's unfair it's like well leo but i
should get laid why does brad pitt get laid more
than not than everybody else why can't i get laid
as much as him that's unfair yeah that's a truth
you have to accept reality is not fair in that
way and so you're avoiding facing that another example is
getting angry at the messenger who delivers bad news so
this is the classic shooting the messenger uh you shoot
the messenger because you don't want to deal with the
actual substance of the news that was delivered to you
so you get angry at the person who told you
the message another example is of avoiding facing how long
a project will actually take and how much work it
will take to complete a project i encounter this especially
a lot in business various kinds of business projects get
themselves into a lot of trouble when they fool themselves
about how long a certain project will take or how
much work it will take almost always when you're starting
some kind of business project you end up underestimating how
long it's going to take how much work it's going
to take and then you avoid facing the truth of
that because you want it to kind of be faster
you want it to be easier because if it's if
if at the beginning of the project you truly understood
how long it would take and how much work it
would take you would probably never even begin the project
so in a certain sense you have to like lie
to yourself in order to just kind of just get
into the project and then later like the sunk cost
fallacy will just take hold of you and and you
know keep you in the project uh but you know
yeah there's a lot of things in my life that
that were so difficult to do that if i was
told the full extent of how difficult it would be
to do it that i would never have done it
which is sort of like an interesting paradox so so
actually by lying to yourself and being overly optimistic about
something you ended up being successful and so i'm not
saying that the avoidance of facing truth and that these
fantasies and lies that you tell yourself are not useful
they can be useful especially for example if you're trying
to be successful that's why people lie so much because
lies can be very effective towards survival but you have
to understand there's always going to be karmic consequences to
that so you know it's going to boomerang on you
another example is avoiding other worldviews and perspectives which would
contradict your own worldview or threaten your worldview a lot
of religions do this a lot of cults do this
a lot of people within you know political idea basically
every ideology does this every ideology as i've explained before
in my epistemology episodes it tries to create sort of
a a hermetically sealed bubble which we call the world
view or a paradigm and it tries to lock you
in and it it it's very sneaky in how it
prevents you from looking outside of the bubble because if
you look outside the bubble too much it'll burst the
entire bubble this is exactly what what religion does for
example in the classical sense but for example materialist science
does this as well so this is not just some
you know naive religious fundamentalists that are guilty of this
very intelligent rational scientists are guilty of this as well
and so i want you to notice this within yourself
when you hear some sort of different perspective maybe you
watch some youtube video or some some public intellectual telling
you something that conflicts with your worldview uh a lot
of times what you do is you just shut that
person down you demonize that person you marginalize that person
dismiss that person laugh at that person ridicule him whatever
but really that's just an avoidance mechanism from facing some
kernel of truth now maybe what he's talking about is
not 100 true but there's some kernel of truth there
and that is the thing that you're actually afraid of
allowing into your own worldview because it would destroy your
worldview eventually another example would be avoiding listening to feedback
from others a similar situation you know certain feedback can
be so painful to integrate because it's so profoundly true
and other people can see things about you that you
can't see about yourself because of how self-deception works you
know when you're deeply wrapped up in self-deception somebody else
can just pierce through your bubble of self-deception very quickly
with like a single sentence they can just cut right
to the core of the truth of how you're bullshitting
yourself and then when that happens like it it terrifies
you and then you can notice yourself getting angry lashing
out at that person demonizing that person shutting that person
down ridiculing that person all these sorts of coping mechanisms
just to avoid getting your own little bubble punctured but
actually if you accept it if you were more open
and not so avoidant of truth you could actually accept
that feedback and then integrate it and that would grow
you but of course it would also kill a part
of you because then you'd have to admit to yourself
that well yeah that person was right you know i
was being arrogant i was being a jerk i was
being a devil or something like that and so that's
why a lot of people are very touchy and not
open to feedback and hey you know i'm guilty of
that too i'm not above that um all of us
are so flawed and so selfish that basically and we're
all so self-deceived and full of [ __ ] and
fantasies that it's very easy to cut a person down
if you're very perceptive you can kind of observe a
person you can just you can tell them a single
sentence that will just go right to the heart of
his [ __ ] and just cut that person like
to the core um and of course if you do
that that person will usually get very defensive and make
an enemy out of you they're not going to be
like oh thank you for cutting me down to my
core thank you for cutting through all my [ __
] and self-deception no they're going to hate you when
you do something like that right because it's it's so
threatening a lot of times we we fool ourselves so
thoroughly that we think that not only have we fooled
ourselves but we fooled everybody else around us too but
then it can be kind of shocking to realize that
oh wait a minute i've only fooled myself i haven't
successfully fooled everybody else around around me they can see
through my [ __ ] and then that can make
you feel very vulnerable and threatened and afraid another example
of avoiding truth is that something is going wrong in
your life in some situation but then you're in denial
about it and you pretend as oh no no nothing's
going wrong it's all going to work out it's going
to work out you know a good example of this
would be the united states military interventions in in the
middle east for example afghanistan or iraq you know we
go into there and we we kind of fool ourselves
into thinking that oh yeah we're going to defeat everybody
with our superior military technology within a few months and
then they're going to be all happy that we defeated
the evil tyrants and terrorists and then uh you know
yeah we'll be able to leave in a year well
two years to ah maybe three years tops we'll we'll
we will be out of there and then we're still
there 20 years later and we're in denial about it
and then when people point out oh you know it's
going wrong you know we're not we're not winning over
there and then people are in denial about it because
they don't want to admit that it was a mistake
to go in there in the first place so think
about how that happens in your own life uh another
example would be with relationships sometimes you know that your
relationship is basically unsustainable you reach a point in an
intimate relationship or in a friendship where you know that
this is not going to work out and that really
the proper move is a breakup but you don't want
to break up because it's going to be painful because
you're going to miss the sex and you're going to
miss the intimacy and the friendship and whatever else you
got from that relationship and so you end up just
kind of like lying to yourself about yeah maybe this
relationship can work ah you know maybe it'll maybe it'll
just work itself out but deep down you know this
is not the right match for you you know this
person is not going to be your ultimate life partner
or whatever it's just not going to work you know
that deep down but you [ __ ] yourself and
you're lie to yourself because it's too painful to deal
with a breakup and a lot of marriages are like
this you know it's even worse once you have kids
and once you're married it's so much worse and i
think a lot of people are stuck in in these
sort of dead-end marriages when where they know the marriage
is is already dead but uh they can't deal with
the sting of admitting to themselves that they're gonna have
to go through this horrific divorce and deal with all
this [ __ ] um to finally be free and
so they just sort of uh suffer quietly for years
for decades and then as they do this this this
makes them jaded this makes them disengaged from life this
makes them bitter and hateful and resentful uh and just
puts them in a depression all this and it you
know it gets bad it gets real bad and they're
they're simply avoiding truth here that's the problem another example
would be avoiding looking at corruption within your own company
or political party you're identified with your company or your
political party so much or maybe your religion or maybe
your academic institution that you're working at you're so beholden
to that entity you're so a part of it it
so aligns with your personality so identify with it that
you can't admit to yourself that actually that corporation or
that entity is corrupt and so you deny the corruption
you turn a blind eye to it this would be
an example for example of uh you know the sexual
abuse problems in the catholic church if you're a priest
and you devoted your entire life to the catholic church
and you depend on it for your livelihood and you
also your whole spiritual path is connected to that church
and then when you learn about corruption sexual abuse in
that church are you going to report it are you
going to take it seriously or are you going to
try to sweep it under the rug and pretend as
though it doesn't exist or as though it's like oh
it's just it's just one bad apple it's not the
whole church it's just one bad apple see that's how
you're going to rationalize it in your mind because you
don't want to face the truth that it's more than
just one bad apple the entire institution is corrupt and
in general the example here is avoiding facing reality the
reality of a situation so sometimes there are certain just
like difficult truths or facts about how reality works uh
so for example if you're a woman when it comes
to you know dating and relationships uh it'll be difficult
for you to stomach the fact that most men are
attracted to young women and as you get older that's
going to be a difficult truth for you to accept
that that's just like how men are wired it's going
to be difficult for you to accept that men are
predominantly attracted to physical appearance youthful physical appearance in women
that's going to be difficult for you to stomach if
you're not that if you don't have that now if
you have that you're going to love it but if
you don't have that that's going to be very difficult
for you to accept the reality of that situation but
conversely you know for for men if you're a man
it's going to be difficult for you to accept what
women are attracted to in men women are attracted to
status and strength predominantly in men that's going to be
difficult for you to accept as a guy if you
don't have that if you have it you're going to
love it but if you don't have it you're going
to be bitter and resentful and you're going to try
to like avoid facing that that reality this is just
one example within like the dating domain but there are
a lot of examples where you just avoid facing the
reality of a situation sort of the stark reality of
a situation whether it's in business or in politics or
in the way money works the way investing works and
then um if you avoid facing this these these sort
of stark truths then you're going to be living in
a fantasy land and then you're not going to be
effective the cost of that fundamentally is that you're not
effective you're not going to be able to reach your
goals and you're going to you're going to hold on
to these fantasies and then you're going to try to
be effective in the world and you realize that i'm
not effective in the world then you're going to start
to feel like a victim a lot of times the
problem with victims is that they have a certain paradigm
or lens through which they see the world and then
they don't want to change that lens or that paradigm
and so they feel like a victim they feel like
they're always going to be a victim that they can't
change because they refuse to admit that it's the lens
that they're holding onto and looking at the world through
that is creating that victim situation and surrendering that lens
that is very difficult for people to do that will
require changing your mind and dropping a part of yourself
so anyways those are some of the examples uh i
want you just to use these to find more within
your own personal life so notice that it is temporarily
easier when you lie to yourself but the effect of
that is sort of like taking out a credit card
loan if you're short on money yeah it's nice to
be able to take out a credit card loan and
buy the things you want to buy but then you're
going to repay it with high dividends or high interest
uh in the months to come and so that's sort
of what's happening when you're lying to yourself in all
these situations i'll give you another example this is more
of a collective example now political example probably pissed some
people off but um look at the republican party in
the united states look at it in terms of like
what's been happening in the last 20 30 years with
the republican party and especially in the last ten to
five years with the republican party because the republican party
is deeply dysfunctional and the republican party has a serious
fundamental problem with avoiding truth they have been avoiding truth
for decades now and they keep avoiding it and avoiding
it but they're too arrogant to actually admit that they're
avoiding truth and so they're clinging and they're doubling down
and tripling down on their avoidance of truth and this
just spins them deeper and deeper into delusion to the
point where now we have the rise of trump and
magga and all this but really where did this come
from this came from a trend within the republican party
that really started with you know george w bush and
even before that where they are just uh deeply avoiding
the truth of the changing of society this is the
fundamental problem of conservatives and and traditionalist sort of people
is that society is always evolving and changing there's new
technologies uh culture is always changing and evolving religion is
always changing and evolving language is changing and evolving sexual
norms are changing and evolving and um and fundamentally conservatives
don't want change they don't like change they're scared of
change and so they're avoiding the change and they are
um putting the brakes on every change basically that they're
uncomfortable with uh in the hopes that that they can
stop it and they could sort of like keep things
the way they were you know it's that trumpian maga
fantasy of you know america was was you know make
america great again the way it was in 1950s or
whenever of course it was never great in the 1950s
or ever in that sense it's just a fantasy but
um uh but you know there's just like certain truths
that are being avoided like for example um the truth
that the demonization of homosexuality and transgender people that this
was based in delusion and um and selfishness and closed-mindedness
that's the truth of that situation uh and so you
know now now that homosexuality and trans stuff is is
more acceptable uh generally speaking we sort of acknowledge the
the limited small-minded way in which we used to think
about those things the same thing with like racism you
know racism used to be more acceptable now it's not
acceptable but for for a lot of conservatives then like
they're not comfortable with with me with admitting and facing
these these difficult truths um [Music] which is not to
say that liberals and progressives don't also avoid facing difficult
truths they do they do so don't get me wrong
here that i'm only picking on the republican party but
if you don't see that the amer the republican party
in america has an especially bad case of avoiding truth
you're [ __ ] blind you're [ __ ] blind
and this is why trump is so appealing is because
trump came along and trump just said you know what
um you guys love avoiding the truth that's what you
guys vote for well [ __ ] if that's what
you're gonna vote for you know i'm a master i'm
a master at avoiding the truth that's what i spent
my entire life doing i can help you guys avoid
the truth um to the hilt like there's no limit
to how much i can help you guys avoid truth
and then the republican party is like yes perfect perfect
because we're not going to admit that we're wrong in
any way we're not going to actually reflect about our
behaviors we're going to actually change our mind we're not
going to change our mind on religion we're not going
to change our mind and abortion we're not going to
change our mind on on you know race relations we're
going to change our mind on gay and trans rights
we're not going to change our mind on global warming
we don't change on anything so yes please somebody come
along somebody like trump some some some media enterprise like
oan or fox news come along and tell me everything
i want to hear and tell me how i can
avoid facing the truth that's the function you're going to
serve in my life and i will happily vote for
you i will be your most rabid supporter this is
the republican party in a nutshell and it's all blowing
up in their face it's literally destroying [ __ ]
democracy this is how democracy is destroyed by people who
don't want to face the truth the changing reality you
know the changing reality of a globalizing world the changing
reality that america is not the best country in the
world anymore the changing reality that many other countries in
the world have better health care systems have better economic
systems have better human rights have better education systems have
better governments have less corruption the reality that the climate
is changing and that we can't keep polluting the way
we've been polluting for the last hundred years the reality
we have to wean ourselves off of oil the reality
that our military interventions abroad and american empire that has
uh been functioning for the last 50 to 100 years
that that is also unsustainable the reality that leeching resources
through capitalism from third world countries via imperial exploitation the
way that america has been doing for the last you
know 80 years or so that that that is also
unsustainable and that that basically is devilry see the republican
party doesn't want to face these things the reality that
our politicians are so corrupt and bought out by uh
you know capitalism run amok through unlimited campaign donations and
so forth and lobbying and that these things need to
change uh the the the the truth the difficult truth
that the constitution as it was formed by our founding
fathers is no longer completely relevant and sufficient to address
the problems that we have in society today thanks to
technology and other factors and changing culture that that the
constitution itself has to change new amendments have to be
passed the constitution needs to be rethought like conservatives do
not want to face any of these and so we
have the problems that we have now again this does
not mean that democrats and progressives don't also have certain
delusions they do they also avoid certain difficult truths they
do socialists avoid difficult truths too they do but it's
it's particularly toxic right now within the republican party it
doesn't have to be that way they could change but
it's going to be a cold day in hell before
they change they keep doubling and tripling down another example
for you at a collective level is with china and
the authoritarian censorship that's going on in china like literally
think about what's going on in china in china the
chinese communist party is so afraid of facing truth that
they have created their own private sort of internet and
cut off the chinese population from the world wide web
as as it exists for most other countries and folk
around the world because they're too afraid of what their
population would read if they could access easily access the
world wide web so instead china has their own sort
of like curated private chinese internet where it's super censored
and um you you can't really get the facts about
certain historical situations certain atrocities things that are actually have
happened within china like tiananmen square and so forth and
so what is that fundamentally it's an avoidance of truth
and you can tell that that's unsustainable there is no
way in hell that you can sustain that for a
hundred years there's no way that that that that that
is going to be the ultimate state of the chinese
society is that that is going to hold it's not
going to hold these are temporary stop-gap measures to allow
certain chinese you know communist leaders to stay in power
but eventually it's all going to collapse that's not going
to work eventually china is going to have to open
up to the world wide web without the censorship that
they're doing right now without all their sort of firewalls
and blockades and and so forth and that's going to
be a very difficult situation for them when that bubble
bursts when chinese people finally get access to the world
wide web and they learn about the truth of many
things that they were denied um they're gonna they're gonna
be pissed off they're gonna rise up there's going to
be revolutions and revolts and political stability and chaos which
is exactly why the chinese communists are so scared of
giving them access to the world wide web and in
general this is how all tyrants are tyrants have to
control information very tightly in their society because if they
let information flow freely then people will realize that the
tyrant is abusing the population at large and they will
organize and they will overthrow the tyrant this is how
it's always been this is why tyrants are so tyrannical
and very touchy about letting people organize or speak to
each other or just even speak truthfully about historical events
or things that are happening within the country because fundamentally
tyranny and authoritarianism and totalitarianism is founded on falsehood it's
devilry so of course the devil's number one job is
to prevent the spreading of truth because as soon as
truth spreads too much then devilry becomes untenable so delusion
and falsehood always has a serious cost but the cost
is usually delayed so here's a principle of life for
you is that you cannot get away with falsehood forever
it's going to come back it's going to come back
and bite you so uh part of developing the good
life is having a long time horizon looking into the
future and not just you know into the near term
and and therefore by looking into the far term you
start to take truth seriously as a value even when
almost nobody else around you does and almost nobody arou
else around you will you will automatically make yourself unique
and different by seriously valuing truth and committing your life
to that people around you are not going to applaud
you for doing this for the most part um they're
going to be resentful they're going to be bitter they're
going to lash out at you and they're going to
try to like you know crabs in the bucket they're
going to try to pull you back in the bucket
as you're crawling out they're going to try to pull
you back into their fantasies and their delusions and their
falsehoods and you need to have the conviction to crawl
out of that bucket despite people pulling down on you
that's why it's so difficult that's why there there's so
few truthful people out there and um you know rarely
when you see a very truthful person as a leader
he or she has a has a challenging life and
they get a lot of stones thrown at them they
even get killed and assassinated or imprisoned by uh by
their fellow man why because i mean truth tellers have
to be killed and imprisoned because otherwise they're going to
spoil the fantasy of society at large so there is
a pain in proactively seeking out truth every day but
this pain is relatively minor and manageable compared to the
pain of avoiding truth for decades and letting that fall
asl and delusion snowball it's better to pay the cost
a bit every single day than it is to have
it all blow up in your face a decade later
so rather than avoiding the relationship problems that exist in
your marriage day after day after day and just sweeping
them under the rug for a decade until your marriage
just becomes completely toxic and untenable and ends up in
a nasty divorce rather than doing it that way how
about you just proactively work on being more truthful in
your marriage all the time then maybe you can actually
have a successful marriage a decade later you see but
that requires you actually doing work and incurring a little
bit of sting every single day within your marriage uh
you know most people just want to like have marriage
be easy and then if you do it that way
that it's gonna blow up in your face so start
to notice where in your life you avoid facing truth
notice the excuses and defense mechanism your mind employs to
avoid facing truth study these defense mechanisms within yourself and
other people and go against the force of primordial avoidance
you have a primordial avoidance of truth and there's a
very deep spiritual metaphysical reason for why that is because
your entire identity is a fantasy and a falsehood your
human identity your finite identity so use introspection to notice
and feel that primordial avoidance of truth within you here
are some powerful questions for you to contemplate that will
help you to do this to stop avoiding truth so
question number one is where am i avoiding truth question
number two how am i avoiding truth number three how
can i become more truthful number four on a scale
of one to ten how much do i value truth
in every situation number five how could i increase my
valuing of truth number six what costs have i paid
for avoiding truth you want to reach a level not
just where you accept truth begrudgingly but where you actually
start to love truth and you start to love this
entire process of seeking the truth unraveling the truth and
you even develop a sort of a more sophisticated mind
and palate shall we say for the bittersweet aspects of
pursuing the truth it's like you feel that sting but
it's sort of like when you're going to the gym
you know when you first start going to the gym
that that burn in your muscles you feel when you're
pumping iron as they say is um it's kind of
uncomfortable and painful and you want to avoid it but
really to be a successful weight lifter you got to
do sort of like the arnold thing where you flip
that around you actually you actually turn turn that that
you know that that sting of stretching your muscles and
really working your muscles to exhaustion you have to turn
that sting and that burn into something you love and
then you can become a successful weight lifter well it's
the same thing with truth i want you to envision
10 20 years from now you're gonna reach a point
in this process of you know pursuing truth so much
on a daily weekly monthly yearly decade-long basis that you
reach a point a decade from now where you're just
like you actually are in love with tracking down the
truth in every situation in life that you're in and
you've built up such a momentum of doing this as
though you've been going to the gym really hard every
single day for a decade that now you're so strong
your capacity to handle truth is so strong that you're
becoming untouchable it becomes difficult for anything in reality to
phase you anymore because you're just you're so you're so
good at stomaching truth to the point where rather than
it hurting you or offending you or triggering you or
causing you to be afraid or to recoil or to
to turn into some sort of victim you're so strong
that it actually it expands you and it deepens your
love for reality and it is your spiritual path and
process try to imagine how good that would feel how
strong you would feel how grounded you would feel how
reliable you would be as a human being how much
others would look up to you and depend on you
and trust your leadership if you develop this capacity but
you're only going to develop this capacity from a sort
of a daily weekly practice for years and years and
years and decades here's a question for you what are
all the areas in your life where you have been
avoiding facing the truth sit down with that one for
uh for an hour just contemplate sit down with a
piece of paper and a notepad and just contemplate that
for an hour make a long list and then also
ask yourself why have you been avoiding truth in all
these areas and of course the answer is fear you
fear what you will find if you go looking at
the truth you fear that the truth will shatter your
fantasies and you don't want to give those up now
you might say leo but i thought you said love
was the highest value and now it seems like you're
talking about truth as being the highest value which is
it well of course like i said before truth is
love and love is truth so they're identical and they're
both the highest value to understand this go check out
my episodes what is love part one part two and
other episodes where i talk about love but in a
nutshell basically it works like this to value truth is
to love a thing exactly as it is that's the
connection between love and truth it's not really enough just
to like i said before begrudgingly open yourself to certain
difficult truths you really gotta love the truth you're opening
up to to value truth requires acceptance and surrender to
a thing to value truth is to is to see
the beauty in the way a thing actually is rather
than your fantasy or desire for how it should be
in order to suit you so as you grow and
develop this muscle over the decades ultimately the whole point
of all this what it's all going to cultivate cultiva
culminate in it's all going to culminate in you being
so strong and so accepting and so open to reality
that you will see things exactly as they are you
will cut through all the [ __ ] and you're
going to be in love with that and you're going
to be in love with reality exactly as it is
and that is the highest power and the greatest gift
is to see the beauty in things exactly as they
are rather than in how you need them to be
for your petty selfish purposes you see and that's the
ultimate strength because what you'll find is that reality rarely
aligns with what you need it to be but reality
is always identical to what it is how it is
for itself rather than for you and so if you
could just start to love reality not for how it
serves you but for how it actually is then in
a certain sense you've conquered the whole challenge of reality
now you can be filled with love because if if
your sort of conception of love is that reality has
to be the way i want it to be and
then only then will i love it then you're gonna
hate life that's a recipe for hatred of life but
if instead you say ah that's not going to work
because i got a bunch of finite fantasies and i'm
a selfish biased [ __ ] so i shouldn't expect
reality to to suit you know my my selfish biases
and instead what i'm going to do is i'm going
to i'm going to transform myself and expand myself in
order to suit reality as it actually is your reward
for doing that will be endless love you're going to
literally fall in love with reality and reality is such
a gargantuan and stark thing that it's difficult to fall
in love with it that's the challenge that's the whole
challenge of life how do you fall in love with
life exactly as it is that's the challenge that's what
all spirituality boils down to that's the core of spirituality
the less truthful you are the more fearful you're going
to be so another benefit of pursuing truth for decades
is that you're going to become fearless the more fantasies
you subscribe to the more truth will threaten you this
creates avoidance dynamics within you and it creates dysfunctional patterns
within you and then living with these avoidance dynamics and
dysfunctional patterns this is not a pleasant life this is
not the good life and in general whenever you experience
fear this is a clue to falsehood fear betrays falsehood
in a situation if you're afraid of something then that's
a that's your clue that somehow you're not seeing the
truth of the situation because the truth is that all
fear is coming from bias and from selfishness fear is
not inherent to reality fear is your response to reality
not suiting your own selfish needs here's a list of
common ways that people avoid truth religion science philosophy drugs
and alcohol food media entertainment video games humor comedy sex
relationships romance socialization family work career business making yourself very
busy communities tribes groups and cults you fear facing truth
because what it might mean for how you must restructure
your life see that's the that's the rub here is
that when you commit yourself to facing truth all the
time that truth is like a signal it's feedback basically
from from the universe it's a it's a feedback mechanism
from the universe that is telling you how you need
to realign your life and then if you do that
and you listen to those messages and you keep realigning
and realigning and realigning your life more and more and
more with truth you have to restructure your life that's
difficult but if you keep doing that work then this
is how you build the good life so to speak
so for example you fear quitting your career if you
realize that your career isn't serving the highest good you
have to quit you fear ending a relationship if you
fully see the dysfunction in the relationship you fear giving
up a guilty pleasure you fear giving up your coping
mechanisms you fear losing your religion you fear giving up
signs and rationality you fear admitting you've been wrong you
fear admitting you were a fool you fear your true
motivations you fear admitting your dark side you fear looking
at your own selfishness and devilry of how you contribute
to corruption and evil you fear doing serious work you
want to be lazy you fear realizing that you're not
as developed as you thought you were that you're not
as spiritual as you thought you were you fear seeing
how you've been using spirituality to actually boost your ego
and to be more of a devil you fear realizing
how much time you've wasted in your life doing stupid
selfish things you fear seeing the collateral damage of your
actions and way of life you fear empathizing with the
suffering of others you fear not knowing and uncertainty you
fear facing your biases and hypocrisy and giving that up
and by forcing yourself to confront the truth on a
daily basis it's going to force you to realign your
life restructure your life in all these different ways and
then your life will become wholesome and pure and then
you will fall in love with life and you will
you will see the beauty of life because you will
realize that the whole the whole secret to living a
good life always was living in truth and the reason
your life is so dysfunctional and problematic is that you
were not living in truth and nobody in society really
showed you how or told you the importance of aligning
your life with truth you were just living for convenience
for comfort for the easy life for pleasure just kind
of like going along with the herd and as it
turns out you can't live a good life that way
surprise surprise a good life must be built on a
foundation of truth but society is mostly built on and
run on illusions fantasies and convenient constructions so society and
culture will pull you towards falsehood therefore a life based
on truth is going to be rare and difficult because
you're going to have to go against the grain of
society and culture it's going to require independence of mind
and courage and it's going to require fearlessness society and
following the herd will not make you a truthful person
uh and therefore people who are blind followers don't ever
tend to have great lives notice that the history of
mankind is the history of games played to avoid and
suppress truth ask yourself why why has this been a
recurring pattern throughout human history regardless of culture regardless of
what continent it's happening on what regardless of what age
whether it was a hundred years ago or a thousand
years ago or five thousand years ago this is the
recurring pattern of human history avoiding and suppressing truth entire
careers are made out of suppressing and distorting truth and
these careers are some of the most lucrative ask yourself
why is suppression of truth so lucrative why are people
willing to pay so much money for the suppression of
truth we've spoken about devilry in the past and here
i want to give you a different or another angle
on what devilry is you can define devilry as an
elaborate means of avoiding truth devilry is a collection of
mental gymnastics that are performed in order to avoid truth
another aspect of not avoiding truth is intellectual integrity maybe
i'll shoot a whole episode about this in the future
on intellectual integrity but intellectual integrity is crucial and basically
a lot of people simply don't have intellectual integrity and
those people who do not have intellectual integrity do not
deserve to be taken seriously at all a lot of
people in the news or in the media or public
intellectuals and so forth they simply don't have sufficient intellectual
integrity to be deserving of being listened to seriously so
you should become good at judging a person's intellectual integrity
and if you realize that a person has low intellectual
integrity you simply stop listening to that person and taking
anything they say seriously you immediately dismiss that person because
if you take that if you take the words and
ideas of people with no intellectual integrity seriously actually what
you're doing is you're opening yourself up to devilry you're
literally listening to a devil this is why someone like
trump you know who has zero intellectual integrity he needs
to be dismissed immediately from from public consciousness and from
public intellectual like um discussion like nothing out of his
mouth should be taken seriously or should have been taken
seriously basically from day one as he announced to be
president his intentions to be president because it was very
obvious from from immediately when he you know when he
slid down that escalator to announce his run for president
back in like 2000 what it was 15 14 i
don't know what it was back then like to anyone
who takes truth seriously it was immediately obvious that he
had zero intellectual integrity that was obvious before he even
became president and yet people still listen to him and
and took him seriously and people still listen to him
and take him seriously as though like things he says
should be taken seriously like no no a person with
zero intellectual integrity if you take that such a person
seriously you're just allowing him to gaslight you that's all
you're doing you're debasing yourself you're basically allowing this person
to intellectually abuse you don't don't allow that have have
higher standards there's a lot of people in the world
who you know talk about stuff but they shouldn't be
taken seriously at all for example the hosts of you
know fox news they have zero intellectual integrity so that
means anything out of their mouths should not be taken
seriously ever at all like that person is done like
in my mind these people are done like never in
my life would i ever listen to anything that comes
out of their mouth seriously it's not serious they're [
__ ] clowns they have zero intellectual integrity so what
are you listening to they're [ __ ] devils again
this is not limited to any one political party you
can find people with low intellectual integrity you know wherever
it's not confined to one party this is not a
partisan discussion just look for people with low intellectual integrity
and do not listen to them ever in your life
because they're they're only going to corrupt your mind so
if society seduces us away from the truth is there
a proper function to society or to a community what
would a what would a healthy society or community look
like well actually there is a a proper function which
is that in a healthy community the community can work
to assist each other in keeping ourselves honest because it's
difficult actually to keep yourself honest other people can be
valuable mirrors to show you your own deceptions and dishonesty
they can give you different perspectives so you're not locked
into your little you know paradigm so that is possible
unfortunately our society right now is sort of like the
opposite of that it's not a healthy community it's a
very toxic and dysfunctional community where actually we're not so
much helping to keep ourselves honest we're actually bullshitting ourselves
collectively if you avoid truth for years and decades then
it's going to make it almost impossible to phase the
longer you avoid it the worse it becomes and then
you become a wretched person don't become that wretch catch
yourself in the moment when you're avoiding the truth and
stop yourself and the cost for the highest life is
facing the pain the fear and the inconvenience of facing
truth this is a lifelong commitment you can begin right
now to start cultivating a love for truth and that's
what i suggest and the upside is that by facing
truth every day in small ways you will become extremely
grounded solid real unshakable powerful free of drama happy and
healthy and the most powerful way that i have personally
discovered for facing truth the most direct way is a
combination of psychedelics and contemplation when you combine psychedelics and
contemplation it will reveal to you all of your lies
if you have that intention if you have actually the
intention of pursuing truth now a lot of people who
take psychedelics they don't really contemplate much and a lot
of people think psychedelics they're not interested in truth very
much so it actually is possible to take psychedelics and
still be diluted and have all sorts of problems and
dysfunctions but if you have that intention if you listen
to this episode psychedelics plus plus contemplation as a combination
that is a crazy powerful tool and if you trip
hundreds of times throughout the next decade and you contemplate
and you are pursuing the truth then basically all of
your lies and fantasies will be laid out before you
because some truths and some some lies and fantasies are
so deep that it's really honestly it's difficult to access
them in in a sober state so this is one
of the prime functions of psychedelics psychedelics are truth revealing
and this is why psychedelics are outlawed and demonized by
society at large because society at large is in the
business of constructing fantasies so truth revealing substances this this
is the most this is the most dangerous thing to
a toxic and uh self-deceived society and what is the
ultimate truth that you're avoiding what does all this culminate
and all these little truths don't they culminate in some
ultimate thing that you're avoiding well of course the ultimate
thing you're avoiding is love love as i've defined it
elsewhere um i'm going to give this definition to you
again it's a very profound definition love is the realization
that there is no difference between anything so that's what
you're actually avoiding you're avoiding realizing that there is no
difference between anything and this is the same as to
say that you're avoiding infinite selflessness because if you realize
that there was no difference between anything then it wouldn't
matter what any anything that happened then you would be
infinitely selfless so that's what you're avoiding or in other
words you're avoiding god because that's what god is all
fear is fear of the infinite self and the infant
itself is just identical to truth and to love here
are some questions to help you face the truth how
am i being selfish how am i being biased how
am i avoiding truth how is fear and greed limiting
my love what trauma am i avoiding facing what am
i avoiding facing because i fear it what if true
would i find impossible to accept how am i avoiding
admitting i was wrong what parts of myself are untruthful
what parts of myself am i afraid to surrender which
of my behavior patterns are fundamentally misaligned with truth what
changes can i make to my life to align it
more with truth contemplate all those questions with a notepad
answer them there's a good book that i recommend that
will supplement the things i said in this episode called
radical honesty it's on my book list check that out
but the trick with that book is that you read
that book and you start to think well i should
be very honest with everybody i talk to like really
vulnerable that's not the key though the key is not
being honest with others the key is really being honest
with yourself that's the key that's more important than telling
people your your deepest secrets that's not what i'm telling
you to do here really um you don't need to
tell people your deepest secrets um you can keep some
of your secrets to yourself but what's important is that
you don't keep secrets from your own self and i
want to give you one warning here one mistake that
people commonly make is that when we talk about facing
the truth by facing the truth i am not here
giving you license to use truth as a weapon or
a bludgeon against others be careful here this is a
easy trap to fall into because you might think ah
okay leo leo said i fear the truth so now
i gotta go you know tell the truth to to
everybody and so um you know let's say oh that
girl has a big nose normally i wouldn't tell her
she has a big ugly nose but i'm going to
go tell her the truth because leo told me to
be truthful so you walk up to this girl and
you say you have a big ugly nose and you
make her cry and you say yeah i did it
i told the truth i'm courageous and strong it's like
no that's not what i told you to do see
in this case you're you're using truth as a bludgeon
against others you've weaponized it as you yourself face more
and more difficult truths and it stings you and it
burns you you realize how difficult it is to face
truth you also gain an appreciation that you can use
truth to burn others and that this is not in
alignment with the highest truth and love and so you
have to appreciate that different people are at different levels
of capacity for tolerating truth and so as you raise
your capacity you know you go up here you can
let's say bench press 500 pounds after a decade of
pursuing truth in this process but then most people are
going to be down here they can't even bench press
a hundred pounds so when you throw 500 pounds at
them you're actually going to hurt them and you got
to be cognizant of that so realize that there are
certain truths that you're going to become very comfortable with
at an advanced level of this work but then you
should not go bludgeoning others with that truth instead you
got to appreciate that people are at different levels of
their development and that you should only give people as
much truth as you think would be of benefit to
them this is actually in alignment with the highest love
the highest love is not to bludgeon people with truth
to make them cry about it and to to make
them traumatized with you know scary things uh the highest
love is to like stretch them try to open them
to higher truths try to stretch them but don't just
don't traumatize them with truth because you can traumatize people
with challenging truths and your ego can grab hold of
truth and use it as a weapon against others and
then that becomes actually untruthful you'll realize later that that
itself was untruthful and so finally i want to leave
you with this is a quotation from david hawkins the
late great david hawkins spiritual teacher he says quote healing
always involves facing truths we'd rather not face and accepting
responsibility we'd rather not accept end quote and that is
because truth is health there's a profound connection between truth
and health and falsehood and dysfunction or disease and i've
actually talked about that in my videos see my videos
called holism and holistic thinking holism and holistic thinking part
one and part two where i give you sort of
a master equation about equating holism with health with truth
with love and healing and and more there's a it's
a big equation i told you that was a very
profound that was a very profound equation that you need
to you know write down and to memorize and use
that for the rest of your life and so here
you're seeing that recurring again the connection between truth and
health and so how can you have the good life
if you're not healthy and by health i don't just
mean physical health i also mean mental spiritual health health
in all the ways i even mean health in terms
of our society the institutions you're a part of the
relationships that you're part of like is your marriage healthy
is your relationship with your children healthy is the corporation
that you're a part of is that healthy is the
nation that you're a citizen of is that a healthy
nation a healthy society is the religion that you're a
part of or the spiritual group that you're part of
is that a healthy group see is your emotional system
healthy are your finances healthy is your relationship to money
healthy is your relationship to sex healthy is your relationship
with psychedelics healthy see is your relationship to other people
healthy so the good life would have you having health
in all those areas and the only way you're going
to get health in all those areas of course it
also means physical health too what you eat how you
take care of your body to be healthy in all
these different areas how can you achieve that without truth
can you see that so there you go i hope
that all makes sense happy new year 2022 is here
it's coming and i don't know yet we'll see what
kind of uh interesting topics lie ahead you
