hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to be talking about mastering your emotions
part one this is a very important video that I've
been meaning to shoot now for a while and I
wanted to do it right so I decided to split
it up into a couple of parts here and basically
what we're gonna be talking about in this series is
getting you a much deeper understanding of your emotions helping
you to build an emotional vocabulary and getting you to
understand how emotions function in your life the thing that
really inspired me and kind of prompted me to want
to shoot this video is because you know I work
with clients in coaching sessions and one of the things
I discover with clients is that when I try to
get them to talk about their emotions they usually end
up drawing a blank and what this shows me is
that they have a very very very very limited emotional
vocabulary and so I started thinking like oh man you
know it's hard to even coach these people because they
can't even assign just basic labels to the feelings that
they have in their body in different situations in their
lives and because of this they're basically unconscious to what's
happening in their body and how these emotions are dominating
and controlling their lives and so what I find is
that in general most people are this way most people
have poor emotional vocabulary they don't have a rich diversity
of emotions that they're able to feel and they're able
to identify they're not really able to talk about the
emotions that they have which creates problems and in general
most people are quite clueless about what emotions are and
exactly how they function so I wanted to dive into
that here basically what we're talking about here throughout this
whole series videos is emotional intelligence e.q and I have
another video that talks about emotional intelligence that introduces that
topic more on point I'm not going to be too
focused on emotional intelligence other than to show you that
basically what emotional intelligence is is what we're going to
be talking about here and this these videos here show
you kind of how to develop emotional intelligence and basically
they've done studies and they've they found that a lot
of the greatest character traits that correlates with success and
fulfillment in life is high EQ not IQ not logical
rational intelligence but emotional intelligence now why is this and
why is this whole topic important well basically unconsciously emotions
run pretty much your entire life emotions unconsciously pretty much
generate all of your results in life all the stuff
that you think you do consciously and deliberately and rationally
and logically well you're deluding yourself about much of that
actually it's your emotions that are running those behaviors so
the most important element of all this here is that
emotions generate behaviors for most people and because of this
this creates a lot of unrest or SFIL problematic behaviors
and then you can get stuck in these behavior loops
which don't get you the results that you want so
one problem here is that many people are not able
to identify emotions properly they just don't have the words
and the labels to even talk about them that's the
big problem another problem that people have is that we
generally don't understand what the messages of our emotions are
did you know that an emotion can be a message
it can carry a concert's message with it so that
you can take the message of the emotion and not
need to react like an animal just against the fee
the sensation so most people don't know which emotions have
which messages that's going to be what part two is
going to be about I'll tell you exactly which messages
you need to know for some of the most common
emotions that you'll encounter in life and another problem that
I see is that people are not able to get
coached or they're not able to get therapy because they're
not able to express their emotions and delve into their
emotions which is necessary for successful coaching and so when
you combine all this stuff together basically what you get
is terrible results in life and you also get much
needless suffering so wouldn't it be nice if we can
address some of this here so you can avoid all
this needless suffering and before I go and start talking
about what emotions are just one word of warning if
you think that you're watching this video and you think
well Leo I'm not a very emotional person I mean
maybe some people are emotional or maybe you're talking about
like what you're talking about here is going to be
helpful for women because there are more emotional creatures but
like I'm this strong stoic guy I don't need all
this emotional talk I don't need to label my emotions
and feel into my emotions this is a not the
way that I live life well if you're telling yourself
that you're not an emotional creature even if you're the
most stoic macho guy in the world then actually what
that means to me is that you're completely clueless about
the role that emotions play in your life you're just
unconscious to it you're so unconscious that you don't even
realize that emotions are a critical pillar like the backbone
of your entire life even if you're the most stoic
macho guy so don't think that you're not an emotional
creature we're all very very emotional creatures so if we
say that women are more emotional than men yes that's
true generally speaking as a stereotype but that doesn't mean
that meant that men are not still highly emotional we're
all very highly emotional and we're mostly like machines running
on emotions that's mostly what a human being is is
an emotional machine in action cycling through emotions over and
over and over and over and over again so open
your mind to this all right if you want to
get to the highest levels of your potential in life
and if you want to self actualize you're not going
to be able to do it by ignoring emotions you're
going to have to really study the hell out of
them to master them so anyways that was just a
warning so what are emotions emotions are kind of my
definition are a matrix of feelings in your body a
rich complex matrix of feelings so just one emotion let's
say we take a common one like anger right what
is anger anger is a label in our English language
that we assign to what we assign it to a
certain collection of sensations in our body and also in
the mind and this is a lot more rich and
complex then you would initially believe it to be sometimes
we can look at anger and we can say oh
anger yeah I know what anger is very obvious but
actually hold on a second maybe it's not so obvious
have you actually felt into anger to see what it's
really about have you wondered why the anger is arising
and what it's prompting you to do have you looked
at the different shades and degrees of anger everything from
full-out violent rage to your typical anger to something like
a mild frustration or an annoyance right there's various degrees
there and how each one of those it's not just
different in degree but it's also different qualitatively it feels
different it feels different in your body also not only
do you have a feeling in your body and those
feelings are very specific they can be located in specific
parts of your body like your chest or your abdomen
or your head or your throat or your arms or
your hands so you can have different feelings all throughout
your body but also you've got various internal mental chatter
that's happening in your mind and there's also a tonality
not only are there certain mental words that you're saying
when you're angry but also there's a tonality there's a
way in which you say them maybe it's an aggressive
violent sort of tonality so there's that and you got
to appreciate how this whole thing just kind of like
creates this big ball of what we might call anger
but underneath that label anger there's this very rich tapestry
of stuff going on and on top of all that
if that wasn't enough this emotion is not like a
fixed state it's like an animated dynamic flowing situation imagine
if someone took a syringe full of red paint and
then inject it into your veins like into your heart
stab you in the heart with it and then squeeze
that red paint in there now if you die from
that but assuming you didn't die and that red paint
would now dispersed and be carried by all the veins
into different parts of of your body and so you
can imagine that the paint is moving through your body
and it's affecting different parts of your body and it's
touching different parts of your body and your mind at
different times and then eventually you might imagine that it
dissipates from your system kind of like a cloud passing
through the air well that's kind of what an emotion
is right it's like this animated thing it's not that
you're just angry he said that anger starts to kind
of develop and grow and then it balloons and then
it has a peak and then it kind of has
its climax and then it starts to dissipate and then
slowly it gets out of your system and transforms and
melts into some other emotion maybe now sadness and then
that sadness takes over and then you have these waves
of emotions so emotions are not static things that's basically
what emotions are and the whole reasoning behind emotions is
that emotions are like a language they're like a language
of your body see if you're a rational logical person
you tend to think that well life is very rational
and logical and that stuff follows in a kind of
linear conscious sequence but what you fail to appreciate perhaps
is that actually before there was logic and before there
was rationality in the evolution of the human being and
in the evolution of mammals in general what you had
is you had a need for controlling how the organism
this machine functions and how do you do that well
you do that with a more primitive communication system and
also in a sense a much more complex and rich
and lightning-fast communication system than logical linear thinking so if
a tiger walks into the room it's not enough for
you to see the tiger and to think about the
tiger and say oh that's a tiger what if that
tiger bites me what if the tiger jumps on me
you know I've encountered Tigers before and I know that
they're scary ferocious animals so probably it's better if I
leave the room right that's not your reaction your reaction
before you can even label the thing a tiger immediately
your heart rate jumps up right Amil you've got this
feeling of adrenaline pumping through your body immediately you're gripped
by terror by fear like very visceral fear and immediately
your body is tensed up your skin tightens different muscles
in your body tighten immediately maybe you're already turning your
head and your body towards the nearest door or window
to jump about of the room so the emotions are
doing most of that work all that stuff happens in
just a few milliseconds and you don't even logically have
any clue what's going on here your body is already
in motion so this is happening thanks to your emotions
right so emotions are very powerful and they're the primary
source of motivation that you have running your life so
you see now why this becomes so important is because
your behaviors are very much influenced by emotions now it's
interesting that your behaviors don't have to always correlate and
be totally aligned with emotions you can actually go against
your initial emotional impulses and that's where kind of you
get into the battle between the logical brain and the
emotional brain or maybe something is telling you that this
thing is something you're supposed to be afraid of over
here but your logical mind can override that and say
well I guess I'm afraid but let me go pursue
it anyways maybe this is actually going to be beneficial
to me and it's there where you get into a
lot of the emotional problems that people face in life
and in a lot of the stuff that holds people
back from achieving them the goals and dreams that they
have in life is because you've got this tension going
on will to start to get a handle on how
all this works it's helpful to just get a layout
of the landscape and to see what kind of emotions
exist and is there like a rhyme and a reason
to these emotions is there a structure to these emotions
so one of things I want you to start to
recognize is that there are hundreds of emotions right and
emotion is this matrix of feelings and there's a lot
of different variety and subtlety in these matrixes of feelings
that you could have so what I want to do
here in this video really is I want to give
you a little overview of the landscape I want to
give you a taste of the different emotions that are
there and I also want to give you some categories
that I found helpful for me in my life to
get me an understanding and help increase my emotional intelligence
so what I'm going to be sharing with you here
in a minute is a model a structure for emotions
that comes from the Sedona Method now the Sedona Method
is a way of releasing emotions which I'm not going
to cover here it's a really great method if you
want to learn it but I'm just going to use
their model to kind of give you some categories like
a framework for understanding the different levels that emotions can
have so what you're going to notice here is I'm
going to be going through is you're gonna be noticing
that there's going to be about eight or so categories
and we're going to be talking about these categories in
order of ascending so we're going to start at the
most you might say negative most Unruh source phille emotional
states that you can have as a human being and
then we're going to move up the ladder to slightly
more and more resourceful and quote-unquote positive emotions okay and
I want you to also watch out for different degrees
of emotions within the category now we're going to be
doing a little sampling here like a little buffet right
but this is just a very little sampling there's a
lot more in fact each one of the categories I'm
going to tell you probably has at least a hundred
if not more different shades of emotion in it but
we're just going to be covering maybe four or five
per category so here's how this is going to work
I'm going to give you the category and I don't
want you to visualize the category but then what I
want you to do is I want to kind of
give you I want you to quickly visualize the emotion
within the category and actually if you want to get
the full value of this video what you're going to
do is you're going to listen to the whole video
then you're going to come back you're going to rewind
to this point here and you're going to re-listen slowly
to each emotion as I tell it to you and
you're going to pause and I want you to close
your eyes and I want you actually feel it remember
it recall how it was in your life because you
felt all these and then I want you to feel
it in your body and I want you to remember
what kind of sensations were going through your body where
in your body was this emotion being felt how is
this emotion different from a prior emotion and what is
going on in your mind when you're in the middle
of this emotion because the emotion is both the bodily
feeling and also the monkey chatter in your mind that's
going on at the same time and the monkey chatter
changes from emotion to emotion so anyways here we go
I'm going to go through this really fast now because
I don't always the whole hour I'm giving you time
to pause you're going to do that later on your
own as an exercise if you want to okay so
here we go the first category is called apathy and
this is the least resourceful state because it's very hard
to take any action from this state and here are
the specific emotions that I want you to kind of
quickly visualize one is depression feel yourself depressed the next
one is defeated feel yourself defeated the next one is
bored what's it like to feel bored and the next
one is lazy think of a time when you were
very lazy okay so we're going through really fast here
so you're not really going to get a good taste
of each one right now in your experience so I
really encourage you to go through again a second time
and really pause between them close your eyes and get
a full sense it might take you 30 seconds before
you get a full sense of something like depression or
something like boredom or laziness alright but it's worth doing
this because as you do this you're building your emotional
vocabulary right that's why I'm doing this segment here is
because I want you to get a taste for the
fact that there are these specific emotions that you have
that are very common but a lot of times you
don't label them and you just kind of skip over
them in your awareness so you kind of know what
laziness feels like but also you have no idea what
laziness feels like because probably for your entire life when
you felt lazy you've just kind of jumped over the
laziness you told yourself oh I'm lazy you told yourself
oughta want to be lazy you labeled it a bad
or a good emotion and then what you did is
you didn't actually feel into it you didn't actually identify
what is in your present awareness right this is called
practicing mindfulness which is a really huge thing I'm going
to talk about towards the end of the video so
anyways let's go on to the next category next category
is called grief which is one notch higher more resourceful
here you've got emotions like being sad hurt betrayed disappointed
and guilty so feel each one of those next we're
going to go to the next category which is fear
and here you have a lot of different types of
fear think about terror nervousness worry insecurity fear is an
interesting categories notice that you know we have the general
label fear but then you have a lot of different
specific types of fear which have various degrees of strength
but also qualitative differences from each other so for example
terror feels very different than insecurity in your body it
also comes with a very different mental chatter in your
mind so you want to become aware of what those
are for each label okay let's go to the next
category which is lust one step higher a little bit
more resourceful than fear within the lust category we have
things like craving possessiveness greed frustration you're going to want
to feel all those and compare and contrast those different
feelings the next category up from that is anger and
here we have stuff like disgusted pissed-off vengeful and annoyed
annoyed is an interesting one because it can be a
very subtle form of anger that you don't even recognize
as a form of anger interesting okay one level higher
than that we have the category of pride here we
have things like gloating feeling I see judgment or being
judgmental of someone else and arrogance so go ahead and
feel all those and compare those and the next category
is called courage here we have things like confident creative
happy and secure so feel all those notice that now
we're getting to the higher levels of this hierarchy and
that now at these levels were getting into actually what
you might call positive emotions emotions that you want more
of in your life also notice that the emotions that
are more quote-unquote positive that these seem to be emotions
that produce more resourceful behaviors and actions in you they're
less toxic they're less damaging they lead to less negative
fallout okay so let's move on to the next category
which called acceptance here you have emotions like compassion glowing
can you remember what it feels like to be glowing
loving and playful okay good so feel all those be
aware of all those different matrixes and lastly now we're
going to be moving to the last category which is
called peace this is a very interesting category which most
people don't even think about when they think about emotions
but actually this is perhaps the most powerful and important
category of all this is the place that you ultimately
want to get to with your self-actualization so here they
are within peace you've got stuff like awareness feeling aware
calm or tranquility feeling complete freedom feeling free and feeling
centered very interesting category in this category of peace so
there you have it you've got like eight or ten
categories I don't how many that was and just a
sampling remember this is a very small sampling like a
tip of the iceberg I could have given you probably
fifty and I'm not exaggerating fifty emotions within each category
so there's a lot of them right and they all
have their own subtle different tastes and flavors to them
almost like food okay so now what I want to
say about all this well I want to say that
emotions are both conscious and unconscious you can be conscious
and very aware of what's going on in your body
and in your mind and you can label it an
emotion like anger or fear or annoyance or or whatever
but most of the time I would say 98% of
the time you're actually not conscious of the emotions that
are coursing through your body and this presents a problem
so if you want to really improve the quality of
your life than what you want to do is you
want to become more and more conscious and aware of
exactly what's going on in your body one of the
problems that emotions create is that we label emotions as
either good or bad and actually what I want to
submit to you here is that emotions are neither good
nor bad and then in fact when you label it
emotion as good or bad this gets you into a
lot of trouble down the road it might seem like
something like anger or fear or jealousy or depression might
be an inherently bad and negative emotion which creates inherent
suffering but actually that's not the case that's an orientation
that you've just accepted as an assumption without really questioning
and looking into it when you really look at what
an emotion is all it is a sensation in your
body and a certain sensation in your mind that's all
it really is and no sensation is inherently good or
bad that's your mind coming in there and starting to
label stuff starting to judge stuff right and so one
of the things that usually happens the way that we're
being run by our emotions unconsciously is that some emotion
is coursing through our body we generally assume this emotion
is created by some negative external circumstance and then we
think that oh this emotion doesn't feel good anymore so
it's a bad emotion how do I get rid of
this emotion and then we just have a knee-jerk reaction
and we go do something to get rid of this
emotion and we don't actually feel the emotion we don't
notice the the richness and complexity of sensation and feeling
that exists there and so because of this we really
are like a puppet that's being controlled by some puppeteer
and we think that we're conscious throughout this whole process
but actually we're not that's the whole crazy thing about
unconsciousness is that unconsciousness doesn't feel like unconscious because whatever
little sliver of consciousness you have is all you think
that there is so if you're 1% conscious and 90%
99% unconscious you feel like you're 100% conscious which is
what gets most people into trouble right because we already
assume that we know this stuff and which is why
I want you to go back and to actually take
your time and feel each one of those emotions that
I described earlier because what you'll realize by doing that
exercise is oh I've never actually sat down and fully
felt what anger feels like or what annoyance feels like
I've never fully realized what jealousy actually is most of
my life what I've done is I've just run away
from these feelings or maybe I have run towards these
feelings generally the way emotions function is that they're like
carrots and sticks either they cause you to pursue something
or they cause you to avoid something and this is
like a very basic biological mechanism by which this organism
in the machine called the body controls your behaviors so
emotions you might imagine them they're kind of like magnets
right it's like a magnet that is polarized and it
pushes you away from something or it pulls you towards
something else and you know a magnetic field it's not
just like black and white it's got like it's almost
like a cloud of magnetic field so if you're within
you know the cloud you get pulled a little bit
more a little bit more than you get closer to
the magnet you get pulled even more so that's kind
of how emotions work they're not these black and white
things so it's not that when you're angry you necessarily
have to go punch someone in the face but you're
certainly much more likely to and so you kind of
gravitate towards that and when you're depressed it's not necessarily
the case you're going to shoot yourself in the head
and commit suicide but you're certainly much more likely to
you're kind of pulled in that direction right and the
same thing with the positive emotions so it's very interesting
how just how complex the human mind and organism is
and how these emotions are like these magnetic poles kind
of like guide you imagine like you're a fish swimming
through a river and you're like this fish that's matted
metal and in this river you've got this torrent coming
down at you but you're going forward and then you've
got these um these different magnets positioned in the river
and you're kind of moving towards one or moving away
from another and you're just kind of like snaking your
way through the river well that's basically a pretty accurate
description of what your your life is as a human
being an important thing to remember understand about emotions is
that really they're the language of the unconscious and the
subconscious mind because there's a lot of stuff that's happening
in your body at every millisecond of the day that
you don't need to be aware of and in fact
if you were consciously aware of all this stuff it
would probably fry your brain there's a lot of stuff
going on breathing heart beating temperature control of your body
of your blood you know your immune system is fighting
off pathogens and your cells are growing and rebuilding and
there's a lot of stuff happening there's a lot of
stuff that's being processing in your brain unconsciously right you're
recognizing shapes and faces and people you're remembering names and
you don't have any idea how this stuff is happening
well it's happening unconsciously for you right and your emotions
are like a language that kind of bridges the barrier
between total unconsciousness and then consciousness so it's kind of
like the bridge and so it's really helpful to learn
how to interpret and become more aware of your emotions
because your body's language primarily is not logic it's not
rationality it's not linear thinking it is emotions it's these
vague fields of emotions and moods so you can start
to see why it's so important to start to understand
the language of emotions it really is like learning language
one question that comes up when we start becoming more
aware emotions is we start to ask questions like well
these negative emotions that we have are these emotions necessary
so if I'm feeling angry or Rast does that mean
that I can get rid of those because I mean
they're creating certain behaviors aren't these healthy emotions aren't these
emotions necessary for my survival and see the interesting thing
is that your emotions are like a very baseline operating
system which keeps you alive and surviving and the negative
emotions are very powerful and they're very strong and they're
extremely well tuned to keeping you alive so if all
you want from your life is to be alive then
you can rely and trust your emotions completely because they'll
do an extremely good job at keeping you alive very
very good they'll also do an extremely good job at
making you reproduce so notice that these are the two
functions that evolution operates on right natural selection survival and
reproduction so in these domains you're going to do great
with emotions you don't even need to learn about emotions
you'll still do great most animals do great this way
and most you know primitive cultures and societies that don't
label emotions or whatever or don't even have us the
study of psychology they do find just fine they survive
great but if you want to take yourself to the
highest potential as a human being if you want to
self-actualize if you want to thrive if you want to
accomplish great things that most human beings are not able
to accomplish and if what you want is fulfillment and
deep lasting happiness in your life then you have to
start to unwire some of the more severe negative emotional
reactions that you have why is that well because that
whole system is tuned just to your survival it doesn't
really care about your happiness or fulfillment so for example
what it'll do is it'll make you worry and it'll
make you nervous about the most insignificant thing just because
that thing might potentially be a survival threat now your
conscious mind knows better it knows that that little thing
is not really a survival threat but see you're kind
of emotional mind doesn't really understand that and so what
its sides on you know it airs on the side
of saying you know what we're just going to interpret
that thing as a threat anyways and we're going to
have you react violently against it we're going to have
you worried and we're going to have you get depressed
and sad and angry about that thing but see you
can't really like build a happy positive resourceful life from
that kind of situation so what you want to do
ultimately you want to unwire that stuff and build in
conscious healthy reactions also you want to transition yourself away
from the lower-level categories of emotions we talked about stuff
like depression anger and fear and into stuff that's much
more a higher consciousness like peace and acceptance and creativity
and confidence and security in this kind of stuff so
that's that's the explanation of that also I think it's
very important that you start to realize that the thing
you really want the most in your life is the
emotions of peace acceptance and wholeness this might sound kind
of airy-fairy and new age and kind of fruity but
I guarantee that this is what you really want in
life you don't want a bigger house you don't want
a sexier wife you don't want more money in your
bank account you don't really want that new promotion what
you really want is you want peace acceptance and wholeness
because if you had these emotions running through your body
all the time you would be on cloud nine you
would be in heaven that's what heaven is it's interesting
though how society doesn't really tell you this it's also
interesting how it's very counter intuitive you don't really actively
tell yourself that what you really want in life is
you want these emotions here instead you turn it into
material objects or you turn it into you know promotions
or you turn into a better looking body or whatever
but you don't really want those things you want those
things so that they get you peace acceptance and wholeness
so wouldn't it be nice to recognize that it wouldn't
it be nice to chart a more direct course in
your life for getting these things rather than the roundabout
way that you'd go about now because you waste a
lot of time and energy and money and resources going
on a tangent rather than directly to your emotional objectives
and your objectives are emotional notice that - so when
you tell yourself that you're not a very emotional person
well actually you are because all your goals in life
ultimately are just pointing to these motions here what you
want what we're talking about here is your entire motivational
system in life right this is huge this is so
huge I hope you can start to appreciate this another
question that comes up when we start investigating emotions is
can emotions be controlled and if so how do I
control them because it sure does sound important that if
there's a way to control them then we want to
develop this way well emotions are a tricky thing and
you really can't control them directly and in fact what
is going on is that emotions are controlling you so
see your conscious mind it's not the primary thing it's
the thing that depends on everything else so your conscious
mind depends on a stable emotional system so you don't
have a conscious mind without emotions emotions come first they're
the base they're the foundation so um in a sense
the foundation controls what's above it it's kind of backwards
to have the thing on top control the thing on
bottom you might say it's unnatural but nevertheless you can
develop something like a pseudo control over your emotions this
is by not trying to control them directly and here
we get into the distinction between controlling your emotions and
mindfulness mindfulness is the key to emotional control I have
a video on mindfulness you might want to watch that
goes in-depth about how that works but here what I'm
going to tell you is that basically the power of
mindfulness is simply that you just watch the emotion and
you don't try to control it at all and very
counter intuitively and paradoxically what happens is that the better
you become at seeing exactly what your emotions are the
more aware the more conscious you become then the less
your emotions dominate your awareness unless they control you and
you can get to such high levels of mindfulness that
basically you're able to exert almost a supernatural control over
your emotions but in fact all you're doing is you're
just looking at them it's a very interesting encounter intuitive
technique - is a whole field of study you could
spend the next 20 or 30 or 40 years of
your life practicing developing mindfulness but I'm just going to
give you a couple of quick ideas and a couple
of tips here so number one for starting to develop
mindfulness which by the way if you haven't realized yet
is what we're doing in this video right by getting
you more awareness this already is building mindfulness but you
also want to be practicing it in the moment so
the first thing you should do is you should stop
judging your emotions and you should stop labeling them as
good or bad this is actually false emotions are not
good or bad so mindfulness is about seeing emotions as
they are and no emotion is good and bad in
itself and the other component of mindfulness is to feel
your emotions physically through the body really take the time
maybe even close your eyes stop yourself feel through it
this is very a North DOX we almost never do
this because we usually are just reacting to the emotion
and if it's a bad emotion we just want it
to go away it never occurs to us that we
can just stop and look at it and that looking
at it is the best way of managing it in
fact this stopping and looking is so unorthodox for you
it's going to be so unconventional that it's going to
take you a lot a lot a lot of practice
years of practice to retrain your brain from just reaction
to emotions and being able to just stop look at
it feel it notice what's going on in your mind
and in your body and don't try to control it
because what your minds going to be telling you is
that wait a minute let me try to control this
if it's a bad emotion I should control it and
stop it right that's the right thing to do or
I should guilt myself about it and tell myself that
all it's a bad emotion why am I having this
bad emotion I shouldn't be having a bad emotion right
now but see what this does is this is just
a reaction to the emotion which just creates more emotions
and it just feeds into it increase this cyclone of
of emotions and so there's no consciousness there no consciousness
at all even though it might feel like you're trying
to control stuff you're really not so in practice what's
going to happens you can forget you're going to forget
to practice mindfulness you're going to forget to stop and
experience the emotion without controlling it and you're going to
do this again and again and again and again and
again and again for a long long time before you
finally learn that you actually need to stop don't label
it good or bad and just feel it but you
know what go ahead and start practicing practice makes perfect
so I recommend you start practicing now because it'll take
you a while to get hang of it and in
fact what I want to wrap up on here is
I'm going to give you an exercise I'm going to
give you really handy exercise for how to practice mindfulness
the biggest problem with mindfulness the reason people don't develop
it is simply because they forget to practice it because
it's so easy to forget so here's the exercise for
you what I want you to do is watch get
your smartphone on the phone I want you to create
an alarm this alarm will be a whole series of
alarms for an entire week so what's going to happen
here is that you're going to create an alarm that
rings three hours after you normally wake up and then
three hours after that and then three hours after that
and three hours after that and three hours after that
so it's going to ring five maybe six or seven
times depending how long you stay awake it's going to
ring let's say five times at least throughout your day
it's going to ring wince alarm rings what I want
you to do is I want you to stop whatever
you're doing I want you to get a special journal
you're going to keep a little journal just for this
exercise and you're going to write down exactly what your
emotion is in the moment whatever it is if you're
pissed off and it's a very strong emotion good feel
that notice what's going on your body notice what's going
on in your mind first just take 30 seconds to
notice it then actually write down what you discovered if
you don't have a strong emotion which will probably be
the case most times then write down whatever emotion you
do have you always have some sort of emotion coursing
through your body even if it's just a very very
subtle emotion and maybe all you're feeling right now is
just you feel uncomfortable or maybe you're feeling a little
uneasy or maybe you're feeling a little bit annoyed just
a little bit whatever it is feel it notice it
and then write it down and you're going to do
this for a whole week so it's going to be
seven straight days of this alarm going off and that's
it at the end of this week which are going
to notice if you do this exercise as I told
you and you don't slack off on it you'll notice
that you've developed a lot of emotional awareness which wasn't
there before and what I encourage you to do from
that point on is just to continue with the process
even if you don't use an alarm anymore I want
you to continue with the process of feeling into the
emotion getting curious about what the emotion actually is not
trying to control anything and I be writing stuff that
stuff down in a journal or a diary so that
you're um you're forcing yourself to use language to clarify
add precision to your awareness what this does is this
builds awareness and when you develop more awareness you develop
higher EQ and when you develop higher EQ you start
to master your emotions and when you start to master
your emotions you start to master your whole life how's
that how's that coming full circle all right so what
are we doing here with actual eyes that work we're
helping you to master your life how do we do
that by mastering your psychology and how do we do
that well a big chunk of it is mastering your
emotions so go ahead and take this exercise very seriously
do it religiously and you'll see some cool results all
