[Music] you in this episode we're going to be really
talking about two topics in one I wanted to shoot
two separate episodes here one on the topic of how
to escape wage slavery and a second one on a
related topic that I called society as a pyramid scheme
but these are two such related topics so interlinked that
you need to hear them both together because they they
work off of each other so the two takeaways that
I want you to remember from this episode is that
firstly your wage slave and secondly that society is a
pyramid scheme but just what that means requires a bit
of explanation because people are really in denial about this
and it's a pretty it's one of those bitter pills
that a lot of people don't like to understand so
first what you gotta understand is that slavery is a
really pernicious thing people think that all well slavery if
I was a slave I would just escape no you
wouldn't because when you're a slave you don't know you're
a slave uh-huh you get that people overlook the obvious
here if you're really a slave you don't know that
you're a slave so it can take you many decades
many years before you have the epiphany the insight that
oh I'm a slave oh then you can escape but
that point reaching that insight that takes a lot of
work so that's what we'll be working towards here today
what do I mean by wage slavery I mean a
very pernicious thing that's widespread throughout our society I mean
doing meaningless work just to pay the bills going to
a grinding 95 job that you don't really value having
an impact on the world you don't know what it
is or why you're doing it but you're doing it
because you have to do it because you got to
feed yourself feed your family pay the bills keep the
electricity run and that's how you basically go through life
under this situation you're unable to contribute to society in
any meaningful creative way because you're doing this grinding work
for somebody else and you are cornered by needs to
pay bills you have no capital which you can use
to pursue your own passion or life purpose you have
no chance at reeducation no chance for doing personal development
or spiritual development and so you get stuck you get
stuck being someone else's puppet doing unconscious work for them
spending your entire life the majority of your life doing
unconscious work and spreading evil why spreading evil because when
you're working for somebody else doing grinding work it's not
just that you're doing boring grinding work for them you're
actually helping them to climb this pyramid scheme which is
society I'll get to that a little bit later and
explain what that is but you're helping them to climb
that you're not helping them to really raise consciousness or
to improve mankind most work that's done is really done
out of selfishness and it's done to manipulate others to
extract money from them for selfish purposes that's what you're
doing for your boss not all the time but in
a lot of cases you certainly aren't tapping into your
greatest capacity as a human being your creative genius you're
not using your creative genius almost at all and that's
what's so sad about this situation of wage slavery is
that when I look at people in society and how
they work what I see is I see that ninety
percent of people are not tapping into nearly what they
could be what they could really contribute to the world
visionary scientists and they could be visionary inventors and they
can be people who could who could help the world
to lift everybody up and they're not doing this simply
because they're stuck in wage slavery and once you do
get stuck it gets very hard to escape this situation
our work in society is deeply dysfunctional and noticed that
work takes up a large chunk of your time in
fact for most people it'll take up over 50% of
all their waking time in their life will be devoted
to work but the kind of work you'll be doing
is not going to be the kind of work that
you're passionate about or that you find meaningful at all
or that contributes in a positive way to mankind and
of course in doing this slave work you are not
gonna be given time for meditation you're not gonna be
given time to take retreats you are not gonna be
given time for psychedelics you're not gonna be given time
for inner work you're not gonna be given time for
personal development you're not gonna be given time for taking
care of your kids you're not gonna be given time
for improving your health you're not gonna be given time
for travel and exploration you're not gonna be given time
for self education because your boss doesn't care about any
of this you're gonna be working mostly to exploit harm
kill and dis inform other human beings and then you
wonder why is there all this evil in the world
well look at who's causing it it's because most people
in society are wage slaves who are just executing the
orders of the people at the top who are mostly
doing it to exploit others so that they can become
wealthy and the easiest way to become wealthy in our
pyramid scheme society is to exploit harm kill and dissing
form that's what a lot of work is about of
course except it's very carefully veiled and denied and all
this is hidden under the surface such that you're doing
this work without even knowing that you're doing this work
it's unconscious you're creating this evil unconsciously that's what egos
do egos run amok creating evil unconsciously thinking that actually
what they're doing is good but they're just ignorant of
what they're really doing most evil in society is done
through unconscious work I'm talking about the programmer working for
Lockheed Martin creating code for drones I'm talking about the
secretary working for coca-cola selling poison to children I'm talking
about the HR person working in some big pharmaceutical insurance
company health care company that actively works in schemes to
throw people off of health insurance deny them benefits when
they need it most killing people and destroying their health
I'm talking about the doctor working for some giant hospital
that overcharges patients for everything because that's her business model
I'm talking about the call center rep who works for
AT&T or Verizon who are scheming to destroy net neutrality
I'm talking about the cashier who works at McDonald's selling
poison to people I'm talking about the delivery truck driver
for tobacco companies that deliver cigarettes to grocery stores I'm
talking about the web designer who works for a big
oil company like Exxon Mobil creating their web pages of
disinformation and contributing to propaganda campaigns for example against global
warming and so on all of these are ordinary people
they have no idea what they're really doing they're not
connecting all the dots and they feel completely disempowered and
if you're one of these types of people you might
say well Leo yeah maybe I mean but aren't you
being really harsh here I mean what can I do
about this I gotta work somewhere I mean [ __
] Leo it's hard enough to get a job in
this economy I'm just kind of struggling to make ends
meet and now you're you're blaming me you're now making
me feel guilty for just being some cashier at Walmart
or McDonald's having how's that my responsibility isn't that the
job of the CEOs to to make sure the company
is going in the right direction but see that's exactly
my point see you're doing unconscious work and you're giving
up your all your responsibilities because you're a slave and
you have no other options because you're a slave so
if you're working for McDonald's now you think you can
quit and then you're gonna go work for AT&T well
you're just substituting one slave job for another slave job
one form of evil for another form of evil how
is society a pyramid scheme no no for this I
want to give you a warning that this might make
you old oppressed it's going to be a harsh truth
we're gonna reveal something here about society that most people
don't understand it are in denial about but don't worry
I'm gonna offer you some solutions here's towards the end
so I'm not just giving you negative stories to make
you feel bad this is actually it's important it's important
that you understand the depth of your predicament and just
how challenging of a problem this is for yourself and
also for all of mankind then you will be in
a position where you could really take back control take
responsibility and make some changes but before you get there
you got to understand what's really going on so what's
really going on with society is that the way that
civilization came to power and rose is that basically tribes
enslaved other tribes tribes became bigger and bigger and bigger
and turned into city stays nation states entire countries they
formed alliances and became allies and all of this and
basically there was mutual enslavement and that's fundamentally what government
is you are a slave to your nation this has
just happened historically from the very very beginning at least
from the time where we had agriculture where wealth could
be accumulated through stored grain and livestock and things like
this accumulated wealth and then we got currencies and so
forth but basically human beings have been slaughtering and conquering
and enslaving one another since the very beginning of mankind
it's been happening in all societies there's not a single
continent on the planet that's immune to this it's always
happened and it's only recently it's only in the last
couple hundred years that in industrialized nations actual physical slavery
has been outlawed but of course just because physical slavery
has been outlawed doesn't mean that you're not enslaved in
other ways in fact in many places in the world
right now people shouldn't understand that there's there's actual physical
slavery there's sexual slavery there's all forms of slavery still
going on right now in many third-world countries even in
first world countries there's for example sexual slavery so people
take this for granted because they just kind of grew
up thinking oh well slavery some archaic barbaric thing that
happened in the past and that will compute completely you
know that we've completely eliminated and eradicated no we haven't
no we haven't you got to put this all as
a historical context society is a battle for power and
you lost that power your great great great great grandparents
have all been enslaved they lost that power it doesn't
matter if you were white or black the the people
with less power were conquered by those with more power
that doesn't mean they had to put you in physical
handcuffs and chains or had to make you pick cotton
to enslave you see society is all about power games
and dynamics who has the power who keeps the power
it's all about skewing the playing field in such a
way that those would power accumulate more power and those
who have no power have even less power because power
equals wealth and why is all this happening fundamentally because
the ego wants to survive and the ego wants to
maximize its survival at all times people think that well
but but once you're rich you don't need anymore you
don't understand the ego is insatiable there's never a point
where ego gets to word says okay now I've got
enough money I've got enough power I don't need any
more let me try to share more with others no
never the ego never gets there because the ego is
always paranoid it's always feeling threatened when you have a
billion dollar company all that happens is that now you're
just paranoid about your view losing your company so you're
fighting for the survival of your billion-dollar company even though
you have billions of dollars just as much as you
were fighting to pay your electricity bill nothing ever changes
for the ego the ego is always chasing for its
own survival always unless it's completely dissolved government has literally
domesticated you turned you into a domesticated animal to do
its bidding now this wasn't done by some scheming masterminds
as a form of a conspiracy theory but rather most
of this just happens unconsciously this is just the structure
of society it happens spontaneously society is deliberately designed to
be unequal grossly unequal it's not something that just happens
by accident it's by design egos at the top try
to maximize their survival those egos once they get power
they try to reinforce that by maintaining the status quo
of this pyramid defending the status quo not only are
the people at the top doing this but actually the
slaves at the bottom are brainwashed and programmed to do
it as well that's what makes it so devious really
your enslavement starts by the enslavement of your mind it's
the ideas that your culture feeds you as you're growing
up which you are completely ignorant of would you just
take completely for granted as normal as just the status
quo is just how things are and how things have
always been as tradition and then you just end up
being a who defends that tradition that status quo oftentimes
you're gonna defend that even if it's against your own
survival agenda simply because your mind is is so close
and so inflexible that it's unable to actually rewire itself
to to look at the world in new ways this
is how indoctrination works this is a large feature of
what education does our education system is a is the
critical component of this which is why it's so difficult
to reform the education system because actually it's there to
enslave your mind it's a vehicle for propagating culture and
culture is just a set of ideas and concepts that
shape your view of your reality which is supposed to
make the entire culture survive not you individually but actually
the entire culture you see the culture collectively is like
a super organism and in the same way that you
don't care if if a few cells on your on
your pinky get killed as long as you survive well
the culture doesn't really care what happens to you so
long as the whole culture survives society is a house
of cards held together by lies and massive self-deception collective
self deception society is there to create a sense of
solid reality it's like a mass hallucination and it perpetuates
this with all sorts of ways very subtle sneaky tricky
ways that will take you years to study and to
fully appreciate wage slaves are used to serve the elite
the people at the top of the pyramid and to
serve all their survival needs what people don't understand is
that wealth as a relative thing you might think well
wealth is just me sitting on a pile of gold
or something that's not really what wealth is about for
one person to be wealthy in a society other people
have to actually be poor because wealth is relative wealth
is not about just having a bunch of paper bills
or numbers in your bank account or bars of gold
wealth is also about power relative power disparity because if
everybody in society was completely equal in their power there
would be no disparity in power or in wealth let's
say in this utopian scenario and then what would happen
is that one person couldn't force the other person to
do something for me to be able to force you
to do something for me like to clean my toilets
let's say I don't want to clean or for you
to feed me grapes while I'm lying on a couch
and for for you to wave a palm frond over
over my head to keep me cool in the summer
for that to happen I must have more power than
you because otherwise you would never do it if we
were equal cuz how would how would I make you
if I told you to feed me grapes you could
say well why don't you feed me grapes first and
then we'd be at a stalemate neither one of us
would feed the other grapes unless we just kind of
both wanted to do that see so for for a
billionaire the whole appeal of being a billionaire or a
millionaire is precisely the power to spare you that you
have it's all the stuff you can do or that
you can get other people to do for you without
having without needing them or being able to force them
to reciprocate that's what wealth is fundamentally about see it's
relative the system is constructed such that wealth only has
meaning within the system in that you can get others
within the system to do stuff for you and then
the question is are you at the top of that
pyramid or at the bottom of it or somewhere in
the middle now of course don't misunderstand me I'm not
saying that wealth is purely a zero-sum game and that
for someone to be a winner people have to be
losers it's not strictly like that but also a lot
of capitalists will will be in denial about this and
they will think that oh well Leo if you just
work hard you can just create a bunch of wealth
for yourself no that's a fantasy it actually doesn't work
that way there's some partial truth to that and we'll
get to that in a minute don't worry but also
you have to recognize that fundamentally the game is rigged
it's a myth that you can just work hard in
this fair playing field this free market competitive marketplace and
if you just do the right things and you're a
good hard worker then you'll rise to the top and
everybody can theoretically rise to the top no the whole
point is that actually theoretically you can't have everybody rise
to the top that's what a pyramid scheme is is
that it only really works as a pyramid you can't
invert the pyramid you can't have all the wage slaves
become elites it's important to understand this structure this is
a structural problem this is the structure we're dealing with
you have to start to understand that the the playing
field is extremely skewed and unfair and it's corrupt by
design and most wealth is not accumulated through hard work
or through creative ingenuity by lone entrepreneurs or inventors most
wealth is accumulated through exploitation manipulation and highly unfair power
dynamics strong-arming the the wage slaves and getting yourself to
the top of the pyramid that's how most wealth is
accumulated a lot of wealth is stolen that's something nobody
tells you a lot of wealth is stolen of course
the most masterful ways to steal wealth is through legal
means by making it socially normal by actually enacting laws
which make your stealing not technically stealing but fundamentally what
you're doing is still exploitation and manipulation and strong-arming of
people disempowering people you're just doing it in legal ways
and of course you're also rigging the laws in your
favor most wealth is made by being close to sources
of existing wealth there are like Wellsprings of wealth that
traditionally exists within the pyramid and the closer you get
to those wealth springs and also the the higher you
get to the top of the pyramid the closer you
are to positions of power and there that allows you
to strong-arm and exploit more effectively and very easily acquire
wealth which is why most wealth in our society is
centered in certain industries very specific industries such as banking
investing government and politics military and defense contracting health care
law celebrities tech giants Silicon Valley Hollywood television radio what
are all of these things these are all little pyramid
schemes within the larger pyramid scheme and the closer you
get to to these Wellsprings of wealth the more your
likelihood of becoming wealthy yourself you're never really gonna become
wealthy by being a schoolteacher you're never really gonna become
wealthy by working at Walmart now what you can do
is you can climb the corporate ladder of Walmart like
let's say you start off it's just like a local
manager that you climb higher and higher and higher but
as you're climbing what are you doing fundamentally why is
climbing the corporate ladder going to make you wealthier and
more powerful because what you're doing is you're you're rising
up to the top of that pyramid structure and the
higher you rise the more disparity in distance there is
between between you and there's fewer people up there than
all the people at the bottom which gives you power
over all those people at the bottom now you don't
need to consciously tell yourself a lot of times when
you're doing this that you're gonna be exploiting someone or
manipulating someone it's just baked into the system such that
all you gotta do is want to climb the system
in my climbing system automatically the exploitation will happen all
the systems in a company are already set up that
way that gives you plausible deniability otherwise you couldn't sleep
at night and so see ultimately if you really want
to become wealthy maybe you get you become friends with
some regional manager at Walmart he maybe connects you with
some other people through some sort of social network maybe
you get to even talk to the CEO of Walmart
or something like that and then they give you some
advice maybe they think a liking to you then they
give you a promotion you know special stuff special purchase
all about specialness why is that precisely because you need
to rise above the common herd in order to have
that power disparity over the common herd that's fundamentally what
you're doing but people don't see this all they kind
of see are just numbers on a paycheck or they
just think oh I got a promotion oh look honey
I I had a meeting with the corporate district manager
blah blah blah and he liked me and maybe he's
gonna introduce me to his golfing buddies and we're gonna
do this and that and all they shared some cool
insights with how it can improve my career and they
put a good word with the CEO and they're gonna
give me a promotion again and thought it added a
bonus this this right see but you're not seeing what's
really happening when you're doing this when you're climbing the
corporate ladder or for example when you're trying to become
famous in Hollywood or on TV or on on radio
the reason that these jobs pay a lot or for
example in trying to become a famous athlete the reason
that can get you wealthy or famous musicians present because
it's such a rare thing is such a rare position
there's only a handful of people who could be on
TV or on radio or sports athletes you know a
very small ratio compared to the vast majority of people
who consume that stuff and that's precisely what gives you
that that leverage of power over them which is why
people on TV make millions of dollars just by being
on TV another thing that people don't understand about how
this pyramid scheme stuff works is syndicates syndicates syndicates are
small networks that are designed for accumulation of power and
cooperative exploitation of everybody else who's not in the syndicate
there are syndicates within every single field in the economy
they're syndicates within healthcare within oil within medicine within self-help
the self-help field within spirituality everywhere what a syndicate is
is a few of the top people in the field
come together they create a sort of a mastermind group
where they share knowledge information and inside tips and trade
secrets with each other and they also scheme how to
rise above everybody else in the field and a lot
of times what they do is they come up with
with ways to rig the game in such a way
that only the syndicate is going to be able to
survive such that anybody who enters into that field who's
new and fresh not part of the syndicate they are
of course then disadvantaged by the skewed highly skewed playing
field which these cities have skewed against them so that's
why it's very hard to break into industries many times
especially the very lucrative ones you have to break into
the syndicates or start your own syndicate but it's very
hard to start your own syndicate because who's gonna want
you in their syndicate when they already have an effective
syndicate already and once you've got a little syndicate going
you don't want to expand the syndicate democratically this is
not a democratic process you don't want everybody in your
field to be part of your syndicate the whole point
of a syndicate is precisely so that you create a
power disparity a knowledge disparity what you have to understand
is that wealth is not just money in a bank
account it also oftentimes includes knowledge insider secrets of how
stuff works various business models and business formulas that you
would otherwise never hear about unless you were part of
some sort of syndicate or some sort of elite group
of people write these this knowledge this information these trade
secrets trades this tricks of the trade so to speak
often times are worth more than actual money because they
are the source of the money and all the power
and so oftentimes these are closely guarded secrets what you
often have to also understand is that most wealth is
carefully controlled and passed down within this giant pyramid talking
about the whole pyramid now of society to relatives friends
and folks within the syndicates which is precisely why we
have these really ridiculous estate taxes where you can just
pass on millions of dollars to your children into your
family and to all this sort of stuff tax-exempt precisely
because the whole scheme of this game is to earn
a bunch of wealth for yourself make your ego survived
and then of course everything that surrounds your ego that
you identify including your friends and your family and so
forth you want to help them survive - that's what
the ego is all about and these syndicates also create
like little collective egos within within egos this of course
gets codified within legislation that's passed lobbying to create legislation
that creates the most unfair playing field possible so that
those in power those passing the laws are able to
ensure their survival as much as they can get away
with very little wealth is generated independently through independent creativity
the fastest and easiest ways to get wealthy in society
is to manipulate this entire structure that I'm talking about
creating various syndicates exploiting government legislations exploiting government subsidies getting
government contracts this is how you really become wealthy and
what's really important are social connections status and your fame
these are hugely important components to being wealthy that's why
social status takes on so much meaning for people that's
why dressing a certain way having a certain kind of
business card knowing the right people going to the parties
and hobnobbing in this and forming connections this is how
you climb this corporate or not just corporate but this
this pyramid now of course most people in our society
are completely in denial about this pyramid they're oblivious to
it they have no idea that it exists but even
when they're told about it they are still totally in
denial about it for for two reasons the people at
the bottom are in denial about it and also the
people at the top are denial about it so why
are the people at the top in denial about it
well because think about it the ego never wants to
admit that it won unfairly because the ego from the
egos perspective anything it does to survive is by definition
good that's what good is good isn't something out there
in the world good is what's good for your ego
so the EO never wants to admit that the ego
doesn't want to admit that goodness is relative to to
itself it never wants to admit that it plays the
game unfairly the ego always comes up with justifications rationalizations
for why when it wins it wins because it deserves
it because it's fair because ego is stronger because it
did something right because it worked more hours because whatever
and then it really believes that so those people who
are at the top of the pyramid they fully believe
that they deserve to be on the top of the
pyramid they believe they got there through their own initiative
they believe that there is no such thing as a
pyramid they believe it's just a play a fair free
marketplace and that the reason they got to the top
is just because they worked their asses off and because
they were smart and intelligent they had a high IQ
and all of this but of course what they're not
honest about is that they're they're not admitting that there
are millions of other people in society who work just
as hard as them or even harder and are nowhere
near the top and never will be and that's because
the thing is rigged also what these people are completely
in denial about is their own privilege and the the
good fortune they had by good fortune I mean good
genetics good parenting growing up in a good place part
of the country going to good schools going to good
universities all of this stuff sure of course you work
too hard I'm not denying that some CEO of Walmart
or Lockheed Martin something isn't a hard worker most of
them are most of them work many hours into the
night that's not the issue there are many people in
the world who work long hours into the night the
question is which ones of them have power and mostly
it's the ones that were lucky most the people who
have power have wealth in society have it because they
had huge advantages over everybody else they didn't start where
everybody else started and that's what these successful people don't
understand they don't appreciate their own privilege they don't appreciate
just how lucky they were to be born in the
right country to be born in the right city to
be more than the right parents to be born to
a family that had money to be born without a
disease to be born without an abusive father or mother
who molested you to to have gone to good schools
to get into good colleges and to have various kinds
of social connections because of the family that you grew
up in and so forth and to have all sorts
of inside knowledge that most people don't have and that's
precisely what allowed you to become so successful to climb
the ladder now again of course I'm not saying that
this is absolutely always the case there certainly are self-made
people out there who generate their own wealth from scratch
there are people who climb from the very very bottom
all the way to the top there certainly are those
few exceptions but people who are in denial about this
whole pyramid scheme what they do is they point a
few of those exceptions they say Allah leo but look
look I can point out a few counter examples -
you have people who are rags to riches stories came
from the very bottom to the very top so what
you're saying leo is false no you're just using those
as actually a smokescreen to deny the larger structure of
what we're talking about so even though yes it is
possible to rise to the top and in a few
moments I will give you solutions for how to do
that before we can get to those solutions though I
want you to appreciate the depth of the structural problem
that we're talking about you see ego doesn't really care
about fairness whatever ego says let's be fair it only
says that to the stat that it helps its survival
in the same way that when ego says truth ego
never cares about truth it's always lying and it's only
saying truth when the truth is helpful to its survival
all the ego cares about is survival not fairness and
not truth which is why this system is perpetuated ego
will always deny that it exploits manipulates and deceives whether
it's itself or other people and another reason why people
are in denial about this whole pyramid scheme is is
because it's just a status quo it's so baked into
the structure of society and most minds are so complacent
that they just accept whatever environment they grew up in
so they just take this whole scheme as just how
it is they can't even imagine how it might be
otherwise they can't even imagine what it would look like
to be at the very bottom of the pyramid those
people that are the top half of the pyramid if
they knew how terrible it was at the very bottom
of the pyramid they would have an existential crisis they
would feel guilty and responsible for just how selfish they've
been and how complacent they've been about all their privilege
so few people know what it's like to be at
the very very bottom of this pyramid and if you're
living in a first world democracy the bottom of the
pyramid might not even be that terrible if you're living
in Sweden Noren in Netherlands or in Germany or in
in Canada or even in the u.s. the bottom is
not that terrible if you could only know and imagine
what the bottom is like in third-world countries in South
America in Asia in Africa the bottom can be just
horrifying and of course a lot of these first world
nations the only reason their first world nations is because
actually they're they're exploiting and they're standing on the shoulders
of all the third-world Nations and America has become a
master at that one of the reasons America is so
wealthy and has so much luxury and power is become
its because it's become a master at exploiting third-world countries
while at the same time completely denying it and whitewashing
it because of course we need to maintain our image
of America being this beacon on a hill and this
Democratic thing the best country in the world and all
of this of course this is a complete sham this
is exactly what the EO does is that whitewashes it's
on egotism and it's precisely why people get touchy when
you start to question america's exceptionalism and america's goodness it's
precisely because the truth that lies underneath all this whitewashing
is very ugly and it's a very bitter pill to
swallow might make you depressed for a few weeks for
a few months might make you have a little existential
crisis if you've been creating identity out of being this
noble country or this noble businessperson you know society is
just like a large dysfunctional abusive family it's in denial
in just the same way in an abusive family if
the father is molesting the daughter here's what's gonna happen
the daughter will be in denial about it because it's
way too bitter to admit that your father is molesting
you the father will of course be in denial about
it because it's way too painful for a father to
admit that he molest his daughter and the mother will
also be in denial about it because it's way too
painful for her to take responsibility and to admit that
she's enabling this whole situation just standing by and letting
it happen and so this whole thing just sort of
continues it's a large dysfunctional abusive family and that's what
society is and everybody around us isn't niall about it
of course of course when the truth is so terrible
and harsh how could you not be in denial in
fact all sorts of ideology are created to justify why
it's good various forms of conservativism libertarianism and cetera blah
blah blah blah they're all designed to maintain the pyramid
and of course the people who are promoting its ideologies
they themselves don't really understand the full pyramid the reason
they don't understand is actually because they've never been at
the very bottom of the pyramid they usually the people
who become libertarians and and and these free-market capitalist and
so forth they're people who already at the middle to
the top range of the pyramid and they're completely in
denial about the bottom half so they think that oh
well if everybody just kind of boot lifted up themselves
up by the bootstraps and work a little bit harder
they would just be where I am oh you don't
understand everybody can't do that in fact your whole system
hinges upon the fact that it won't happen because if
it did you would lose all your wealth and power
and privilege and all the sudden you would not be
so happy anymore now let me issue a warning here
don't mistake what I'm doing here as some sort of
anti-capitalist rant I actually am a capitalist I earned money
I'm a business person I'm an entrepreneur I start my
own businesses I enjoy doing business I love it I
don't want to see it stop well get to the
solutions and how to run a business in the moment
my solution for you is actually to become a business
person but a few more warnings here so what I'm
talking about here is not a conspiracy theory there's not
some global reptilian race that's that that's making this happen
no this is just a structure of human civilization if
you think of human civilization as an ant colony this
is just how an ant colony works every ant colony
has worker ants warrior ants and so forth and there's
a certain structure it's not like the evil queen has
created the ant colony to suit herself no it's just
the structure of the thing there's a deep wisdom and
logic to it there's reasons that this pyramid exists it
actually is important for survival this is our legacy our
history this is how we came out of the the
ape Ages this is how we civilize ourselves through this
very barbaric process survival is no easy business and a
lot of times it requires doing some nasty stuff and
making nasty sacrifices brutal sacrifices a lot of pain and
suffering and torture goes into survival people take survival completely
for granted in our society because in our society survival
has been abstracted and all all that survival means for
many people is just I got to go to my
work between the hours of 9:00 to 5:00 I show
up then every two weeks I get a paycheck and
that's survival but see that that process abstracts away and
obfuscates what survival really entails what your boss had to
do to make you get that paycheck to be able
to pay you at the end of the month you
don't know the kind of evil should he have to
do who he had to exploit and manipulate to do
that how many throats he had to slit metaphorically speaking
or sometimes literally speaking you know there's companies that are
that are earning billions of dollars from manufacturing weapons bombs
arms that go to kill thousands of people around the
world every year and you could be working for one
of those companies and not even know it you could
be a subsidiary wing of one of these companies you
might say olio my company doesn't do that oh yeah
but you might be providing services your company might be
the only reason your company could be paying your check
paycheck is because you're providing subsidiary services to that company
maybe you're designing their webpages maybe you're doing their accounting
maybe you're providing them with electricity or whatever you see
the entire system is deeply interconnected it's deeply holistic these
libertarian types they don't see the holism of how all
of it works together so this is not a conspiracy
theory nor am i demonizing capitalism here there are certainly
many problems within capitalism and they can require political solutions
and we need those we need improvements and so forth
I don't have all the answers by any means I'm
John pointing just I'm pointing out a deeper structure of
how human societies work this goes way beyond just issues
of capitalism versus communism or socialism or anything like that
even in communist two countries this is still the case
they're still a pyramid in communism it's one of the
problems of communism is that you can't actually truly apply
communism ever because human nature is such that it creates
a pyramid and the whole idea behind communism is that
you're trying to eliminate the pyramid and it just doesn't
work or at least it hasn't worked up to this
point so my solution here is not to advocate some
political revolution or to turn you into political ideologue I'm
not trying to turn you into a Marxist or a
communist I'm not trying to make you blame anybody here
or to play the victim that's very important to understand
a lot of people when they start to learn some
of these harsh truths about the nature of this system
they become political ideologues and they say ok well the
solution must be Marxism or whatever let me go read
Marx let me then go protest and do Occupy Wall
Street and all this sort of stuff and while some
of those protests are good a lot of them are
also very naive and actually are just a distraction from
escaping wage slavery I'm gonna give you the solution here
in a minute and it's not going to involve political
action now that doesn't mean political action is bad it's
important but you have to understand that those people who
are politically active in these sorts of protests and stuff
they usually never end up escaping wage slavery they could
be doing good stuff they could also be doing bad
stuff it depends on how you're doing your protesting and
what kind of ideas you have the details matter of
your ideas a lot of these people who have ideas
about how to change politics or economics they're extremely naive
extremely unsystematic thinkers and they're just very clueless about the
changes they want to make it's really difficult to make
these changes effectively right so that's that's a whole different
game and we're not getting into that here I want
to make sure that you don't take this as me
trying to get you to demonize other people and blame
them there's nobody to blame here and you're not a
victim I just want you to see the depth of
the predicament that you're up against because only then will
you be able to take serious steps to change the
problem and you need to understand that it's not some
one guy's fault or even some class of people's fault
it's not just the fault of the Republicans or the
Conservatives or the libertarians or somebody else or the rich
people it's not that simplistic there's a lot more going
on here so you can never just blame somebody this
is a deep structure of all human societies and it
doesn't matter how you feel about this pyramid you might
say Ollie okay fine I'm not gonna play this pyramid
game then I'm just gonna go like join a monastery
or some yoga ashram and I'm gonna work towards enlightenment
and [ __ ] this whole thing I don't want
to be part of this nasty pyramid well if you
go to one of these n monasteries or these yoga
ashrams what you'll discover is that there is a pyramid
so you think you've escaped but you haven't escaped and
even if you do join an ashram or a monastery
it's still part of the entire web Society you can't
escape this this is all-encompassing unless you're gonna go live
alone in a cave by yourself and hunt and forage
for your own food you're gonna be part of this
system you might think only okay so maybe I can
just like win the lottery get a bunch of money
retire in the Bahamas and just live there in luxury
and then I have escaped the pyramid No then you
are completely reliant the pyramid because when you're living in
the Bahamas with all your lottery money how is it
that you have a house how is it that you
have electricity how is it a of water how is
it that you get food how is it airplane travel
and car and gasoline and all of this it's because
you're leeching off this social grid off the pyramid so
by winning a bunch of money you're actually what you're
doing is you're you're living off the very top of
the pyramid the only way that you can retire or
even go on a couple of weeks vacation the only
way you can do that is because you're relying on
the entire human safety net the the pyramid to support
you while you're doing that see because if you were
living alone in the woods you couldn't have a single
week of vacation ever because you'd every day you need
to get up and hunt for your own food gather
your water and build your fire and shelter and fix
stuff up every single day you need to do that
that's survival but again people are so disconnected from survival
in everyday society they take it completely for granted because
society has become so effective and efficient as just delivering
these things to you so it doesn't matter how you
feel about the pyramid it doesn't want it it doesn't
matter if you don't want to play the game you're
still gonna play the game even if you refuse to
play the game you're gonna be forced to that's survival
you're forced to survive nature forces you unless you're okay
with dying and it doesn't matter who you blame about
this pyramid and it doesn't matter whether you think it's
fair or unfair moral or immoral it doesn't matter the
pyramid is here this is how it works this is
how it's worked for thousands of years and it's not
stopping anytime soon so you might as well learn to
accept it and to start to take responsibility for for
it if you're young if you're in middle school high
school and college watching actualised org man you doubled upon
something here that is life transforming for you this is
huge I hope you realize now that you're being groomed
to be a wage slave that's what school and college
is about and unless you do something special you take
some special measures you will become a wage slave because
that's the default position that's who you become if you
do nothing if you're one of those average C students
who's just kind of like milling through life and just
kind of [ __ ] around playing a bunch of
video games and watching TV taking your schooling for granted
just kind of doing the bare minimum smoking weed with
your friends just hanging out partying drinking a bunch of
beer and beer pong and this sort of stuff in
college and this is what you're kind of doing you're
gonna end up a wage slave that's what you're gonna
be it's much easier to avoid becoming a wage slave
if you start early if you're in middle school high
school or college right now once you're out of college
once you're past the age of 22 now you've got
to be independent on your own pay your own bills
or now it's really hard to change this situation really
hard because you didn't prepare and now you're probably gonna
be a wage slave for the rest of your life
even most well-off paid professionals are wage slaves I'm talking
about the lawyers the doctors the programmers the scientists what
are they they're mostly wage slaves they don't have true
independence they have to jump through hoops the hoops of
their clients the hoops of their bosses their institutions whoever
they work for they have to show up at a
certain time punch the clock basically that's what they got
to do people in society who have true financial freedom
autonomy and independence this is extremely rare I want you
to realize how rare it is because I want you
to start to appreciate what this is this is something
that you can develop in your life but you have
to appreciate just how rare this is and how valuable
this is and what this could really mean it's only
once you start to appreciate it and then you could
say okay I see this is like we're not talking
about like going to the store and buying a bag
of popcorn for five bucks that would be a cheap
cheap to get item we're talking about like buying a
million dollar house that's a big ticket item you know
you want to buy a million dollar house you've got
a plan for it strategize work towards it you know
you're not gonna just buy it on a whim the
way you got but I a five dollar piece of
popcorn popcorn bag all right people just take all this
completely for granted how does one become a wage slave
you might think well it's because the evil structure of
society no actually there's something very simple at the heart
of it something that actually you can control cuz you
don't have much control over the structure of all of
society but you do have control over this stuff listen
to this actually consider that you become a wage slave
because you have no clue what you want in life
you have no clue what you want you have no
sense of purpose you have no clear intentions no clear
vision you have no independent thought you have no desire
for anything really other than just to coast through life
and you've wasted your youth you've wasted your youth playing
video games and [ __ ] around when you should
have been spending those 15 years of your schooling that
time between first grade and and the end of college
you should have been spending all of that time strategically
planning developing skills the skills you need to avoid wage
slavery you needed to be spending that time honing your
sense of purpose building a vision thinking independently for yourself
setting your foundation such that then when you get beyond
college now you're ready to work towards your financial independence
and you have some sort of foundation to work with
but the vast majority of people have completely wasted this
opportunity simply because you were you were oblivious your parents
didn't tell you about this your school teachers your professors
none of them told you about this mostly because all
of them have themselves fallen prey to this trap and
this is this is uncommon knowledge here so that's the
bad news the good news is that you can escape
and there are two basic strategies for escaping wage slavery
the first one is to become ultra creative and hardworking
with a powerful vision a clear life purpose and to
come become a massive value provider an exceptional value provider
to the world you provide so much value to the
world that your finances aren't even an issue anymore you
can develop yourself to be this way examples of this
include the popular singers and musicians filmmakers programmers public speakers
artists founders of various companies inventors designers scientists that's one
way second way is to manipulate the system to get
close to the sources of wealth and power within the
pyramid and exploit this pyramid to rise to the top
obviously I recommend option number one and the reason I
recommend option number one is because there are some serious
problems with option number two option number two fundamentally is
egotistical because it depends on manipulation and exploitation it's unconscious
it's also rather lazy you're not thinking about what you
can offer the world rather you're thinking about what you
can get from the world oftentimes it leads to criminality
of various kinds gross forms of it and also subtle
forms of it like various kinds of white-collar crime at
least to downright evil and selfishness and it harms a
lot of people and also it's just fundamentally unsatisfying even
if you eight are able to exploit this pyramid and
rise to the very top and become wealthy so what
you're just gonna be as miserable as the people at
the bottom I mean yeah you you won't be fast
physically miserable because you'll have the luxuries of life you'll
have a car to house and water and electricity and
and all this but uh but deep down there's gonna
be a hole that never was filled with option number
one by becoming a powerful creative genius you kill two
birds with one stone not only can you handle your
finances but you get the thrill and satisfaction of of
offering something valuable to the world and helping to uplift
mankind and doing it in a way that you find
meaningful and fun and exciting and that you could be
passionate about so I'm only gonna be talking about option
number one here from this point on I don't care
about option number two because I don't see it as
a as a sustainable and a conscious choice so if
you're gonna be taking option number one then here's how
you escape wage slavery first of all you stop whining
and blaming and you take full responsibility for everything that's
happening in your life everything you do not have the
luxury of whining and complaining and making excuses and playing
victim everything in your life needs to be your responsibility
because you need to be able to take control of
it and change it by developing yourself developing the skills
or whatever you need you have to change yourself to
turn yourself into this powerful creative genius then what you
got to do is you've got to figure out what
you want from life and you got to be really
[ __ ] crystal clear about this you should spend
an enormous amount of time thinking about what you want
from life you need a very clear vision a powerful
compelling vision that's gonna motivate you this is not a
short-term vision this is a vision that that will guide
you over the next 10 to 20 years of your
life it's a it's a big-picture strategic plan for how
you're gonna escape this wage slavery this is basically a
vision for your career this is a life purpose this
is what I call life purpose you also need to
decide if you want to be a sheep or a
leader to be able to follow through on this strategy
you're gonna have to turn yourself into a leader not
a sheep a leader means you're gonna have to lead
yourself and lead others around you it means you'd have
to take extra responsibilities beyond what everybody else is doing
you have to work a little bit harder you're gonna
have to have a a better vision than everybody else
you have to develop trust in yourself you have to
stop looking to other people around you to validate you
and to support you and to give you answers but
actually forge forward and seek the answers yourself you have
to get comfortable being alone as a leader there are
many other facets to being a good leader I have
actually a whole episode called I believe how to be
a leader or leadership do a search actualize for actualize
that org leadership on YouTube and you'll find my leadership
video where I talk about the nuances of being a
good leader that will be very important you got to
also become a massive value provider what does this mean
this means you have to train yourself in some way
where you will provide an inordinate disproportionate amount of value
compared to everybody else you see be really you only
have two options in this pyramid scheme either you're gonna
exploit the pyramid scheme or somehow you need to use
your creativity your god-given creativity you got it you got
to take that and utilize it and leverage it in
such a way that you're able to give the world
so much value that eventually their help but pay you
for the amount of value that you're offering and then
you're gonna be able to buy your freedom from that
but to do that the only way you can offer
a lot of value to the world because remember value
is also relative within this pyramid so you gotta provide
way more value than the average person in the pyramid
is providing that's not that difficult to do because most
people in pyramid provides so little value but it does
require that like you actually develop yourself to provide value
because the average person doesn't have any skills any education
or any training or anything that allows them to really
provide inordinate value all they can really do is like
the value they can provide is to wait tables wash
dishes answer emails type up some secretary report you know
this kind of very minimal value real value is creative
value when you're able to come up with new solutions
and inventions that solve serious problems in the world that's
what a real provider of value does high-level thinking it's
abstraction its big-picture its strategic its system's thinking right you're
you're solving serious problems for mankind in some fashion now
don't take that in a very narrow sense solving problems
for mankind might mean that you're a really talented musician
and you might say well but how does a musician
solve serious problems for mankind he does of course he
does he entertains he takes away people's misery he creates
beauty if he's a really good musician so to become
a massive value provider really what what's required is you
need to have a very clear vision of how you
want to provide value to the world in what way
then you got to focus yourself and you got to
develop mastery in the field and it usually takes a
good 3 to 5 years of training and practice to
get good at one narrow special feel to the point
where you're actually able to provide enough value that people
are actually willing to pay you for it and the
only reason they're willing to pay you for it is
because now you're providing so much value that they actually
feel bad that they're not paying you because you're really
offering them a lot of value you're helping them with
with some particular problem they have in their life you're
helping them in some really tangible concrete way so for
this you need training you need skills you need need
education but not just loosey-goosey skills or education you got
to focus it in a very specific way channel it
this is why school high school education college education in
of itself does not make you a massive value provider
because it's way too loosey-goosey and diffuse there's there's there's
nothing tangible that you're able to offer if you just
finish a regular college degree for most people I mean
for certain feels like if you're gonna be an engineer
or computer programmer those very technical fields usually you can
offer a lot of tangible value out of college and
therefore you get paid a lot for those fields those
are some good paying fields but for most feels like
you've got an English degree or something or a philosophy
degree or a psychology degree you can't provide value you
know the person who has a four-year university psychology degree
this person for example can't actually help me to fix
my psychological problems like if I come to you and
I say look I got a terrible problem in my
relationship we're gonna get divorced can you help me works
like man I got a depression can you help me
figure out my depression can you help me be happy
of course not because the [ __ ] they taught
you at university in psychology is just [ __ ]
non-academic nonsense it was never tangible and never actually turned
you into a massive value provider so what kind of
training you'll need and what kind of process you have
to go to master the thing you need to master
that's gonna be highly dependent upon what your field of
mastery is gonna be which is gonna be highly dependent
upon what your life purpose is and what the [
__ ] you actually want to do so I can't
tell you what that is that's that's something you got
to figure out and that's another thing that's very important
here is that for you to succeed in escaping wage
slavery you're gonna have to go beyond all cookie cutter
solutions all types of business and a box solutions do
not come to me asking me how to start your
business you as the leader you as the one who's
got a vision a clear vision a clear sense of
intent of what you want out of your life you
should be telling me the things you're gonna do the
things you need to master the skills you need to
provide the massive value that you're gonna offer don't ask
me you tell me and you might say oh Lea
but I don't know well the reason you don't know
is because you actually don't have a clarity of purpose
once you have a clarity of purpose that will give
you the fuel you need to go out there and
to research everything you need to research to learn everything
you need to learn that passion will drive you that
sense of intent will drive you and of course you're
still not going to know a lot of stuff but
you will start to figure it out so don't get
too lost on the details here I'm giving you a
big-picture overview this is a strategic plan you will then
need to fill in the the details of that plan
specific to you and you can't just copy somebody else
you have to truly be creative fundamentally what human beings
get paid for is creativity can you come up with
a unique creative solution that means you have to actually
use your mind that means you can't just watch some
video of mine and then just copy what I do
or what I tell you to do and get the
same result because the value that I offer is precisely
that I'm thinking this [ __ ] through originally if
I'm offering any value to anybody at all it's because
there's some originality in my work now of course a
lot of my work is not original there's ideas that
I take from two thousand year old traditions you know
but but there's something original and that's the only extent
to which it's valuable to you to which I'm adding
value to society because if all I did is I
just parroted the words of the Buddha then why would
you need to listen to me you just go listen
to the Buddha you'd read books about the Buddha I
would just be a middleman so you don't want to
be a middleman you want to be an original provider
of value you got to do something new you got
to be an inventor really every good career professional who
is good at what they do and has power and
wealth the reason they have it is because they're offering
something new because fundamentally what what life is doing it's
evolving everything is evolving society's evolving culture is evolving the
economy is evolving technologies evolving everything is always changing you
can't just keep doing the [ __ ] that that
worked the last generation it doesn't work so good anymore
you got to be at the cutting edge the people
that get paid the most or the ones that are
at the cutting edge coming up with the new solutions
because that's actually what what all of existence is doing
in a sense you could think of it as God
is actually paying you money for you to come up
with new ideas that will push his entire creation forward
you are actually a part of evolution you are not
just some ape who evolved to be a human and
now you're sitting here and just kind of twiddling your
thumbs and doing stuff no like you are part of
the whole evolutionary process what are you doing to push
evolution forward if you're not doing anything to push evolution
forward that means you're one of the wage slaves you're
helping somebody else who has the ideas to push evolution
forward that's why you're working for a boss if you
are so leadership is important very very important so one
of the things that's very important for you to achieve
this goal of escaping wage slavery is to take your
power back stop looking to me or to somebody else
to lead you you got to become the leader my
job in leading you is to help you to become
a leader yourself such that then you don't need me
and you can come up with unique and original ways
to lead others that's what moves society forward what we
need is more powerful conscious passionate leaders another important pillar
of escaping wage slavery is becoming highly creative teaching yourself
how to be creative and that's not a topic I
can cover here that's a lot to say I will
have an episode in the future about how to turn
yourself into a very creative person in a practical way
so that's not just airy-fairy talk there are specific things
you can do to make yourself exceptionally creative within whatever
field whether you want to be a musician a filmmaker
a designer a programmer a writer whoever the best musicians
writers and filmmakers are always the cutting-edge ones the ones
that are doing something new and the reason they are
able to do something new is because they're highly creative
that's what creativity is creativity is a part of all
of creation everything that's happening not just human technology not
just human society but everything that's happening in all of
existence is creativity manifesting itself and you are a part
of this process and one of the greatest joys in
life is to become consciously deliberately intent phillipe art of
this process rather than the way that most sheep and
most wage slaves go about life which is that they
they completely give away all their creative power to somebody
else they abdicate this power and they don't know the
joy that comes from being a creator when you fully
tap into your creative potential you feel like God you
are your little mini god creating stuff whether it's music
or art or film or computer code and the more
creative you are the better you feel it's a super
central pillar of just having a good enjoyable life is
to be a creator you've been given this mine in
this body and all these things that you can do
with your hands with with with everything you've been given
with all the stuff that's available in society all the
information all the knowledge we have we have hundreds of
thousands millions of books full of knowledge on all sorts
of technical fields and arcane topics you can master any
one of those and then contribute to that field and
push it into new directions that's what the entire universe
is doing is its pushing in new directions in an
infinite number of dimensions and you are actually a part
of that as a human being you're part of this
divine process it's amazing it's actually a spiritual process creativity
is a deeply spiritual pursuit but most people never take
it to that level most people even if they're creative
they still don't really take it to that level so
I'm excited in the future to show you how to
do that we'll definitely talk about that you also need
to study entrepreneurship marketing and sales these are central to
your ability to escape wage slavery there's lots of courses
and resources available for you seminars and books and audio
programs DVDs you can buy and watch these are all
available for you if you would just have a clear
sense of what you wanted out of life and you
got to do a lot of research so to be
very creative you're gonna have to find your niche in
the world your niche with your career what's that unique
role that you're gonna serve so it's not enough just
to say that you're gonna be a musician or you're
gonna be a great filmmaker or a great writer that's
not enough that's a good start but not enough you
got to find your niche how are you gonna distinguish
yourself as a writer in what way what's gonna be
your specialty and to do to figure that out you
got to do a lot of research by doing lots
of reading lots of studying lots of googling and so
forth so that's the big picture now I know that's
just a loose pigpig sure there's a lot of details
that I'm leaving out here but I just want to
orient you here we're just orienting you the details get
filled in with time so don't don't worry that you
don't have all the details here yet now you might
wonder well leo but so are you saying that everybody
can escape wage slavery using this model using this game
plan and the answers definitely no in fact the vast
majority cannot because we're in a pyramid scheme in a
pyramid scheme the majority of the people need to be
slaves but you can you as an individual if you
execute this plan you can do it the problem is
that most people listening to this even though they hear
me talking about it they will never actually mobilize themselves
to actualize what I'm saying and those are the sheep
those are the ones who will end up the wage
slaves they don't have to end up that way but
statistically speaking the vast majority of people will not because
they have to but simply because they will choose not
to they won't be willing to go through the hard
work of doing it because they're not visionary enough they
don't see the value in this they're not committed enough
to going through all the obstacles that they will face
to pull this off this is not a one-year plan
so something's gonna take you 5 10 15 years to
actualize in your life but it's highly highly worth it
now you might say Oh leo but but I'm worried
about all the other people it's so depressing I mean
I would be cool with this if only all the
other people could rise with me but you're saying that
the vast majority of people will always be slaves and
that depresses me I want to help them yeah well
tough titty welcome to life this is survival survival is
a dog-eat-dog world and the fact is the most people
just complacent most people are just sheep and they're happy
being sheep so don't feel too bad for them focus
on yourself by making yourself a powerful creator and allowing
yourself to be a conscious creator not just a creator
but a conscious creator you are actually putting yourself in
the best position to help elevate mankind you're gonna help
mankind by sitting there and being a slave with them
whining and bitching and moaning about their slavery and your
slavery along with them but actually being a leader showing
people the way that's how you're gonna solve that problem
so set a good example figure it out for yourself
spend a good 15 years figuring out for yourself and
then let's talk about how you feel about the rest
of the world and also never forget that you should
be grateful that you're not an actual slave right now
I need an actual physical slave it's not that long
ago that you would have been one if you were
born just a few centuries prior if you were born
in ancient were ancient Rome for example you would have
probably been a slave 40 percent of all Roman citizens
or Roman people or slaves 2,000 years ago so just
the fact that you're not even a physical slave right
now you should be thankful every single day for that
there are still people today right now in certain African
countries and elsewhere who are slaves so really the only
reason you're a slave right now in if you're living
in a decent country is because you're a slave of
your own mind and that's a very powerful thing to
realize because you can you can change your mind that's
why the mind is great you can't really change your
body your body's pretty fixed but your mind is flexible
it's not that flexible it's still pretty rigid most people
are stubborn and [ __ ] dogmatic as hell but
uh but it's still possible to shift your mind takes
work takes years sometimes but it's possible is escaping wage
slavery right for everybody no you need to determine whether
it's right for you you need to determine whether you
are okay with being a sheep some people are some
people are some people are happy working at the post
office for 40 years just showing up punching the clock
putting in their eight hours of work not thinking just
kind of licking stamps or something and they're happy with
that if that's you you know if you have that
kind of temperament it's a temperamental thing like for me
if I had to do that I would I would
kill myself rather than work at the post office for
40 years looking stamps I would kill myself but maybe
for you it's fine maybe you're happy with that okay
if that's you you're fat you're happy with that then
we got no problem here then just kind of accept
that you're a sheep forget about this whole conversation forget
about the whole pyramid and just enjoy your life as
you can now you might wonder leo is it possible
to enjoy life as a sheep I mean relatively speaking
like you can if you're living in a decent country
and you find a relatively decent job that pays you
enough and whatever and you don't get fired and I
mean you can you can kind of like coast by
and it'll be sort of an average mediocre kind of
life you won't be you know you know you won't
work too hard you won't rack your mind too much
and you'll probably have some ups have some downs but
overall I'll just kind of be like a 5 5
out of 10 that's one like what your life will
be if you're in a decent country and maybe you're
fine with that but then there are those of us
who are not fine with that and those of us
who really want to be passionate about life those of
us who really want to make the most of life
those are us who are conscious that we were born
here for a purpose and that we want to live
life to the hilt and we want to become as
conscious as possibly want to develop ourselves we want to
push ourselves to the cutting edge we want to be
those who are pushing evolution forward those who are transforming
society those who are uplifting mankind we want something more
and we don't want to be sheep and if you
if you are like that and you consign yourself to
being a sheep you're gonna be very miserable very miserable
so watch out I recommend that you set a goal
for yourself to escape wage slavery I think this is
one of the most powerful goals you can set in
your life especially if you're one of these people who
isn't super spiritually oriented yet maybe you're just not at
a high level of development where you're you're ready to
go for enlightenment yet you're what ready to go for
meditating your ass off and the sort of stuff maybe
that stuff doesn't quite resonate with you yet one of
the next best things you can do is set this
goal because then it will create the foundation for you
for everything else in your life this is one of
the most important things that I've done for myself that
has enabled conscious living and personal development in my life
I did this about ten years ago I saw the
power of this goal I worked pretty hard to to
make it work I had to be very clever and
resourceful and I was able to succeed in that and
it's only thanks to that that actualized that exists there
could not have been actualized Org if I had not
first escaped wage slavery could not be possible and that's
the great tragedy of being a wage slave is that
there are millions of people out there right now who
are where I was 10 years ago who had some
ambition some higher inkling of a vision but they didn't
know how to actualize it they weren't free to actualize
it because they were a wage slave and they had
no clear path forward no plan no idea that it
was possible or even worthwhile to do and so there
are millions of people out there right now who who
can be doing amazing things in the world contributing amazing
things to mankind analogous to maybe what actualize that org
is by which I don't mean that you become impersonal
Don the teacher that's not what I'm trying to get
you to do I'm not trying to turn everyone here
into a guru no what I mean is your analog
to a cleanser order actually is always like my pet
project it's my purpose you see so your pet project
your purpose doesn't have to be about that it could
be making films it could be about shooting porn it
could be about I don't know inventing stuff for children
it could be about reforming education system it could be
about creating some new fuel energy technology that saves the
environment or whatever right it has nothing to do with
personal development but one thing that's really good is that
when you escape wage slavery you have more time more
freedom and more autonomy which means not only can you
work on your own pet projects more and live up
to your own values more not having to listen to
others dictate to you what you should do or how
you should live your life but you also now have
free time to delve deeply into personal development self education
spirituality and that's just something most people can't do most
people can't self actualize because they simply spend ten hours
a day at work they're dead tired by time to
come home and that's it they have no more free
time all their time is sucked up by this wage
slavery and what can you do in that situation well
I suggest you bite the bullet you assess the depth
of your problem and you connect with something deeper inside
yourself and you really commit to to solving this permanently
once and for all it doesn't mean you solve it
one day or one year but you start to hatch
the plan do you sort of think about it sir
to lay the groundwork sure to figure it out if
you're young you're at the perfect time to think about
this and if you're already older if you're in your
30s and 40s and 50s don't don't fret you can
still work on this it'll be harder of course it's
harder yes you might have pissed away your your youth
doing stupid things but hey you got to do that
you have to do that because hmm you didn't know
any better but now you do now you have at
least some kind of skeleton of a plan now you
see the value of it where before in your 20s
you couldn't see the value of it you were too
myopic that's life we do stupid things because we're myopic
and ignorant so if you're on board with this I
recommend you set as a plan full financial independence or
as a goal rather full financial independence I recommend that
you align your full financial independence with your life purpose
such that not only are you fully financially independent that's
really not that big of an accomplishment an even better
accomplishment is to be aligned with your life purpose offering
massive value to mankind helping to elevate mankind is some
specific way that's meaningful to you and I also recommend
that you set as a goal for yourself that if
you died the very next day thousands of people should
be in pain and in mourning crying over the fact
that they have been denied value from you like if
I died tomorrow a lot of people would be upset
now why would they be upset is it because they
care about me really no nobody really gives a [
__ ] about me the only reason that people would
cry over me is because I offer a lot of
value to you so it's a selfish thing right it's
purely selfish the only reason you like me or care
about me is because I offer value to you that's
it it's a very utilitarian thing and as soon as
I stop offering value to me you stop caring about
me that's pretty much how it works you have no
real love for me so let's not kid ourselves here
so so set that as a goal for yourself try
to get to point in life where you're just offering
so much value to people you're uplifting so many people
so many people are reliant on your leadership to show
them the way in whatever way you're doing it that
they would be lost without you that's how you know
that you're actually playing a really meaningful crucial role in
society and of course if you ever get to that
point then you don't have to worry very much about
your finances you'll be taken care of if you're gonna
execute this plan brace yourself for hard work there will
be some hard work ahead some late nights brace yourself
for loneliness brace yourself for some suffering brace yourself with
you know feeling very confused and lost sometimes sometimes feeling
totally stuck not knowing what the next step is you're
gonna have to go through all that I got to
push through all of that that's all par for the
course the paradox was trying to escape wage slavery is
of course that to escape slavery you're gonna have to
work your ass off to do it but the upside
is that you'll work your ass off for a few
years but eventually we'll get to a certain point where
you can you can ease up you'll have more free
time and then you'll be able to do more of
these other kinds of activities more time for hobbies more
time for your family more time for personal development spirituality
and so forth and so you really can have the
best of both worlds that's one of the nice things
about the pyramid structure is that it's precisely because there
are many people in the world who are willing to
be sheep and don't have any clear sense of direction
don't want to be leaders they want to be led
that you can rise up and become a leader for
them so that's sort of the silver lining of the
pyramid there's a deep wisdom to the pyramid don't think
that this pyramid is some sort of evil Machiavellian constructure
construction of the human mind no it's actually a deeply
wise structure of all of nature and so you got
to figure out where you need to be situated in
that pyramid and to help you to to actualize all
this I have the life purpose course the life purpose
course is what I created it's an or 25 hour
long course that talks in depth in a lot more
depth than I talked about here about all the principles
that I use to figure this out for myself it's
definitely not going to solve all your problems it's not
going to answer all of your questions but it will
help you to to get the most important thing right
which is to figure out your values to figure out
your your clarity of intent and your purpose so that
you know what you're really doing you get that very
crystal clear and then you can really get to work
so if you want to check that out you can
find that at actualized org now you might wonder well
Leo but aren't you just pitching a pyramid scheme here
it sounds like you were criticizing pyramid schemes and and
now all of this was just so that I buy
your life purpose course no because see unlike typical sort
of like business in a box solutions that you can
buy out there some sort of get-rich-quick scheme the life
purpose course is not a get-rich-quick quick scheme it's actually
like a rich slow scheme very slow scheme it gives
you principles so actually and the reason I made it
that way principle based is precisely because I'm conscious of
this sort of pyramid scheme concept not any one on
one of those people that sells you on a scheme
that only works for those people who are selling you
the scheme these are timeless principles that will apply for
hundreds of years to come for anybody who wants to
develop a sense of direction in their life and build
a really powerful creative career and become a creative genius
this is what you need is to follow these principles
now of course how many people will actually be able
to follow these principles very few not because they can't
not because it's a zero-sum game but simply because they're
not motivated enough they don't take it seriously enough it
takes enormous work to actualize your life purpose takes a
lot of work just to get through the course but
if you're serious about it I think it's really worth
worth your time I get a lot of positive testimonials
every week every month from people who have told me
that the course has transformed their whole life giving them
a whole new sense of meaning and purpose and direction
in life that they they wouldn't have had otherwise and
and I know the power of that because I feel
it in my own life these days I take it
actually for granted I sort of forget nowadays that I
even created the course I sort of forget that I
even went through the course myself in a sense to
create it I sort of forget the fact that I'm
even living my life purpose because it's sort of like
just the norm for me now I can't even imagine
a life otherwise but then I think back to how
I used to live five ten years ago and man
I remember the suffering and how bad it was um
so yeah sometimes like I just got to remind myself
sometimes got to remind myself of how conscious I'd be
cover the last five years it's crazy because the ego
see the ego never is satisfied with anything so it's
just always chasing after more and more and more even
with consciousness you become conscious even you be able enlightened
you're gonna take it all completely for granted it's just
gonna become your new norm so we always have to
kind of stay vigilant against that and and appreciate the
things we have gratitude is a very important component of
success and of personal development precisely because we grow so
much we grow so fast that we we take it
for granted unless we are proactively grateful for the things
we got alright that's it I'm out of here please
remember to click that like button for me and come
check out actualize that org that's where your final life
purpose course the book list the blog the forum where
you can go and discuss this stuff and the last
thing I'll tell you is that it's not really enough
to be enlightened there's more to life than just enlightenment
yes enlightenment is great spirituality is great but also very
practically speaking I think a very important component or pillar
of living the good life is yes you want to
become hyper [ __ ] conscious and you want to
become enlightened but you also want to engineer a conscious
way of making a living I think that that's a
component that a lot of spiritual teachers miss they just
don't talk about it but I think it's a really
important component because half of your waking life will be
spent on work whether you like it or not even
if you're enlightened you could be enlightened but you could
be working for you know some gun manufacturer in some
Factory and maybe you're cool with that but I would
suggest you would be even more happy if you were
enlightened and that also you had designed for yourself some
sort of conscious way of making a conscious living and
contributing to the elevation of mankind in whatever way is
meaningful to you in whatever way you're passionate about and
that's why life purpose is still an important topic of
discussion even if you have figured out non-duality and that's
why actualize that org is not just talking about non
duality but it's talking about other things like life purpose
business topics and creativity how to be creative and many
other topics because what I'm interested altum Utley is I'm
interested in how do I create an amazing life how
do I get the most out of my life yes
a huge important component of that is Awakening but there
are other components that also need to be studied and
seriously researched and discussed there are political facets there are
relationships there there's health and fitness there's nutrition there's I
mean there's life purpose there's career there's so much so
in the future we're not just gonna be talking about
enlightenment we're also gonna be talking about all these other
topics and when we all bring it all together and
that's one of the unique things I think about actualize
that org is that we do take this sort of
holistic approach to creating a good life which I don't
see that many people out there doing most people are
siloed teaching one very narrow specific thing about something they
might tell you how to get your relationship right they
might tell you how to get enlightened or something like
that along those lines how to start a business but
they don't bring it all together and show you how
all the pieces can fit together that's quite rare and
so that's one of my missions with actualize that organs
to is to show you how all the pieces fit
together so don't get too narrow-minded about these topics sometimes
I hear people saying oh Leo what's the point of
talking about this so I'll just mental masturbation it's all
just a distraction from enlightenment no there's a lot of
stuff that you need in your life and actualize that
org is sort like a university we're trying to cover
lots of topics we're not like a narrow trade school
it's not an enlightenment trade school if you want that
go join us a temple and all they talk about
is enlightenment of course most of them have very unrounded
lives and they're still part of an pyramid in that
Zen temple the only reason that Sun Temple survived is
because they have like some donors that they milk every
single month to pay for them and they have a
hierarchy structure they got the amongst the bottom who are
cleaning toilets with with toothbrushes every day all right so
uh you probably don't want to be one of those
toilet cleaning monks or maybe you do I don't know
figure it out for yourself you
