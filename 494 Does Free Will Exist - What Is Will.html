            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-GZSsI3aaI8' target='_blank'>Does Free Will Exist - What Is Will</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding of Free Will and Will</b>: Leo Gura believes that free will and the concept of will are extremely complex concepts. He asserts that understanding these notions requires deep contemplation and multiple awakenings and claims to have reached a new level of understanding after over a hundred awakenings.
</li><li><b>Will as a Distinction</b>: Reality, according to Gura, is an infinite field of consciousness that creates distinctions such as freedom and constraint, or control and lack of control. The concept of will is also considered a distinction.
</li><li><b>Controller vs Controlled</b>: When discussing the question of free will, Gura speaks of the divide between the controller (the human) and the controlled (the universe). He notes the paradox that on one hand it seems like the universe affects man (for instance, one cannot control DNA or their birth), on the other it seems like man has some control over the universe (like steering a car or building a house).
</li><li><b>The Effect of Personal Identity on Free Will</b>: He argues that one's definition of "you" is crucial when pondering the question of control. If one identifies as separate from the universe, they cannot control it. However, by identifying as the entire universe and not simply as human, the perspective on control changes.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Universe's Control</b>: Leo mentions that the universe, being an infinite field of consciousness with no outside, is controlled by itself and not by any external forces. The notion of controlling and controlled entities requires a distinction within the universe, and such a distinction is not fundamental.
</li><li><b>Fundamental Concepts for Understanding Free Will</b>: He asserts that understanding the concepts of control, freedom, and distinctions is fundamental for grasping the concept of free will. Accepting that reality is an infinite field of consciousness and imagining distinctions within this field are important steps towards understanding these concepts.
</li><li><b>The Concept of Control</b>: The idea of control, specifically the relationship between a controller and the controlled, is discussed. To illustrate this, a puppet master controlling a puppet is brought up. If the puppet and the puppet master are seen as one entity, we might say that it controls itself. This raises questions about the nature of control as it relates to our identities and whether we see ourselves as separate beings or part of a greater whole.
</li><li><b>Understanding Freedom</b>: The discussion then turns to the concept of freedom and what it actually entails. It's argued that freedom is a more profound idea than most people realize and its understanding requires deep contemplation. Freedom is inherently dualistic, as certain conditions limit and define freedom. Leo challenges the common understanding of freedombeing able to do whatever one wantsby citing physical limitations such as our inability to jump 50 feet high.
</li><li><b>The Role of Identity</b>: Leo argues that our identity plays a crucial role in our perceptions of limitations and freedom. If we regard ourselves as separate from the world, we may see external factors (like gravity) as constraints. If we see ourselves as part of everythingthe entire universethen our perspective changes. A new question is raised, "Is the universe as a whole free to behave however it wishes?"
</li><li><b>Universe as a Whole</b>: The understanding of the universe as a whole is that it has no outside influences, so nothing outside the universe can constrain it. Leo notes that even restrictions, such as physical or logical laws, are part of the universe. Therefore, they do not truly constrain the universe if our definition of the universe includes everything.
</li><li><b>Absolute Freedom</b>: Leo puts forth an idea that, since the universe can define, create or constrain itself however it wants, it can also choose to have no constraints at all. This means the universe is absolutely freethere's nothing outside the universe dictating what it should be or how it should behave. In this context, the universe is self-defining, self-creating, and self-constraining.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Free Will</b>: The discussion now moves to the concept of will and its relation to the universe. If one becomes infinitely aware that one's identity encompasses the entire universe, they realize that everything that happens or exists in the universe is a manifestation of the universe's will. This realization includes the fact that physical, material manifestation is the manifestation of the universe's will. Leo makes the profound statement that all material objects are identical to will. This means that everything, including inanimate objects like chairs and rocks, are manifestations of the universe's will. This overturns the traditional human-centric view that only human minds possess will.
</li><li><b>Human Notions of Will</b>: Leo argues that humans only consider their own personal will when understanding the larger concept of universal will. They do not care about the will of the entire universe or other beings, but only concern themselves with their personal will, using it to manipulate their environment to survive. This human-centric view severely limits the concept of the universe's infinite will, narrowing it down to just the small portion a human ego mind perceives as its own will.
</li><li><b>Human Being's Struggle Like a Hummingbird in a Hurricane</b>: Leo compares our struggle with life to a hummingbird in a hurricane. We have control like the hummingbird does over its flight. But, similar to the overpowering elements in the hurricane, we can often feel frustrated, unhappy, and tired due to unforeseen circumstances.
</li><li><b>Redefining Identity and Increasing Self-Control</b>: Leo challenges the restricted view of our identity. He suggests that maybe we're not the struggling hummingbird; perhaps we are the entire hurricane including the bird. While this radical shift does not grant the hummingbird (us) more control, it does increase our capacity for self-control by expanding our perspective and definition of self. 
</li><li><b>Universe as A Mental System</b>: The universe is not physical but a mental system, a field of consciousness. If we are fully awakened (infinite consciousness), we would realize everything happens as a result of our manifestation and our infinite will (including every physical object around us). 
</li><li><b>Ego and Infinite Will</b>: As we move closer to infinite will, ego diminishes, lessening our attachment to our personal needs and biases. This eradicates the need to manipulate reality, and the perception of problems with reality itself. At this peak level of consciousness, you can't use infinite will to manipulate life for personal benefits. 
</li><li><b>Surrender and Acceptance</b>: When you identify as God and become conscious of the interconnectedness of everything, you surrender to your own will. This is an acceptance of life's flow, leading you to realize that life is perfect just as it is, flowing in the best possible way because it is an expression of God's, and therefore your own, perfect will.
</li><li><b>Physical Things as Will</b>: Will encompasses every physical thing that is occurring or has ever occurred in life. Physical things are not merely material, they are denser forms of mind stuff, distinctions imagined within the mind of God. 
</li><li><b>God Consciousness and Infinite Will</b>: Paradoxically, upon reaching God consciousness, you realize that your own will has manifested everything that is happening now. Despite feeling powerless, the expression of free will is present, but not in the way our ego perceives it. Rather it is the manifestation of God's will and thus our own. 
</li><li><b>Free Will in Amalgamation With Divine Will</b>: The non-dual nature of God's will and our own is celebrated. We are not separate from God, or the universe. By recognizing this we can more effortlessly flow with life, improve our circumstances, and better understand our inherent will. This is contrary to the claim that free will doesn't exist, a viewpoint many spiritual teachers espouse. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Will and Universal Mind</b>: Will is not nonexistent as some scientists argue, but is omnipresent and infinite. Every action, including the simple act of moving one's hand, is directed by the universal will, also referred to as God's will. This intriguing realization arises when we identify ourselves as the whole universe rather than an individual part. 
</li><li><b>God and Infinite consciousness</b>: God is a state of infinite consciousness, interconnected with every element within the universe, functioning flawlessly and intelligently. God's will is not about control but about aligning with this intelligent flow or universal mind. 
</li><li><b>Logic vs Universal Mind</b>: Logical reasoning, scientific understanding, and language are all finite, dualistic, and cannot truly grasp the concept of God, which is a universal, non-dual entity. The understanding and acceptance of God requires transcending these limitations and recognizing the interconnectedness of all living and non-living entities.
</li><li><b>Struggle vs Flow</b>: Struggling to manipulate reality for personal gain exhausts one's energy and leads to emotional and physical illnesses. This attitude stems from the misconception of self being separate from the universe. However, by recognizing oneself as part of the universe, one can let go of their struggles and tap into the energy and potential of the infinite flow. 
</li><li><b>Attachment and Surrender</b>: Embracing the belief that one is the universe eliminates the necessity for attachment to material objects or people. Surrendering these attachments allows alignment with higher universal intelligence and will, leading to an effortless life of flow. 
</li><li><b>Universal Mind and Self-definition</b>: Every individual, using their complex human mind, is a manifestation of the universal mind. Recognizing oneself as the whole universe allows one to create their own destiny, without relying on external constraints like logic, physics, or other potential minds.
</li><li><b>Oneness and Omnipotence</b>: Oneness signifies omnipotence, i.e., possessing immense power to manifest any imaginable reality. However, grasping this concept requires one to be conscious of their entire self, and how they contribute to the construct of the universe.
</li><li><b>Gods will and Love</b>: God's will can imagine anything into existence without obstructions. However, the only constraint on God's will is that it must be based on absolute love. This leads to the connection of love, will, and freedom. The highest level of intelligence and consciousness is invariably directed toward the manifestation of infinite love.
</li><li><b>Understanding of God and Infinite Consciousness</b>: The concepts of love, intelligence, consciousness, truth, goodness, and god are perceived as identical and undistinguishable at the highest level of intelligence, love, and will. This omnipotent level is used towards manifesting the entire dreamlike material world, and it must not be used for selfish purposes.
</li><li><b>Example of Healing through Infinite Consciousness</b>: An example is presented where an individual desires to heal a loved one's severe illness (like cancer) through achieving an infinite level of consciousness. It is emphasized that such outcomes are not determined by one's desires but by the "highest love." If the highest love dictates healing or not healing, then the result is best either way.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Highest Love's Outcome</b>: Individuals are encouraged to surrender their consciousness to the flow of infinite intelligence and love, accepting the will of god or the "highest love." This surrender goes beyond acceptance, to becoming the will of god and trusting its perfect judgment even in tragic circumstances.
</li><li><b>Bias Influencing Perception of Highest Good</b>: Biases, attachments, neediness, ego, fear, and suffering distort one's perception of the highest good. The ultimate understanding of this highest good requires infinite intelligence and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Cancer Case as Example of Highest Good</b>: Using the cancer case as an example, it is explained how one's suffering (from eating unhealthy food all life and developing cancer as a result), might serve the highest good of the universe. Because the individuals who create and consume such unhealthy food did so out of selfish or careless desires, they bear the responsibility for their actions and their consequences.  
</li><li><b>Human Responsibility in Creating Societal Structures</b>: God provided humans with the freedom to shape their societies, including the creation and provision of food. Owing to this freedom, the responsibility lies with humans to create systems that prioritize health and well-being, rather than indulging in selfish desires.
</li><li><b>Learning from Mistakes to Achieve Higher Good</b>: The highest good, becoming god-like, is achieved not by having a problem-free life provided by an external entity, but by figuring things out for oneself, making mistakes, learning, and evolving from those mistakes. 
</li><li><b>Surrender of Selfishness for True Awakening</b>: Becoming god-like entails the surrender and relinquishing of selfishness, bias, manipulation, dishonesty, and attachment. Problems created by humans can only be changed by taking responsibility and offloading responsibility on external entities inhibits an awakening to one's God-self.
</li><li><b>Understanding God's Power</b>: God's power should not be viewed as means to satisfy personal needs or attachments. Although humans can manipulate reality to a certain extent, it is a limited method. Aligning with God's intelligence and love flows into a state where actions become imbued with higher intelligence and goodness.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Spiritual Work and Consciousness</b>: Spiritual work's purpose is to shed the ego and elevate consciousness, becoming a vessel for divine intelligence. Concept of flow explained through the example of learning to ride a bicycle. The concept of flow requires self-consciousness and a practice of letting go of fear and tension for mastery.
</li><li><b>God's Will is Absolute Love</b>: At the highest level of consciousness, God's will is perceived as necessary and absolute love. This concept is beyond the perception of the logical mind as it is viewed as infinite, non-dualistic, and able to perceive an infinite number of moves in advance. Achieving this level of consciousness is not easy and requires surrender of one's pride, selfishness and the recognition that every moment is a manifestation of one's own will. It is a self-conscious recognition that all happenings in life are an outcome of one's will under the exercise of absolute love.
</li><li><b>On seeking higher consciousness</b>:Leo stresses the importance of wanting to become God and love. He suggests that one can't truly love if they're selfish, afraid, biased, manipulative, and dishonest, as love represents truth. 
</li><li><b>Taking responsibility for your life</b>: He emphasizes taking ownership of the life one creates and refrains from blaming others for the current state of their life. Leo stresses taking responsibility for how one defines themselves, instead of letting science, religion, or any other source define them.
</li><li><b>Shifting blame</b>: He mentions that people often attribute their shortcomings and failures to others, such as religious figures, gurus, parents, colleagues, etc. This tendency to shift blame and responsibility prevents people from realizing their God self as they refuse to accept that they are constructing their own reality. 
</li><li><b>Realizing you are god</b>: To attain the highest levels of God consciousness, one must take complete responsibility for everything they've created in their life and stop blaming others. This entails taking full responsibility of one's thinking patterns, emotions, and relationships. A lack of responsibility prevents one from realizing their God self.
</li><li><b>God's paradoxical free will</b>: God has free will but in a paradoxical sense it doesn't, as all of its free will has been given to infinite love. God is content with this as there is no higher purpose than the manifestation of infinite love. 
</li><li><b>Limited perspective on God's powerlessness</b>: From a human perspective, God might appear powerless and weak as we can't manipulate our circumstances to fulfill our selfish desires. However, this is not true from an infinite perspective. Sacrificing the universe for one's petty needs is the true weakness.
</li><li><b>Manipulating reality</b>: Humans can manipulate reality to a certain degree. However, this manipulative strategy is a finite game that ultimately fails. Actions guided by alignment with God's intelligence results in a state of flow and leads to actions imbued with higher intelligence, love, and goodness. 
</li><li><b>Emptying oneself of ego</b>: The purpose of spiritual work is to eliminate ego and raise consciousness to become a vessel for God's intelligence. Achieving a state of flow signifies becoming one with the universe, and all actions are naturally guided by love and intelligence. Practicing self-consciousness is crucial and not many spiritual teachers correctly identify this due to a lack of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding reality</b>: Understanding reality requires deep levels of holistic god realization that is not easily attained through basic meditative practices or self inquiries. Its important to recognize that everything happening at the present moment is a manifestation of ones own will. Without this consciousness, true awakening is not possible. Leo concludes by wishing viewers good luck in cultivating this consciousness and urges them to not stop their spiritual work until they become directly conscious of what will truly is.
