            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of Mindset and Emotional Connection</b>: Leo Gura stresses that it's not solely about the fingering technique in making a girl squirt, but more about the mindset and emotions you put into it. The key is making her feel safe, secure, relaxed, and open by breaking down any psychological sexual barriers she may have.
</li><li><b>Criteria for Applying the Technique</b>: This technique rests on a certain level of intimacy, and therefore shouldn't be tried with a girl you're having sex with for the first time or haven't had sex with frequently. Leo suggests it can be useful to spice things up when things become a bit stale or with someone you have an established sexual relationship with, such as a girlfriend or wife.
</li><li><b>Squirt Capabilities</b>: While not all girls will spontaneously squirt due to varying comfort levels and openness about their sexuality, Leo suggests that most girls do have the potential to squirt if they are made to feel comfortable, intimate, and aware that they have this capability. Erecting a barrier of comfort and intimacy is therefore necessary.
</li><li><b>Ideal Conditions</b>: A relaxed ambiance is crucial for this process, including a private and uninterrupted setting. He recommends massaging her to make her relaxed and physically stimulate her, without directly going for intimate areas.
</li><li><b>Building Intimacy</b>: Leo discusses the need to form a deep connection by looking into her eyes and expressing affection. Creating a special experience and not rushing the process is emphasized.
</li><li><b>Fingering Technique Introduction</b>: Upon building the right intimacy and comfort levels, Leo then shifts the talk to the fingering technique, emphasizing that its complexity is secondary to the mindset and emotions involved.
</li><li><b>Building intimacy and setting up for squirting</b>: Leo emphasizes creating an environment and using communication methods that make the girl comfortable with the idea of squirting. He emphasizes the importance of expressing your love for the act, assuring her that you'll guide her through the process, and suppressing any fears she might have, such as being judged or putting pressure on her. Leo also suggests building a dominant-submissive dynamic where you lead and she follows.
</li><li><b>Addressing concerns surrounding the act</b>: Leo discusses the importance of dispelling misconceptions about squirting being similar to peeing. He advises explicitly telling her that pushing during orgasm will lead to squirting and not peeing. This encouragement is crucial to making her comfortable with the idea of trying to squirt.
</li><li><b>Techniques for squirting</b>: Leo outlines the physical positioning and fingering technique that can facilitate squirting. He advises the viewer to position themselves next to their partner, with their arm between her legs. He stresses the importance of starting slowly and building up the stimulation, using a pressing and releasing motion against the upper wall of the vagina where the G-spot is located.
</li><li><b>The right conditions for squirting</b>: Leo points out that the woman needs to be extremely aroused and wet before attempting to make her squirt, as insufficient lubrication can lead to discomfort. He introduced various signals of an impending orgasm essential for adjusting the timing and pressure. These signals include moaning, dirty talk, and closer eye contact.
</li><li><b>Building Up To Female Orgasm</b>: Leo insists on focusing on increasing the speed and pressure of stimulation as the woman gets closer to orgasm. He suggests this progression should involve a pumping motion against the upper wall of the vagina, turning into a back-and-forth motion. This process requires significant strength and endurance of the hand, advising the use of the dominant hand.
</li><li><b>Recognizing and Reacting to the 'Coming' Signs</b>: Paying attention to cues that indicate the woman is nearing orgasm is highly important. These cues may be moaning in a certain way, moving her hips and body in a special manner, or verbally indicating her orgasm is about to happen. Upon recognizing these signals, it is crucial to establish a deep and intimate connection with her.
</li><li><b>Role of Vocal Guidance</b>: As she approaches orgasm, Leo underscores the importance of explicitly instructing her to squirt and push using her muscles to aid the release of fluids. This communication should ideally be timed in the last 5-10 seconds before her orgasm and can be continued afterwards to help extend her orgasm.
</li><li><b>Continued Stimulation Post Orgasm</b>: Leo advocates for continuing the stimulation even after her orgasm to potentially achieve extended and multiple orgasms. After the peak, the intensity of stimulation can be reduced, although maintaining a certain level of pressure can potentially lead to more orgasms.
</li><li><b>Physical Effort Required for the Stimulation</b>: Emphasizing that the technique can be strenuous, Leo notes that arm and finger strength is crucial for delivering the pressure consistently. As such, he recommends exercises to strengthen these muscles for this sexual activity. 
</li><li><b>Building up Intimacy Through Sexual Exploration</b>: Leo suggests helping a woman explore her sexuality and break societal conditioning can greatly enhance the couple's intimacy. By demonstrating that she can squirt, she may have an unexplored sexual experience that can make her highly attracted to the partner.
</li><li><b>Going beyond sex life to master oneself</b>: Leo argues the need to focus not just on sex life, but also other aspects of life like relationships, understanding female psychology, and creating an awesome life. Developing oneself can lead to adventurous, regret-free lives, which can also positively impact relationships. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org Website</b>: Leo recommends signing up for their newsletter to receive free articles and weekly updates. Such resources can help individuals become better versions of themselves and improve their relationships and success in various areas of life.
