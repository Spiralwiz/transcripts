He emphasizes the need to view sex as an emotional activity rather than a mechanical one, and introduces techniques to heighten emotions during sex.

</li><li><b>Increasing intimacy and communication in a relationship</b>: Leo Gura advises individuals in a relationship to be more open, caring, and loving. This involves sharing a special, deep level of understanding and intimate experiences unique to both parties. He notes that intimacy is not just about the words spoken but majorly about the tone with which they are spoken. He recommends a softer, more loving, and compassionate tone, reassuring in nature. He suggests whispering as an intimate way of communicating, especially during sexual encounters. Gura states that building intimacy also requires gentle physical touch like caressing the face or the body, large amounts of kissing, and extended cuddle periods.
</li><li><b>Importance of intimacy in a relationship</b>: Gura proposes that some people may have difficulty being intimate due to previous bad experiences, but it is something that can be worked on, possibly with a therapist. He suggests that intimacy takes a relationship to a level beyond a regular friendship or familial relationship. He emphasizes that intimate communication should be practiced and may even need to be written down and memorised for better results. 
</li><li><b>Sex positions for intimacy</b>: Gura suggests that certain sex positions, such as the missionary position, can create intimacy due to the face-to-face and full body contact it provides. He noted the importance of saying "I love you" if comfortable within the relationship status and also subtly introduced the intimate act of having condom-free sex while using other protective measures.
</li><li><b>Physical actions to increase intimacy</b>: Gura emphasizes the role of holding hands, cuddling, and engaging in public displays of affection for intimacy. He points out that little actions all add to build intimacy. 
</li><li><b>Achieving deep intimacy</b>: Leo Gura indicates that for people in a relationship, achieving deep intimacy might require overcoming some personal obstacles, such as past traumas. He advises those people to seek professional help and work it out. He asserts that the tone of intimate talk should be soft, reassuring, and compassionate, and could be enhanced by whispering during sex. 
</li><li><b>Significance of dominance in a relationship</b>: Leo Gura expands on the significance of dominance in a relationship, stating that the masculine in a male partner brings out the feminine in their female counterpart, creating a strong, intimate charge in the relationship. He highlights fierce eye contact as a way to convey dominance, alternating between a loving look and an intense, fierce look.
</li><li><b>Dominance through non-verbal communication</b>: Leo explains how a dominant, fierce look in your eyes conveys confidence and desirability, which can be appealing to women. A hesitant or weak look can potentially communicate uncertainty, which may negatively impact the perception of dominance.
</li><li><b>Using sounds as a form of dominance</b>: Leo suggests that growling, a deep, guttural sound, can communicate dominance. This method can especially effective during sex in positions where the partner is near your throat and can feel the vibrations. Smaller growls even outside the bedroom are also suggested to have a positive effect on women.
</li><li><b>Dominance through slight physical roughness</b>: Leo discusses biting of the neck as another form of dominance, advising to start lightly and gauge the partner's tolerance. The neck region is described as sensitive and receptive to this kind of touch.
</li><li><b>Dominant talk for dominance</b>: Dominant talk in the bedroom is another method suggested by Leo for increasing dominance in the bedroom. Using authoritative language and a dominant tonality in statements made during sex can increase a sense of dominance. Using such words as commands rather than requests is suggested. However, Leo makes it clear that this is not a license to be abusive.
</li><li><b>Rough physical touch for dominance</b>: For enhancing dominance, Leo suggests gripping various parts of the body and restraining hands. Jerking motions and restraining of hands are mentioned as potentially enhancing dominance. Leo stresses the importance of safety, communication, and consent when trying these methods to ensure comfort.
</li><li><b>Dominance through tearing off clothes</b>: Leo mentions that tearing off a partner's undergarments can demonstrate dominance. However, he advises against damaging expensive clothing and insists on making sure that the partner does not get hurt during the process.
</li><li><b>Dominance and role-play</b>: Leo discusses the concept of engaging in domination role-play but stresses the importance of making sure it is consensual and never crosses into non-consensual acts. He clarifies that playing into fantasies is not an endorsement for actual non-consensual acts.
</li><li><b>Dominance and Intimacy Techniques</b>: Leo Gura provides many techniques to increase dominance and intimacy in an intimate relationship. 
</li><li>- He suggests using inexpensive neckties as convenient tools to incorporate light bondage into play; they could be used to tie hands or feet or to connect a partner to a bedpost. 
</li><li>- Another way discussed involves tying a necktie around her hands and throwing the tie over a door to immobilize her in a certain position. 
</li><li>- Other dominant actions incorporated include the 'door slam' or 'wall slam', where he talks about pinning her against a wall or door, with care taken to avoid potential injuries. 
</li><li>- Leo encourages exploration with biting, spanking, and choking during sexual encounters, cautioning careful communication and ensuring partner safety. 
</li><li>- Certain dominant sex positions are recommended such as doggy style with spanking and slamming, sex standing up, and sex on furniture like a table. 
</li><li>- Leo emphasizes on maintaining a commanding mentality by leading and initiating sex as a form of dominance.
</li><li>- He warns against hesitation and advises being confident, stating that if tried something confidently and it doesn't work, women will often forgive you and appreciate the effort. 
</li><li>- Leo suggests it's essential to improvise and be tactful when needed. He encourages viewers to experiment around with these suggestions responsibly.
</li><li><b>Confidence in the bedroom</b>: Leo emphasizes that hesitation and insecurity are turn-offs. He encourages viewers to approach sex with a dominant attitude, asserting that they're there to ravish their partner. This involves expressing urges authentically and assuming their actions will be welcomed. 
</li><li><b>Mixing intimacy and dominance</b>: To maintain a dynamic, thrilling sexual experience, Leo suggests alternating between intimate and dominant actions, creating what he calls the "sweet and sour combo." For example, following a deeply affectionate sentiment with a dominant statement could be a powerful way to keep the experience exciting and unpredictable.
</li><li><b>Importance of variety</b>: To avoid sex becoming stale and monotonous, Leo encourages viewers to use variety. This involves changing up sex positions, phrases used, and locations. The goal is to make the experience unpredictable and adventurous. 
</li><li><b>Planning and preparation</b>: Leo emphasizes the significance of planning different types of sexual experiences, reflecting on them, and ensuring all necessary items are available. As the dominant one, it's the man's responsibility to set the pace and ensure everything is in place.
</li><li><b>Practicing with committed partners</b>: For the effective implementation of these techniques, Leo recommends practicing with a partner who's sexually curious and adventurous, preferably a girlfriend. One-night stands don't provide the consistency or depth of connection needed for effective practice.
</li><li><b>Focusing on pleasing the partner</b>: Leo argues that most guys fail in the bedroom because they don't care about pleasing their partner. He stresses that amazing sex involves creating an unforgettable experience for both parties involved. He encourages viewers to derive as much pleasure from their partner's satisfaction as they do from their own. 
</li><li><b>Continuing personal development and growth</b>: Leo finishes his talk by promoting his newsletter, which provides weekly tips on improving various aspects of life  from sex and relationships to finances and personal psychology. He highlights the importance of taking small weekly steps towards personal development, to lead a fulfilling and extraordinary life.
