[Music] this episode's going to be very practical so pay
attention this will change your life right here this one
simple idea the idea is i want you to notice
that there is a category or class of things which
can be achieved in your life only through a slow
steady consistent investment into that thing over a period of
years on a daily basis that's it that's the entire
notion if you grok this notion this notion will change
your whole life this is so significant i'll share a
lot of examples here to illustrate what exactly this notion
means but again what i'm saying is that there are
certain things that you can accomplish in your life only
if you invest on a daily basis every single day
for years a little bit at a time which ultimately
accretes to some amazing result that you cannot get any
other way you cannot purchase it and you cannot build
it overnight and there is no magic pill you can
take that will leapfrog that process for you the way
that everybody wants and in a sense this is the
ultimate key to success in life is to realize this
notion that i'm talking about to realize how significant it
is and to realize that the the most valuable things
in life are those things which are built in this
fashion through long-term investing in yourself and they cannot be
gotten any other way and the key mistake that most
fools in life make go see my episode what is
wisdom where i explain technically what a fool is what
i explain in that episode is that fools are impatient
people that's one of the characteristics of a fool a
fool wants something very valuable very cheaply and quickly a
fool doesn't want to work for it a fool can
be convinced that something highly valuable in life can be
gotten without this process of patient steady investment so one
of the areas in life where the biggest fools are
caught into serious and painful traps is when it comes
to investing and i mean just financial investing like on
wall street see fools want to get rich quickly the
wise want to get rich slowly because if you get
rich quickly you're going to lose that richness very fast
whereas if you get rich slowly you're going to be
able to solidify that and build upon it and it's
going to be solid like granite and another thing that
i said about fools is that fools build build their
castles on foundations of sand the fool is more interested
in the castle than the foundation they don't dig a
deep enough foundation and their castle collapses they can't build
their castle very high and then they're they're constantly working
because their foundation is constantly sinking and so they spend
their whole life redoing things over and over and over
again like they chase get rich quick scheme after get
rich quick scheme after get rich quick quick scheme and
they keep failing and failing and failing thinking that one
of these schemes one day will make them super rich
and will allow them to live the easy life whereas
it would have been just easier bite the bullet and
just actually work hard slowly patiently for a decade or
so and then you can actually build up some serious
wealth that way but when you're just chasing um then
you know easy opportunities then you're not gonna you're not
actually going to become successful that's what the fool doesn't
understand it's a trap the fool doesn't see the trap
so the point here is to help you to adopt
a sort of life philosophy and attitude of patience of
investing in yourself and building up yourself and your life
and those aspects of your life that are most important
to you slowly patiently over years and decades and this
is how you will make yourself successful this is how
you will make yourself deeply satisfied and happy in life
and only in this way and to resist the temptation
for shortcuts and to resist the temptation to try to
outsource this to somebody else this is your primary responsibility
this is why you're alive is to do this this
is the heart of self-actualization and personal development so now
let's get into some examples to illustrate what i mean
so what's one example of something that can only be
developed over a long period of time working on it
very consistently and patiently well one example would be education
if you care about education if you care about understanding
the world if you care about knowledge if you want
to be intelligent and smart this is not something you
can go and purchase off a store shelf there is
no amount of money that will make you well educated
now of course money helps it helps have money um
in this process but it's not going to do it
for you nor can you get educated in a weekend
or even in a single year there is no thing
that you can do this weekend that will make you
well educated to become well educated if you're serious about
it what that means is that you're going to be
investing in your education time and energy mostly every single
day for a period of decades there is no single
book you can read that will make you well educated
there is no single class you can go to there
is no even university program that you can go to
that will make you well educated that's not going to
be sufficient to be well educated is such a big
thing but it's also a rather sort of nebulous and
abstract thing after all what does it mean to be
well educated it's hard to even define what that means
to me it means a lot more than just having
a degree or going to a class a solid education
requires thousands of hours of investment so how do you
become really well educated you read every single day and
you do it for decades and you listen to podcasts
or to videos and you listen to lectures and you
contemplate and you take notes and then you read some
more and you go to classes and maybe you go
to school maybe you go to university and then that's
not enough you continue after that as well it's a
sort of commitment to lifelong learning and you keep doing
that for a long time and then at some point
you become very well educated but it's going to take
thousands of hours and nobody is going to do it
for you you can't outsource it to anybody and nobody's
going to push you really to become very well educated
sure your parents might push you to get good grades
or they might push you to go to university and
to get a degree but that is not the same
thing as being well educated and even your teachers your
teachers will push you to do your homework assignments and
they may push you to study or cram for an
exam and they may even inspire you or push you
to learn some field or some some aspect of a
field if you have a good teacher but a teacher
is not going to really be there holding your hand
and guiding you towards becoming a well-educated human that's something
only you can do on your own if you develop
that vision and then you work towards it every single
day and if you don't work towards it every single
day then you won't become well educated and then you
will see other people in the world who are well
educated now granted it's rare to find a really well-educated
person but they exist they're not that rare uh you
will see those people and you will look at their
results in life and you will envy their results you
will want their results and you will wonder all you
know how how lucky that these people are so smart
or so intelligent or so well educated how do i
become that way and you're gonna look for a shortcut
like what book can i read tell me the magic
secret well the magic secret was two or three decades
of constant daily contemplation reading studying note taking doing it
over and over and over and over again and see
but you don't want to hear that because now you've
wasted 20 30 years of your life whatever you were
doing not investing in your education and now you want
the end result you want to find some way to
buy it or to outsource it or to get it
quickly and of course the answer is you can't that's
exactly why being well educated is so valuable it's worth
so much so the real answer was for you to
travel back in time and to invest 20 30 years
of your life becoming really well educated of course you
can't do that now maybe you're still young enough that
you've got another 20 30 years of your life left
and you can invest that time to become well-educated but
will you see it's going to be harder now because
you're going to feel like you're behind the curve and
you are of course you're going to feel like you've
wasted a lot of your time and of course you
did you didn't invest and also you see the earlier
you invest the greater chance of compounding returns on your
investment so somebody who invests 30 years into becoming well-educated
at the beginning of his life that person is going
to get much more benefit from that investment than somebody
who invests 30 years towards the end of his life
because the whole key with this sort of investing strategy
that we're talking about investing in yourself is that you
spend 10 20 30 years building up something you build
it up you become really well educated now of course
you don't stop you can keep doing it but basically
then after a certain number of decades you can coast
off of that success for the rest of your life
it pays dividends forever that's the beauty of it that's
why you want to get it done as quickly as
early as possible you want to start investing as early
as possible the longer you wait the less payoff there's
going to be now that shouldn't discourage you from i
mean investing at all it's better to be late than
never but it's better to be early than late there's
this uh popular sort of cliched adage in um software
development where they say that you know if you have
10 women you can't make a baby in nine weeks
it still takes nine months what this means is that
there are certain things in life that have sort of
a natural developmental process that takes a certain amount of
time no matter how many women you get together and
how hard you tell them to work they're not going
to produce a baby faster than nine months now this
kind of of course seems obvious but a lot of
times we we fool ourselves into thinking that we can
get something done faster by by pushing it or by
funneling more resources into it sometimes that's the case but
not always certain things in life like if if you're
trying to build a house if you have one person
building that house one worker that house let's say will
take three years to complete if you have two people
it's probably going to take one a half years to
complete if you have three workers working on it you
can probably do it in a year if you have
four you can do it like in eight months and
so it makes sense to put more people on the
problem but after a certain point there's going to be
diminishing returns simply because if you have too many people
working on a small house there's going to be too
much interference so if you take a hundred people to
work on you know a single family home uh you
might say well we can get it done in a
day right no you can't maybe on a calculator you
could do the math and you can kind of keep
you know adding people and keep subtracting days and you
can actually on your calculator get to a point where
you think you can get a house built in one
day but you can't because there's all sorts of overhead
costs you know it takes time to deliver the lumber
it takes time to move things around there's a there's
sort of friction between different people on the workplace if
you have 10 people working together that might be optimal
for a single family home if you have a hundred
people that's no longer optimal if you have a thousand
people it's going to be worse than having 10. so
why am i telling you this um because your mind
is going to want to trick you to try to
take these sorts of shortcuts so another example is in
the area of business or another way to put it
is building a brand building a high quality brand is
not something you can do overnight and it's not even
something you can do in a year building a brand
is a decades-long process or more of gradual investment into
your brand whatever the brand is patiently building a reputation
in the marketplace of you know high quality products or
services that you're offering honing your brand to making sure
that it's fitting within a certain narrow niche within your
marketplace and serving that niche very very well and just
even for yourself as a business person who is running
that brand even for yourself to identify exactly what your
brand is and isn't you might say well that's just
kind of theory you should be able to just sit
down and do that no that actually takes you decades
of work to do to really hone your brand and
to understand what it is exactly you're selling and who
you're selling it to and what is part of your
brand what's not part of your brand and this leads
to something very valuable in the end if you go
through this whole process over a period of a decade
or more and do this because most business people are
so concerned about just returning a quarterly profit that they're
not deeply investing in their brand and in fact a
lot of times they cannibalize their own brand in order
to extract profits a lot of the giant companies fall
prey to this usually what happens in a in a
company's development cycle or even in a brand's development cycle
is that initially there's some sort of visionary founder who
works really hard to build up the brand in the
first 10 years then that brand is built up and
it it gains a loyal following a fanatical following from
its customers because that visionary produced something really cared about
the brand and was really interested in customer service and
delivering the highest quality product or service and that elevated
that business and that brand above all the others then
once that brand became well established usually it's sold off
to some giant corporation who then milks that brand and
then exploits all the loyal customers screwing them over by
delivering inferior products right this is this is how most
modern business works uh there are a few exceptions like
for example think of the brand like nintendo nintendo is
an old company nintendo's over 100 years old it used
to be a trading card company back in japan in
the old days before the the war and so forth
um and then it turned into arcade games and video
games but nintendo has has spent decade after decade cultivating
this massive brand of iconic characters iconic names uh iconic
games and uh and they just do it consistently over
and over and over and over again and that's what
makes nintendo a multi-billion dollar brand you can't build something
like that overnight and it takes a real commitment and
vision and a very patient approach to what you're doing
and consistency on a daily basis building and building inch
by inch by inch by inch that brand see we
have this attitude and the more foolish you are the
more you have this attitude of wanting some big result
quickly like leo tell me what i could do to
become enlightened tomorrow or leo what can i do to
break out of wage slavery tomorrow or by the end
of the year and something like enlightenment or something like
breaking free of wage slavery and becoming totally financially independent
these would be two more examples of things that you
cannot just buy or outsource or get done very quickly
without being patient about it these are things that require
long-term consistent investment this means you have to have a
vision you have to have a plan you have to
follow through on that plan you have to be very
disciplined about it every single day chipping away at it
and you'll be very patient and then you can achieve
a result like being totally financially independent and then you
can bask in that result and you can enjoy that
result for the rest of your life for example i
quit a relatively well paying career in video game development
in order to go off and become financially independent to
break free of wage slavery because to me i perceive
that as one of the most important pillars of my
life i knew early on when i first got my
first job out of university i knew early on that
there was nothing more important in my life than to
become free of wage slavery and so when i understood
the value of that i was willing to do anything
to make it happen so i even quit a great
career that i was planning my whole life i quit
that because this was such an important thing for me
to develop and then i invested in it patiently over
months and years and then today i'm free of wage
slavery and i probably will be for the rest of
my life and i can coast on that and it's
such a rewarding aspect of my existence that most humans
will never experience and to me that's very sad because
i know a lot of people would love to experience
it wouldn't you love to be free of wage slavery
for the rest of your life how do you achieve
a result like that well i can't give you the
exact step-by-step formula you have to figure out the the
minutia of it for yourself because this is not a
scalable solution not everyone can be free of wage slavery
so you have to be very creative and clever about
going how you go about it but uh but the
biggest mistake that i see people making who try to
do it and fail and most of them fail is
uh is because they're not patient enough and they're not
willing to invest long term bit by bit by bit
by bit over a period of years and decades to
do this they're not patient enough to build a brand
or to build a really solid business instead they're looking
for a shortcut they're looking at cryptocurrency or the latest
fad or they're jumping on this or you know oh
podcasts are popular today let me go make a podcast
like oh youtube is popular let me go on to
youtube this kind of stuff and with this sort of
attitude when you're just chasing and you're just desperate for
some result and you want it quickly you're not willing
to work for it see when you're not willing to
work for it and you want it quickly what that
really reveals about your attitude and your mind is that
you don't truly appreciate the value of the ultimate goal
because if you really appreciated the value of being free
of wage slavery you would be happy to work for
10 years to do it to achieve it but see
most people you tell them well i can show you
how you can break free of wage slavery but it'll
require 10 years of consistent daily work are you going
to do it and they'll say oh 10 years that's
that sounds hard and they won't do it and then
of course what's the surprise of course then they're going
to be wage slaves but see to me the idea
of being free of wage slavery was so valuable it
had almost infinite value in my mind because the way
i thought about it was like this if i can
have complete financial independence i could be completely free creatively
to do whatever i want creatively and to me as
a creative person that was the most valuable thing i
could be completely creatively autonomous i wouldn't have to have
a boss i wouldn't have to listen to customers i
would have to listen to anybody i could literally work
on any kind of project that i want if i
want to make a game i can make a game
if i want a movie i can make a movie
if i want to pursue awakening i can pursue awakening
you know whatever i want i could literally do now
what's the value of that to you versus what's the
value of that to me to me the value of
that is infinite you can't put a price tag on
how valuable that is to be free of a work
schedule to be able to sleep and wake up whenever
i want to be able to work whenever i want
to be able to take a vacation whenever i want
i could take half a year off whatever i want
i could not work for five years and then come
back and still be fine see that kind of freedom
what is that freedom worth to you most people undervalue
that freedom they might say well that's worth a million
dollars but actually it's worth way more than a million
dollars what you can do with that freedom that freedom
is worth hundreds of millions of dollars if you use
it properly now of course most people would piss that
freedom away so if you're gonna piss it away maybe
it's maybe it's only worth fifty thousand dollars to you
if you're gonna do nothing but play video games and
smoke weed and jerk off with that freedom but to
somebody who who really has uh their [ __ ]
together that freedom is worth so much and then depending
on how much you value it and how much it's
worth to you that determines how hard you're gonna work
towards it how patient you're gonna be with it another
example for you is with actualize.org that's my brand actualize.org
see when i began actualize that already eight years ago
my vision for it was very advanced from the very
beginning my vision for it was that i was going
to cover profound topics about the nature of reality and
the mind and psychology and epistemology and metaphysics and philosophy
and spirituality like i had all this plan from the
very beginning although i didn't know all the details of
it but um uh i had a huge vision for
it and i knew that it was going to take
me years and maybe even a decade to build up
this catalog of content and videos that would all interconnect
together every episode would end with would interconnect with every
other episode synergizing and doubling its value see if if
one of my episodes has x number of value to
you or to anybody when you then link it with
a second episode it doubles its value when you link
it with a third it doubles its value again and
in this way its value compounds so when you link
hundreds of them together what you get by linking hundreds
of of them together is much more than just a
linear sum of every episode in isolation because what we're
doing here is we're building this big picture that's very
deep and interconnected and the more interconnections you have you
have these sort of network effects like you get with
a social network like with facebook these network effects are
non-linear which means that if you have 10 people on
facebook only 10 people facebook is not very valuable when
you have a hundred thousand people it's it's more interesting
now you got something going now you've got a little
bit of a network effect you've got friends and acquaintances
interesting stuff is being shared with a hundred thousand people
but still it's very limited when you got a million
people now it gets really interesting now when you got
a billion people that's a whole um a whole new
ball game when you have the entire world on facebook
so you need to be good at sort of spotting
these non-linear payoffs that you can get with your investments
so that's sort of what the actualized brand is built
upon and um the videos are all supposed to interconnect
in a very profound way for those who want to
interconnect them all who are willing to watch them all
and that will produce a certain effect on your mind
and it will produce a sort of level of personal
development that you can't get from reading any self-help book
or from any other single self-help teacher and we're we're
interconnecting so many different kinds of perspectives scientific perspectives and
spiritual perspectives and religious perspectives and philosophical perspective and all
these different people and models and we're interconnecting that produces
something that's way more than the sum of its parts
and see i had that vision 10 years ago but
every episode that i was releasing in the early years
was not actually delivering on that result you see my
early episodes were not very deep or not very profound
i didn't even have the skills the speaking skills or
even the intellectual skills developed yet to be able to
talk about and interconnect all of the profound stuff that
i talk about now it took me a good eight
years to develop this capacity and that is now something
deeply valuable to see this is one of those things
that's sort of abstract but it's profoundly valuable that you
cannot buy or get anywhere else it's something truly unique
that had to be built over a period of a
decade and that turns into a unique selling proposition that
then i can sell to you and then i can
get value back from you see but to give you
val to get value from you first i have to
give you a lot of value to give you a
lot of value i have to generate that value somehow
how did i generate that value very very patiently building
it out over years and it was very frustrating at
the very beginning because i had this idea of of
all the amazing content i was going to shoot and
release but i couldn't do it yet because i didn't
have the skills i didn't have the intellectual capacity yet
i didn't have the levels of consciousness yet i didn't
even have the speaking abilities yet to do that all
that had to be built over time my own mind
had to be built over time but see the one
thing that allowed me to do that is that i
saw the value of it i had enough vision to
see the value of it and to work towards it
on a weekly basis and that's what i did i
basically have been recording videos these kinds of videos every
single week for the last eight or nine years of
my life very consistently but it's more than just recording
videos it's also i spend even more time just constantly
thinking about how to interconnect all these ideas in my
own mind organizing different topics for what i'm going to
cover what kind of videos i'm going to shoot creating
lists i have lists of hundreds of videos that i'm
simultaneously working on that i'm brainstorming on i've been brainstorming
on them for years and then from there i can
then pull out a topic create a video release it
to you and it seems maybe to you it seems
like oh this is something leo just did over the
weekend it seems that way actually this is something leo's
been doing for a decade and that makes it much
more powerful than some youtuber just saying like oh let
me just record some video i just had an idea
yesterday let me just record a video about it today
you can do that but you're not going to get
the same kind of depth and then how are you
going to compete and i mean you can't there's a
lot of shallow [ __ ] on youtube so you
can certainly compete that way i'm not saying you can't
but i'm just saying that you won't be able to
develop something like what i've developed as a brand with
actualize.org if you want to develop a really powerful brand
you got to be thinking about it 10 years into
the future and then chipping away at that so that
each video you're releasing is not just a standalone video
yes it can stand on its own any one of
my videos can stand on its own but the real
power of the videos is when you combine them all
together when you string a hundred of them together what
you get is much more than the sum of its
parts now don't get hung up on just the fact
that i'm talking about making youtube videos i'm really not
i'm talking i'm giving you a specific example about a
much more abstract principle here you can apply this in
any kind of business that you're working on if you
want to be building a powerful business this is how
you got to think you got to think long term
you got to think strategically and you got to think
in terms of how are every little piece and product
and service that you're combining together or releasing on a
weekly monthly basis how are those all going to add
up to something that's larger than some of its parts
that's where you get the network effects that's where you
get exponential value and then that's where you can build
a lot of wealth and also make a huge impact
on the world if that's what you care about see
for me i was never in this for the wealth
i didn't start a youtube channel because i said oh
everyone's starting youtube channels and i want to get rich
doing it no for me it was about the impact
that i saw that i could have on people on
people's minds and related to that is another thing that
i've been developing which is even more important to me
than my brand and this business or this channel really
see what i've been doing um i don't know if
you realize this or not but sort of the secret
to what i've been doing over the last 10 or
even longer 20 years really is that i've been developing
one of the most robust and interconnected maps of reality
that any human has ever developed and i've been doing
it inside my own mind that means when i was
reading a book or when i was doing some philosophy
or when i was contemplating or meditating or whatever taking
a psychedelic or watching a podcast or watching an interview
or listening to some teacher or going to some workshop
or whatever reading a bit of self-help all of those
were little things i was doing you know that could
stand on their own that could benefit me and my
improve my life a little bit but really what i
was doing is i was taking all those little pieces
and i was combining them all together to figure out
what the hell is going on in reality making sense
of everything with the idea being that if i do
this for 10 or 20 years i will have such
a profound and deep understanding of how reality works that
this will be like a superpower that i have that
nobody else has no scientist has this no doctor has
this even a lot of spiritual people don't have this
because the way they do spirituality is not with that
kind of intention they're doing spirituality for some sort of
shallow singular goal like they want to feel happy or
they want to escape suffering or pain or they want
to just awaken and all they care about is just
awakening and nothing else or they just want to be
a buddhist and they just follow the buddhist path and
nothing else they only care about understanding buddhism and nothing
else you see this produces a very narrow understanding of
reality and it's not the same thing as what i'm
talking about so i've spent the last 10 years or
more integrating literally hundreds of different perspectives interconnecting them in
my own mind from scientists to new agers to religious
people to political ideologies and you know social sciences hard
sciences psychology philosophy nonduality sociology developmental psychology spiral dynamics chaos
theory fractals quantum mechanics like i mean like evolutionary theory
interconnecting all that stuff and my my hunch was behind
all this that if i was able to integrate all
this stuff together that i would get something that's more
than just the sum of its parts it would be
more than just having a phd or a diploma it
would be more than just having a career as a
scientist or as a philosopher it would be more than
just reading a list of books it would be way
more than all that and that this would be extremely
valuable both to me personally just for living my own
life in a better way but it would be extremely
valuable in sharing that with others like you it would
be worth millions of dollars and so that's exactly what
i've been doing over the last 10 years of my
life you see rather than investing in bitcoins although i
have a little bit of bitcoins uh full disclosure but
rather than you know chasing after bitcoins or chasing after
stocks or chasing after money or chasing after podcast success
or youtube success really what i've been doing is i've
been investing in the most important and valuable thing that
i have which is building my mind see in this
mind is literally contained one of the most sophisticated understandings
of the entire universe that exists on this planet now
that might some sound narcissistic and arrogant to say that
but i put it so starkly because that was my
vision i tend to have pretty high visions when i
do something i can't really motivate myself to do it
until unless i i think that it's really awesome to
do that means it has to be like a really
awesome achievement it has to be something really amazing rare
unique and powerful otherwise to me it's not worth doing
and see nobody in society will tell you that this
is something you should be doing or that this would
be valuable to do in fact most people will tell
you that this is foolish to do it's a waste
of time and i've had a lot of people tell
me to stop doing it on a daily basis people
tell me to stop doing it but that's what it
takes to to really accomplish something amazing in the world
is that you have to keep doing it despite all
the naysayers you keep doing it and doing it and
doing it every single day pushing towards your vision because
you you feel that it's going to be something significant
and something important and you don't look to external validation
to to tell you that what you're doing is right
you have to look within your intuition your higher self
will tell you what you're doing is right and i'm
not done with my project there's still a lot more
of this project going on i still have a lot
more to understand and to to interconnect and so my
idea was that if i was going to interconnect more
and more different perspectives that eventually this would lead to
something extraordinary and you see this is one of those
things that is so abstract like even to get this
idea imagine getting this idea in your mind what i
was just describing and then to actually work on it
every single day for 10 or 20 years with no
external validation that means you can't go to your parents
and ask them hey should i do this is it
a good idea because if you ask them they'll tell
you no it's stupid that's what they'll tell you so
this requires a certain independence and a leadership quality to
do this and vision and then patience and then doing
it every single day consistently a little bit and then
telling yourself every single day that by doing this you're
working towards something important and not to quit and that
it's going to be worthwhile because you're going to have
days where you're doubting yourself you have you're going to
have weeks where you want to quit and just go
follow all your friends and do all the stupid stuff
that they're doing or somebody's going to criticize you or
somebody's going to naysay you and then you're going to
take that criticism and and an injunction to quit to
to uh you're gonna let it get to you and
then you're gonna wanna quit and you gotta push past
that and stick hold tight to your vision see this
is what creates the most significant kinds of success in
life your ability to do that now i'm just giving
you examples from my own life i'm not saying you
have to do this i'm not saying this is what
you need to be doing maybe you don't maybe you
have the kind of mind that doesn't want this or
doesn't need this or maybe you have a different priority
in your life that's fine um don't get hung up
on the details so one of the things that really
juices me up and gets me one of the secrets
i guess i could say behind the passion that i
have for life is that intuitively i'm always making these
kinds of investments in my own self and after years
of doing this it becomes very rewarding this is how
you create a deep sense of meaning in your life
whether you're doing it with your business or with your
family or with your spiritual work or with your you
know your your education or your mindset or your understanding
of reality whatever you're doing it with this kind of
patient investing in that which you intuit is going to
be deeply valuable based upon your own values not the
values of somebody else what's another example of this for
example um of course we're gonna we're gonna get to
spirituality here in a moment but before we get to
that how about just something more simple like emotional mastery
hopefully you can intuit as early as possible in your
life that emotional mastery the development of emotional mastery is
going to pay dividends for the rest of your life
if you can develop it and the faster you can
develop it the better but also you should see that
developing emotional mastery is difficult you can't master your emotions
overnight or even in a year this requires a lot
of deep introspection work mindfulness work dealing with your shadow
stuff um dealing and facing fear and anger and jealousy
confronting these in an honest way journaling about them reading
about how emotions work this is a whole project this
project can take you 10 20 years of your life
perhaps practicing different methods like the sedona method letting go
of emotions just even learning how to label your emotions
for example when you're angry learning to label oh that's
anger and when you're afraid oh that's fear and when
you're jealous oh that's jealousy and when you're um feeling
guilty oh that's guilt and then and then you can
you can research and learn different coping mechanisms and different
sorts of you know strategies for how to jiu jitsu
jujitsu with those different kinds of emotions so like when
you're angry you can maybe learn the strategy of like
okay let me just take a few deep breaths pause
and take a few deep breaths like that or maybe
when you're afraid you notice that your hands are tensing
up and they're getting sweaty or your leg muscles your
thigh muscles are tensing or your gut is tensing and
maybe you even have a little bit of like irritable
bowel syndrome from your fear and then learning to let
that go you have to become mindful of it first
then you let it go and maybe you learn some
relaxation techniques and then when you're sad or when you're
depressed learning some coping strategies for that like what do
you do when you're stuck in a depression or you're
stuck in in sort of a a lazy unmotivated state
and a sort of an apathetic state or when you're
feeling nihilistic and you feel like nothing matters and everything
is meaningless and maybe you even want to kill yourself
what do you do see most people have not developed
any of this stuff this is not taught to you
in school of course and yet think of how valuable
it would be if you actually developed this kind of
emotional mastery or with being happy see how do you
be happy most people just are kind of winging it
they're doing stuff desperately to to gain happiness but it
doesn't give them any happiness all that happiness is fleeting
and yet they keep doing it over and over and
again again for the rest of their lives and their
their miserable and depressed when it doesn't work so investing
time researching what is happiness and then learning how to
make yourself happy and how to maybe enjoy how to
be satisfied building up that muscle as i've talked about
in my satisfaction meditation episode that would be part of
emotional mastery you see all this would take you years
and decades to develop and you would have to work
on it yourself of your own initiative because nobody's going
to do this for you you can't buy you can't
outsource it and if you haven't developed this in the
early part of your life it's going to get harder
to develop it later in life because you're going to
build a lot of bad negative habits you're going to
build a lot of dysfunctional coping mechanisms for how to
deal with your emotions then you're going to have double
the work to unwire all those and then to wire
in new ones in the future so the earlier you
do it the better and also just it's gonna pay
dividends you see when you develop this emotional mastery you're
gonna have the rest of your life to enjoy it
to enjoy a life that is not filled with a
bunch of anxiety and panic attacks and fear and anger
and jealousy and all this sorts of insecurity and victim
mentality and uh bitterness and nihilism so how much is
emotional mastery worth to you is it worth a million
dollars is it worth 10 million dollars so how hard
are you gonna are you willing to work for it
are you willing to work every single day for the
next 20 years are you gonna do it see and
see this is what determines the difference between a high
quality person and a low quality person a high quality
person is one who is going to work for the
next 20 years to develop it and actually will develop
it and then that is what contributes to the quality
of that person whereas the low quality person is going
to be lazy is going to slack off he's not
going to be consistent he's going to do it for
one weekend and then he's going to quit and go
play video games and go jerk off and go smoke
weed and go party with friends and go have a
bunch of sex and do the easy life and then
before you know it 20 30 years will pass in
that person's life and they will be 40 years old
50 years old and they will have nothing to show
for it because they've pissed away 40 years of their
life down the path of least resistance and they've invested
nothing in themselves and they have nothing to show for
it they don't have a house they don't have a
savings account they don't have emotional mastery they don't have
any spiritual development they don't have any education they don't
have any um brand they've built any business that they've
built they don't have any skills that they've built that
are highly valuable they don't have any artistic or creative
skills they don't have any business skills they don't have
any marketing skills they don't have any speaking skills they
don't even have a sense of humor because even something
like a sense of humor is a great example of
something that you have to build over years i've spent
years developing a sense of humor if you think i
lack a sense of humor that i lack a sense
of humor you should have seen me ten years ago
before i started shooting these videos how uh how shy
and how how serious i was how humorless i was
uh i had to spend a lot of effort to
develop my sense of humor and i had to practice
it on a daily basis sometimes on my forum you
see me cracking jokes or being humorous uh even in
serious situations i'll sometimes crack a joke and sometimes people
wonder oh leo leo's being an [ __ ] why
is he doing that actually what you don't understand is
that i'm actually practicing my sense of humor developing that
because i know that by the time that i'm 50
years old i want to have like a really good
sense of humor and the only way i can get
it is by practicing it for 10 20 years in
every chance that i can get so if i see
a chance to crack a joke i'll take it now
i'm not saying i have an amazing sense of humor
i'm saying it it's it's not about how good you
are in some absolute sense it's it's always relative to
where you were in the past right so where i
am today is is a thousand percent better than where
i was 10 years ago i'm not comparing myself to
stand-up comedians i'm comparing myself to where i was and
also to where i want to be and my journey's
not done there's still a lot of work i can
do on my sense of humor you see but a
lot of people they take this approach of like well
leo how do i become humorous by the way i
have a video i have a long hour long video
that says how to be funny it gives you my
formula for how to become funny and develop a sense
of humor but how many of you will first of
all sit through an hour of that recognize the value
of it to even sit through an hour of it
most people they wouldn't even value this topic enough to
sit through an hour video explaining how to become humorous
that's a fail right there but even even then you
know at the end of that video i give you
a bunch of exercises that you should be doing every
single day to develop your sense of humor how many
of you have done that for a year every single
day for one you for even just one year straight
none of you almost none of you i guarantee it
and then you come to me and say oh leo
how do i be funny tell me how to be
funny you can't become funny overnight becoming funny requires retraining
how your entire brain looks at reality if you're a
serious person if you're a shy person who isn't very
witty isn't very playful with others socially isn't really good
at cracking jokes or being humorous if that's your starting
point if your starting point is sort of a zero
it's going to take you years to change that now
some people are just more intuitively humorous and then they
don't need that much work uh but see but most
people when they talk about how do i become more
funny they don't see the value of that what is
it worth to you to become more funny is it
worth a million dollars is it worth 10 million dollars
to you if it isn't you're a fool you're under
uh estimating the value of having a good sense of
humor you can use a good sense of humor to
charm people to charm women and men to get laid
but not just to get laid it's much more significant
than that you can use it to land a job
for example at a job interview if you have a
great sense of humor and you're able to be charismatic
and outgoing and kind of bubbly at least for that
hour or two of the job interview you'll impress them
so much they'll give you the job and if you're
a business person and you're doing business deals having a
great sense of humor could make the difference between closing
a 10 million dollar business deal or losing it with
a great sense of humor you can develop a great
social circle with a great sense of humor you can
open doors that would be otherwise closed to you you
can charm all sorts of people you can charge sale
you can charm sales people with a great sense of
humor you can go into a used car dealership and
you can buy a car for a thousand dollars cheaper
than they would have sold it to you if you
didn't have that sense of humor and and none of
that even goes to say how it makes you feel
on the inside when you have a sense of humor
i mean it's just fun life just becomes more fun
socializing becomes more fun going out with friends becomes more
fun partying becomes more fun being with girls if you're
a guy becomes more fun you just enjoy your life
more what is that worth to you so see once
you understand how valuable it is then you won't whine
and [ __ ] and moan so much about investing
a couple of years of your life working for maybe
20 minutes a day developing your sense of humor by
doing various kinds of exercises that you could be doing
you can't buy a sense of humor you can't go
to walmart and buy a sense of humor and you
can't develop in any kind of cheap or easy way
i i literally had to re-program how my mind thinks
and seize situations in order to become more humorous it's
actually much more profound than most people realize it's not
about memorizing a bunch of jokes it's about looking at
the world in a playful manner anyways if you find
that valuable then go check out that episode how to
be funny of course we should now talk about the
example of spiritual work so all of the biggest fruits
of spiritual practice such as enlightenment awakening or even just
happiness or a sense of liberation freedom or a sense
of peace and tranquility or maybe some emotional mastery that
comes along with it as well or shedding your suffering
and your depression and your anxiety and your self-hatred and
what other other demons you have um getting rid of
your shadow becoming more loving you know accessing infinite love
accessing god accessing higher intelligence accessing profound wisdom from the
universe that you couldn't access otherwise or even spiritual powers
like cities classic cities yogic powers that could be developed
even things like um telepathy clairvoyance and so on that
many materialists don't even believe are possible you know healing
powers and so forth um see these are all the
fruits of spiritual work that everybody would love to have
immediately like if i if i published a course tomorrow
that said how to have cities in one weekend how
to develop clairvoyance and omniscience and telepathy and all this
in one weekend or how to access infinite love in
one weekend this i could sell a million copies of
this course tomorrow everybody wants that but of course i'm
not going to create a course like that because developing
these powers and and so forth and accessing these these
fruits of spiritual work this takes decades of patient consistent
daily practice and self-investment rather than some sort of weekend
course if you're sitting there thinking like oh man but
leo can't you release a course like that i would
love that tell me how to get these fruits from
spiritual practice well but that's what actualized rug is actualize.org
is that the problem is that this is such a
deep domain of of work it's so broad and deep
simultaneously that you don't even realize that all these episodes
that i'm releasing are helping to guide you towards that
and that if you actually would do the [ __
] work you'd maybe experience some of the fruits see
are you willing to sit and meditate every single day
for an hour or two for the next 10 years
to develop some of these fruits most of you aren't
which is why you'll never get the fruits which is
why you keep watching my videos and you get no
results and you'll keep getting no results until you wise
up and actually discipline yourself to do the practices that
i have talked about many many times that you stubbornly
refuse to do because you're lazy and you just want
the result and you don't want to work for it
what does accessing infinite love um what is that what
is that worth to you is it worth five million
dollars what does becoming conscious of god what is that
worth you how about understanding the the entire origin of
existence what is that worth to you to most people
these things are worth nothing and therefore they're not willing
to even expend a weekend working towards it so then
is it a wonder that most people are spiritually bankrupt
in our society they are just like most people cannot
invest 10 years building a brand in their business they
cannot discipline themselves or motivate themselves to spend ten years
building up their spiritual bank account they're bankrupt and then
they want some quick solution like how to be happy
how to find love how to have a bunch of
sex how to be attractive how to be masculine how
to get your health back all of these things you
can do but these require serious long-term investment in yourself
there are no quick solutions for these things those things
that have quick solutions those solutions are already generally well
known and you can buy them and you already have
bought them the most valuable stuff is the stuff that
people haven't invented a mechanical solution for there's no technology
or gadget that will do this thing for you you
have to build it manually that's precisely why it's worth
so much because if if you could just push a
button and it would be solved in a weekend it
wouldn't be worth anything and you would already have that
if there was some button you could push or some
course you could take that would make you happy in
one weekend everybody would push that button and buy that
course and everybody would be happy already you see and
if there was some button you could push that would
make you enlightened everybody in the world would already be
enlightened and if there was uh some video that i
could release that would make you experience infinite love then
everybody in the world would already be filled with infinite
love and there would be no problems in the world
there would only be infinite love so you have to
be wise enough to see that what you really want
in your life is always going to be walled off
from you by your own willingness to exert the labor
to get it and so when you realize that then
you can actually get excited about doing labor because you
realize that in a certain sense the more labor you
put into something you can almost get excited about it
because the more you invest the more you realize you're
going to get back now of course you want to
be smart about this you don't want to be investing
labor into some dead end pursuit thinking that it's going
to pay off you got to be investing in the
right things there are some things you can be investing
in that will never pay off for you and in
fact it'll backfire so you got to be investing in
the right things but as long as you're investing in
the right things in a smart way and you're doing
it effectively then you can get excited about the fact
that you're investing in it like for example um uh
lately i've restarted my yoga practice and uh with my
yoga practice you know i'm getting more mature and i'm
seeing the value of the practice more and more as
i develop myself and like i'm more excited now than
ever about doing my yoga practice because i realize that
every hour i put into it that is directly investing
into my own consciousness a little bit drop by drop
by drop every single day and it doesn't seem like
a lot you know a drop you know imagine sort
of an eye dropper and you're dropping one little drop
into a giant bathtub it's an empty bathtub and you're
just walking in every single day and you're going drop
and then you're walking away and then the next morning
you're walking in there and going drop and then you're
walking away and you're doing that every single day only
one drop see most people would get very discouraged about
this because they would see like they would look at
the bathtub they look how big it is they look
at the little drop they see how small it is
and they say oh this is hope this is impossible
um but to me this is kind of this can
kind of be reframed i like to reframe this in
my mind and to say like this is actually amazing
because i know that everybody else is going to be
discouraged by this process and is going to quit and
all i have to do is just keep doing drop
by drop by drop by drop by drop every single
day and in 10 years i'm gonna have uh i'm
gonna be the only person with a full bathtub and
then people will wonder how did your bathtub get full
what's the secret tell me the secret how can i
fill up my bathtub in one weekend well you can't
because all you have to work with is a is
this little eyedropper see the human mind is a very
stubborn beast it takes years and decades to rewire your
mind how it works its belief structures and so forth
you can't change these things overnight and so one of
the mistakes people make fools make is that they undertake
a strategy of a sort of a spasmodic obsessive strategy
of like what they will do is they will try
to you know they they won't use the eye dropper
instead they'll get a giant bucket and they'll take the
bucket and they'll try to you know throw a whole
giant bucket into the bathtub all in one go and
then it's going to backfire on them it's not going
to work most that water is going to spill back
out spill over them it's going to make a giant
mess they're going to get discouraged by it and they're
going to quit the next day whereas if you were
just patient and you did drop by drop by drop
very carefully every single day very accurately drop by drop
by drop by drop you would fill your bathtub but
you know a fool isn't patient enough to do that
so the fool is just fumbling around and thinks he
can just take a you know in one day or
in one weekend he can just do something very rapidly
that's going to change the whole situation and it doesn't
work that way because your mind like i've talked about
in the past in my eco backlash episode is like
a harmonic oscillator it's an organic system it's a non-linear
system that means any change you make to your mind
like a pendulum that swings back and forth or like
a spring you pull it back you let it go
it does this it does a sort of oscillating motion
that's how uh organic complex systems tend to work because
they are homeostatic so the human mind is like that
you can't achieve deep spiritual purification in one weekend or
in one retreat you have to do retreat after retreat
after retreat after retreat after retreat after retreat after retreat
and then 10 years of that will radically change your
mind but on a daily basis and even on a
weekly basis you don't see the changes so much and
that's what can be discouraging most people when they sit
down to meditate they don't they're not sensitive enough to
really feel the change that this makes there's a change
that it makes on it on a temporary basis like
on your temporary state for the next hour or for
the next day that's irrelevant that comes and goes but
there's also a secondary change it makes at a deeper
structural level of your mind where it it purifies your
mind a little bit but only a tiny bit like
every every hour you meditate effectively maybe it purifies your
mind by point zero zero zero zero one percent it's
virtually imperceptible it's like a little drop in the bathtub
uh and so it's easy to discount the value of
that we want some kind of magic pill that will
give us like a 10 increase or 20 increase in
our consciousness or in our love or in our sense
of humor or in our business but usually that's not
possible let alone a 200 increase you know that's how
these get rich quick schemes they fool you and even
a lot of self-help teachers and seminars they will fool
you telling you like come to this workshop and we
will teach you how to fix your marriage in a
weekend or how to rid yourself of insecurity and social
anxiety in a single weekend or take this course and
this will solve for you your all your money problems
or all of your problems with attracting women and of
course none of these can deliver on that promise and
then you get discouraged by self-help you just get discouraged
by business courses you get discouraged by all these books
and other things you've read but you know what it's
sort of your fault because the reality is that these
books and courses are marketed to people like you because
you wouldn't buy a book or a course or a
product or a service or a workshop or a seminar
or whatever you wouldn't buy it if the truth was
told to you that it's going to take you 10
years to build this business it's going to take you
10 years to achieve your awakening it's going to take
you 10 years to to solve your social anxiety because
you're full and these courses and books and products are
all targeted towards fools because there's not enough wise people
to to make a business gearing your business towards the
wise is not very smart it's if you want to
make a lot of money gear your business towards the
biggest fools so when it comes to spiritual work this
is where you require the most patience and the most
maturity and the most strategic approach and this is why
most people have never felt the fruits of spiritual work
they don't even believe there are the fruits like many
of the fruits that i talk about or promise people
will say that i'm crazy or that i'm a cult
leader or that i'm imagining things or that i'm delusional
to promise these fruits because these people have never they
can't they're not their their worldview is so limited they
can't even imagine the possibility of these fruits let alone
never mind actually working towards them for years spiritual practice
is some of the most challenging work that you can
do it's the deepest kind of investment you can make
in yourself and it needs to be done really over
a period of decades you need to have a very
patient attitude a very long time horizon a very deep
vision to access these fruits for most people some people
are more spiritually gifted they can do it faster but
for the majority of people who are not especially spiritually
gifted it'll it'll take years and decades now you might
say that that's that's so negative and depressing actually no
i'm delivering to you a very positive message is that
in 10 years time you can experience incredible fruits in
your life 10 years is not that long 10 years
of your life will pass so quickly and one of
the most depressing things that will happen to you is
if you let the next 10 years pass without making
any investments and then 10 years will pass and then
you'll you'll realize what i told you 10 years from
now on your 40th birthday or 50th birthday you'll realize
what i'm telling you here and you'll say oh [
__ ] how i wish that i listened to leo
and actually disciplined myself when i was in my 20s
and in my 30s and in my early 40s to
to make these investments because now i would be living
the high life i would be coasting off the dividends
i would be living off the dividends i could do
a sort of early retirement early spiritual retirement rather than
slaving away at this stuff when i'm in my 50s
and 60s and i'm getting close to the end life
really is about investing in yourself very deeply as early
as possible and doing it as much as humanly possible
every single day this is what it takes to build
a great life really you should have been doing it
from age five sometimes people ask me leo i'm i'm
15 years old or i'm 20 years old is the
stuff that you talk about uh suitable for me or
or am i am i too young and my answer
in my mind the answer is always you're not too
young you're too old if you're 15 you already missed
10 years of doing this you already wasted 10 years
of your life if you're 20 you already wasted 15
years of your life you could basically be like a
spiritual master by the age of 20. if you start
at five if you start meditating at five every single
day for an hour you would be an enlightened master
by the age of 20. but in our society in
our culture you know people are so lazy and complacent
these days that they don't even really begin serious development
until like age 25 or 30. people piss away 30
years of their life and then then they come to
me and they're they're sort of like wondering leo how
do i fix all these problems please help me i'm
so desperate it's too late i mean like it's not
too late but i mean like you already pissed away
the prime of your life now i'm not saying you
shouldn't now invest i'm not i'm not don't make a
limiting belief out of this and don't get depressed about
this even if you're 50 or 60 years old and
you just stumbled upon this content and you feel like
you've wasted 60 years of your life okay fine um
you can still i mean what else is there to
do do the work it's like i said it's better
later than than never um but are you gonna have
some regrets about wasting a bunch of your life yeah
you will because you did and so that's going to
be something you have to work through so don't don't
be that way most of you who watch me are
pretty young um i know a few of you are
older and i have i have sympathy for you it's
not it's not easy doing this work if you're starting
in your 50s and 60s i believe me i sympathize
with you um personally i started this work young and
i'm very grateful for that that that's mostly what i
attribute my success to is that i started investing in
my life when i was very young basically in my
in my teens i was investing in my life back
back in high school when most kids were screwing around
and you know horse playing on the playground and smoking
weed and going to parties and making out and doing
all this sorts of stupid stuff you know going to
football games i was busy investing in my life and
today i get to coast on that and i get
to coast on that for the rest of my life
that's very enjoyable so i recommend for those of you
who are young to start investing as soon as possible
and basically wherever you are start investing as soon as
possible be very strategic about your investments be very disciplined
about your investments uh be very committed to your investments
when you know you've got something good invest in it
don't be shy about that be decisive and invest in
it like your life depends upon it and be explicit
about what you're investing in on a piece of paper
actually write down the top five things you want to
be investing over the next five or ten years of
your life in your business and your relationships with your
emotional mastery with your spiritual work whatever your finances whatever
your you know your health and then paste that on
your bathroom mirror so when you're brushing your teeth you're
looking at that list every single day and it's reminding
you of what you're really invested in that is what's
going to make or break your life and then for
the most part everything else that's going on in your
life is just distractions if it's not on that list
it's trivial it's almost irrelevant it's not going to really
contribute to your success very much so i recommend you
be very deliberate deliberate about this invest in skills too
that's another thing i i've talked about this in the
past but i haven't mentioned it in this episode but
a huge aspect of this is figuring out what skills
you're going to need professionally or even like interpersonal skills
relationship skills financial skills what skills you're going to need
and then build those skills and to build skills you
need to train on a daily basis i have an
episode called i forget exactly what it's called [Music] um
i think it's called no growth possible without training no
growth is possible without training go watch that episode is
one of my underrated ones um but really it's it's
just you got to train on a daily basis the
same way that when you want to become an olympic
athlete you train every single day that same attitude needs
to be applied to spirituality to your finances to your
relationships to your emotional mastery and everything else you got
to train all that [ __ ] on a daily
basis if you want to build something great with your
life and when you start doing that that's when your
life becomes meaningful and interesting it becomes sort of like
the difference between just playing a first person shooter versus
playing a deep rpg one of the most enjoyable aspects
for me of playing an rpg like you know elder
scrolls or something is that you get to invest in
your character every time you're leveling like you know you're
killing monsters but you're not just killing a monster like
in a first person shooter you just kill a monster
and that's it it's a one-off deal whereas what's beautiful
in an rpg is that you kill that monster it
gets a little bit of xp that xp adds to
your level you get new levels you get new skill
points you get to allocate those skill points you get
new skills and that keeps building on itself and that
becomes very rewarding where did these rpg game designers get
this idea they basically copied it from real life but
most people are not living their life like an rpg
most people are living their life like a shallow first-person
shooter where every day they just do a little bit
of thing here a little bit of thing there it's
just like a one-off thing it doesn't add up and
build towards something meaningful after a long period of time
try to design your life in such a way that
every activity you're doing is gonna synergize and build towards
some larger goal and in this way your life will
become very rich and meaningful so you see like when
i'm recording this video a couple of things are happening
simultaneously for me and i've sort of designed it this
way it's a great synergy first of all i'm releasing
this video it's going to get monetized and it's going
to earn me some money that's nice it's always nice
to get some money from your work but that's not
the biggest benefit i get from it but still you
know if this video sits on youtube for the next
20 years you'll earn tens of thousands of dollars for
me just this one video so that's pretty nice that
means that this this hour and a half that i've
invested up to this point to be talking about this
this is going to get rewarded with thousands of dollars
so that's pretty nice but also it's gonna like help
many people out there it's gonna help tens of thousands
of people to figure out their life and it's gonna
add to them building a better life for themselves and
ultimately some people from this video from taking this advice
will become millionaires some will a few will become billionaires
you know over the next 20 years and we're talking
really big picture some people will become enlightened some people
will experience infinite love some people will discover god some
people will find their dream you know partner some people
will fix their health problems so a lot of good
will be done for society so that's great from my
point of view building a better world but also as
i'm talking i'm practicing and developing my speaking skills so
that's good because that's going to synergize with the next
episode and the next episode you know i do 100
more of these my speaking skills will double triple over
the next 10 years that will make me a powerful
public speaker in the future that will be very valuable
because then i can use that to influence people and
make the world even better and i can also enjoy
the better my speaking skills become the more enjoyable it
is you see after 10 years of speaking on camera
not 10 but like eight years of speaking on camera
um like doing what i'm doing now is the most
fun part of my day it seems like i'm up
here working really hard no this last hour and a
half that i've been talking in my mind it seemed
like five minutes it's nothing it's so easy what i'm
doing right here is so effortless that's what's beautiful about
it on the one hand it's very profound insight on
the other hand it's the most effortless part of my
day this is the easiest part of my day is
sitting in front of the camera and talking that's what
happens when you develop high skill in something and you're
relatively proficient with it and you're strong in that area
it also happens to be a strength of mine so
you know you're building on your strengths you want to
align what you're doing you want to align the skills
you're building with your strengths not with your weaknesses so
that's happening also as i'm speaking i'm hearing myself speak
and i'm refining my own internal models of understanding of
reality so every video i shoot helps me to understand
myself and my own models better i also get feedback
from from people once they you know post their comments
and stuff that also helps me to kind of correct
my models and adjust them and polish them up and
ultimately that all contributes every episode i shoot really even
though it helps you it helps me even more because
it helps me to build up my model and my
model is the most valuable thing that i have in
my life and then this model that i build over
the next 10 20 years is going to become so
amazing that then i'll write books based upon it hopefully
once i get to that point um i already am
writing some stuff but it's really difficult to write it
all down because it's so vast and deep and complex
but eventually i'll get it into book form and i'll
use it to make even deeper videos and i'll use
it to make even deeper talks and um and so
that becomes very rewarding to me so see when all
of these things synergize in this way that's when you
get the most meaning out of life and out of
your work so try to set your life up that
way like for example most people when they listen to
a podcast or an audio book to them it's just
like a one-off thing okay i've listened to it kind
of nice okay and then they just kind of move
on and it's disconnected from everything else that's going on
in their life for me if i listen to a
podcast or read a book to me that's going into
my model that's adding to my model that's refining my
model so it has much more significance than it would
to an ordinary person also it helps me to then
deepen my videos deep in my work it helps me
to help a lot of other people um that makes
it much more valuable there are these sorts of synergistic
effects and so what i want you to understand is
that this did not happen by accident i designed it
this way and i'm not saying you have to copy
me because you're you you have your own unique values
skills strengths and weaknesses and talents and proclivities and biases
that are different from mine i'm just giving you an
example of how you can kind of build your life
with these sorts of different synergies we have to sit
down and actually think about what kind of things will
synergism synergize in my life in the same way that
if you're if you're playing a deep rpg you rpg
gamers all right uh and you like to min max
the [ __ ] out of your characters the way
that i do what you do like one of the
most fun parts of any new rpg that you sit
down to play is like before i even play it
i will sit there for a few hours just brainstorming
and strategizing what kind of character i want what kind
of classes and subclasses and starting skills and you know
what kind of strengths and weaknesses you can usually select
these at the beginning of your you know of your
game how do i want to you know build out
my characters so that uh for the rest of the
game all of my skills and characters are going to
synergize with each other in a good way well if
you're doing that for your rpg characters why aren't you
doing it for your life why aren't you doing it
for you so figure out what things you're going to
be investing your skill points in and remember there's trade-offs
just like in a good rpg there's trade-offs you can't
have it all you have limited you have finite time
you have finite resources and energy and you have finite
money it's all about how strategically are you going to
allocate those things and also unlike an rpg where with
an rpg usually you have like a blank slate you
can literally choose any character any stats anything you can
kind of do whatever you want it's a little bit
more challenging with life because you're born with a certain
set of conditions so imagine like if you started an
rpg normally you could choose to be an orc an
elf a goblin a troll a you know a human
a dwarf or whatever you can select one and each
one has their own strengths and weaknesses already baked into
that class or that race but you don't get to
do that in life in life you're just born as
a [ __ ] orc that's what you are you're
an orc you can't change your orkness or you're a
dwarf and that's what you are and maybe you don't
even like being a dwarf but [ __ ] you're
a dwarf you got to deal with it and so
now the question is okay i'm a [ __ ]
dwarf i don't want to be a dwarf i want
to be an elf but [ __ ] i'm a
dwarf okay um but i am what i am now
i gotta make what's the best i can make of
this how can i be the best dwarf that i
could be what skills do i need to synergize what
classes and subclasses do i need how do i got
to allocate my points to become the best dwarf and
when you do all that and you align it really
well eventually what you'll realize is that being a dwarf
isn't so bad and then you'll actually grow to love
being the dwarf that you are it might take you
a few decades or maybe you were lucky and you
were born as an elf the way that you wanted
to be i don't know you know we're all a
little bit different so you have to customize you have
to very much customize what's going to be happening in
your life to to what you are and you know
uh part of the challenge of this whole thing is
that you know in an rpg it's it's it's very
easy because like you know you're a dwarf you're an
elf whatever it's a clear label it's a clear image
it just tells you but when you're bored as a
human you actually don't even know imagine that you're a
dwarf but you don't even know that you're a dwarf
maybe it's like that story you know what is that
that that goose or that uh swan baby swan that
was born to a bunch of ducklings you know and
um and it thought that it was a duckling because
all the other ducklings were ducklings but it's like a
swan and a swan kind of looks like a duckling
when it's small but it's not when it's big it's
kind of like that as a human you're born and
you're undifferentiated you don't really know what you are yet
and it's going to take you 20 years 30 years
just to figure out you're a [ __ ] dwarf
and the way you can hasten that process though is
by doing a lot of deep introspection the more you
introspect the more you contemplate the more you study the
more you study different perspectives the sooner you will realize
you're a dwarf and then the sooner you will realize
the best way for a dwarf to live and it's
when you align yourself with your dwarfness and you become
you don't need to become the best dwarf you can
be you just need to get on the path towards
becoming the best dwarf you can be just just getting
on the path and walking the path is already enough
to start feeling good about yourself what really sucks is
when you're out of whack so much you're so out
of alignment that you're like you don't even know you're
a dwarf and you're living like an elf even though
you are a dwarf and then so you're like a
dwarf trying to live like an elf envying the elf
not realizing you're a dwarf and then that's when things
don't click for you so i hope this talk has
sobered you a bit and has gotten you to appreciate
the importance of investing deeply and patiently into yourself now

should be and then of course to follow through on

helps me to stay financially independent and lastly you can
find my second channel called actualizedclips that makes this content
a little bit easier to digest and to share and
to review i want to warn you that every teacher
that you study under whether it's me or anybody else
is going to have biases some of these biases can
be very negative some of them can be positive some
of them can be can be neutral some of them
don't really matter but regardless you're never going to find
a human that that doesn't have biases even if they're
enlightened and awakened and all that they're going to have
biases the more you listen to them the more the
biases will get baked into you their biases will get
baked into you and they will limit your sense of
possibilities and so some of you can over consume my
content you know consume all of my content sort of
religiously and then what i want to warn you against
there is that if you're doing that i mean it's
fine to watch all my content i recommend you do
but you have to also balance it out with other
perspectives with other teachings and teachers with other books and
so forth because otherwise you're going to you're going to
get my biases and you're going to let my biases
limit what's possible for you and that's going to become
a problem for you it's very important that on this
journey you stay true to yourself to your values to
your uniqueness customize the things that i talk about to
you some of the things i talk about are not
going to apply to you don't try to make them
fit if they don't fit some of the topics that
i cover i cover them from my own personal interests
and my personal interests may not align with yours so
make sure that with with my content the important thing
is not that you get hung up on that on
the little details and on the you know specific examples
the important thing is that you get the big picture
you learn the overall principles and then you use those
not to become a copycat version of leo but to
become yourself authentically fully yourself while applying some of these
broader life principles to help you to do that do
you see the difference i'm not trying to create a
bunch of copycat versions of myself in you so watch
out for that trap and as long as you do
then stay tuned for more
