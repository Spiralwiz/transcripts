hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the paradox of
self trust how do you develop trust in yourself in
this work while at the same time questioning many of
the limiting aspects of yourself and your worldview there's a
very interesting paradox at the heart of personal development which
is that on the one hand all personal development advice
tells you to question yourself question the things you believe
and to really deeply doubt very fundamental aspects of your
being and then on the other hand all personal development
advice tells you to trust yourself completely so what should
you do should you doubt yourself should you trust yourself
how do we reconcile this this is very difficult it's
a very challenging sort of Gordian knot for the newbie
of personal development to unravel and even when you're getting
to the intermediate phases of personal development it's still very
tricky to grapple with this because really what you're doing
with all personal development work is you're trying to understand
okay what aspects of myself should I trust and what
aspects of myself are deceptive and misleading and sort of
counter-intuitively leading me down the wrong paths in life and
finding that middle ground being able to discern between the
two is what the bulk of the work is for
that's why you're doing the work you see I want
to help you to sort out some of the good
from the bad here so one problem is that you're
not doubting deeply enough you're not nearly doubting deeply enough
some of the things you need to be doubting and
then on the other hand the problem is is that
you don't have faith in the things you have faith
in those quote unquote right parts of you what I
want to talk about is I want to give you
some lists and some guidelines for how to understand the
things that you should be doubting and the things you
should be having faith in because what's very interesting is
that what I see in newbies and I experienced this
myself passing through the newbie stages of personal development is
that the newbie falls into two extremes here one problem
for the newbie is that he trusts very blindly and
gullibly his own mind basically he doesn't recognize the self
deceptive characteristics of the mind so the newbie tends to
trust his beliefs his beliefs about people about the world
about himself these beliefs could be very limiting or they
could even be empowering beliefs but nevertheless he really trusts
them he buys into them hook line and sinker and
that creates a lot of problems for him down the
road because every belief ends up being limiting even the
positive ones so there's that aspect we're going to talk
a lot more about that as a whole can of
worms he also trusts his fears a lot he trusts
his emotions the various emotional triggers and buttons that he
has he trusts those when really he shouldn't be and
of course he trusts his ego way too much way
too much so this misplaced trust leads the new be
completely astray in life and then on the other hand
he doesn't trust enough this is the other extreme for
the newbie he said he doesn't trust enough his intuition
and what I'm going to call his higher self but
see what is the right intuition what is the proper
higher self these labels like ego or intuition or higher
self they're very abstract labels so it's not really helpful
for me to tell you these things just like this
because in your mind it doesn't really resolve anything because
you need like the fine-grained distinctions and details so that
your mind can actually sort out what can be trusted
and what can't be trusted in a sense this is
sort of the same problem that a computer software runs
into for example operating systems right they have to distinguish
between what is a computer virus and what is legitimate
useful software that you're installing on the machine and sometimes
you have false positives like you've if you install a
antivirus kind of checker program right like Norton security sound
like that then one thing that will annoy you about
that kind of software is that it hits you with
false positives that means that it thinks oh this thing
is bad it's a virus and actually you know that
no this not a virus this is a good program
that I want to install on my computer and then
of course it also has the opposite problem is that
it doesn't detect the viruses because if you got a
new sneaky virus it comes into your machine and your
security software is not up-to-date yet it doesn't catch that
virus and the virus gets you well the same thing
has sort of happened in your mind and this is
tricky because the devil is in details the same sort
of problem is faced by your your biological immune system
right it has to distinguish between what are the good
substances for your body to accept and then what are
the bad foreign agents that it should reject and sometimes
the body gets it wrong in fact there's a whole
slew of diseases called autoimmune diseases or what happens is
that your immune system attacks itself it sacks various organs
in the body because it now for some reason believes
that these organs in your body even though they're your
own and somehow believes it's diluted itself into thinking that
oh these are actually bad for and ages I need
to kill them and it actually sends out like certain
cells I go out and try to kill these parts
of your body which of course leads to some disastrous
results and likewise your immune system can go wrong the
other way in the other extreme and it can let
all sorts of foreign agents come into your body that
will kill you because it doesn't defend you properly against
the foreign agents right so it's very important for these
systems very complex systems they have to they have to
very carefully distinguish and the devil is in the details
so for the newbie you know this creates neurosis because
look at this for the newbie on the one hand
he's trusting all these false beliefs and phears and his
ego in his mind a lot so that creates a
lot of neuroses but also he doesn't trust the higher
self in him and the intuition his own innate creative
capacities he doesn't really trust in those and then so
of course yeah he becomes neurotic he becomes fearful in
places in life where he shouldn't be fearful he becomes
dysfunctional in those places where he should be functional right
this is what neurosis is neurosis fundamentally is an inability
to trust in yourself it's to always be kind of
fighting with yourself grappling with yourself do you face that
problem as a student of personal development is that like
you're fighting yourself to be disciplined you're fighting yourself to
get motivated you're fighting yourself to resist certain foods or
certain temptations or you're telling yourself no I got to
do this because this is what I have been told
or this is what's right this is what should happen
because you have these rules right that's classic neurosis so
personal development work is supposed to help you to on
why your that neuroses because hey you know living a
neurotic life is not very pretty it's stressful it's dramatic
it's just like needless drama in your life why do
you want that you don't you want to get rid
of it but how do you get rid of it
is it real trick so you got to find out
and you got to know what you should be doubting
within your system of beliefs itself and what you should
be trusting and a nun in a nutshell what you're
doing with all personal development work is that you're discovering
self-deceptions many many many very sneaky and very subtle self-deceptions
that have been part of this system that we call
you the mind and the body for years and decades
and it's very hard to go in there in to
isolate in to pinpoint what these viruses that are infecting
your mind actually are but let me help you here
so let me first give you a list of things
that you should start to doubt about yourself and when
I mean doubt I'm not talking about doubting other people
or what other people say everything I'm talking about in
this episode is all you right we're talking about self
trust and self doubt not other trust and other doubt
if you have problems with trusting other people or if
you are like a constant skeptic and skeptical of everything
people tell you including what I tell you that's another
matter another matter and actually what you'll discover if you
pay close attention what I'm telling you here in this
episode is that your trust issues with other people and
with other ideas and belief systems and so forth your
skepticism that actually it's rooted in a deep distrust of
yourself it's because you can't trust yourself that you have
problems trusting others and it's because you doubt yourself that
you doubt everything else in the external world so let's
focus on you you as a self as an ego
that's the first thing you should start to doubt is
the ego and what the ego is is basically the
entire structure of mind that you have this notion that
you are an individual separate from life somehow separate from
other people separate from the world separate from nature suffer
from the environment that you are there and I am
here and that you need to defend yourself this whole
defense mechanism structure needs to start to be doubted the
newbie never really doubts this very seriously the newbie doesn't
look at his own self biases have you noticed that
everything you believe and almost every idea you hold is
biased towards yourself in an untruthful sort 'we have you
noticed this so for example if you're driving on the
road and someone cuts you off you get pissed off
at the person who cut you off you might say
well that makes sense he cut me off of course
I'm gonna get pissed off okay but what's interesting is
that if you cut somebody off you will not hold
yourself to that same standard will you you will come
up with a rationalization which will say something oh yeah
but you know Leo I was in a hurry you
know I wasn't hurting my child was sick so I
am justified in cutting this person off that's a very
innocent example hopefully if your student personal development you've been
noticing these sorts of self biases and when I tell
you the word self bias immediately in your mind a
thousand examples should pop up of the ways in which
you are untruthfully self biased it means you give yourself
your ego preferential treatment for examples a lot of guys
do this in relationships they'll say you know what I
love open relationships I like seeing lots of girls okay
so you like saying lots of girls that's fine but
then what happens when your girl one of the girls
you're seeing says hey you know what I want to
see other guys too I like seeing lots of guys
are you gonna be cool with that and now see
the mind likes to play a lot of very sneaky
games here so what the Maya could say is like
oh yeah leo sure sure yeah I'll let her go
see other guys I don't care because you know what
I got other girls I'll just replace her with another
girl but see that doesn't really address the issue does
it what if all of your girls wanted to see
other guys how would you feel then and what if
you couldn't replace them how would you feel then would
you still be cool with it and here you have
to be very very honest because your mind gets very
very sneaky right comes up with a lot of rationalizations
so this is just a couple of examples of what
I mean by looking at yourself biases right and then
kind of holding yourself accountable for them and saying wait
a minute why is this is there this double standard
why do I have all these double standards why is
my outrage that I feel towards other people filled with
so many double standards and then when you start to
notice that you see oh yeah it's all about me
the whole game that I'm playing here with my ego
is I'm trying to get more for me so of
course all these double standards are here because it's just
me it's all for me and then you know if
the ego is really bad if the ego is totally
out of control the Eagles say well leo so what
so what what's wrong with an ego what's wrong with
ego what what's wrong with it being all about me
what's wrong with that ah it would take me hours
to explain all the things wrong with that this is
where you need to start to trust a little bit
of your intuition just try to see what's wrong with
that but let's move on because there's a lot of
other points I want to talk about so there's this
also you have to start to doubt yourself defense mechanisms
so all these I've started I've already started to go
into the self itself mechanisms that people have against their
double standards so you have to start to question yourself
defense mechanisms all the excuses you make for why you're
special why you should be treated differently also you have
to start to doubt all of your beliefs and ideologies
so anything you believe and you hold it's like okay
this is it this is the most certain thing that
I know this cannot possibly be false that thing right
there you need to doubt that I'll tell you that
flat-out doubt the [ __ ] out of it throw
it away that [ __ ] that most cherished belief
you have whatever it is God science atheism you know
your beliefs about men and women about sexuality about business
about money about life about death whatever that's the thing
you got a question and question it so deeply that
you stop believing in it but of course what ego
really wants to do that not very many that's the
problem right because your immune system has actually now been
corrupted by these beliefs and now because your immune system
actually is composed of these beliefs it doesn't want to
question some of the most deepest beliefs you hold because
it's threatening to the whole structure of the ego right
but this is a problem for you because your immune
system once it's filled with these strong beliefs then it
will use those to attack any possibility for growth and
consciousness that you run across in your future because growth
and consciousness is anti all beliefs it's anti ideological you
see that's why every belief gets in the way now
some beliefs are much worse than others but don't let
your mind trick you into thinking like oh well yeah
some beliefs are bad but some beliefs are good no
uh it's not about good and bad it's really about
whether you're a slave to your beliefs or you're actually
free of your beliefs that's the issue the issue is
not about true and false beliefs all beliefs are false
I'll tell you that right now so that's not the
issue the issue is are you actually practically free of
your beliefs and ideologies do you actually hold them lightly
or do you hold them tightly like a baby blanket
that you need to protect yourself with that's the issue
so start to doubt every single n of your beliefs
also start to doubt your mind and all your thoughts
your entire structure of the rational mind everything that is
quote-unquote rational and logical sorted out all that all of
it start to question rationality itself start to question logic
itself start to question all your reasons for your beliefs
so every belief you hold has a justification behind it's
like well I believe the earth is round because X
Y Z that's how it works right those XYZ are
the justifications and those are the things you need to
start to doubt why do you believe X Y Z
well because of ABC and why do you believe ABC
well because of D F G and why do you
believe those well because of LMNOP or whatever you know
right you have like a nested kind of hierarchy of
justifications and need to trace all those down to the
very bottom to see where they terminate doubt rationality itself
doubt logic itself the out-science these are things that in
general people do not doubt enough they are taken on
faith and that turns out to be a very damaging
thing because once you take all these things on faith
your mind becomes closed to experiencing the deeper states of
consciousness and awareness that are possible and you're basically locked
in to your present normal mundane everyday state of consciousness
which is a very very limited state you can't do
very much in that state you need to get to
higher states and you can't get there through logic and
rationality and through science at least not as they're typically
conceived so you have to start to question all those
now I'm not saying you have to abandon that and
become some kind of stupid [ __ ] fool who
does completely irrational things I'm just saying start to question
start to doubt apply the skepticism in the right places
internally not externally so the biggest problem that self ordained
skeptics commit is that they're skeptical of everything but focused
outward their skepticism isn't focused inward enough on themselves if
you want to be a skeptic that's great I love
skepticism but the most skeptical thing you should be skeptical
about is skepticism itself right your skepticism has to go
so deep that even you start to doubt your own
skepticism that's when you're being a proper skeptic otherwise what
it is is just a tool for the ego to
reject new ideas and new avenues for growth also don't
think that I've left religion on touched here so while
you're doubting science and logic and rationality at the same
time doubt the [ __ ] out of religion every
religious belief you have about God and what's right and
what's good and what's evil and about the Bible and
whatever in a few if you grew up a Hindu
or a Jew or a Christian or a Buddhist it
doesn't matter question all that because all that is holding
you back from actually growing and discovering the higher states
of consciousness that actually your religion is talking about also
start to doubt your emotions so when you feel angry
when you feel jealous when you feel defensive when you
feel hurt when you feel fearful when you feel like
you need to protect yourself when you feel judgmental when
you feel violent and angry when you feel self-righteous all
these sorts of emotions question all those emotions ask yourself
what is this emotion is it actually true could it
be a tool of the ego that is being used
here to play games to manipulate myself and to manipulate
others could that really be what's going on with these
emotions the newbie doesn't really question these emotions he's actually
just reacting to these emotions he's a slave to these
emotions also question your quote unquote good emotions not just
the bad emotions but also the good ones because actually
this distinction between good emotions bad emotions you've made the
wrong distinction there you don't really know what the good
emotions are what the bad emotions are really the bad
emotion is any emotion that you are a slave to
and that you're on - so this could include emotions
like happiness and excitement and love these can be very
damaging emotions because it's very easy to use love to
actually hurt people it's very easy to used love to
manipulate people to delude yourself about what you're doing with
this person in a relationship why you're with them very
easy to delude yourself with love excitement can also be
very diluting as an emotion you can't just blindly follow
excitement wherever it leads you because it could lead you
down some very terrible paths in life so you have
to question your excitement to these things that you take
for granted like oh I'm excited by this thing well
yeah sure you might be excited by having sex with
lots of people that might be very exciting to you
but is that really growing you or you might be
excited about earning lots of money in business and sure
that's exciting but the question is is that really what
you should be doing with your life or you might
be excited to get into a relationship and get married
settle down have a bunch of kids and the question
is is that really the choice that's going to grow
you the most or is that actually an escape so
you have to question all those yeah emotions can be
very self deceptive also you have to question and doubt
your criticism of that people also known as projection have
you noticed yet that almost every single criticism you make
of other people whether it's teachers friends family coworkers bosses
celebrities business people that you read about in the Wall
Street Journal you know your enemies if you have any
enemies if you judge me if you judge a book
that you're reading if you judge a video that you're
watching have you noticed that all this stuff is just
a projection of your own ego it has nothing to
do with me it has nothing to do with the
person it has nothing to do with the celebrity or
what kind of dickish thing you think your boss did
to you whatever has nothing to do with that it's
really all about you it's about your own insecurities and
your own projections onto other people so you have to
really start to question every single criticism that you have
to the point where you've questioned your own criticism so
much that you can't even make a critical move anymore
it's like I want to criticize that guy but I'm
too aware I can see that my criticism of him
is actually a denial of something that I'm doing it's
actually a projection oh I can't criticize him anymore right
you want to get to that point also you want
to doubt all your cultural preferences cultural indoctrination is huge
in every single culture I don't care if you're a
a Hindu or if you're Asian or if you're Japanese
or if you're Middle Eastern if you're European or if
you're American it doesn't matter you have thousands of cultural
preferences and norms and beliefs that you have just kind
of soaked up like a sponge from your culture and
you've never doubted them you've never really questioned them and
it's especially dangerous for people in Western culture because as
a Western culture part of Western culture is sort of
this kind of like individualistic anti cultural norm which says
like oh yeah I'm kind of a typical American so
you know I don't really buy into culture all that
much but then you know Americans are instead of having
the traditional cultures of like Eastern countries they have a
culture of consumerism like the popular culture the music culture
the videogame culture the drug culture the college culture the
pickup culture the whatever culture so if you consider yourself
a cultural if you could consider yourself kind of like
a modern American or western minded type of person doesn't
matter where you live you still have these very powerful
cultural influences in you which are shaping the things that
you're pursuing in life what you're doing what you're desiring
what you're avoiding in life whether it's money sex marriage
family all this kind of stuff largely you don't even
know what your authentic desires are in life because the
cultural influences are so strong and yet also so subtle
and so taken for granted by you that they're never
questioned yeah it's like you've been infected by the cultural
virus and now that virus is running you and that's
all stuff you got a question question very very deeply
also you should question while you're at it any moralization
or shoulds that you have I have entire episodes about
this we're talking about the should statements and how you
moralize to yourself and other people but basically all those
statements you have such as like I should be fit
and I should be rich and I shouldn't be sick
and my kids should be good at school and my
wife should be pretty and this should be this way
and that should be that way and my husband should
be loyal to me and all these shoulds that you
have they all need to be questioned because they're holding
you back you have shoot statements because fundamentally you're not
making conscious choices in your life so you're dictating yourself
with these rules but these rules are very limiting they're
not robust enough they don't have enough requisite variety to
navigate life successfully because we live in a very complex
and nuanced world these days also you should question and
doubt your motivations which are based on obligation or duty
where are you motivated in life and you feel like
well I have to do this because there's a sense
of responsibility and duty whether it's coming from my culture
or from my family or from the fact that I'm
a husband or that I'm a wife or that I'm
a father or that I'm a mother or that I'm
a brother that I'm a sister or that I am
a student or that I'm a for that I'm a
boss or that I'm an employee or whatever question all
that most of those are not authentic to you and
they are creating neurotic forms of motivation in your life
this is why so many people have motivation problems in
life also you should deeply question when you beat yourself
up a lot of people like to beat themselves up
and be harsh with themselves talk harshly to themselves kind
of discipline harshly to themselves because they think that that's
the proper way to motivate yourself and that that will
actually lead to improvements and growth it won't that leads
to neuroses leads to unconsciousness leads to very screwed up
behavioral patterns in your life leads to lack of groundedness
and consistency in your action taking also does it make
you feel very good when you beat yourself up it
ruins your self-esteem or road your confidence and so forth
so you got to question why you do that and
why you feel like beating yourself up is preferable to
actually accepting and loving yourself who'd a thunk that that
would be a better option also you have to start
to question your web of beliefs what I call the
love beliefs or your entire model of reality so the
things you think about reality which seem very certain like
time-space the universe the Big Bang Theory and all this
kind of stuff you know whatever your models of reality
are whether you think God created reality or do you
think reality came out of you know nothing or whatever
you think all this is nonsense because it's not based
on any direct experience you have it's just ideas you
have likewise your ideas about men and women your ideas
about business your ideas about what's right wrong in the
world your ideas about terrorists your ideas about the government
your ideas about politics all this kind of stuff your
entire web of beliefs your entire model of reality he
is largely fictional and you have to go in there
and challenge and question every single one of them to
see wait a minute is this belief I have is
it grounded in actual direct experience or is it just
something I heard from somewhere and that I liked I
happen to like it so I just added it to
my web of beliefs you have to do that that's
a lot of work because you got a lot of
unquestioned beliefs in your model reality and lastly the thing
you got a really question is your identity your very
existential nature who you think you are what are you
as the most like metaphysical of questions what are you
are you a human being sitting there listening to me
is that what you are were you actually born are
you a kid who grew up and then went through
adolescence and then became an adult is that what you
actually are your identification with your body and your mind
is that actually what you are are you your models
of reality are you the things you believe are you
what your face looks like are you what your body
can do are you the athlete are you the guy
who can go to the gym and benchpress 300 pounds
is that actually what you are or is that an
identity that you've constructed and if it is just an
identity that you've constructed then what are you underneath the
construction if you deconstruct the entire identity what are you
left with what is that you have to deeply deeply
deeply question all those things so this is a list
of the things that you should be doubting that most
newbies take totally for granted and it takes so much
open-mindedness just to even understand my instructions to you here
because even though I told you all these things now
you have to go spend years years years maybe decades
questioning everything I told you by yourself you can't read
it in a book I'm not telling you to go
read the answers in a book because that won't happen
it's not going to you have to actually sit down
and dig in to yourself I can't tell you the
answers it's not about having answers it's about exploring these
in a sceptical manner without an agenda not trying to
prove or to disprove anything but just trying to look
at what the facts are of the situation where did
all these beliefs come from where did your cultural notions
and preferences come from are they authentically yours or have
they just kind of snuck their way into your life
now let me tell you some things that you should
trust you should trust more your intuition and what I'm
going to call your higher self your higher self is
the thing that we can contrast with the ego the
ego is worried about kind of defending itself acquiring more
for it self aggrandizing itself making it feel itself feels
secure special and protected the higher self is more about
just being in the present moment being open being spontaneous
being kind of playful and free the way that you
were as a child that kind of pure innocent sources
sense of self so you should obviously trust that more
and that can be difficult for some people to even
recognize themselves anymore because after twenty thirty years of life
you've been so bombarded with with traumatic events and people
screwing you over and various belief systems and indoctrination in
your school and your college from your professors from your
religious leaders from your politicians from your family from everybody
from the books you've been reading from the TV shows
you've been watching by popular culture you've been bombarded by
all this so that now it's like my original self
what is my original self I don't even know but
also it's possible to kind of just you know move
all that stuff apart move it all away and just
kind of get a whole sneak peek a little maybe
those old crack opens up through the facade through the
web of beliefs and you can kind of look down
deep through in there and then you can see oh
that's what yeah I have a memory of what it
was like to be my original self that thing you
can trust in fact that thing right there might be
uh the road map for you for how to get
out of this mess that you're in now today as
an adult so look at your child self as your
child self try to remember one of the things that
moved you what are the things that inspired you how
did you behave how did you hold your body how
did you speak how did you sit how did you
smile how did you relate to other people now you
got to be careful here because some kids they have
dysfunctional childhoods right off the bat so maybe you're one
of those unfortunate kids who was like beaten or molested
or even something a lot less sinister than that maybe
just some kids laugh at you at first grade you
know when you went to first grade some kids laughed
at you and because of that right off the bat
when you were seven years old already you couldn't properly
to relate to two boys and girls at school because
you were afraid of them laughing at you so you
know there will be aspects of your original self that
I think you can find even if you've been victimized
and traumatized as a kid but for some people it'll
be a lot harder than for others right and you
got to be careful this is where the you know
careful distinguishing has to happen when you trust parts of
yourself it's very dangerous because everything on this list of
things that I'm telling you that you can trust also
notice that it's very easy for the ego to to
use that as an escape kind of got a back
door so the ego will say like oh yeah when
I was a kid you know I was shy as
a kid I'm were being shy in first grade because
I was shy in first grade that means that's my
original self Leo told me that's my original self so
that means just like a shy introverted child and I'm
that way as an adult and that's how I'll be
forever no that's not what leo is telling you not
at all so you got to be very very careful
here with everything that I'm telling you that you should
trust you have to also be a little bit skeptical
about me like uh is my ego just using that
as a backdoor to actually get in there and manipulate
it its way into my ax into my psyche see
you should also trust the drive for truth there is
a drive in you that wants to find truth with
a capital T this is a very deep drive in
you but this drive has probably been hijacked by your
cultural upbringing so when I tell you to trust your
truck you're driving truth you might say oh yeah leo
that's already what I'm doing you know I'm religious and
that's why I believe in God because I trust my
drive for truth that's not what I'm saying or you
might say but leo you know yeah that's you know
I agree with you amen that's why I'm an atheist
and why I'm materialists and why I'm very skeptical and
scientific mind and very rational minded because I have this
dry this passion for truth that's not what I mean
either see both of those are actually backdoor manipulations of
the ego what I mean is a drive for truth
is like direct experience of reality it's a very sober
thing truth as distinguished from beliefs truth with a capital
T is not a belief it is not science it
is not religion it is not what you would typically
call spirituality what is it that well you'll only find
out after many many years on the path towards truth
of the capital T and a very self honest way
very carefully moving away from all the egoic stuff that
I talked about earlier moving away from all that clearing
all that way that stuff that that debris out from
your vision and then you might have a little sneak
peek preview of what truth looks like if you do
all that stuff successfully and that's that's a tall order
to fill to do all that stuff's just like this
cuz all this stuff in your way all this debris
it's it's not just like dead static debris this debris
is like alive it's highly animated and it wants to
survive it will not release its grip on you unless
you're very very persistent and your very self honest and
very open-minded about this pursuit cuz like it clings to
you right it sinks it's claws into you all this
ago 'ok stop it's really alive it's life also what
you should trust is love compassion and gratitude these drives
in you you have these drives everyone does you have
the drive for love unconditional love for compassion and for
gratitude and these you can you can find solace in
them you can find grounding them they can be like
your anchor but also again it can be like a
back door for the Eco especially for example love it's
very easy to rationalize many of the egoic things that
you do in your life as being loved but actually
they're not love they're a distorted form of love like
for example if you think of romantic love these are
distorted forms of love and even the love that you
have for example for your children this is a distorted
form of love because it's a highly selective conditional form
of love so for example when you go to school
to look at your kids you know interacting in school
and you see a classroom full of kids and you
only love your kids that's not it's very easy to
love your kids the ego loves to love its possessions
that's what comprises the ego the ego loves to love
your car and loves to love your business and loves
to love your kids it loves to love your your
spouse it loves to love that kind of stuff what's
challenging for the ego to love is the world at
large can you love the bum on the street can
you love the other kids in the classroom can you
love the person that your girlfriend or your boyfriend left
you for that's real love that's unconditional love but that's
her that's not what most people think about when I
say love now that kind of love and all of
its manifestations the unconditional manifestations of love those you can
trust in so if you have a desire like you
just see a poor homeless man sitting on the curb
and you just have a desire because you see you
feel compassion for him it's like man it's so hot
it's a hundred degrees outside this guy is burning up
in the Sun he's probably hasn't eaten enough in a
week he looks dirty probably hasn't had a shower a
month uh you know I want to give him 20
bucks that kind of drive that you can trust or
the gratitude you might feel like maybe you're reading a
book you're reading some amazing book that somebody wrote a
hundred years ago the person is dead now but you
could see from reading the book that this is this
is a brilliant book and this person devoted a significant
chunk of his life to writing this book and you're
reading this book and you finished the book it's like
wow that was an amazing book it really really touched
me and then you feel this sort of sense of
gratitude for the writer of this book like oh wow
I get I'm really grateful that this person um went
out of his way to contribute something like this to
society that you can trust also what you can trust
is silence silence and solitude when you sit down and
you just sit on your couch late at night in
the silence by yourself and you just shut up and
you just ponder life that silence you can trust all
the answers to life are really found in that silence
but the question is how much of that silence do
you actually experience on a regular basis if you're like
most people very little because actually you spend most of
your life drowning out that silence with noise music video
games TV Internet YouTube magazines friends partying sex relationships children
business whatever have you started to look into those behaviors
and started to see their self deceptive nature how the
point of all that noise is what to distract you
from the silence which is one of the only things
in life you can trust the silence another thing you
can trust is your emotions now here you're going to
say but Leo you just told us in the other
list not to trust our emotions and now you're saying
I can trust my emotions which is it exactly exactly
that's why this issue is paradoxical and that's why it
requires work that's why the devil is in the details
your emotions are actually very accurate signals sent to you
by the body and by the unconscious mind they're shockingly
uncannily eerily accurate you can use them to diagnose exactly
what's wrong with you physically and mentally they are very
powerful signals and signposts but the problem is that most
people are not taught how to read their emotions it
takes years of work to be able to read your
emotions and to be able to really trust in them
but after you've been doing personal development for a few
years you start to see as you develop more awareness
over your emotions like oh this emotion is telling me
this thing and that emotion there is telling me that
thing and I can actually use them as very accurate
compasses to guide me to where I ultimately want to
be in life but that requires very carefully separating that
out from being triggered by your emotions so for example
what I'm telling you here I'm not telling you that
when you feel angry and you want to yell at
somebody because they cut you off in traffic that that
right there would be you know only oh I'm just
trusting my emotions you know my emotions told me to
flip that guy off because he's a [ __ ]
[ __ ] no that would be you succumbing to
getting triggered by the emotions which is not the same
thing as really trusting your deeper emotions right not the
surface level annoyances in your life but like the deep
emotions for example you have two deep desires emotional desires
in yourself if you've noticed for connection with other people
for experiencing nature for beauty for justice for contribution to
the world for love for truth something like truth is
not just a intellectual pursuit and something like contribution or
love or justice after epitome you know at their peak
these things are emotional in nature these are the emotions
sort of speak of the higher self the drives the
higher self and you have to get in touch with
that and separate those out from the drives of the
lower self and how do you do that by doubting
a lot so in order to get to this list
of all the stuff you can trust really the way
you get there in practice is by doubting the [
__ ] out of everything and then whatever remains is
simply all the stuff you can trust there's really a
little possibility to just start with all these things that
you can trust that's very challenging because how do you
know what you can trust and what you can't trust
only by going through a very radical and deep process
of inquiry sorting the wheat from the chaff so to
speak and then you can come up with a list
of stuff to trust it's not really enough to just
listen to my lesson and say okay I'm just going
to trust all this stuff no because you're not going
to have the fine-grained distinctions made that are necessary unless
you go through the doubting process see so even though
I'm kind of giving you a shortcut here there's a
only so far that this truck can take you you
do have to actually jump into the mud and get
your hands dirty because this stuff is decided and learned
in the same way that you learn to ride a
bicycle you don't learn to ride a bicycle by listening
to me tell you how to ride a bicycle you
have to actually sit on the damn bicycle you have
to go start to pedal fall down a few times
scrape your knees you know take a few nasty spills
and then you'll learn how to balance on the bicycle
same thing here other things you can trust are your
creative Muse have you noticed there's a muse inside of
you it's really like a separate most ideas and inspirations
come to you where you want to go out there
you want to create stuff whether you want to create
video games or movies you want to write novels you
want to paint you want to change the world whatever
you wanted these are all creative sort of activities and
they're there sprach ting you buy and use this muse
can be cultivated and listened to it's like a little
voice inside of you it's a very faint voice but
you can learn to listen to it that thing you
can trust also what you can trust is awareness and
direct experience awareness as distinguished from the mind or thinking
thinking in general you cannot trust but awareness and direct
experience you can trust direct conscious experience just to explain
what that is is a whole hour long discussion can't
really go into it here but if you're following along
with me and you've heard some my other discussions previously
about awareness then you know what I'm talking about and
that you can trust awareness you can trust and also
what you can trust is your natural powers as a
human being as a human being you have natural defenses
and capabilities that Nature has equipped you with to live
survive and to thrive and these you can trust you
can trust in your ability to walk you can trust
in your ability to talk you can trust in your
ability to uh to procure food and find water and
shelter and to be confident in yourself to not be
cripplingly afraid of other people right you can trust all
these things because basically these are all abilities that all
your ancestors needed to possess in order to survive if
they didn't possess these abilities they would be dead and
you wouldn't be here so in a very real sense
these are natural abilities that are hard-coded into your DNA
and those you can trust in so that concludes the
list of stuff you can trust what does it mean
to trust this stuff it means that you take guidance
from these parts of you if you notice everything I
discussed here they're almost like parts of yourself there are
parts of yourself sort of like little voices you can
almost think of it as like the devil on your
shoulder the angel on your shoulder you know the devil
whispers in your ear some stuff obviously you shouldn't trust
it angel whisper some stuff into your ear you should
trust that so that's kind of what it's like if
you want to really um you know dumb it down
it's kind of like that so yeah you listen to
that angel on your ear your creative muse you listen
to your awareness faculties you listen to your drives for
passion for I mean for your drives for love for
compassion for gratitude for beauty for uh for contribution right
you listen to that pure original inner self the one
you had as a child you listen to your intuition
you listen to your higher emotions that's what it means
and you trust in those in fact you trust your
life to those things completely you surrender your logical mind
to those things so that when it comes time to
make decisions about who you're going to marry her what
part of the country you're gonna move to or what
kind of business you're going to start or whether you
should go off live in the woods and become a
Buddha or something like that you you don't listen to
your logical mind you don't listen to your belief systems
you don't listen to your cultural background you don't listen
to any of that kind of stuff you listen to
your inner muse your you know your inner emotions your
inner intuition you listen to that instead and you just
have the faith to follow through on that that's what
it is that's really what religious faith is so this
notion of religious faith you know a lot of people
including myself take faith as kind of a dirty word
we don't like that we're in rashly minded people don't
really like the word faith because it could mean like
all just kind of blind belief and stuff but that's
not really what faith is what real faith is is
making this distinction between the things you can't trust and
the things you can trust and then fully with your
whole heart buying into everything that you can trust because
you have done the inner work and then just kind
of surrender your entire life to it surrendering your logical
mind to that which doesn't really involve blind faith or
belief it's it's more of like an emotional surrender and
that can be difficult for left brained thinkers to to
accept swallow that because if you're really stuck in your
mind you think that your mind is your best tool
actually your mind is not your best tool you need
to start to doubt your mind until you realize that
your heart is your best tool and that the mind
serves the heart so yeah so the key is to
make this distinction between the ego and the higher self
and like I said this requires getting in the mud
getting your hands dirty simultaneously gonna have to doubt yourself
a lot but also trust certain parts of yourself and
I can't really tell you how to do that I
wish I could I've given you my best attempt with
this these two lists but you're gonna have to go
in there and actually sort out what's what in your
own mind that's like the growth curve here generally speaking
the growth curve for developing self Trust will look something
like this if you're a wounded Newton newbie like you're
depressed or you have a severe victim type of mindset
a very low self-esteem you if your start off there
you need some basic trust in yourself because if you're
a wounded new newbie the problem there the reason you're
so wounded is because you have lost all sense of
trust so once you develop some trust there then you
move up and you're kind of like the normal newbie
the non wounded newbie and this person needs to start
to doubt doubt everything got all your believes doubt all
your ideologies that all your models of the world doubt
rationality science God religion culture doubt at all doubt yourself
doubt your own doubt go through a few years of
that process doubting everything very painful very emotionally taxing then
you search get into intermediate territory and then intermediate territor
the problem there is that now you get a little
cocky because you've been doubting so much now you little
cocky and you're like oh well I already know what's
what because I've already spent a few years doubting but
actually you haven't doubted deeply enough yet so as an
intermediate now it gets even worse now you got a
doubt even harder doubt the [ __ ] that you
thought you could never doubt in your life doubt that
until like there's nothing left and then you got into
advance and then when you're at advanced what that looks
like is actually you're like oh hey you know I've
been doubting my whole life for five years and now
hey all the sudden I can find that I can
like trust myself a little bit wow that's wow what
a relief I can actually trust my heart I have
a heart I have emotions I have an intuition I
have an inner muse what is all this stuff this
is crazy this is like I've become a hippie look
at all this New Age stuff but I like it
I like it because it feels good it feels very
natural it feels like I'm a kid again wow this
is so cool that's when you start to become that
integrated human being that's when your mind and your heart
start to integrate ken wilber refers to this as the
Centaur the stage of development called the centaur the reason
he calls it adds kind of a cute a little
metaphor is because supposedly the Centaur is you know half
man half horse or half animal so he's got the
he's got a logical mind he hasn't lost a logical
mind and he's got also the animal part of him
the bottom the bottom half the horse is the animal
part and the center kind of fuses the two together
so that now the heart and the mind the logical
and the intuitive have come together and they function as
one unit integrated that's a pretty cool place to get
to but it takes work don't think you're going to
get there just in one or two years you're probably
looking at three five ten years of pretty deep inner
work because when you start off as an undeveloped person
who hasn't really done a lot of inner work then
the bottom line is that you really can't trust yourself
an undeveloped person his penalty is that he cannot trust
himself in life because if he trusts himself he's going
to get himself into trouble because he's not developed the
more you develop yourself the more you can then trust
yourself in the same way that if you have like
a child you know if you have a mature child
you can trust that child with the keys to the
car you could even trust that child with a bottle
of alcohol because you know the child is wise he's
mature so even if you leave a bottle of alcohol
at home and then you leave the child is there
he's mature he's not stupid enough to go drink the
whole thing but if you have a stupid child an
undeveloped child then when you leave the house you better
take the car keys all the whiskey in your file
in your you know in your office cabinet and you
better take all the guns and all the weapons in
your closet you better take all that [ __ ]
with you because if you leave him with all that
uh something's really Bad's gonna go down you see that's
the difference and it's like that with you right now
chances are unless you've done a lot of work on
yourself that you are that immature child that immature child
is in you and he's creating a mess or she's
creating a mess inside your mind and that's why your
life reflects that see the first three years I find
is the hardest part of this journey because the first
three years of personal development you're starting to question and
doubt so many parts of yourself and it feels confusing
it feels like you your sense of direction it might
feel like you're moving backwards it might feel like you're
regressing like you're not just working on external success and
you know you're going to be overwhelmed to the point
of depression with self-doubt during these first three years of
this journey maybe longer but man once you make it
past like three the three or the five year mark
and you've done all the work it starts to feel
really good because now the payoff starts to come back
to you start to see the results of all your
work and it's like oh I can trust myself low
back and I can let go of the reins a
little bit and my life doesn't fall apart and I
can be kind of spontaneous I don't have to be
rigid anymore I don't have to be very harsh with
myself I don't have to talk down to myself or
criticize myself none of this stuff and my life just
kind of flows it flows and that's ultimately what you're
working towards right you want your life to flow you
want your life to be effortless I talked about in
a prior episode how you want your life to be
effortless and some people have asked me Leo how do
I make an effortless life shoot a video about how
I can make my life effortless well haha everything I
talk about is really geared towards helping you to make
your life effortless to make it flow and man the
ability to trust yourself is a big component of that
the ultimate point you want to get to in your
life is complete trust 100% trust in your emotions in
your cognitions in your body sensations everything is just like
you're just like a force of nature there's no more
hesitation in you and even if there is hesitation you
trust in that hesitation doesn't bother you you're fully integrated
you're the center and then you're moving even beyond that
your trance sending the sent or that's the ultimate point
and this level of self Trust has to be earned
you can't read it in a book you can't go
buy it in the store you can't even learn it
from me really what I'm doing is I'm outlining a
path for you that you can choose to undertake hopefully
you're wise enough to see the benefits that will come
from that from being able to one day wake up
in the morning and say well today I 100% trust
myself wouldn't that be a powerful place to get to
in your life alright that's it I'm wrapping up please
