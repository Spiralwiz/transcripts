            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/4JcOrC9LH9w' target='_blank'>Best Supplements - What You Must Know About Supplementation</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Biohacking and Supplementation</b>: Leo discusses his background in biohacking, beginning a few years prior and his experimentation process with various supplements. He notes his desire to optimize his body and mind performance, not just through mental development, but also physical changes such as supplementation. Leo admits to a thyroid issue that led him down a more thorough investigation of supplements. 
</li><li><b>Process for Taking Supplements</b>: Leo shares a practical tip for managing supplementation, suggesting the use of a large pill box to keep track of and easily manage daily supplement intake. He notes that this method makes taking a variety of supplements less tedious and more manageable.
</li><li><b>Omega-3 Fish Oil</b>: Leo advises viewers to take Omega-3 fish oil, which he regards as the most important supplement because of its potential health benefits, such as improving cardiovascular health and reducing inflammation. He recommends a daily dosage of two capsules.
</li><li><b>Vitamin C</b>: Leo suggests a daily intake of 100 milligrams of Vitamin C, particularly to reinforce the immune system and help fight off colds. He emphasizes that high intake of Vitamin C is safe, as the body can flush out any excess. He recommends using a two-stage time-release capsule for optimal absorption.
</li><li><b>Vitamin D3</b>: He mentions Vitamin D3 as another crucial supplement, assuming that most people are likely deficient due to insufficient sunlight exposure. Leo suggests getting a blood test to determine specific Vitamin D3 levels and adjust supplementation accordingly. He also warns that the typical recommended doses might be too low, thus higher doses may be necessary.
</li><li><b>Annual vitamin D3 testing</b>: Leo recommends getting a blood test for vitamin D3 levels annually. As most people do not get enough sunlight, natural vitamin D3 levels might be low. It is also not found in foods, thus increasing the importance of supplements. He suggests taking larger doses than commonly recommended, up to 10,000 IU's a day, based on individual needs and test results.
</li><li><b>Maca supplement</b>: Another supplement Leo highly recommends is maca, a root from South America. Known as an energizing herb, it significantly boosts libido improving reproductive health for both men and women. It's suggested to take one 500mg pill daily. 
</li><li><b>Vitamin A for improving vision</b>: Leo has found beneficial effects of vitamin A on vision, improving sharpness in his personal experience. The preferred source of vitamin A should be fish liver oil as plant-based forms aren't as effective. But with vitamin A, it's important to watch dosage as overdosing is possible.
</li><li><b>Magnesium for digestion and bowel movements</b>: Particularly useful for those with constipation issues, magnesium helps in smooth digestion. Leo recommends six chelated magnesium pills a day to ensure bioavailability. 
</li><li><b>EGCG as Green tea extract</b>: Green tea has been found to have anti-aging benefits and antioxidants. EGCG is an extract from green tea that can be taken in pill form if one doesn't consume green tea daily. 
</li><li><b>Resveratrol for cardiovascular health and anti-aging</b>: A compound found in grapes and red wine, resveratrol is known for its positive effects on heart health and anti-aging. Available in supplement form, it provides the benefits without alcohol intake. 
</li><li><b>Astaxanthin supplement</b>: Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant, is recommended for overall health benefits. It is derived from salmon or algae and is suggested at a dosage of 12 milligrams.
</li><li><b>Usage of astaxanthin supplement</b>: Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant, is a recommended supplement that is found in salmon and can also be extracted from algae. It is rumored to act as a natural sunscreen, offering resistance to sunburn. The dose suggested is 12 milligrams.
</li><li><b>Basic minerals and vitamin supplements</b>: Regular use of elemental supplements like copper, zinc (in an absorbable form like zinc picolinate), vitamin K (as a K2 complex supplement with K1 and K2), and manganese is advised. Another recommendation is mega fulonic, a bioactive form of folic acid.
</li><li><b>Iron supplementation caution</b>: Iron supplementation should be done carefully; while women can supplement due to menstruation, for men, unless heavy bleeding is happening, there's usually no requirement. Over-supplementation could lead to cancer. The bioavailable form of iron, Ferro gel, is preferred.
</li><li><b>Supplementation of rhodiola and selenium</b>: Rhodiola is a herb that helps in energy stabilization and maintaining consistent cortisol levels. Selenium is an essential element that might be lacking in diets, but it shouldn't be overdosed. 
</li><li><b>Tarot stilbene and Vitamin B6</b>: Tarot stilbene, extracted from red grapes, is a more potent form than resveratrol and has health benefits. The most bioavailable form of Vitamin B6, called P 5 P (Pyridoxal 5 Phosphate), can be taken if the B6 levels are low. 
</li><li><b>Bioavailable form of curcumin</b>: Super bio curcumin, a potent anti-cancerous ingredient found in turmeric, has been designed specifically for high bioavailability. 
</li><li><b>Mushroom blend for immune support</b>: Host Defense, a blend of 15 different exotic mushrooms including Maya taki, reishi, lion's mane, and shitake, have immune-enhancing properties. 
</li><li><b>Herbs for improved cognitive performance</b>: Extra strength ginkgo biloba, huperzine A and acetal l-carnitine are herbs known to improve mental function, learning, and memory.
</li><li><b>Beta glucan for immune support and blood sugar regulation</b>: Supplementing beta glucan, a complex polysaccharide derived from yeast, can support immunity and regulate blood sugar levels. 
</li><li><b>Conclusion about supplements</b>: Supplements can be part of your daily regimen, but taking the right ones and in the right amounts is crucial. Each individual's needs may vary, but the need for nutrition is universal. Researching on your own and taking the time to understand what's best for your body is highly advised.
</li><li><b>Supplement Use and Maintenance Cost</b>: Leo discusses the cost associated with taking a large number of supplements daily. He spends about $140 per month on his regimen and advises viewers to only dive deep into biohacking if they have specific reasons. He warns against spending money on supplements that may not work, but also argues that investing in health is vital, even if it can be expensive.
</li><li><b>Recommended Supplements</b>: Despite the many supplements he uses, Leo specifically recommends a few that he believes to be crucial. These include omega-3, vitamin C, maca, vitamin D3, vitamin A, and astaxanthin. He also mentions magnesium for its effects on digestion. 
</li><li><b>Research and Quality</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of thoroughly researching each supplement and understanding what it does. He advises viewers to find the highest quality supplements possible by looking at reviews and researching on sites like Amazon. Despite the lack of comprehensive scientific evidence on many supplements, Leo believes that using high-quality, well-reviewed supplements from a reliable source will not cause harm.
</li><li><b>Holistic Well-being</b>: In the final part of this section, Leo reiterates the need for a healthy mind and body to live an extraordinary life. He argues that individuals can't fully perform or enjoy life with health issues like tiredness, digestion problems, or severe diseases like cancer. He suggests that one's level of productivity is linked directly to their physical and mental health.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org</b>: Leo mentions actualized.org, where he produces more content focused on personal development, psychology, and life optimization. Additionally, those who sign up for the site's free newsletter receive exclusive content and a chance to win free coaching with Leo.
