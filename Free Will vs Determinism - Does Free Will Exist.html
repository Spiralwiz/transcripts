Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about freewill versus determinism. And
we're going to answer the age old question, does freewill
exist this topic of Free Will has been one that
I've wanted to delay and not cover quite yet. But
we've reached the point where it's necessary. It's necessary now,
because we're getting into deep territory with actualised.org. We've covered
a lot of stuff about enlightenment. We've talked about meditation,
we've talked about mindfulness, we've talked about consciousness and raising
awareness. So if you start to actually listen to these
ideas, and actually start taking action, start meditating, start doing
some self inquiry work, perhaps, then, inevitably, this question of
free will, will come up for you. Because we're questioning
the very essence of your being, we're questioning whether you
as an ego even exist or not. So this issue
comes up. And it's a really confusing and tricky issue.
So I want to dispel many of the myths and
misconceptions that happen here. Please listen to the entire episode
in its entirety. Because if you don't, if you only
listen to half of it, what will happen is you'll
hear some crazy and radical and perhaps mind blowing ideas
about free will. And then what will happen is that
you'll have a lot of misinterpretation of what I say,
you'll misinterpret the facts. And you'll think that this means
something negative or problematic in your life. And then you'll
get depressed and bummed out and you'll basically screw your
whole life up. So we don't want that to happen.
So listen to everything I say here, I'm going to
cover many questions that people have, and many misconceptions that
people have. Now let's set the foundation for this discussion,
which really goes back 1000s of years. It's a philosophical
debate that's been raging for 1000s of years, ever since
antiquity since the Greeks and Romans 2000 years ago. And
this is the freewill versus determinism debate. So basically, what
it means is you have two sizes, bate. And one
side says that the whole universe is mechanical, we know
that the universe is made up of atoms and molecules
and chemicals and stuff like this. And we've discovered many
of the laws scientifically speaking of how this works. And
it turns out that the universe is very mechanical, and
mathematical and orderly and predictable, generally speaking. So because of
that, it's almost like the universe is like a giant
computer simulation, like an algorithm. Everything is happening from the
preceding causes. What happened a second ago, was caused by
what happened two seconds ago, was caused by what happened
10 minutes ago, was and then that was caused ultimately
by what happened billions of years ago. So that's how
the determinist side of the bait runs. And then the
freewill side of the debate says, Well, wait a minute.
We as individuals, certainly must have free will, because it
feels like I can make choices and decisions in life.
For example, I can raise my hand, I can choose
to raise my hand, I can choose to stick out
one finger, I can choose to curl that finger up
and down like this. And it seems like I'm doing
that. Don't I have that kind of control? So from
a first person perspective, it certainly feels like we have
freewill. It's almost undeniable. And so this debate has raged
on for 1000s of years, and many intelligent people have
chimed in on both sides. And really, there hasn't been
a very satisfactory resolution, at least in philosophy circles. So
what can we say about this? Well, I want to
tackle this from a different perspective than philosophy. Or, rather
than citing, for example, scientific studies, I want to come
at this from a phenomenological perspective, from a first person
perspective, and experiential perspective. And from an experiential perspective, the
claim that I want to make is that free will
does not exist. Now the trick with this is discovering
what this really means is deciphering this as tricky. So
free will does not exist. This is my claim. And
I'm going to cover in a lot of depth, all
the nuances of this claim as we go on here.
So firstly, let's ask what does this really mean that
free will does not exist? What am I actually claiming?
What I'm claiming is the most radical thing you could
claim. It's really quite an outrageous statement to make. And
that is that you have no control whatsoever over your
life, even though it feels like you do. I'm not
saying that you have only maybe 5% control or 1%
control or point 00 1% control If the rest is
mechanical and out of your hands, I'm saying you have
0%, control, none whatsoever. What that means is that you
don't control your thoughts. You don't control your actions, you
don't control your habits. You don't control your desires or
your motivation level, or your success or your failure in
life. You don't control your emotions either. Most people find
that one easy to believe. But basically, you have no
control over anything at all. And the reason that this
is, is because there is no self who can have
control. The assumption that kind of latently exists in the
freewill determinism debate is that there is a self in
the first place who could have freewill. And this just
isn't the case. And I'll describe exactly how this works
in a lot of detail. But let me emphasize that
this is not something that I want you to just
to believe, I don't want you to just believe me
and take this on as some new dogma and then
go convince other people of this fact. Now, what I'm
claiming here is an empirically verifiable fact. So not only
am I saying that free will doesn't exist, I'm saying
you can demonstrate to yourself in an extremely convincing way
that free will does not exist. And I'll show you
how to do that in a second. This is not
just something I am claiming this is something that has
been demonstrated by 1000s of people who are enlightened, enlightened
people are those who have discovered that there is no
self inside of them. They've seen through the illusion of
self. And then of course, what that means is they've
also seen through the illusion of self control, there is
no executive agent, there is no like CEO living in
your mind, who's controlling things. Right, there is no Wizard
of Oz behind the curtain. That's what we're saying. And
this can be demonstrated. That's what's so amazing about this,
I wouldn't even be talking about this issue, if it
was just speculation, or if it was just empty theory
or philosophy. That kind of stuff doesn't interest me, what
interests me is getting practical results in my life. And
what I found is that to get the really amazing
results that I know I can get in life, I
need to understand and surrender myself to this idea that
there is no such thing as free will, as other
people have done. Now, what I could do at this
point is I could bring in and start start citing
all sorts of neurological and neuroscience studies, which actually seem
to suggest the very same thing that you're gonna find
out through direct experience for yourself. But I don't want
to cite these studies, firstly, because I don't think they're
very conclusive. And I don't think the science is fully
in yet, because neuroscience is a very new field, and
it's still growing and maturing. But even more importantly than
that, the reason I don't want to cite studies, is
because studies are studying this phenomenon of Free Will from
the outside. From an objective perspective, we need to look
at this from a subjective perspective, because what we're studying
here is our subjectivity. And the only way you can
do that is through self observation. In fact, speaking of
self observation, you know, I didn't always think that there
was no free will. In fact, if you know anything
about me, I really was interested in philosophy ever since
I was in high school, and through college, I became
a philosophy major after doing some aerospace engineering. And I
loved it. I loved studying philosophy. I read a lot
about it, thought a lot about it for years. And
of course, I was interested in this freewill versus determinism
debate. And I was on the side of freewill because
to me, it certainly felt like I had freewill. I
mean, I can do stuff, I can talk, I can
walk, I can create goals, I can get into relationships,
I can break relationships, I can do all this kind
of stuff. I can create success in my life, I
can also be lazy and experience failure. So aren't I
doing all that? It certainly seem that way. Until about
two years ago, two years ago, I changed my mind.
And the reason I changed my mind is because of
self observation. Self observation. Let me describe what this is.
This is actually the method through which you can prove
that you don't have freewill. So if you're really serious
about this, and you really want to find out, then
here's what you do. You sit down and you start
to observe your thoughts. This can be done in meditation
practice, there's all kinds of different meditation practices, or it
can be done with something called self inquiry where you
basically sit down and you start asking yourself questions like,
Who am I? What is the nature of reality and
existence? What are thoughts? Where do thoughts come from? etc.
So you can sit down and start observing your thoughts.
And if you observe your thoughts in real time as
they arise, what you will notice, first of all, is
that you can't stop your thoughts. Now, that's a pretty
cool and odd phenomena that you can't stop your thoughts,
you should already start to make you a little suspicious
about this idea of free will. And this is not
something you should just believe me on, you guys should
sit down and do it. In fact, an exercise I
recommend for you is sit down for five minutes with
a clock, time yourself and try to stop your thoughts
for five minutes straight. If you do that, what you'll
discover is that actually, you cannot stop your thoughts. You
can't kind of odd, why can't you if you have
control? What's even more shocking, not only will you discover
that you can't stop for five minutes, you'll discover you
can't even stop them for 30 seconds. And that's really
shocking. Not just to know that but to actually experience
it. And if you do meditation, then you've experienced plenty
of this, you've got what's called monkey mind, your mind
is always running, it's always running, it's really, really hard
to stop. Now, this isn't conclusive proof of anything, but
it's a little hint, what you need to do is
you need to go deeper, deeper with your self observation.
So if you do go deeper, what you'll notice is
that not only can you not stop your thoughts, you
don't even know what your next thought is going to
be. You don't know what's coming next in your mind.
You think you know, but you don't really know. Here's
the whole problem with this is that when we're born,
we just somehow assume that life is kind of what
we expect it to be. After we go through childhood,
we learn the basics of life. Now we think we
got life handled, we understand how life works on the
fundamental level. And nothing is further from the truth. We
never take the time, it never even occurs to us
to sit down and very carefully painstakingly observe our own
mental process, our own behaviors and habits and actions. How
do these actually come about? Where do they come from?
What's sourcing them? This is something that most people just
overlook. And they think it's so obvious, we don't even
need to look at that. They don't even question it.
But in fact, this is one of the deepest fields
of human study that you can involve yourself in. This
is called mindfulness, it's developing the muscle that we call
mindfulness, your ability to resolve very precisely and carefully, exactly
what's happening in the present moment with your emotions, your
body sensations and your thoughts. So if you start to
realize that actually, you haven't really looked inside yourself, to
figure out how you work, then you start to sit
down, you start to actually do that process. And if
you start to do that process, what you discover is
that you don't really control your thoughts. You can't control
them, nor do you control your actions. And one of
the reasons that is is because who would be in
control? Who is exactly having free will? What is this
thing that has free? Will? We think it's us, right?
You think it's you, and I think it's me. So
these are the keywords you me, I, Leo, or whatever
your name is, this refers to the ego, this refers
to what I call the self. Now this self, and
this is, the deepest truth you can find out as
a human being I think, is you can find out
that the self is actually an illusion, it doesn't really
exist. And this is something I don't have time to
go into in much depth here. You should see my
spiritual enlightenment videos about a lot of in depth discussion
of this issue. But you know, if you're on board
with me on that, then basically what you understand is
that there is no such thing as a self. What
the self really is, when you think of you so
for example, right now I'm addressing you I'm talking to
something you think of as yourself, right? You I'm pointing
at you, if you're watching that you that entity right
there. What that is, it's not a physical entity. It's
not a solid entity, the way we feel it is
what it really is, is it's a collection of things.
It is the intermingling of mental images, mental auditory labels,
and body sensations. And when these three things intermingle, what
they create is they create a very solid illusion of
a you and that it's that you that we attribute
freewill to. So we think that this You, this ego
is making choices and decisions in life, and that it's
running your life, we think of it as the CEO
that's living inside your skull. Doesn't it feel like that's
where you reside, you reside behind the eyes, somewhere in
here in your skull? Well, what we're saying is that
that's an illusion. That's a very, very persistent and very
difficult to see through illusion. But nevertheless, it is an
illusion, and it can be seen through. So one question
you might have as well, Leo, if thoughts don't come
from me, and they don't? Where do thoughts actually come
from? And this is a really tricky issue, actually is,
I mean, it's very simple. But it's tricky, because your
mind doesn't want to believe it. And the answer to
that question is that thoughts appear out of nowhere. thoughts
appear out of nowhere. Now, this is a very special
nowhere extremely special nowhere. I'll talk about that, in future
episodes, don't have time to get into it here. But
just open your mind to the possibility that instead of
thoughts arising out of a thing called you, thoughts are
arising out of literally nowhere. Because that is what's happening,
phenomenal logically, from a first person perspective, in your direct
experience, when you experience a thought, it arises out of
nowhere, watch, let me prove it to you. So here's
a thought for you. Pink, elephant, orange, Flamingo, purple hippopotamus.
Those are some thoughts. When I said those words, your
mind interpreted all that without any input from you interpreted
all those sounds, there just sounds bla bla bla bla,
just sounds right, interpreted those sounds created meaning out of
those sounds, link them together, created a mental image in
your mind of a flamingo a hippopotamus or whatever, gave
it the right color that I said, and now you
have an image of that faint image in your mind.
And you also not only just have that image, but
you have all sorts of associations with that, for example,
when I tell you about purple hippopotamus in your mind,
you're like, well, hippopotamuses are not purple. And flamingos are
not orange, and so forth. Right? So where did those
thoughts of the animals come from? You think they came
from you? You kind of we assume that? Well, I
thought them. But if you're going to look really closely,
and you're very honest about it, what you notice is
that no, you didn't actually think them, you didn't create
them, you didn't willed them, they happened to you. In
fact, you could say that I triggered them in you.
So if anyone created those thoughts in you, it was
me, not you. kind of freaky, really freaky. When you
start to observe this, you start to notice that man,
I really don't have control over my thoughts. In fact,
most of my thoughts are being triggered by external stimuli.
The TV, I watched the books I read, the people
I talked to, and so forth. And if I'm not
connected to any external stimuli, I still don't control my
thoughts. Because my thoughts just arise on autopilot. And a
lot of times, my thoughts are very random and scattered.
Isn't that what it feels like? That your thoughts are
so scattered at random? That's why we call it monkey
mind. Now, some people will say, okay, Leo, maybe I
can concede the fact that I don't control my thoughts.
But that doesn't mean I don't control my actions and
behaviors. I mean, Leo, Are you really telling me that
when I put up my finger like this in front
of my face, and I straightened it out, and then
I decide to curl it back down? I mean, I'm
making that conscious decision, right? I curl it down, and
look, it happened. And now I can straighten it back
out. And that happened, and I curl it back down,
and then it happened again. So aren't I doing that?
Who's creating that? The answer is not you. Because there
is no human side who can make that choice. What's
really going on is you have a lot of subsystems
within your mind that are simultaneously creating the action and
the arising of the thought and what you really are,
you're not the one who's causing that you actually are
something that is also a thought that's arising. So you
yourself are a thought. You're not a physical thing. You're
a thought. You have a self image of you. You
have an image of your mind. You have an image
of your body, you have an image of your head.
You have a personality that you think you is really
you you think that's solid, you think that's real, but
that's all illusory. and I talked about that in my
enlightenment videos. So anyway, let's get back on track here.
What I want to just convince you of is that
it's possible to prove this to yourself, you don't have
to believe me, there's no requirement of taking me on
faith. The Warning I'll issue to you, though, is that
if you think you're just going to sit down for
five minutes, and look at an activity like this, am
I really doing it, you're not going to break through
the illusion, because the illusion is extremely deep and persistent.
What it's going to take just to, to give you
an idea of how long it takes, it'll probably take
you over 1000 hours of very careful and precise and
laborious self observation. Not only does it take 1000 hours,
think about 1000 hours, that's extremely, an extremely deep field
of study. Just to observe your own thought process, 1000
hours, that's crazy, that would drive you add your mind
board nuts. Not only that, but it's going to be
emotionally difficult, very emotionally difficult to do this work. Which
is why most people don't do it. And which is
why most people don't understand this truth have no free
will. Now, at this point, people have the following objection.
They say something like, well believe So are you saying
that my actions then are random? If I'm not the
cause of my actions? Where do my actions and decisions
come from? For example, let's say I'm sitting at a
restaurant, and I'm trying to decide between the cheese burger
and the Caesar salad. Which 1am I going to have
Leo, who is making that decision? aren't I making that
decision? The answer is no. You're not making that decision?
And the answer is also no, your actions are also
not random. There's nothing at all random about your mind
and your body. Your brain and your body are very
complex, extremely complex, you can't even imagine how complex the
system is, and how ordered it is. It's highly, highly
ordered. Any significant variation within that order will destroy the
brain and the body, which we see with people who
have diseases, or people who encounter injuries. You have to
start thinking of the brain and the body in a
much richer and more holistic way than you presently do.
Most of us assume that the body and the brain
are just kind of dumb, mechanical devices, almost like you
know our robot and we're living inside this robot inside
this machine. That's not really what's going on, you have
to appreciate the complexity of nature, and also the intelligence
that's possible within nature. It turns out that the brain
of the body are not actually that dumb. What you
are really is you're a distributed system. You're not a
centralized system, there is no one thing inside you that
we can point to to call you, you. Instead, it's
all the parts of you. How many parts of you
well, estimates, scientists say that there are 37 trillion cells
in the human body on average? 37 trillion cells in
the human body. Think about that. Think about that. That's
orders of magnitude more units than the number of people
on the entire planet. There's only 7 billion people on
the entire planet, there's 37 trillion cells in your body.
Now, is it possible that when you take 37 trillion
of something, and you combine it together in complex and
ordered ways that you get emergent phenomena that happen? If
you're a student of nature, and you're a student of
science, which you can appreciate is that an emergent phenomenon
are actually very common in nature. They're like a hallmark
of nature. You can take for example, some hydrogen and
oxygen atoms, mix them together and you've got a h2o
molecule. And h2o behaves very differently than hydrogen or oxygen.
It's not simply like if you take some hydrogen, and
you take some oxygen, and you put them together, then
you've got water, no hydrogen, oxygen or gases. But when
you do combine them together in a special way, and
they bond you get water. Now water is kinda like
an emergent property. Water feels very liquid at room temperature,
but that exact same substance can also be a solid,
slightly below room temperature. Or it can be a gas
slightly above room temperature, exact same substance, but that it
has these real qualitative differences, right? That you wouldn't really
expect from just a bunch of molecules bouncing around in
a box, you wouldn't expect some molecules bouncing around in
the box for them to act like a liquid or
a solid or gas, the exact same ones, just by
changing the temperature a little bit. So that's what we
call an emergent phenomenon. What I'm saying is that you
are also an emergent phenomenon, extremely, extremely high order levels
and levels and levels above just water. What's interesting with
water is that even with water, there's even higher levels,
not only can it be just like a solid or
a gas or liquid, but if you take a lot
of water, you can put it into something like an
ocean. And you've got this vast ecosystem called the ocean,
which has really unique properties and stuff going on inside
of it than just a glass of water, right. And
then if you take that water and you evaporate it
with the sun, you get clouds in the sky. Again,
clouds in the sky are very different phenomenon qualitatively from
just water in a glass standing in your room. And
then if you combine the ocean, plus the clouds and
the atmosphere together, and you mix a little wind and
air and some temperature differences, you can create a hurricane.
What is a hurricane, a hurricane is basically driven by
forces of water, and temperature differences. So that's, you know,
a really high order. emergent property is something like a
hurricane. So you as a human being a human entity
is kind of the same thing. You have to start
to appreciate just how much just how much power there
is in combining 37 trillion cells. Each one of these
cells is itself made up a little units. So we're
not even going to the slightest level. But the starts
to get a little bit of appreciation for it. So
how does this relate back to this example of sitting
in the restaurant and choosing between a cheeseburger and a
Caesar salad? Well, what we're saying here is that it's
not like there's an individual unit called a you inside
your head that chooses the cheeseburger over the salad. No,
what happens is that every single one of these 37
trillion cells take part in the decision, they all weigh
in. Now, the problem is that when we are just
trying to be rational and logical, from a first person
perspective, for you know, from just a common day perspective,
it doesn't feel like there are 37 trillion cells acting
on the decision to eat the cheeseburger. But in fact,
you know, scientifically, if we look look closer, we know
that this must be the case, it has to be
the case. But it goes even deeper than this. Not
only are all these 37 trillion cells in play, but
we also know that you are not separate from nature,
you are a part of nature. That means all of
nature is acting on you. And there are fundamentally there
are physical forces acting on all particles in the known
universe. Your cells are made out of matter. Matter has
mass, we know that every particle of mass also has
gravity. And this gravity is influencing every other particle of
mass at infinite distances. Of course, there's a drop off,
and it drops off a lot over vast distances. But
nevertheless, we know that technically speaking, there is still an
effect. So actually, what's happening when you're choosing the cheeseburger
think about this. What's happening is that every single particle
in the known universe is acting on every single cell
in your body. And every single particle in your cell
in your body and is influencing in a tiny little
way. Your decision to go with cheeseburger now, that's pretty
freakin cool. really freaking cool. We don't think of it
this way, though. Why? Because it's so complex. Our mind
can't deal with it. What our mind likes to do
is simplify everything down and just dumb it down and
make it really stupid. Like, oh, yeah, there's just a
me choosing the cheeseburger or, you know, some part of
my brain decided that it likes salty, fat, greasy food,
and there's bacon on the cheeseburger. I love bacon. So
that's why I chose the cheeseburger. But if you really
sit down and you look at this with a fine
microscope, and you break it all down, you start to
see that it's not just that you like bacon, why
do you like bacon? Well, you like bacon because of
all these different factors. If You boil it down all
the way to the bottom, you get to just chemicals
and atoms and even lower. Now, that's kind of going
down the scale. There's also going up the scale, which
is your psychology and your life history. So of course,
another way we can talk about this is that when
you choose the cheeseburger, and this is going to sound
a little less ridiculous, because I really over exaggerate this
example, just to kind of show you how deep we
can think about this topic. But let's think a bit
more on kind of everyday common terms that probably don't
seem as absurd. When I choose the cheeseburger, what's happening
there, we could say is that every single experience I've
had in my whole life, is influencing this decision. It's
all the other food I've eaten in my life. It's
the cultures I've been exposed to. It's the cuisines I've
been exposed to. It's the DNA that I inherited from
my parents, my tastes, preferences, it's all the diseases I've
had. It's all the colds and viruses that I've had.
It's all the teachers I've had in high school, and
in college, and in elementary school, it's all the friends
I've had, my parents, it's my siblings. All of this
is coming into play, do you see this, because based
on all that, the mind then constructs its preferences, and
then makes decisions. So you have to start to appreciate
just how much information the mind is able to process
or the brain, I should say, the brain is able
to process absolutely staggering quantities information. And what's really crazy,
if you think about is that you are not conscious
of 99.999% of any of it. Level of controlling it,
you don't even have awareness of it. For example, just
think about this. Right now you're sitting here, you're listening
to me, as that's happening, what's going on inside your
body and inside your brain. Within that complex system, millions
of processes are happening, that you have no idea about,
your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing for you,
cells in your lungs are taking the air, the oxygen,
and they're using that to generate energy through a very
complex and intricate cycle that you have no clue about.
Also, your immune system is responding to viruses and pathogens
and bacteria that live by the millions, inside your gut
and inside various tissues. Your kidneys, and your liver is
doing its job, you have no idea even where those
organs are probably located in your body. hair is growing.
Millions of strands of hair on your body are growing
right now, at a tiny, slow rate. And you have
no idea how that's happening. You probably haven't even thought
about it until I mentioned it. You're your sensory system
is producing various sensations, for example, your eyes are taking
in and processing data from the environment, they are compositing
that data, they're editing that data, they're processing all that
data and feeding it to you. Not just that, but
also your ears are processing auditory sounds, they're hearing me
talk, they're breaking that down into individual units of the
English language, creating meaning out of that, and then feeding
that meaning to you, we could say. And then you're
understanding me. All of that, notice that all of that
is happening without a single input from you. You're not
willing any of this stuff. And that's still just the
tip of the iceberg. Of all the stuff that's happening.
It's crazy. How intricate and elaborate these systems are. So
when someone comes up with the objection says, well, Leo,
you know, but I do intelligent things. For example, I'm
creative. And I can do mathematics and human beings, you
know, we can build the rocket ship, the flash the
moon, we can do all this intelligence stuff. Doesn't that
mean there has to be a self to do that.
Doesn't that mean that there is freewill? And the answer
is, of course, no, it doesn't. Because what you assume
is you assume that this dumb body and this dumb
brain tissue cannot do intelligent stuff? Well, that's an assumption
infrastructure question. Because clearly, your brain and your body can
do extremely intricate, extremely elaborate and intelligent things. Think about
the immune system response that you have in your body.
You actually have little cells that go and attack viruses
kill viruses, they know how to distinguish which virus is
the right one to kill. Which one is not the
right one to kill. They know which bacteria is good
and which bacteria is not good for you. That's a
pretty intelligent process. We have to really start to question
this idea that nature doesn't have a certain innate intelligence,
because it certainly seems like it does. What the ego
or the self likes to do is he likes to
take all the credit for this. He likes to say,
well, all the dumb stuff. Yeah, Leo, I admit that
all the dumb stuff I do, like, you know, the
heart beating the kidneys working the immune system, working, the
eyes, processing data, oh, that's just kind of dumb brute
force stuff all admit that that stuff I have no
control over. But then you know, my decision to marry
this person here, or my decision to be nice to
that person or to get angry with this person, or
my decision to start a business, or my decision to
go lose weight, that those higher order decisions that no
those are done by me who else could do them?
Well, maybe the same exact system that is responsible for
fighting viruses. And for processing urine in your kidneys. And
for rendering your visual field could also be responsible for
you making a decision such as which cheeseburger to eat,
or when to go work out at the gym, or
who to marry or what college to go to, or
which kind of business to start. Could that be possible.
You can actually sit down and observe your actions and
behaviors. And you'll see that you don't have control over
these things. Even the stuff that we quote, unquote, call
conscious. So for example, we would say that walking is
a volitional act, I can actually choose how I walk,
I can also choose how I talk, I can also
choose when to raise my hand, when to lower my
hand, when to curl my finger, when to straighten my
finger, we would say that these things I have control
over, what I would say is that actually you don't
if you carefully observe, what happens is that when you
straighten your finger, it appears as though you have control.
But actually what's happening is a thought is arising at
the same time as the finger is moving. And the
thought claims control over the finger. That's how the illusion
is created. And you actually sit down and break it
down. And you will observe that this is the case.
What you are the thing, we call you, this ego.
What that is it's not an input into the system,
it actually is an output of the system. That's crazy.
That's crazy, right there. Think about this. Think about an
example such as Google, Google is a search engine. Now,
this search engine. Imagine the search engine got really, really
intelligent and really complex, to the point where the search
engine started to believe that it was an input into
the Google, the Google company, Google, as an organization. See,
Google as a search engine, when you go to the
homepage, that's an output of the millions of hours of
work that 10s of 1000s of employees have done over
10 years, those individuals in that company that make up
that company, they are like the cells in the body.
And then Google itself is like the emergent property. It's
the homepage seems very simple, except you have 10s of
1000s people working millions of man hours to create that
incredible amounts of technology. That's the output. You got to
be careful not to confuse the output with the input.
Right, who's actually creating Google? Is it the Google homepage
that's creating Google? No, it's the employees. Now, maybe Google
will get so smart one day that it will start
to think that it is responsible for everything, in which
case it'll be exactly like you. That's the state that
you're at. But that's an illusion. That's not recognizing the
hard work that the actual individual cells are doing to
produce you. You are produced by your cells. Not the
other way around. It's pretty mind blowing stuff. Now, another
objection that comes up when I start to talk like
this, is people will say, well, Leo, you're just being
very mechanistic. You're saying that I am basically just a
robot. We're all just robots. And where's the soul? Where's
the spirit? You're not accounting for spiritual things here. And
actually, this is a huge misconception people have. Spirit is
still in play. Accepting Beer is not what you think
it is. Spirit is not some kind of ghost in
the machine. It's not the EU, the EU is not
the spirit, the EU is an illusion. What spirit is,
is the actual thing that everything is made out of.
So yes, you are a robot, yes, you are a
machine. And that's something you need to start to really
take on very seriously. Because as long as you decide,
deny your machine like nature, you experience a lot of
problems in your life. The more you start to see
how mechanical you are, the more your life flows smoother.
But what is spirit spirit is basically what scientists call
matter. So the very rock bottom thing of which all
of reality is made out of that's what spirit is.
This is not what most people think spirit is. But
this is what it is. And if you look at
the Buddha, you look at Jesus, you look at other
Mystics and Saints that have actually realized this, they are
enlightened people, what they realize is that spirit is everything.
Spirit is like, what existence is made out of it's
awareness, it's consciousness, that's what spirit is. But when they
talk about consciousness and awareness, they don't mean the ego,
the you that I'm pointing out, they don't mean that.
They mean literally, like, you knock on a piece of
wood, that wood you're knocking on is made out of
spirit. So spirituality is still in play, we have not
gotten rid of it. In fact, and I'm going to
get to this in a minute, is what we've done
is we've opened the doors for spirituality. This is what
makes spirituality possible. Many confused spiritual people or religious people
believe that free will is kind of where spirituality takes
them. Actually, it couldn't be further from the truth. What
spirituality actually is, is the recognition of no free will.
That's enlightenment. But before I talk about that, let me
talk about some of the challenges of accepting this idea
of no free will. It's a really challenging thing to
accept. For several reasons, let me list them. The first
reason is because you have a very strong illusion of
free will. So there is the illusion of free will
we can't deny that that's certainly in play. You got
that going on right now. You have to open your
eyes the possibility that it could just be an illusion.
Could it be that the ego is claiming responsibility for
things that it actually doesn't have responsibility for? Could that
be the case is it's really challenging to accept that,
to even open your mind to that possibility. The second
challenge is that the ego really hates this idea really
hates it. It's antithetical to everything that you do is
about fundamentally what the ego is about is it's about
control. The ego is the thing that thinks that has
control. And when we tell it that it doesn't have
control, the ego goes nuts. It has an emotional reaction.
In fact, as you're listening to me, be mindful of
any emotional reactions, you have maybe a hint of anger,
a hint of sadness, some depression, some outrage, some frustration,
some annoyance, some confusion. Those are all emotional reactions, to
hearing some of those bitter news. Is it really bitter
news? Well, it is for the ego. But it's not
for the higher self. Now the higher self, what is
the higher self, that's something I can't cover here. See
my lightning videos that I'll talk more about that in
the future. But basically, you know, for the ego, this
is an extremely bitter pill to swallow, because it basically
makes the ego useless. And as the thing that you
hate the most, because the ego is like to think
of it like a tornado or a hurricane. It's just
like this swirling pit. That's schmear of air. It's just
made out of hot air, basically. But it certainly feels
like it's very solid, like it has a force of
its own. And it kind of does. It's the force
of illusion. That's a very strong force. In fact, it's
such a strong force that most people who watch this
and listen to me here will never actually verify this
stuff for themselves. Because their tornado their hurricane inside their
mind is so strong, that they will not do the
work to dismantle it. The third challenge we've got is
that you've been wrong your whole life. If what I'm
saying is true, then you've been wrong your whole life
because your whole life you assume that you've had control
Again, for the ego that's very difficult to accept when
you've been living for 20 3040 5060 years of your
life believing you have control, and then someone tells you
that you might not have control at all. What's your
initial reaction? Your initial reaction, say, No, that's ridiculous. That's
stupid, Leo, you're wrong. can't possibly be the case. Look
at my life, I've been controlling my life for the
last 50 years. So you're just talking nonsense. So that's
the third challenge. The fourth challenge is that this is
very socially unacceptable. And also culturally unacceptable, goes completely against
the grain of culture and society. Many of our social
systems like our education system, our government, our politics, our
legal system, our police enforcement system, or military, these things
are tacitly predicated upon freewill. And when you start to
go around talking to people about no free will, on
a social level, they think you're crazy. Or they think
that you're dangerous. Because a lot of these social systems
are really bought into this idea. And they kind of
depend on it. What would happen to the legal system,
if you admitted that no one had free will be
pretty interesting. And the fifth challenge is that no free
will does not mean what you think it means. So
already, right now, this is your first time listening to
this, then your mind is coming up with all sorts
of interpretations. Your mind is confused, right? Now. It's saying
something like, okay, so what does this really mean? This
means that what this and this and this and that
in my life, I don't control and yada, yada, yada
and all this is so bad, so negative, right, your
mind starts to go down this kind of road. And
you start coming up with ramifications for this idea of
no free will. And the challenge is that the ramifications,
the actual ramifications are not what you think they are.
The actual ramifications are very counterintuitive and paradoxical. And that's
something that I want to cover right now. Let's cover
some of the misconceptions. And then we'll cover some of
the actual ramifications. So that you have it straight and
you don't get confused. So the first common misconception that
people have about no free will is they simply say
something like, well, Leo, I've studied Zen masters and Yogi's.
And like martial artists, for example, These people seem to
have extraordinary degrees of self control. As a Nash can
just sit there for days on end. So can a
yogi and a martial artist, you know, he's mastered his
mind. What about these people? Don't these people have freewill?
Haven't they broken out of this? Isn't there a glimmer
of hope? And the answer is not at all. In
fact, what the Zen master and the yogi have done
is they have achieved enlightenment, they have realized through self
observation that there is no such thing as a self.
And of course, that means that they realized there is
no such thing as control, what they've done is they've
completely surrendered themselves to the idea of no free will,
totally surrendered. There is no more self inside of them,
so to speak. And what this allows them to do
is just to flow with life, to flow with life.
Now, what's very counterintuitive about this, that you would think
that this kind of person has become just a lazy
victim, who can't accomplish anything in life. It has no
self discipline. Actually, it's the exact opposite of this. From
the outside, when you look at a Zen master, it
looks like he has complete self discipline. But in fact,
what's happened is that, no, he's just completely gotten rid
of the idea of a self. And now everything he
does, there's no resistance in it. There's no internal suffering
or struggle anymore. He's flowing with life. And that looks
effortless, and that looks very rigorous and disciplined. Also, of
course, it helps that, you know, he's really trained himself
very hard. Zen masters and Yogi's and martial artists, or
they'll have in common, they train themselves for 1000s of
hours, which is something that you probably don't like doing,
because it's boring and hard work. Through this training process,
the body so to speak, trains itself. The self discipline,
disciplines itself. This is something that's hard for people to
understand. This is what's very paradoxical about this whole notion
of Free Will no free will is that if I
surrender myself, actually. I gain power rather than lose power.
Of course, it's not the AI that's getting the power,
but from the outside person It's gonna look like I'm
really on top of things. So that's what's going on
there. Another misconception that people say, Well, what about Leo?
What about the earlier episodes, you talked about taking 100%
responsibility for my life, and you told me how I'm
responsible for everything. And now you're telling me the exact
opposite. You're telling me I'm not responsible for anything? Yes,
in my other videos, the earlier videos, they're not as
advanced as this one, I tell you to take full
responsibility, because that's what's necessary for you to hear at
that point in your journey. Here, we're talking about very
advanced stuff. This is stuff that most people will not
understand it will never go and actually realize for themselves,
only the very dedicated will do this. So one answer
to that question is that we're targeting different audiences. Another
answer to that question is that your journey through personal
development has stages and steps in it. Where you start
is not where you end up. We're talking about a
high level here, right now. Another paradoxical thing about this
journey is that when you start off, and you're really
struggling in life, and you're getting crappy results, and you're
depressed and angry and frustrated easily in this kind of
stuff, what that usually means that you actually have low
self esteem, this means you have a weak ego, your
ego is kind of flawed. What has to happen usually
with this person is that he has to develop a
strong ego, before he can release and transcend the ego.
You see this? very counterintuitive, again. A person with a
weak ego, you think that well, if I have a
weak ego that makes it easier to release, actually, no.
Because you're so busy trying to protect your ego, to
defend yourself, that you're not able to let go of
it. What happens is that you take that weak, you,
you develop it, you take responsibility, you stop being a
victim, you become a creator, taking a lot of responsibility.
You do that for a decade or so. And then
once you realize, like all there is the next level,
at the next level, I can surrender control completely. And
in a sense, it's kind of like going full circle,
except you don't go back to being a victim anymore.
There's a very huge difference between being a victim and
no free will. So do not make this mistake. I'm
not saying that you are a victim. Nor is this
mutually incompatible with taking responsibility. So when I tell you
to take 100% responsibility, yes, take it. Someone who's enlightened
takes responsibility. In fact, they are the epitome of taking
100% responsibility is just that weird stuff starts to happen,
you know, when you get to the very advanced levels,
stuff that you don't anticipate when you start the journey.
Another common misconception people have is they say, Okay, well,
Leah, what about when I'm creative? I understand that a
lot of stuff I do is mechanical and dumb. But
when I'm being creative, let's say I'm sitting there and
I'm, I'm writing a play or a novel, I'm coming
up with some brilliant business idea. I'm painting I'm, I'm
composing some music or some lyrics. Don't I have control
over that? At least there? I mean, that's a very
human activity. My cells aren't doing that, are they? And
the answer is no, you have no control, even over
that, is specially over that. And this is actually a
very easy one to demonstrate for yourself. You don't need
to spend 1000 hours to see this. The next time
you're in a creative brainstorm session, where you're sitting there,
you're getting all these brilliant ideas. Just notice where those
ideas are coming from. Right in the moment, notice that
they're not coming from you. They're actually appearing to you
so to speak. This is why the ancients called it
getting inspired by a muse. Where does creativity come from?
From muses, that's why they call it music. Music is
inspired by a muse. What is a muse? A muse
is basically nature. Or if you really want to get
deep, the ultimate Muse is nothing. Because your thoughts and
ideas arise out of nothing. And this is the source
of all existence, not. So when you're being highly creative.
Just notice that your ego is not at play. In
fact, when you're in a creative brainstorm session, it's like
you're just getting pummeled with brilliant ideas from out of
nowhere. They just come to you. It's just like a
it almost seems like it's flu cluck, but it's not
Fluke luck. There is an intelligence to it. Have you
ever noticed that you're sitting at a computer and you're
typing something like you're typing an email or a report
or a book? On the one hand, it seems like
you're doing it right you're Coming up with what to
type. But then as you're in mid sentence and you're
typing, and then you become more aware what you noticed
that oh my god, I don't actually know what the
next word is going to be. How is it actually
happening? My fingers are just typing away. I don't even
know what keys I'm pressing. And my mind is just
coming up with words. And it's not just like random
words come up, the perfect word comes up. Perfect, perfect,
perfect word after perfect word, creates the perfect sentence after
the perfect sentence. Are you doing all that? No, not
if you honestly look at that. Only arrogant ego will
claim responsibility for that. The truth is that it's happening
to you. And it's almost like magic in the way
that it happens. It's not really magic, but it's almost
like magic. next misconception, Leo What about when I try
really hard at something and then I six feet. So
for example, here's a really prototypical case of this. Let's
say that I've been overweight my whole life. And then
one day, I'm trying on some new clothes, I look
at myself in the mirror, I just get so frustrated
and pissed off. And so disgusted with myself that I
say, you know, dammit, fuck this, I'm taking full responsibility
for my health and my weight. And I commit and
I vow that by the end of the summer, in
six months, I will have dropped 50 pounds, and I
will be looking, you know, all ripped. And then what
I do is I say, Okay, I'm gonna improve my
diet, and make it real serious. I'm gonna go to
the gym every single day for the next six months,
and I'm going to do it. And then I really
discipline myself, I really put the screws to myself, I
push myself really hard. Some days I even cry, but
I push myself so hard. And then you know what,
six months later I've dropped those 50 pounds. And I
fit into my sexy bathing suit. And I look awesome,
and I look ripped. I've succeeded. And now what I
tell myself as I say, well, Leo. I did that.
Look at me, I did it. I succeeded. So I
have free will. And the answer, of course is no
you didn't. That happened. But you didn't create that. So
in this case, you're really motivated to succeed, right? But
where did that motivation come from? Again, if you're very
close, if you look very closely, and you notice, what
you see is that the motivation didn't come from you.
It a lot of times comes from the outside, you
get inspired by something or disgusted by something. But you
don't just sit there and come up with motivation out
of the blue. That doesn't really happen. Again, be very
careful about assuming that just because you work hard and
you are disciplined and you are successful, that that means
that you have freewill No, why can't 37 trillion cells
in your body who do everything else in your life?
Why can't they also be responsible for you losing 50
pounds is that so far fetched? Really, start thinking about
this much more holistically. Start seeing yourself as a part
of a larger force in nature. You are not separate
from nature. You are a part of nature. Human beings
are not some special unique unicorn animal. Living in fairy
tale and we are a part of nature. No separate
firm from right subject to the exact same forces as
it including our egotistical pneus in our our pettiness and
our vileness in our violence. Right. All of those things
are also a part of nature. Everything's a part of
nature by definition. Another common misconception people have is they
say, Well, Lee Okay, so does this mean, I should
stop trying. I'll just accept what you're saying here. And
I'll just sit on the couch and be a lazy
bum and not do anything else in my life. This
is a real trap. Watch out for this one. Because
this is not what I'm saying. Trying is done by
the 730 7 trillion cells in your body. So it
doesn't mean you have to stop trying doesn't mean you
have to stop working. It doesn't mean you have to
stop going to the gym, you still have to start
you start do those things if you want the results
that those activities give you. And you know what, if
you do decide to sit and be lazy on the
couch for the rest of your life, that's fine. You
can do that. But just realize that even if that
happens, you're not deciding that your body and your brain
will make that decision for you. And you will take
credit for it. But you didn't actually decide. On the
other hand, if you decide to go start $100 million
dollar company, and you're going to spend the next 30
years of your life 80 hours a week building that
company. Then you might say to yourself, Well, I'm taking
control of my life and I mean responsible and I'm
exercising free will. No, you're not. That's a force that's
actually running your life. And in fact, these kinds of
people, they can't stop, like a serial entrepreneur, a really
ambitious person, they will be ambitious until they're dead. In
fact, a lot of times their ambition kills them, they
have a heart attack from all the stress and hard
work they do. So there's kind of like a catch
22 paradox here, no matter what you decide, you're not
actually deciding. So if you decide to be lazy, no
free will, was acting on that. And if you don't
decide to be lazy, no free will was acting on
it either. Again, think of this much deeper, and on
a much more holistic level. Another common misconception is, people
say, well, then Leo, how do I choose to become
enlightened? If I have no free will? How do I
make that choice? And the answer, of course, is that
you don't it's a contradiction in terms to even say
that you will become enlightened, there is no you to
become enlightened. And there certainly is no you to choose
to become enlightened. That is, what enlightenment is, is the
realization of that. Another misconception people have is they say,
well, Leo, this is a very depressing and negative. What
you're saying here is very bleak. And I grant you
that the first time you hear it, it will seem
negative and depressing. Why is that? Because again, this is
a bitter pill for the ego to swallow. This is
terrible news for the ego. I like to think about
it like this. Imagine that you are a corrupt politician.
And now, after 20 years of being a corrupt politician,
taking bribes, and really doing all sorts of nasty stuff,
taking credit for things that weren't yours, now the FBI
is on to you is going to come arrest you.
Now, when the corrupt politician gets arrested, when he gets
caught on his bullshit, he's depressed and he's negative, of
course. And of course, that's going to happen to you.
That's what the ego is, the ego is like a
corrupt politician who has usurped power through falsehood and deception.
And now that assumption is getting unraveled. And now the
truth is starting to shine through. And of course, it's
depressing and negative to you. Of course, you hate it,
because you are the thing we're trying to eliminate. kind
of twisted. But also, I love it, because it's so
mind bending and cool. Imagine that, imagine if you were
a politician. And one day you just found out that
you've been lying to yourself, your whole life, about being
corrupt. And then you have to actually admit to yourself,
you know what, I was corrupt, I do deserve to
go to jail. I deserve to get punished for my
deceptions. That's the courage required to become enlightened. That the
courage that a Zen master or a yogi exercised to
develop his self discipline, quote, unquote, self discipline, they have
a pseudo control. They don't really develop control. Don't make
that mistake. A Zen master has no control. He has
a pseudo control. Another misconception people have is the following
is, is this it's like, well, Leo, this is highly
anti spiritual. I'm a religious person. I've been brought up
to believe in God and in faith in the importance
of the soul. And now you're telling me there isn't
there is no soul and no spirit? actually know. What
I'm telling you is that what I'm telling you here
is exactly what allows spirituality to exist. It's exactly where
all the religions were derived from. See, religions were derived
from spiritual discoveries made through self observation by the early
hardcore mystics, such as the Buddha, Jesus, and various Yogi's
and other people throughout history. Right. And all of those
people if you actually go and you study them, you
study the esoteric traditions, the esoteric kernels of all religions,
what you discover is that they all say the exact
same thing, what do they tell you? They tell you
that you need to surrender yourself. They tell you that
your arrogance is separating you from God. What does that
mean? Poetically speaking, who you are, the ego is the
devil. Lucifer, you understand this? You understand how this works?
The devil is not some other entity living somewhere in
the shadows. The devil is you. You separate yourself from
God. How do you do that? By acting arrogant, like
an ego by claiming power over things over which you
have no power. Now God in this case, does not
refer to a man in the clouds. God refers to
the very existence that you're existing in right now. God
refers to reality, God refer As to the source, which
is nothing that's all the early mystics describe the source
in ways that are very similar to this word, nothing.
Now a lot of people don't like this idea of
nothing. They like to have God as some kind of
anthropomorphic figure in the sky in the clouds in a
human form. That's quite ridiculous. That's not what the original
self observant mystics and gurus had discovered. Go read more
carefully what they talked about. The devil separated himself from
God, because what are the devil do the God The
devil said, I am not a part of nature, I
am separate. I am an individual, and I will do
my own thing, and I have my own control. So
I'm gonna go down to hell and rule over hell.
And the devil did that. And what do you got?
What did he get? He got hell. And that's exactly
what you are doing right now. And that's exactly what
you've got is you've got hell. So let's connect this
for a moment with practical, everyday life. Because this whole
thing is not just a philosophy, discussion, this is practical
stuff. The reason we're interested in no free will, and
realizing there is no free will, is because it frees
us. It frees us from the torments of hell, what
are the torments of hell? It's all your anguish, all
your frustration, all your fear, all your suffering, all your
anger, all the negative emotion that you experience? Why are
you fundamentally frustrated in your life, because you believe you
have control when actually you do not? That's it. That's
the root of almost all your problems in life. If
you actually surrender yourself, if you take a leap of
faith, and surrender yourself, to nature, to reality, to existence
to God, whatever you want to call, it doesn't matter
what you call it to nothing. Then what happens is,
there are no more problems. Life flows smoothly for you.
There is no more internal struggle. Do you understand this,
you understand that your biggest problem in life is internal
struggle, self interference, your biggest problems are not external problems.
It's not a lack of money. It's not your spouse,
being a bitch or nasil. It's not that it's your
self interference. It's how you interpret these things, and how
you react unconsciously to these things. Personal Development and maturity,
Real Mature adulthood begins when you start to understand that.
So all the religious traditions talk about faith. What is
faith? Faith is the surrender to nature. That takes a
lot of balls. That's real hard to do. Faith is
not believing blind ideas. In the Bible, That's not faith.
That's a perversion of faith. What real faith is, is
a recognition that you actually were never in control in
the first place. And that I have to be humble
enough to surrender myself to that. If I maintain my
arrogance and egotistical pneus, then I am the devil. That's
exactly what the devil chose to do. And he kept
his arrogance, he kept his ego. But now he's consigned
himself to hell. Not because God punished him. But because
when you live in falsehood, you create your own hell.
So spirituality is exactly what I'm talking about here. We're
not talking about anything else. Don't confuse what I'm talking
about here. And don't confuse no free will with some
kind of shallow materialism. Not at all. Just the exact
opposite. very counterintuitive, and paradoxical, as I said. Let me
now talk about some of the actual ramifications of no
free will. The actual ramifications are not what you might
think. So firstly, what it means is it means that
there was no one in control your whole life. It's
not as though we're going to take control away from
you. It's not like we're saying that well, tomorrow, you're
gonna start to believe that there is no free will.
And now you lose yourself or you lose control. No,
there's nothing to lose. The only thing you lose is
the illusion of control. You never had control in the
first place. The analogy that I like to use here
is imagine if we Have a little child believing in
Santa Claus. Now I come to the child. So you
know what? Hate to break it to you, but there
is no Santa Claus. The child starts crying. And then
after he's done weeping, then he says, So you mean,
I'm not going to get presents this Christmas. And of
course, we laugh. And that's silly. Because the child still
hasn't gotten over the fact that he's inside an illusion.
He's kind of heard it. But also, he still didn't
fully fathom it. Because if he really fathom the fact
that Santa Claus in his illusion, then he would connect
the dots, and he would see that, oh, that means
the Christmas presents were never caused by him. So we
can get rid of Santa the Christmas presents are still
there, the next year? You see, because we haven't really
gotten rid of Santa, we've only gotten rid of the
illusion of sand. Well, the exact same thing is happening
in your life. So in a sense, we're not really
changing much about your life, your life will still go
on, you're still going to make decisions gonna feel like
you're doing stuff. But deep down, you can know that
actually, you're not. You might say that well, then is
this just a word game? Leo, we're just playing word
games. It's just philosophy again, what's the point? No, actually,
there is a point. Because if you surrender yourself to
no free will, and you actually directly prove it to
yourself through self observation work, something important will happen. What
will stop is self interference. Your suffering will stop. The
upset, the anxiety, the anger, the sadness, these things will
stop. Because these things are unnecessary. The struggle for control
will stop, your neuroses will stop. A lot of your
bad behaviors and habits will just melt away. Why? Because
you will realize that you don't control anything. Also, what's
really cool is that you know, that agonizing frustration you
experience when you need to make a big life decision.
Like you need to decide who you're going to marry
or what school you're going to go to or what
job you should take all those really tough decisions, those
will become effortless for you. Because you will realize that
you're flowing with life, and that you're not the one
making these decisions in the first place. You have never
made a single decision in your life. Not really. They
have all been made for you. But you certainly agonized
over them, haven't you? You have because you believed that
you were in control. Imagine how frustrating it would be
if you were sitting in a car, somebody else was
driving the car, but you were deluded enough to believe
that you were in control. So when they took take
a turn to the left, you're yelling, and you say
God dammit, why doesn't this car turn to the right
when I tell it to. And when they take a
turn to the right, or they press the brakes or
they speed up, and they do the opposite of what
you wanted. You just get more and more upset, and
you start to fight with yourself. Because you believe that
you're the one in control, when actually you're not. So
what you need to do is you need to surrender
yourself to the fact that you're not the driver, you're
not in the driver's seat. And then what can happen
is you can just sit around and enjoy the sights
and sounds and enjoy the trip. Can you still be
successful life? Yes, this does not mean you cannot be
successful, you can still achieve a lot. In fact, don't
make the mistake of thinking that just because you're enlightened,
or because you have discovered there is no self and
no free will that now you're not going to be
productive. Just the opposite. In light people are some of
the most productive people that are out there when they
actually want to. And when their desire is authentic. They
are a force of nature. They can be extremely productive,
they can move mountains. Take a look at what Jesus
did take a look at what the Buddha did. When
you have that kind of faith and surrender to life,
you are unstoppable. Because nothing can scare you. That's the
power you get. It might seem like you're surrendering your
power. And in a sense you are and it's scary
for the ego is very scary. That's why they call
it a leap of faith. Why is it called a
leap of faith? Because the ramifications of no free will
are so counterintuitive that when we start the journey, it
seems like if we go on this journey, what's going
to happen is that we're going to destroy and ruin
our life, because we're gonna have to completely let go
of all control and surrender. That's the last thing we
want to do. It takes a lot of wisdom to
see that actually the result is going to be the
opposite of that. Yes, we're going to give up the
egotistical power, the egotistical need for control, but then what
we're going to gain is we're going to gain complete
oneness and unity with life. Peace of mind, unconditional happiness,
this is what we gain. And we get a lot
of power in the sense that we unify ourselves with
the force of nature, we become a force of nature,
by allying ourselves with it. Think about the force of
a waterfall, the force of an avalanche, the force of
gravity. These are impersonal forces, they have no ego, they
just act. And they're extremely powerful. There's no pretense in
their actions. They're very direct. That's what's awesome about nature.
As humans, we have a lot of pretense a lot
of bullshit, we blow a lot of smoke up our
own ass. And then that leads to a lot of
fake behavior. Really ask yourself, if your aim is happiness
and peace of mind, which I was suggested it is
that's your whole aim in life. Your current strategy for
acquiring it, you know, control, you're basically your strategy right
now is to seize more control in life. You think
that's going to work, but it's not gonna work? Think
about this, how else could peace of mind be possible,
other than if then if you surrender yourself to nature,
if there actually is a self, and there actually is
even a semblance of control, then that means that there
is no possibility for peace of mind or happiness. Can
you see that? Here's why. Because if you believe that
you do have control. That means that there's a need
for struggle. Now you are struggling against nature, you're not
allied with nature anymore. This, of course, makes you worried
and anxious and frustrated when you fail. And inevitably, you
will fail. Most fundamentally, because you will die. The biggest
reason you need control is to keep yourself alive. But
in the end, that game will be lost, that game
is rigged against you. So fundamentally, you're going to feel
there. But even before you die, you're going to experience
a lot of misery and frustration and suffering. In situations
where you think you have control, and you're trying to
exert control, but then you see that actually, it doesn't
go your way, and then you fail. And then you
really beat yourself up for failing, you feel guilty, you
feel ashamed, you feel angry, feel pissed off, you feel
like you've been violated, like you've been victimized. All this
stuff stops when you surrender to nature. That's the power.
Imagine a situation where you're at the movies at the
movie theater, right? And you're sitting there and you're watching
the movie. And you're crazy enough to believe that you
actually have control over the movie. Imagine you're the director,
when the director is watching the movie, and he actually
gets to say how to change the scenes and how
to film from different angles and stuff. That guy is
frustrated. He's anxious. Why? Because he knows that he has
to do everything himself. If he doesn't do it, the
movies not gonna come out, right. But that's not your
experience when you actually go to the movies. When you
go to the movies as a viewer. It's a fun
experience. It's enjoyable, it's relaxing, you get lost in it,
you're in the flow, you're flowing with life. Why is
that? Because you're sitting there and you know that you're
there to surrender, no control whatsoever. You don't have to
worry about anything. Just sit and enjoy the show. That's
exactly what an enlightened person's life is like, they're sitting
there enjoying the show. No matter what the show is
showing. They know that there is no remote control in
their hands. You on the other hand, are sitting there
watching life and you believe you have a real control
in your hands. But actually, of course you don't. It's
just an imaginary role control. So that is a really
deep description of your suffering in life and where it
comes from where it really comes from. Okay, so at
this point, you might be saying, Alright, Leo, I've got
the concepts. I've got the theory what do I do
about this? Here's what you should do firstly, is I
want you to admit the possibility that you have been
wrong your whole life, about having free will Can you
open your mind and admit that maybe, just maybe it's
possible that you don't have control. Maybe that's why you
struggle so much with your personal development, maybe this is
why you struggle so much to lose your weight, or
to change a bad habit or to quit smoking, quit
drinking or whatever else. Because it's really not up to
you, your body and your mind will decide when they're
ready. And then they will drop those habits. They won't
do it out of your egotistical striving. So admit that
possibility. That's step number one. Step number two is, don't
believe anything I say. intend to verify it for yourself.
Prove it to yourself. Commit to self observation, sit down
and start doing self observation, how I have episodes that
cover that, check out my latest videos, check out my
mindfulness meditation video, check out my other meditation videos, and
I'll have more videos in the future, which talk about
how to do self observation, the actual techniques. So this
is a practical process, you can sit down and start
doing it today if you want to. And the last
step I'd say is to learn more about enlightenment, educate
yourself. read some books, I have a great book list
that has some really awesome enlightenment material on there. A
lot of enlightenment material or spiritual material is bullshit. The
stuff that I have on my list is really, really
direct, straightforward and practical stuff. It will change your whole
life. So start there, or watch some more of my,
my videos. And that's it. Those are action steps. All
right. And very importantly, just sit in contemplate this. Think
about this, let all these ideas percolate into your mind,
what's going to happen is that at first, you'll find
that you're going to be depressed, it's going to be
kind of sad, because you are that corrupt politician who
has to now go to jail. And you have to
accept that fact. And that might be a process of
a couple of weeks. We're not really feeling very good.
Are you feeling demotivated? Don't worry about that. That's just
your ego reacting. Don't worry about that. Have faith take
the leap of faith. Trust that there's something deeper and
truer here that you will discover if you just get
on board with this journey. And you'll come out doing
real good. Alright, this is it. I'm signing off, please
