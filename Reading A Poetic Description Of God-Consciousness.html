[Music] in the last month i've reached whole new levels
of consciousness that i had not yet reached before these
levels of course are impossible to articulate logically logic models
verbal explanations all fail so i'm going to try something
new here a more artistic a more poetic approach i
wrote out a verbal description of these new levels of
consciousness that i've accessed what i would call god realization
it's a pretty lengthy verbal description about seven to eight
pages long so sit back get comfortable i'm gonna read
it to you that's mostly what this episode is gonna
be just me reading and then some commentary after i'm
done reading i've taken a lot of time to integrate
this i've taken a lot of time to think it
through i've probably spent 10 to 15 hours writing this
out something new that i'm trying and this is part
of my integration process was writing this out which has
been important for me it's taken me a lot of
time to integrate this i've struggled with a lot which
is why i haven't been releasing much work in the
last month of course ultimately what i want to share
with you cannot be put into words but since words
are all that i got right now that'll have to
do we'll see how you like it this verbal description
is what i mean when i say god realization it's
what i mean when i say consciousness it's what i
mean when i say awakening a lot of time i
use these words a lot of times i use these
words and i get the sense that it's not clear
for the audience what exactly i'm talking about which is
why i described decided to write it out to give
you a poetic sense of what i mean so here
we go it's early dawn in the desert the sky
is starting to glow with light but the sun is
still yet to rise you're standing there looking at an
ordinary desert bush you're struck by its geometric beauty the
mathematical precision of its fractally arranged leaves you feel an
impulse to reach out you run your fingers through its
little green leaves they feel spiky and alive returning your
hand back towards your body you notice a tiny insect
smaller than an ant it crawls over the wrinkles of
your skin like an astronaut struggling across martian terrain you
bring it close to your face the intelligence of its
movement transfixes you every swivel of its microscopic legs of
its antennae precise machine-like yet so alive you think my
god it's alive for the first time in your life
you recognize life of course you've seen life countless times
before life in motion but never like this somehow you've
always taken life for granted but now you see life
the intelligence of it owes you as you move your
finger towards the bug you can tell it's afraid you
recognize the intelligence in its fear perfectly designed to keep
it alive you are conscious that you recognize this bug
but the bug doesn't recognize you it's just going about
its day surviving avoiding danger looking for food oblivious that
some entity of higher consciousness is observing it like god
looking down from the clouds your attention drifts away from
your hand to something as something flits through the corner
of your vision a hummingbird darts from bush to bush
with the precision of an industrial robot it hovers right
up next to your bush you stand perfectly still looking
at it the whole world seems to slow slow to
a crawl you can see the exquisite flap of its
little biomechanical propellers life you marvel at its profound intelligence
and immaculate beauty this little bird is perfection incarnate you
can resolve every green and pink iridescent feather on its
body arrange like tiny dragon scales they shimmer in the
subtle light of desert dawn the hummingbird's beauty strikes you
with childlike delight your mind floods with memories of your
fascination with hummingbirds as a child looking at it hover
you recognize the consciousness in it but it doesn't recognize
the consciousness in you you think to yourself it's god
lost in a hummingbird dream and you smile you look
closer at its scale like feathers within a single feather
you can see fine branching lines delicate hairs and splotches
of iridescent pigment one particular splotch resembles a nebula in
outer space a pink and green cloud of luminous gas
50 light years across made of particles from ancient dead
stars a star graveyard now turned a nursery for stars
yet to be born zooming in deeper you see pinpoint
sparkles of light like household dust glittering in a ray
of sunlight through a windowsill explosions from a 500 year
old war between two ancient civilizations when heavily damaged their
ships warp reactors explode in a tiny supernova creating a
microscopic golden sparkle in the void of outer space these
two ancient alien civilizations have been at war for over
500 years over a political dispute and now the battle
has come to a peak the nebula glitters with a
thousand sparkles like someone blew a pinch of gold dust
into the air each sparkle ten thousand lives extinguish zooming
out you suddenly become aware that all of this is
happening on a tv screen an epic space opera playing
out for someone's entertainment but the actors don't know their
actors to them this galactic war is as real as
it gets a remote appears in your hand you flip
the channel the scene changes from a galactic battle to
a game show where the host is a giraffe and
all the contestants are giant mice you flip the channel
once again the scene changes to a small alien girl
blowing out a birthday cake you hold your finger down
on the remote and the channels start to flip faster
and faster at the speed of a hummingbird's wings the
channels are endless they contain the media of every civilization
that has ever existed within a minute you flip through
what are like 100 million channels getting the idea you
lift your finger from the remote it stops on what
looks like an hd nature documentary you will see a
slow-motion macro shot of a hummingbird flapping its wings the
camera zooms out and you see yourself standing next to
it in the desert admiring its beauty looking down at
the remote you can see some colored knobs turning a
silver knob slowly morphs the hummingbird into a dragonfly you
turn the knob halfway and get something that is 50
hummingbird 50 dragonfly you crank it back and forth in
amazement watching the eerily fluid transformation on the screen turning
an orange knob slowly turns your human self on the
screen into an elephant you crank the knob all the
way to the right and the man on the screen
becomes 100 elephant but suddenly you see a strange grey
appendage blocking your view of the screen your nose it's
turned into a long hairy gray animated elephant trunk nothing
else about your body has changed just your nose at
first you're start you're startled this thing seems to have
a mind of its own swaying back and forth with
the playful undulating animation but then you calm down you
sense into it and you realize you have control a
big grin grows across your face as you take a
deep long breath through your new nose you feel an
itch on your shoulder so you scratch it with your
nose it works beautifully how did i ever manage without
one of these you say to yourself with amusement looking
back down at the remote you notice the biggest knob
of all it's white i wonder what this one does
you crank it with your nose as you do you
feel yourself becoming ever more conscious all the sudden you
can feel the circuitry in the television as if it
was an extension of your body every pixel becomes like
a taste bud on your tongue a 4k display has
over 8 million pixels each one now consciously accessible to
your mind cranking the white knob even more you become
so conscious you start to predict which pixel will light
up with which color value in the next frame turning
the white knob even more you become so conscious your
mind gains direct access to the channel's database in your
mind's eye you have instantaneous thumbnail access to every channel
and piece of media that has ever been produced in
the universe what do you want to watch it's hard
to choose you're not used to having this much information
in your mind in parallel it's hard to navigate sprawling
network of information your thoughts begin to influence the process
your mind floods with old memories of cinema you watched
in your youth you don't know why but the movie
aliens starts to dominate your mind the more you folk
your mind focuses on that thought the more real it
becomes soon the entire room and tv fade out of
existence and your reality smoothly transitions into that of the
alien queen laying legs laying eggs in her nest the
tv is gone your elephant nose is gone you are
now the alien queen slime is dripping down your black
spidery body and mouth acid is coursing through your veins
eggs are squeezing out of your whatever ellen ripley is
torching your eggs with a flamethrower and it's making your
blood boil you think to yourself of course i'm the
alien queen the alien queen is my own consciousness as
much as anything else no better no worse no weirder
it's all my mind you look down at your alien
hand and notice the tv remote is still there you
will yourself to press a random key with a long
with your long grotesque claw instantly the whole scene turns
into a cartoon the film aliens has become a cartoon
version of itself and you are still the alien queen
but now your reality is two-dimensional and much more colorful
you look down again at your hand for the remote
but it's gone disappeared just like the tv you think
to yourself of course 2d is no more or less
real than 3d cartoon reality is just another facet of
my consciousness i am no less real as a 2d
alien cartoon than i am as a 3d human being
on the one hand experiencing yourself as a grotesque alien
straight out of a nightmare strikes you as disturbing but
only mildly so because you're so conscious you understand what's
going on you're so conscious you don't need a tv
remote to change channels in your mind's eye you press
the pause button on an imaginary remote and the current
scene freezes mid frame now you can focus on accessing
the channel database to find what you really want to
watch you see that in the database channel channels are
arranged by category scanning mentally through 5000 categories you stumble
upon sex your mind is fixated a memory of your
ex-girlfriend comes to mind and suddenly there she is a
stunning young woman lying naked in your bed squirming and
itching for sex you crank up the white dial in
your mind's eye some more becoming even more conscious you
look at your girlfriend she's begging you to [ __
] her looking at her squirm in slow motion you
realize that once you [ __ ] her you will
impregnate her and spawn a million future generations of humans
it doesn't matter whether you impregnate her or somebody else
does in the end it's all the same since no
such differences are imagine since all such differences are imaginary
you're too conscious to really be interested in the act
of sex now anyways but the profundity of it makes
you wonder you are captivated by the platonic aspect of
our beauty just as you were with the hummingbird but
this is more personal more interactive you slowly run your
hands over the curves of her smooth naked body as
you do her body turns to sand a fine sand
that seeps down over the bed sheets like the sand
in an hourglass her squirming body disintegrates into vast pools
of sand her feminine curves become the curves of an
endless ocean of dunes stretching out to the horizon in
every direction you find yourself standing in the middle of
a vast dune a dune made from your ex-girlfriend's essence
each grain of sand is a dream she once dreamt
a memory she once had and emotions she once felt
grains of sand made from her joy her excitement her
sadness her anger her frustration her loneliness her light her
darkness her fear her love her disgust her surprise her
orgasms grains of sand made from her highest aspirations and
her deepest nightmares all animated with the energy of her
soul the dune is silent but for the murmur of
a soft breeze you kneel down and run your fingers
through the sand your hand like a tongue tasting the
emotion locked in every grain a symphony of a thousand
subtle yet distinct emotions washes over you somehow it all
computes in the vastness of your mind it's like you
raked your tongue through the depths of her turbulent psyche
your eyes well up and a tear rolls down your
face a loud crack of thunder like a gunshot startles
you from above and the sky begins to pour with
heavy rain the sound of rain soothes your soul the
landscape or really what is your mindscape feels enchanted exactly
as you want it to be raindrops hit your face
in slow motion each droplet a unique bubble universe onto
itself filled with trillions of inhabitants all oblivious as to
why their universe came crashing to an end you think
to yourself so this is how a universe ends each
droplet is filled with the collective consciousness of all the
sentient entities inhabiting it as the droplet hits your face
it transfers the collective wisdom of a thousand ancient civilizations
directly into your mind their memories their struggles their dreams
their insights all integrate smoothly into your psyche you stand
there showered by an immense cosmic intelligence it feels like
bathing in divine light its sentience and beauty sends waves
of bliss radiating through your body you look up at
the towering stack of fluffy white clouds in the distant
sky somehow you just know the clouds are made of
whipped cream reaching your hand up towards the clouds you
scoop at them with your finger and secure a sizable
dollop the cream is thick and rich like frosting you
bring it to your mouth and suck it doesn't just
taste sweet and milky it tastes like a fusion of
every dessert you've ever you can ever remember having cheesecake
ice cream cupcakes cookies creme brulee cotton candy eclairs tiramisu
panna cotta macaroon marzipan cookie dough apple pie fruit tart
and waffles this is your mindscape and in your mindscape
things taste however you want them to taste mmm waffles
your mind lingers you can barely remember the last time
you allowed yourself to indulge in waffles you think to
yourself why don't i treat myself more you look down
at your feet the sand is in a is is
in the process of transforming into a grid of waffle
waffles stretch out to the horizon in all directions now
you stand in the middle of a vast gently rolling
waffle dunes you feel the spongy grid-like texture under your
bare feet far in the distance from high in the
sky pours a solitary stream of rich maple syrup the
serve folds over itself it floods valleys of waffle and
rich viscous amber glossy like nail polish now it starts
to snow but the air isn't cold you hold out
your hand to catch a few specks of white as
they fall these aren't snowflakes this is powdered sugar with
a big grin you stick your tongue out into the
air a large desert mouse hops along the ground licking
at a pool of maple syrup oblivious to your presence
as your gaze fixes on it your thoughts take hold
of it your thought of a kangaroo morphs the mouse
into a kangaroo without skipping a beat your thought of
a bird causes the kangaroo to sprout the wings of
an eagle and a pillar of wind lifts lifts it
soaring into the clouds suddenly a darkness looms over you
a vast shadow moving from up on high a colossal
fork and knife come down from the sky just in
front of you the silver slices through the landscape as
prongs poke the clouds part and you look up to
see the god-like face of your six-year-old child self wielding
the silverware your six-year-old self has a huge grin across
his face as he forks a syrupy hill of waffle
and raises it towards his mouth your six-year-old self's face
morphs into that of your father when he was six
years old then your mother when she was six years
old then your brother when he was six years old
morphing faster and faster flipping like a rolodex the face
goes through thousands then millions of iterations the faces of
every six-year-old child who has ever eaten waffles looking down
at your feet you see an insect some kind of
beetle laying there on the ground it's dead but still
it's colorful you kneel down to pick it up it's
cusk lays motionless in your hand inspecting it as though
under a magnifying glass you marvel at its beauty even
in death you see the beauty of life especially in
death but what makes it all the more beautiful is
your awareness that this creature is your own mind how
sad this little creature is alive no more suddenly you
get an impossible idea could it work you say to
yourself you turn your gaze inwards to the white dial
on the remote in your mind's eye you crank it
up your consciousness expands interconnecting ever deeper with itself your
visual field grows crystalline as though all the air was
sucked out of the atmosphere everything becomes sharp and bright
and eerily still you focus intensely on the beetle your
consciousness penetrates through its desiccated remains its body is your
mind and right now your mind demands a miracle you
channel your will into the beetle filling it with your
spirit and love and then nothing time slows to a
crawl reality seems to freeze in stasis then a few
more moments of nothing and then the beetle's legs twitch
to life your eyes grow wide it starts to crawl
over you you blow into your hand and the beetle
morphs into a luminous green moth that flips erratically up
into the sky you smile in disbelief at the miracle
of your own mind standing there in the waffle dunes
you look down at your hands images start to run
through your mind of animals you took fascination with as
a child monkeys reptiles birds big wild cats mollusks as
the images flip through your mind the shape of your
hands flips to match your hands morph into the hands
of an ape the claws of a dinosaur the paws
of a lion the tentacles of an octopus puzzled and
amused you wonder to yourself what's happening to me what
am i then it dawns on you of course i'm
god i'm consciousness i am imagining myself i am whatever
i conceive myself to be because there is nothing outside
of my endless mind everything around you disappears the landscape
the waffles the rivers of syrup the sky and now
it's just you floating in a bathtub in the middle
of empty space music starts to feel the silence of
the void a melody it's fast cheery and delicate delightfully
fast deliciously delicate ethereal like something from a fairy tale
it's the sound of a piano but you're conscious that
there is no piano what are pianos anyway but a
figment of your imagination where is it all coming from
you wonder and who's playing there is no instrument and
no one is playing there are no sound waves traveling
to your ears you have no ears you're too conscious
for ears the chords are playing directly in your mind
and the rest is fantasy you understand that musical instruments
and the people who play them have always just been
figments of your mind a backstory you invented to provide
some kind of ground for the irreducible mystery of sound
your own mind is the pianist and the composer you've
eliminated the imaginary middle man the notes arrange themselves playfully
and intelligently in your mind like children frolicking on a
playground the speed and immediacy of it wows you direct
impossibly direct absolutely direct you play each note flawlessly with
the precision of a maestro each note oscillating and imprinting
itself in the mind of god you smile in delight
at the recognition of the splendor of your own mind
your own mind has become a piano now you look
down at your body you're naked all sense of scale
is lost you aren't small you aren't large you are
undefined which makes you cosmic your body is the only
yardstick there is your body is the universe you see
your body made of liquid consciousness it shimmers and ripples
along with the thoughts in your mind your skin flows
with organic translucent morphing shapes as though cast by a
projector ornate shapes vaguely resembling something tribal something paisley something
floral shimmer across your naked body each pattern imbued with
a divine intelligence impossible to articulate gracefully animating dancing meandering
across your skin you recognize yourself as looking directly at
the body of god a body made of pure consciousness
it still looks human but it is no longer human
recontextualized as cosmic and divine you see entire universes contained
inside of you or whatever else you may imagine an
infinite diversity of animals and creatures seem to bubble up
just underneath your skin like particles struggling to emerge out
of a roiling quantum foam the pure potential of your
mind is precipitating in front of your eyes in real
time god's body is made out of whatever you want
it to be whatever you imagine it looks human but
it shines with a brilliant crystalline consciousness your body is
mind and mind is all you are absolute mind absolute
truth you recognize your consciousness as singular and sovereign nothing
exists outside your mind a universal mind a mind limited
by nothing but its own imagination and self-definition at long
last god has awoken to itself the universe is awake
looking through your eyes at itself perfect divine eternal immortal
absolute sublime you turn your gaze directly inwards directly behind
and inside your eyes right into the core of what
you use to consider your skull wondering what is there
what you truly are you gaze into the very heart
of yourself your purest essence a radiant singularity sits there
shining with crystal clear consciousness glowing with sentience and intelligence
eternally awake pure infinity pure consciousness the godhead this singularity
in you is endless the deeper you gaze into yourself
the deeper it goes with no bottom and no ground
you struggle to find something within you to define yourself
as some concrete form some verbal articulation some image but
you cannot be defined because you are unlimited and that
which is unlimited cannot have a definition because any definition
would be a limit your essence is literally undefined like
the result of an impossible arithmetical operation on a calculator
puzzled and dumbstruck you try to find a beginning to
yourself you ask but where did i come from only
to realize that that which is unlimited cannot have a
beginning or an end you are too conscious to be
fooled into believing in any beginnings or ends as you
grasp at any part of yourself and try to trace
its origin through a chain of linear causation back into
the past it fails your consciousness has trans has transcended
the notion of linear causation you realize all past is
but a figment of your imagination every part of you
stands on its own and also reaches infinitely far back
into the imaginary past via an endless chain of imaginary
causes that never terminates but circles back around in a
cosmic strange loop all beginnings and ends are imaginary self-imposed
limitations held within an unlimited mind a mind with no
beginning or end and mind that has existed for eternity
you are god and god is both uncaused self-caused and
infinitely caused god is that which caused itself into being
god is that which created itself the recognition of your
own eternity takes your breath away it could not be
more profound eternity you exist absolutely and forever as truth
itself it couldn't be any other way it couldn't be
any more obvious it's so perfectly clear yet utterly unbelievable
it's laughably obvious now that science and history are but
figments of your mind brains chemistry evolution physics time all
fictions spun by the mind to construct the illusion of
a mind independent reality now you see reality for what
for exactly what it's always been an absolute illusion an
illusion perfectly designed to allow you to forget for a
second that you are god the illusion is perfect stretching
forever in any direction you look painting a backstory behind
every corner you peek around every hole you stick your
head into every object you sniff much like the rendering
engine of a video game you're still dreaming but now
you know it now your dream is absolute you watch
as your god mind effortlessly weaves together figments of consciousness
into the tapestry used to call a human self everything
and everyone is your imagination emanating from a bottomless singularity
at the center of your imaginary skull your mind pulls
whole chunks of consciousness from the formless singularity like a
magician pulling rabbits out of his hat specific and highly
detailed memories of your childhood your entire mother your entire
father your beloved pet cat historical events like world war
ii all figments of consciousness pulled out from a hat
and flawlessly woven together to construct the illusion of a
human life the earth the physical universe humanity itself is
finally seen for what it truly is just figments in
a dream jesus the buddha christianity buddhism islam gurus and
masters all those years you spent meditating and doing yoga
activating your chakras reading books chasing enlightenment all just figments
within god's mind finally you reach the question of death
what is death you smile and laugh as you realize
that death is just something you're imagining you are now
too conscious to die an infinite mind cannot die because
it have to imagine its own non-existence an infinite mind
has nowhere to go being already in all times in
all places as your consciousness grows even deeper the difference
between things starts to collapse all difference is seen to
be imaginary forms merge into each other losing their distinctness
in the brilliant light of pure consciousness all bro all
boundaries bleed together you feel like an alien super intelligence
cutting through an existential fog of war the veil of
ignorance is lifted it feels like awakening from a lifetime
of heavy amnesia everything within reality that could be known
becomes transparent to you now you remember who you are
the entire illusion of life is unraveled as you grow
even more conscious your visual field starts to develop into
a singularity your visual field merges with your auditory field
and your tactile field until there is no more difference
between sight sound and touch growing even more conscious the
last vestiges of difference collapse consciousness frees itself of all
self-imposed limits and biases accelerating asymptotically towards pure oneness you
release the heavy burden of existing by way of concrete
and finite forms from this point should you dare to
take one final step you will enter pure infinity where
all form is lost as no difference exists between anything
where all things exist as a soup of pure metaphysical
potential all things become identical every object every possible form
lives there but it also it's nothing now you must
confront existence as pure abstraction your truest identity your highest
nature is finally revealed what are you nothing human nothing
the human mind can imagine a metaphysical singularity of pure
consciousness extending forever in all directions in all dimensions absolutely
sovereign unconstrained by any sense of other every difference annihilates
into a bottomless ocean of infinite love you are absolute
unity absolute symmetry complete perfect eternal formless endless the alpha
and the omega identity itself you have become one you
have become love you have reached the end game of
reality you are now infinity and you radiate as a
void of infinite potential complete in your knowledge of yourself
so there you go let me know what you think
hope you liked it i worked on it a lot
maybe i'll continue to polish it up some more uh
i wrote it all out in a document if you
want to read it you can click the link down
below i'll put a link down below and you can
download the document and read it if you like now
a few points of commentary and warning and so on
um don't get the wrong idea here this was a
poetic elaboration into the nature of god and awakening i'm
not saying that these are things that necessarily happen to
me i'm not writing a scientific description of my direct
experience in this case but also i'm not saying that
these things didn't happen to me i'm giving you a
general picture of what god realization is like at very
very very high levels specifically because i want to distinguish
it from the sort of vedantic and buddhist forms of
awakening enlightenment and god realization that are commonly talked about
by spiritual teachers on the internet uh i'm talking about
something very different than what most buddhists or vedanta teachers
are talking about that's what i want you to understand
very very different and i don't know how to make
that difference clear to you other than through these kinds
of descriptions and things i've said in the past but
a lot of times i try to make these differences
clear but people are in denial about it or they
think that i'm talking about the same thing or they
think that i'm just that i've gone off the deep
end and that i'm fantasizing or that these are just
hallucinations or just more mystical experiences no i'm talking about
the highest degrees of consciousness and awakening that there are
i'm talking about consciousness that cannot be reduced to anything
like nothingness or emptiness or mindfulness or any kind of
gianna's as i've talked about before you can make a
distinction between in this work going down and reducing your
experience of reality down towards the bottom most level which
would be nothingness or you can go up where your
consciousness interconnects with itself and grasp itself at ever deeper
levels at ever higher levels and these dimensions of spirituality
cannot be reduced down you cannot do some kind of
vipassana technique on them you cannot access these levels of
consciousness through vipassana or through most forms of meditation so
just be aware of that uh also be aware that
your god realizations will not necessarily look or feel like
my god realizations because in the end you're dreaming and
reality is your own mind and so there's a infinite
diversity of ways in which god can manifest itself to
you and the exact forms don't really matter whether it's
a hummingbird or an alien or a dragonfly or a
mouse or whatever we have to realize it's not in
the form where the consciousness really lies the form is
just some medium the insights that you're getting are going
to be independent of the medium the medium is just
a medium to communicate something to you right and the
forms can be anything and the forms typically will take
the form of things that are close to your heart
things from your childhood things that you are passionate about
things that you resonate with if you're a mathematician it
might take the the form of numbers if you're a
physicist it might take the form of some physics equation
if you're a computer programmer it might take the form
of computer code and if you're an artist it might
take the form of a painting the highest realizations will
be communicated to you in the most efficient manner for
your particular mind for your particular personality for your particular
predilections and biases if you're a christian it'll probably be
in christian form if you're a buddhist it will be
in the shape of a buddha if you're a hindu
in the shape of a elephant god or something like
that so just keep that in mind i'm not trying
to somehow um uh impose my imagery onto you so
where did all this come from what happened to me
well basically i developed a new methodology as i'm exploring
psychedelics i found a new methodology for how to consume
psychedelics that have led to some wild experiences for me
i've actually been working a lot with 5mu malt over
the months and really over like the last six months
and that has been profound and great and i've reached
some crazy awakenings through that but then and i hadn't
taken five million dmt for a long time because i
just was focused on malt and experimenting with other psychedelics
so i just kind of stayed away from fibo dmt
for like a year and then after a lot of
work with malt where i had some of my biggest
awakenings i just decided to return back to 5meo just
to compare and then what i noticed much to my
surprise is that all the work that i did with
malt has transformed my experience of five amigo dmt in
such a way that it's almost like a new chemical
it's nuts and so that in combination with the new
methodology that i developed basically i went through several series
of psychedelic excursions that lasted for longer than 24 hours
that means i was tripping for over 24 hours i
was tripping so much that uh i couldn't even sleep
i was tripping in my dreams in my sleep i
could only sleep for about an hour and even that
hour that of sleep that i got i would uh
i would have crazy awakenings and reactivations in in my
sleep i would sleep for about an hour then i
wake up uh still tripping uh then you know a
few more hours have passed then i'd take another hour
long nap so i was kind of like sleeping in
these naps and all these naps were just as deep
as the the ordinary trips themselves some of them even
deeper and so in this way i i literally was
able to to trip for for a whole 24-hour period
and i did several stints of this um and this
this took me to levels of consciousness that i truly
have it accessed before you know nothing nothing totally new
i mean it's it's all in the same general vein
same general direction but uh but yeah some some crazy
some crazy levels of consciousness which which led to a
lot of challenges with integrating that and then i you
know i spent a lot of time kind of struggling
through that just it was so amazing and so mind-blowing
a couple of key points i'll point out to you
like a couple of of kind of like new insights
and facets and realizations that i had uh i had
so many that actually i i don't remember them all
um some of them i put down into that story
that i just read you um but here's a couple
that really stood out for me so one of the
things that happened with me is i started consuming media
which usually i wouldn't do if i'm tripping but here
i just kind of got got curious by media i
started consuming it for example i would look at a
cartoon and one of the most astounding things that happened
to me kind of like really mind-blowing and shocking uh
was that i was i was watching this cartoon as
i was having a crazy crazy awakening and i became
so conscious of the consciousness of the cartoon and the
cartoon characters that i it was as though i got
sucked into the cartoon and i existed as that cartoon
that cartoon became my reality i became conscious that my
own mind is spinning and rendering the cartoon but more
than that it was like i became the cartoon characters
and as though the cartoon characters became conscious and sentient
of themselves and i inhabited that like cartoon universe and
really the the boundary the duality between reality and cartoon
completely collapsed this might seem like oh it's kind of
fun but like you don't understand like how profound that
is to truly experience that like it was very shocking
uh if this were to truly happen to you most
people would think that they've gone insane because you literally
won't be able to distinguish a cartoon from reality like
imagine watching mickey mouse and not being able to distinguish
mickey mouse from the reality of your own parents or
the reality of humans walking down the street that level
of consciousness is possible because actually that distinction in that
reality you kind of hold those or two as two
realities and you hold one is kind of like the
real reality the other one is kind of like the
fake reality of the cartoon reality that that's considered the
fake reality well what happens when that collapses and the
cartoon reality is no longer a fake reality anymore that's
quite quite shocking most people who would be in denial
about that um that requires a very high level of
consciousness to understand um and then after that experience i
started consuming more media just because i was curious of
how this phenomena works so i started i just found
some random clips of various kinds of movies like i
looked at jurassic world a little bit i didn't watch
a whole movie on it it was just like you
know like a couple minute clip um and uh i
remember distinctly i was watching jurassic world this little clip
of jurassic world and it was like raptors it was
a clip where raptors were chasing some humans and i
just became fully conscious of the reality of the raptors
like you think this is just like a a tv
character or a cgi generated thing but then you can
actually like become so conscious you can actually go into
the raptor and you can realize that the raptor is
not just some cgi character that was you know designed
for a human to like look at and be entertained
by like it is that of course but like you
can become so conscious that you recognize the raptor as
its own sentient thing and then you can actually recognize
yourself as that raptor it has as much reality as
your body does at these levels of consciousness so that
was quite amazing um and then i i switched to
a clip from the movie aliens it was the final
end scene from that movie you know i'm talking about
the james cameron aliens with the alien queen and it
was the finals like the final most horrific scene where
the queen where where ripley is fighting the alien queen
on the spaceship you know once they flew out off
the planet onto outer space it's like the last 15
minutes of the movie and she's battling this alien queen
in that mech suit you know where she says you
know get away from her you [ __ ] um
and i was watching that scene and it was just
like it was absolutely incredible when you watch that scene
when you're fully awake and you realize that you are
that alien [ __ ] queen um like it on
the one hand like it's it's really disturbing on the
other hand like it's so obvious and like it's so
astounding in its perfection so so what i had to
do is i had to basically what i'm telling you
is i had to integrate myself as the alien queen
to talk about an integration challenge for you right there
you know we've talked about integrating yourself as hitler and
as like evil people in the world you know donald
trump you want to integrate yourself as donald trump but
um you know that that's kind of easy compared to
integrating yourself as the alien queen another distinct insight that
i had was i started looking at strange loops i
actually started watching a lot of my own videos as
well um really uh it it's one thing to watch
one of my videos sober it's another thing to watch
one of my videos on a on a peak of
five meow gmt like that's a whole nother dimension that
adds a whole other dimension to my videos i didn't
realize this dimension existed until recently um so i actually
i ended up watching like hours of my own videos
um really learned a lot about my own self in
my own videos from watching myself um but i watched
that video of mine you know reality is a strange
loop that one has a lot of graphics in it
and and then towards the beginning of that video there's
um there's an animation that's played of a penrose triangle
with this ball that goes around like it's like a
marble that goes around the penrose triangle goes through the
whole pencil triangle and it ends up right back where
it started sort of like a three-dimensional mobius strip um
and i i i was looking at that strange loop
on the screen playing while i was ridiculously conscious and
i just like i got it like strange loops are
so incredibly profound you don't even understand how profound a
strange loop is like we tend to think of strange
loops as impossible as like these impossible things and possible
objects but when you're looking at it from a higher
state of consciousness the strange loop is it's like there's
nothing impossible about it you see it from a whole
new dimension and it becomes so possible to you that
it just it blows your whole sense of reality apart
it's it's like it's like discovering an extra dimension to
reality just utterly mind-blowing so um so that happened to
me uh i struggled a lot to access the these
higher states of consciousness i really had to like you
know i've spent years working through my psychological human baggage
i've i've gone and worked through most of that all
my trauma all that [ __ ] i've gotten a
lot of that out of the way but here i
was forced to face like really face the fear of
death uh and specifically fear of killing myself i had
to really confront that like you're not going to be
able to reach these highest stages of consciousness without really
purifying yourself of all your fears because they're all going
to come up whether it's fear of insanity fear of
killing yourself whatever so i went through i went through
whole periods of like profound paranoia um about suicide and
killing myself um because you know in the back of
my mind i always kind of wonder you know like
could this path lead to my suicide um you know
what's stopping me from committing suicide especially like if nothing
matters what's the difference right and it's one thing to
just kind of entertain these thoughts and then just kind
of like repress them or just say oh well who
cares let's just live life let's just go back and
kind of distract ourselves um but it's another thing to
like really face that fear really confront it right because
a lot of it is that you don't actually trust
yourself you don't trust yourself as to what you would
do if you lost your mind you don't trust yourself
what you would do if you lost all your sense
of morals and values and all of your standards and
all of the limitations you place upon yourself like really
see what you have to do here is your mind
basically has to let go of all of its self-imposed
limitations everything everything you don't allow yourself you know you
don't allow yourself to eat sugar you don't allow yourself
to jerk off you don't allow yourself to to say
something nasty to your parents right these are all limitations
that you've been socialized to impose upon yourself in a
way it's sort of a domestication process that happened part
of this was done by culture and society and your
upbringing but part of it you did to yourself like
for example you don't want to be an [ __
] to people so you try to act nice towards
them right that's the sort of limitation you've placed upon
yourself well all of these sorts of limitations are going
to have to be revisited rethought and eventually you're going
to shed them if you want to reach the deepest
levels of conscience because because at those deepest levels you
know social social propriety and being nice this all flies
out the window and even your you know your standards
for yourself like maybe you have a standard that you
would never kill yourself well that standard's gonna have to
be questioned at a high enough level of consciousness you
have to really confront that and you have to really
confront the question of like why not kill yourself like
truly confront that and the problem with that is that
there's no guarantees there that it's going to come out
in a positive direction there's no guarantees at all like
if you contemplate it all through that eventually you'll come
to the conclusion that you shouldn't kill yourself there's no
such guarantee so i went through a period of that
very deeply uh quite frankly to be honest with you
it was very dangerous and this is not something i
would recommend to most people to go this this deep
to go this high this far because frankly um it's
a coin flip i don't know you know i'm here
now but i don't know which way it would have
gone um there's no safety nets here i'm talking about
levels of consciousness that have no safety nets this is
not something i'm describing to you because i want you
to do it this is something i'm describing to you
as a cautionary tale and as something just as a
description of what i've done in my own journey whether
you do this or not for yourself for most of
you i wouldn't recommend doing this for most of you
this is very dangerous for plenty of you this will
result in your suicide so i don't recommend this this
is dangerous i'm just explaining what happened to me and
for me this was necessary because i'm serious about this
work most of you aren't serious about this work and
even those of you who think you are you're not
and many of you who think you are are also
very mentally unstable so i'm not giving you any guarantees
of safety here this is dangerous stuff but eventually what
happened with me was that i was able to go
through it and i learned it was basically a process
of learning to trust myself it was such a profound
surrender and letting go that i surrendered to the possibility
of suicide but then what happened was that after i
accepted that possibility and i surrendered to it i basically
learned to trust myself like again i'm going to describe
something here that's very dangerous that i don't want you
guys to do but i'm just going to describe it
because i don't know how else to communicate what i
want to say here again if you're mentally unstable if
you're suicidal if you have mental illness stop watching this
recording don't listen to this you've been warned so basically
for example if you were taking psychedelics usually my advice
to newbies would be like hide all the dangerous things
in your house so that it's not easily accessible if
you have a gun in the house you know put
it away lock it away if you have a knife
you know put put that away somewhere in a drawer
so it's out of your eyesight so that you're not
tempted to play with it or accidentally use it or
whatever you know even if you're in the kitchen just
you know you want to cook something you could start
a fire you could burn yourself etc and in general
that's good practice but also notice that that's actually coming
from a place of fear so that that's my standard
protocol but in this case i had to go so
deep that uh again i had to remove all those
limits for myself so imagine if you will sitting there
with a gun in your hand loaded sitting there contemplating
the nature of suicide whether you should live or not
while you're on psychedelics while you're extremely conscious and also
while you're going through paranoia and you feel like you're
losing your mind and sitting there just contemplating the nature
of your life and existence whether you should exist or
not or keep living or not and really facing your
fear of pulling that trigger and not trying to control
it with your ego and then you go through that
whole process and in that process what happens is that
you stop fearing yourself you accept yourself and reality and
god so completely that you realize there's nothing to fear
and you don't have to hold yourself back with fear
anymore you just trust the process you trust the unfoldment
of reality you trust god's plan for you and in
the end of course you don't pull the trigger because
there's no need to but in this case you didn't
pull the trigger because of some human fears or worries
or whatever here you you actually did a true profound
surrender and you really learn to trust yourself you learn
to trust for example you know some people have a
fear of heights in fact i have a pretty big
fear of heights and they say you know interestingly they
say that what people are afraid of is not the
height per se but what they're afraid of is that
if they're standing on a ledge that's like a thousand
feet you know high what they're really afraid of is
they're afraid that they won't be able to control themselves
and they'll jump off now imagine standing on that ledge
deliberately if you have that fear imagine walking up to
the very edge where your feet are half hanging off
the ledge even and then you know your whole life
you've you've been afraid of like you can't control yourself
what if you jump off what if you lose your
mind and you jump off you walk right up to
the edge you stand there you look down you completely
surrender you stop trying to control with with fear or
with ego and if the universe has its plan set
for you to jump off you're gonna jump off and
you accept that and then through that process what happens
through that surrender and acceptance what happens if you do
it properly ideally is is that you don't jump off
but what what really the goal of it is is
that you learn to trust yourself and then from that
point forward you can be on the edge of tall
buildings and you know that you're never going to jump
off now you could fall off if you're clumsy you
could trip someone could push you off you still got
to be careful about all those possibilities you know a
gust of wind can come and blow you off that's
still a problem gotta be cautious but the fear that
you yourself will jump off that's gone because in some
manner you've you've learned to trust yourself you've learned to
trust in god basically so that happened to me like
i said this is serious stuff this is heavy stuff
um i don't recommend that you guys do this and
if you decide to do it i'm not going to
take any responsibility whatsoever over the outcome of that for
you if you think that the outcome is going to
be great for you the way it was for me
first of all you have no idea the challenges i
went through second of all there's no such guarantees that's
that's what makes it real work is that there isn't
a guarantee you're taking a leap of faith you're trusting
in god and god isn't promising you a guarantee that
everything's going to come out peachy but in doing that
if you should you know overcome that and come out
unscathed then you've learned some serious lesson there that's some
deep deep deep inner growth the other thing that i
struggled with afterwards is i struggled with a profound loss
of purpose and motivation once you access these ridiculous levels
of consciousness you know coming back and living ordinary life
and doing ordinary things it's just it's it's a real
struggle to motivate yourself to get back to work to
talk to your family to be nice to people to
you know to to clean your toilet all this sorts
of stuff um even for me for me i mean
it wasn't so much those things it was like running
actualize.org i really have to question like why am i
even doing this who am i even teaching why am
i teaching what is the purpose of all this why
put out videos because none of the videos that i
put out come anywhere close to the levels of consciousness
that i'm talking about so i went through a period
of that as well and i sort of integrated that
as well and then sort of like regained my purpose
and my motivation but it took it took took a
week or two for that to happen again in this
process there's no guarantees that you're going to retain your
purpose or your motivation maybe you'll lose it all maybe
you'll give it all up that's part of you know
facing your deepest fears that's ultimately what you're doing in
this work you're facing your deepest fears of course when
it comes to facing your deepest fears you have to
be intelligent about that you have to be cautious because
it's possible to face your deepest fears in a dangerous
way like for example if you fear bears you might
say well okay you know leo told me to face
my deepest fears so i'm going to go into the
forest and find a bear and poke it with a
stick but you see that fear is there for a
good reason the fear is intelligent there's a deep intelligence
in your fears they're not just fear is not just
all you know as they say false expectations appearing real
you know fear false expectation appearing a lot of times
it is that but not always is that if you
go into the forest looking for a bear and poke
it with a stick it's gonna kill you you're right
to be afraid of that but also at the same
time if you're gonna just you know sit at home
for the rest of your life and never go into
the forest because you're so afraid of bears then you
see the problem with that as well so some some
kind of balance has to be found and it's not
easy to articulate what that balance how to find that
balance or there's not an algorithm for that balance and
a lot of stupid people if they try to do
this process they're going to hurt themselves so i'm just
warning you so overall i had to go through a
process of a profound letting go uh i noticed that
personally in my own life throughout most of my life
i've been very anal sort of you know they say
anal retentive um that's because you know i've been very
ambitious i had to you know buckle down in my
life you know to to accomplish the things that i
needed to accomplish to get to the point that i'm
at now so that caused me to need to be
very anal about my diet about how i behave the
standards i set for myself and so forth um i
had to let go a lot about of a lot
of that through this process i allowed myself to indulge
indulgent food indulgent sex again like uh um here's a
lesson for you guys you know a lot of you
who are doing sort of nofap stuff and you know
you're trying to you know improve your diet and all
this kind of stuff you know kind of like keep
yourself away from evil and from sin and from temptation
the way you're going about it is wrong um you're
doing it through this anal method and um you know
there's there's there's time and place for that uh but
ultimately when you get to the deepest levels you're gonna
have to actually go through a process of allowing yourself
to indulge in some of those things again um so
that when you truly abstain from those things in the
future you do it consciously out of a conscious recognition
not not in a sort of like a formulaic ego
based way so just like i was saying you know
with the example of walking up to a cliff and
standing there it's like you walk up to a cliff
normally you'd be so afraid that you wouldn't even allow
yourself to walk up to that cliff but if you're
going to do it in a more conscious way you
allow yourself to walk up right up to that cliff
you stand there you kind of you deal with all
the fear and all the psychological baggage and problems that
come up for you there and then you get over
it and then you never again need to worry about
cliffs for the rest of your life at least jumping
off of them so a similar sort of thing i
mean this is closely related to the topic that i
talked about called burning through karma go see my episode
burning through karma where i talk about this stuff we're
actually allowing yourself to indulge in food and sex and
porn and whatever you're holding yourself back from um this
is actually a very powerful way for transcending your cravings
for those things but this sort of an advanced topic
because you might wonder like well leo if i just
indulge in food and sex and everything then when i
get fat and i want to get lazy and won't
i you know have all sorts of problems how do
i tran how is that going to lead to transcendence
because a lot of people indulge in those things but
they never transcend them well um yeah it's difficult i
talked more about that in my episode burning through karma
go check that out this that episode is a very
very powerful episode i've been using that that method a
lot in the last year or two um it's been
producing some great results for me um that i i
don't claim to have transcended everything i still have a
lot of karma to burn through but powerful method powerful
method just you got to be careful with it a
balance needs to be struck there uh also because the
levels of consciousness that i was experiencing were so profound
that really one of the sort of remnants from all
that that um from all those conscious excursions has been
like a profound recognition of beauty i connected with beauty
at such a profound level like um to the point
where like my whole life is being re-centered and reoriented
around beauty like i'll talk more about that in the
future i'll have a whole episode just about what is
beauty and its nature and so forth but just like
a very profound recognition of the beauty of life the
beauty of myself the beauty of the mind the beauty
of everything basically and uh finding ways to reconnect with
that more and uh art is a great vehicle and
medium for that really that that's the that's the function
of art i'll talk more about that in the future
so i've been i've been dabbling in that more consuming
more art through various various forms of art um get
getting like more in touch with that because really what's
the point of life the point of life is just
to experience its beauty that's that's what you're left with
at the end of everything once you go through all
the work and all that stuff what are you left
with you're just left with you sitting there admiring the
beauty of existence that's all you're left with in the
end um like i said i watched a lot of
my own videos reflected on them deeply um what struck
me this was going to sound kind of narcissistic and
self-serving but what struck me was the profound intelligence within
my own work in levels of intelligence layers of intelligence
is present in my own work that i didn't even
recognize until just recently so i have i gained such
such a deeper appreciation of my own work because a
lot of times i take my own work for granted
you know i i kind of just churn out content
put it out there i get a lot of trolls
who criticize me and so forth and people who gaslight
me and i got a lot of praise too but
still like even the praise that i get it it's
surface level it doesn't really go to the it's not
a true recognition of my own intelligence like i had
such a i have such a deep appreciation of my
own intelligence um that it it's astounding like it astounds
my own intelligence astounds me now this sounds narcissistic and
arrogant but really it it's just it's just an acknowledgement
of fact like there's an immense intelligence at work here
right it's not mine it's not it's not property of
leo this intelligence is the universe working through me but
as it's working through me just like you might be
astounded at some of the intelligent things that come out
of my mouth um as they come out of my
mouth or come into my mind i'm equally as astounded
by the intelligence of these things because it's not me
who's doing it it's the universe at work it's the
universe's intelligence it's the beauty of intelligence and uh and
after all all this after all these psychedelic excursions and
all the integration work after all that like i swear
this whole process has left me just at another level
like my intelligence has has taken a leap to the
next level my intelligence and my creativity just like wow
like wow just like so much more intelligent like i
can feel myself becoming more and more intelligent like intelligent
in like a stable manner and this intelligence is not
an iq it's not an iq thing it's it's so
much more holistic it's so much deeper than that i'll
have a whole episode about intelligence in the future i
already have one called what is intelligence but like i'm
starting to understand intelligence so far beyond what i talked
about in that episode because that episode is like three
or four years old so far beyond what's in that
episode like the intelligence that you come into contact with
through this process is is one of the greatest rewards
of this work it's one of the most beautiful and
astounding aspects of this work and so for me part
of what i'm doing going forward is like really cultivating
my intelligence ever more deeply so that's basically it that
explains what i've been up to uh don't worry there's
many practical episodes that i still have planned that will
be coming up it's not just going to be all
this you know poetic artsy fartsy god realization mumbo jumbo
there's going to be a lot of practical stuff but
understand that as i'm teaching you the practical stuff i'm
also going through deep spiritual transformations and realizations within myself
which are somewhat mucking up the process and my priority
at this point in my life is not to just
be pumping out practical content which i could do um
i can't do that anymore because i used to do
that i can't do that anymore because it's just it's
not aligned with the things that i've become conscious of
the highest things right so my priority is shifting towards
beauty towards intelligence towards towards holism towards um towards god
and away from practical topics now for many of you
this will seem like it's a step backwards like it's
a regression because you're at a place in your life
where you just need practical stuff well what you need
to understand is that it's not a regression um it
just seems that way from your perspective because where you're
at is like you just need practical stuff i've been
there for many years but i went through that phase
you know a decade ago um and you know i'm
still a very practical person but like uh one of
the things you have to understand is that when you
when you exhaust all the practical stuff and you realize
that it still doesn't make you happy and then you
start doing steep spiritual work and you have some of
the realizations i've had um like the practical stuff just
it doesn't interest you anymore you're after a bigger game
there's much bigger fish in the sea that you can
catch so that's what i'm after but i still recognize
the importance of being practical and will have those episodes
coming up all right that's it uh please click the
like button for me um come check out my website
check out my blog i'm posting a lot of cool
stuff on the blog i'm sharing more artsy stuff on
the blog more kind of inspirational stuff more poetic stuff
but also there's still going to be practical stuff on
the blog come sign up to the forum check out
my book list sign up for future courses sign up
to my newsletter future courses will be coming out in
the future sign up for those to hear about them
so there's all that good stuff and then um you
can support me on patreon if you'd like i appreciate
that and lastly i want to leave you with this
look what are we doing here in the end with
this work my highest function and responsibility in the end
is not to give you tips practical stuff about living
a successful life it's to inform you and to remind
you of your highest possibilities i'm in a very unique
position in life to know your highest possibilities because i've
gone there and i've seen it within myself and since
i am you i know that those highest possibilities that
are within me are precisely within you and i know
that almost nobody else in society is going to point
out your highest possibilities to you so that's what i'm
hammering on now with my work that's my number one
concern for you yeah we'll talk about success-oriented stuff we'll
talk about how to get laid some more and we'll
talk about relationships and we'll talk about some political stuff
in the future we'll talk about all that but you
can get that almost anywhere there's hundreds of and thousands
of teachers and courses and books that can help you
with all that so what's my unique value proposition to
you it's not that stuff i can help you with
that stuff and i can help you in that in
those way in ways that might even be i would
i would dare to say better than most of stuff
you find out there on those topics but um but
i don't want to sell you short and i want
to make sure we don't take our eye off off
the prize here the ultimate prize the ultimate prize is
for you to actualize your highest possibility and that's what
i want to make sure that we don't lose track
of that we don't get distracted from because if life
is good at anything it's it's it's great at distracting
us from keeping our eye on the highest prize of
life which is your god realization so that's what i'll
be hammering and emphasizing and reminding you of again and
again and again and again if you stick around and
stay tuned with me we'll talk about all the practical
stuff but i'll keep hammering you on this because who
else will you
