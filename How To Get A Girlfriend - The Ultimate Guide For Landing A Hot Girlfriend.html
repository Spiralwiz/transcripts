hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
I'm going to tell you how to get a girlfriend
alright so let's talk about how to get you that
awesome girlfriend that you want how to get a girlfriend
all right so what I'm going to give in this
video is I'm gonna give you some very practical techniques
and really areas in your life that you have to
look at to see where you need to fix certain
sticking points that you have in order to get much
better at attracting a girlfriend alright we're going to cover
all the different nuances that I've discovered in my own
struggle to find a girlfriend because I had a big
big struggle with this and I dedicated massive massive resources
and attention and energy and time to figuring this out
because I really sucked with attraction and that's what I
want to really talk about in this video is there's
really two phases to having a girlfriend one is to
attract her and that's from the phase where you just
meet her to the point where you have sex with
her and then after you have sex with her onwards
that's when the relationship starts and there there's also some
different mindsets that you need and various techniques to actually
maintain a girlfriend because some people have trouble doing that
after the sex part but I find most guys can
figure that stuff out more naturally I'll have other videos
that will cover those topics more in depth here I
want to focus on the first part of this process
the attraction part I find that most people who are
struggling to get a girlfriend are struggling in this area
the attraction area so we're going to talk about that
I'm going to give you all the different sticking points
you might possibly have and how you can boost your
success there by a lot what I've really learned is
that if you're bad at this if you're bad with
girls if you're bad at attracting women then what's actually
really nice about this for guys is that you can
improve and you can improve massively you just have to
be dedicated and you have to be following some of
these principles and then if you chip away at it
over time you can improve ridiculous amounts it's insane how
successful you can become with women regardless of your looks
or your finances or your social status or anything like
that so here we go let's talk about that first
of all let's talk about the possible avenues of getting
a girl I think this is important because most guys
are are sitting or stuck at home or stuck in
their job or doing something that's keeping them locked out
from ever finding a girlfriend simply because they're not utilizing
one of these avenues that you have to use in
order to actually find one so one is social circle
social circle means that you are socializing with your friends
and then your friends socialize with other friends and you
kind of intermingle and then through that you meet girls
you meet new friends and eventually you end up dating
from that and from there you can create relationships this
is actually how probably 95% of all dating is done
is through social circle this is how girls love to
date and most guys like this as well so that
is a very legitimate Avenue the next Avenue is online
online dating now is pretty popular it's a totally legitimate
way to get dates even a legitimate way to get
married to find your life partner and all that stuff
so that's definitely a appropriate Avenue if you like that
sort of thing and if you're a bit tech savvy
so that might be more in line with you the
only the only trick there is that all AI dating
is is fairly nuanced there's a lot of details that
will go into that and I'll have another video that
talked about the in-depth how-to of online dating so I'm
not going to cover that here next is cold approach
what is cold approach this is my favorite of the
most interesting cold approach is when you approach girls randomly
on the street or in the mall or at Starbucks
or at a club or at a bar literally you're
approaching a stranger a strange girl that you never met
before and you're chatting her up with the intent of
having sex with her and making your girlfriend so this
is very very possible and you can get amazing results
from doing this and this is a very very good
way at learning how to be good with women in
fact this is the best way there is no better
way to learn and to improve than by doing lots
and lots and lots of cold approach so I highly
recommend that if you are deficient in this area and
lastly the last Avenue I would say is public visibility
so a lot of people a lot of guys will
have options with very high quality girls simply because they're
out there in public they're around people and they're visible
and they also have status right so for example who
might be in this position a public speaker or someone
who's doing public presentations or a celebrity and actor a
musician if you have your own band and artist who's
doing shows you know anything where you're out and about
and you're meeting people it's basically good enough right because
you're going to be bumping into girls and that's all
you need really you need some sort of vehicle for
bumping into girls whether you do it through cold approach
online dating or social circle or public visibility it's all
pretty much the same thing just different ways to get
there so make sure that you choose one of these
avenues to specialize in and commit yourself to that master
that get good at it if you want to be
good at social circle get good at that make sure
you have a large social circle make sure you're being
active in it if you want to be good at
online dating make sure you commit yourself to that don't
just go out there and post a profile and hope
that girls hit you up like really go at it
hard make sure you craft a really awesome profile make
sure you understand and learn how online dating works and
make sure that you're always on the online dating sites
and hitting up lots of girls that's giving you more
more opportunities if you're doing cold approach then you know
do that hit that really hard if you're doing the
public visibility thing well then you know do that make
sure you are visible and make sure that you are
actually coming into contact and talking to these girls so
those are the actual four avenues for getting a girlfriend
now let's talk about attraction problems this is going to
be a list of eight things that keep most guys
from being able to attract the girlfriend that they want
so here they are in no particular order but they're
all very important and if you get any one of
these wrong then you could be very critically hampering yourself
from acquiring a girlfriend so the first one is neediness
neediness is a huge turnoff for women I have other
videos I talk about attraction with women and you might
want to check those out but there I talk about
neediness in more depth here I'm just going to say
that if you need the girl if you're desperate for
sex if you're desperate for love or companionship then there's
no way in hell that you're gonna have a girlfriend
she is probably not even gonna get attracted to you
in the first place but even if she does she's
going to leave you very fast because she's going to
sense that neediness from you so what you need to
do is you got to burn that out of your
system find a way to get the neediness out usually
the best way to do that I find is to
actually be in a lot of relationships dude eating a
lot so you can burn it out of your system
and you're not so needy for sex or women anymore
the next point is not going out most guys that
have problems with getting a girlfriend are antisocial they're not
going out they're sitting at home in their mancave watching
television or watching sports or playing video games all day
or they're stuck at work and they're workaholics and so
of course if you're doing that then how can you
expect to get a girlfriend you have to be out
being social because women are social first of all women
love social guys just because they love social everything they're
social creatures you need to be a social creature too
now if you're an introvert I understand this is hard
I'm insured myself this has been a big challenge for
me but you had to go out there and push
yourself right you don't have to become a social party
animal but you can still go out more often than
you do and if you never go out then that's
your problem right there gotta fix that start going out
the next point is not approaching just because you go
out that's nice maybe you out with your buddies once
a week to a bar and you stand there and
you you have some drinks in you you crack some
jokes and then you go home I mean you see
girls but you don't approach them you talk about approaching
them you you fantasize about maybe how you could sleep
with that girl or how you can get that girl
or maybe how you could fall in love with her
or she could fall in love with you but then
no action is taken no approach is made or maybe
you expect her to approach you and that will never
of course happen because women almost never approach men so
here what you got to do is got to take
the initiative and I know it's scary there's anxiety involved
it's called approach anxiety there's actually term for it in
the pickup community is called approach anxiety and this approach
anxiety it let me tell you it doesn't really go
away all right I've cold approached several thousand women in
the last couple of years and I've really pushed myself
hard and I still have approach anxiety if I go
out to the club tonight I will still have approach
anxiety all right it's natural it's normal so you have
to just bust through it you have to take the
initiative don't be a [ __ ] have to be
a man just when you do up a direct approach
on a girl that alone builds massive attraction within her
eyes about you because you're a man who did that
and 99% of men are not willing to do that
or they only do that when they're shit-faced and wasted
you want to be doing that so right do it
dead sober that's the best way to learn alright next
is guys suck at talking talking to women right maybe
you're one of those guys that just doesn't know what
to say in front of a woman this is actually
a lot of guys this was one of my biggest
stumbling blocks when I started doing cold approaches that I
didn't know what to say I didn't know how to
talk to women I'm a very logical analytical introverted guy
so what does that mean that means I'm always stuck
in my head and the conversation topics that I have
are never appropriate for the kind of social settings that
I'm in so when I'm in a loud club or
a bar or something it's like that or even at
a mall I mean I can't talk to a woman
about the kind of stuff that I'm like talking with
you guys it's very heady it's not appropriate for that
atmosphere so I had to really retrain my brain to
be more flirtatious and fun and spontaneous more like joking
and more witty one I'm out and about and talking
to women that's what women want they want emotionally stimulating
conversation not the boring hey what's your name where are
you from where do you work all right that's a
very if you got to start there that's fine and
I ask those questions a lot myself I still do
especially when I started I was asking those that was
basically my whole game because at that point you know
you got to work with what you got start there
if that's all you got but then try to actually
improve your conversation skills so you're cracking jokes you're being
funny you're being witty you're doing these kinds of things
where you're teasing girls you got to be doing that
all right girls will be so much more attracted to
you if you are ok the next point is not
being sexual with women you have to be sexual this
is why guys get friendzone they have friendzone problems is
that they're acquaintances with a girl and they kind of
befriend a girl they do nice things for the girl
and they expected the girl will magically fall in love
with them she's not going to do that if you're
not sexually making advances on her then she's going to
perceive you as just a guy with no balls and
she's not going to get attracted to you that's because
you have no balls and you don't deserve to get
the attraction of a cute girl so what that means
is that you have to be sexual be sexual the
girl right off the bat set that frame what does
that mean that means putting your hands on her body
physical right off the bat as soon as you can
especially if you're in a nightclub or a bar that's
very appropriate if you're at them all definitely don't do
that that's not appropriate so have to be calibrated that
sort of stuff also the conversations you having right be
sexual with your conversations flirt use sexual innuendo sometimes literally
you know say dirty things to her right off the
bat I mean it can work extremely extremely well and
some of the best guys that I know are extremely
sexual when they're talking to women because they don't want
to be playing around they don't want any confusion about
what this conversation here is about this conversation is about
us having sex and us having some sort of relationship
this is not a get-to-know-you chat or chat about the
weather make sure you're not doing that that's a big
killer big mistake that people make all right the next
point is not leading all right a man has to
lead and you have to be leading with a woman
that means what that means literally you take her by
the hand if you meet her somewhere and you move
her around you move around the venue you change venues
what does that mean that means that let's say you
open a girl at the mall and you're talking to
her at the mall you just like chat her up
okay you have a nice little five-minute conversation at the
mall now you grab her by the hand and you
lead her to the Starbucks inside the mall to grab
a coffee right it's like an instant date go grab
a coffee you're leading her you're pulling hurt somewhere that
shows that you're a man you're leading but it's also
about leading her to sex literally I mean that's what
you got to be doing that's what really good guys
do the guys that get a lot of girls that's
what they're doing they're not just standing around and waiting
for the girl to say eh come home with me
it doesn't work like that you have to lead take
her from one place to the next place so from
the mall to the coffee shop from the coffee shop
to ice cream from ice cream to food from food
to your house and their sex right if you're not
doing that then it's not going to happen you're missing
a lot of opportunities just by not leading properly okay
the next point is not closing hard all right you
have to be a hard closure this is so important
I can't even count how many women I've lost because
I wasn't closing hard enough you have to really close
hard basically you push her for sex until she gives
you a really hard dead no so when she says
no that's when you know you have to stop and
you can disengage and leave that's when it's done but
until she give you a hard no you push it
because women will give you so many excuses they'll give
you literally thousands of excuses from oh I got to
go to the bathroom oh my friends are here somebody
is waiting for me I have work in the morning
this and that she'll give you all sorts of excuses
you have to bust through every single one of those
lead her to a place where you're isolated and have
sex with her there is no relationship until there is
sex all right so this is very very critical you
have to be a hard closer if you don't know
how to do that if you're not comfortable with it
you have to just push yourself push yourself to take
it to the next level you will be shocked at
how far you can get away with with what you
can do with girls as far as pulling them too
close like you have to be like a really hard
salesman it's really a Salesman skill ok the next and
last point is bad text game right how good are
you with your text messages this is very important because
nowadays you rarely will call a girl that you just
met or that you even met through a friend it's
usually going to be a text message and if it's
text messages or even text messages after online dating to
get a girl to meet up with you're going to
be treating text messages you have to know how to
say the right things to communicate the right things so
that you seem attractive via the text messages you don't
see needy and desperate and a lot of guys will
will screw this up because their text game is completely
completely wrong it's usually way too verbose way too overblown
and way too needy so you need to work that
out as well and I'll have other videos that talk
about that that's a pretty in-depth topic and I really
struggled with text game for a long time and I
still do to us to an extent but now I
kind of really know the do's and don'ts which have
lost me many many many girls who would have otherwise
slept with me or become my girlfriend just because I
sent them the wrong text message I mean girls will
be very picky about that wrong one wrong text message
and you're going to blow the whole opportunity so you
have to make sure you get that right all right
so those are the eight points all right neediness not
going out not approaching sucking at conversation not being sexual
not leading not closing hard and bad text game all
right the next point that I want to make is
that you will you got to look look you got
to take these points and you got to ask yourself
okay where am I going wrong where am i faltering
here pick the ones that you're doing the worst on
and then commit yourself to working those out practicing and
learning from other places learning for me learning from other
sources that you could find to get this dialed in
in your life if you get all eight points firing
on all eight cylinders then you are going to be
so attractive and so successful with women that you'll have
more girls that you will want to be your girlfriend
you will not have any trouble getting a girlfriend if
you do this the next point that I want to
make is really that you have to commit to a
different paradigm in your thinking most guys what they do
when they start off dating and they struggle with getting
a girl is that they use this what I call
the rod and reel method of catching a girl it's
kind of like fishing if you take dating and getting
a girl as an analogy and equate it with fishing
right if you're fishing and you're using the rod and
reel what you do is you go out on the
bank you cast one line out into the lake and
you've got one hook on it and you're sitting there
all day waiting for a fish to come nibble and
bite on it now the problem with that approach is
that a fish comes and bites let's say five hours
later you're bored out of your mind if you're even
asleep but let's say it comes and bites once in
a blue moon it bites now you you get all
excited you grab the pole you set the hook and
what well half the time the hook doesn't even set
and then you get all disappointed and dejected you have
to wait another five hours but even if the hook
does set now the fish is on the hook you're
reeling it in but then you got to be very
careful in you're very anxious about reeling it in because
you got to get everything just right or you're going
to land you're going to lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
reel in this nice fish so so with that kind
of approach there's a lot of like anxiety within you
and it builds up a lot of neediness and desperation
and with women that's just for like repellent to them
so this is the worst possible way to attract women
is with this rod and reel method it's going to
be extremely frustrating instead what you want to do is
you want to use the net method what's the net
method you walk out there with a large casting net
and you can cast that thing into the lake and
you just pull it in and you see what you
get and invariably you're going to get an assortment of
things you're going to get a good fish bad fish
all sorts of fish from that you pick the fish
that you like the best and you make her your
girlfriend that's a much better approach now this is all
nice and poetic and philosophical but what does this practically
mean for you if you're a guy who wants to
get a go right now what that means is working
on these eight points that I just talked about right
these eight points this is your net now the less
of these points that you've got solid that means that
your net has holes so if you're being needy if
you're not going out if you're not approaching and if
you're sucking out your conversations those are four huge holes
in your net basically your net is going to be
it's going to be so so full holes up that
girls will just slip right through it and if you're
not being sexual and you're not leading and you're not
closing hard and you have bad text game again for
other gaping holes in your net so if you've got
all these holes no wonder you don't have a girlfriend
now if you get all these holes plugged by working
on yourself then you'll have a very solid net and
you'll be catching lots of girls in that net and
you'll select the one that you really want so that
is the approach that I recommend if you use the
rod and reel method then you're going to be in
a world of pain and disappointment and you are not
going to get the best kind of girl that you
could get if you did it the other way around
so think about that think about making that paradigm shift
it's pretty important the last point that I'm that I'm
going to say is that you know if you've had
a lot of holes in your net just admit that
you do and it's okay just admit that you're not
good with girls right now and use that as fuel
to motivate you in this journey of learning how to
get better with girls let me tell you when you
get better with girls and you get on this path
of getting better with girls but also personal development it's
one of the most rewarding journeys that you'll ever go
on in your life you will not regret it it's
going to be challenging but it's going to be extremely
rewarding I've gotten some of the biggest personal development growth
in my life from from doing this so women are
a really great way for a man to really become
a man so don't shy away from from learning this
stuff it's very important especially if you're young and you've
got a lot of years ahead of you you know
you're going to be feeling that pain for a long
time if you don't fix this and lastly is you
know commit to being patient with this process you're not
going to get good with girls if you suck you're
not going to get good just in a week or
in month or even in a year it's going to
take multiple years to do this and you know what
this is okay because you're going to be baby stepping
your way up and up and up and you're gonna
be learning and learning and getting better and better and
better and most of the payoff are going to be
at the end at the beginning it's going to be
a big struggle but the end you're gonna have massive
massive payoff so it's very very worth it but you
have to see the long-term vision for yourself you have
to be patient don't say that you're gonna get a
girlfriend in one weekend that's not very realistic and even
if you do you haven't really improved yourself you haven't
really fixed your net so you just got lucky if
you did and that's not the right way to really
solve this problem permanently all right so this is Leah
