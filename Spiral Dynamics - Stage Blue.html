[Music] you welcome to the beginning of this multi-part series
about spiral dynamics this is gonna be at least six
parts and I want to focus each part on every
single stage of the spiral dynamics model so we're gonna
have a part on blue that's what we have today
we're gonna have an episode on orange on green on
yellow on turquoise and finally towards the end we're gonna
have an episode about red the reason I'm leaving red
towards the end is because it's less relevant to you
guys to most people because most people aren't evolved beyond
red and if you're wondering why I'm not covering beige
and purple which come before red the reason I'm not
covering those stages is because those are very rudimentary and
primitive and I don't think it's gonna be worth your
time to to have entire episodes about those but as
far as blue orange green yellow and turquoise it is
worth your time to have episodes about these now you
might wonder ilio you talked about spiral dynamics in the
past in fact I have a whole 90-minute episode called
the ultimate model of human development or human consciousness I
forget exactly how I titled it you can search for
that on youtube or on my website and that's a
great episode it covers the entire spiral all these stages
it tells you everything about them but still there's only
so much we can cram into ninety minutes and I
went back and I started just to study spiral dynamics
this model for my own benefit for myself taking a
lot of notes on it and I saw just how
much richness and depth and value there is here by
studying this model my understanding of mankind civilization politics has
has just become extraordinary it's so easy to see all
the problems that are happening all around the world and
also within myself and where I fit within the spiral
so that's been very valuable so I felt like it
would be a good idea to help you to extract
that kind of value out of this model because I
think that most people still don't really see the power
of spiral dynamics what is spiral dynamics I might sound
complicated and it sort of is but also it's not
that complicated spiral dynamics is a model developed by dawn
Beck and Christopher Cohen based on the work of a
professor by the name of graves and he developed a
psychological model with these different colored stages which represent the
evolution of human consciousness both individually and collectively across all
of human history and it ends up being a pretty
damn accurate model now of course it's just a model
it's not perfect it doesn't fit everything that happens in
the world and it doesn't account for every single thing
that happens in your life it's a model but as
far as models go it's you'll be shocked you'll be
shocked at how accurate and useful this model can be
so just in a brief nutshell what spiral dynamics is
telling us is that there are these discrete stages that
the human mind passes through and because our civilizations and
our societies are developed out of individual human minds that's
how they come about where is society taking place but
inside the human mind if you think about it what
structures society what governs politics what governs culture and religion
and science and innovation all this stuff it's ultimately the
values and the worldview that is inside of individual minds
and because humans are very hive like be like ant
like creatures we develop these complicated societies but really they're
not as complicated as we think a society tends to
be at a certain level of psychological and spiritual development
and so that's what this model tracks that's extremely useful
because guess what you are part and parcel of your
society and your culture and your religion and your science
and whatever other stuff you buy into and believe in
media entertainment education all of this what is all of
this is as part of society you have been programmed
with whatever is the predominant set of values and worldviews
that your society in stay and age has you see
so wouldn't it be useful to understand how this develops
and evolves over time not just in your society but
all around the world across all sorts of societies going
back thousands of years so that you can see where
you fit into the bigger picture and also you can
see where you're stuck and where you need to go
and you can also see why other people are stuck
at lower levels of development and you can see what
their problems are and if you want you can help
them to evolve as well that might be very useful
you see so this model is both useful individually for
your own self-actualization and spiritual development but it's also perhaps
even more useful collectively to understand what the hell is
going on in the world we have a lot of
crazy stuff happening in our politics these days crazy stuff
happening with with with religion and spirituality and economics and
culture Wars all of this sort of stuff how do
you make sense of it there's so much confusion these
days and people are just so unconscious about it and
they just bicker back and forth and fight with each
other talk across each other don't understand each other and
then what you have is you have this sort of
polarization and nothing really works and everybody sort of agitated
and bitter at somebody and they don't see the bigger
picture with this bigger picture you're gonna understand everything you're
gonna be shocked at how much you understand so what
Spile dynamics really is is it's it's these stages the
first stage is beige then purple then red blue orange
green yellow and turquoise each of these colors these colors
are just arbitrary they don't really mean anything per se
other than just as a label for a set of
values so well spiral dynamics tells us is that you
are at one of these stages and you must move
to the next highest stage without really skipping over anything
and so you've got to move so if you're at
red then you got to go to blue then you're
gonna go to orange then to green then to yellow
then turquoise now most people usually after they become adults
they get stuck at one of these stages forever in
their life because they don't understand that this model exists
they don't have enough perspective to see that there's something
higher that they can evolve to and there's also all
sorts of traps that come with navigating this spiral all
sorts of obstacles to the ego from moving up to
the next stage and so we'll be talking of course
about those to help you to to get higher so
fundamentally what spa dynamics is is its its its modeling
sets of values and cultural memes which govern your life
individually and collectively why is spiral dynamics important well I
think I already answered that because it gives you a
roadmap to see where you need to go what's preventing
you from getting there and it helps you to understand
and to tolerate the ignorant and lack of development of
people below you on the spiral and that becomes very
important because otherwise you're gonna get stuck criticizing those people
who are less evolved than you but you yourself are
gonna be wasting time because while you're criticizing others you're
not evolving yourself what we're gonna cover in these episodes
each episode is going to focus on a particular color
or stage so this one is going to be about
stage blue the next one's gonna be about stage orange
and so forth in each episode we're gonna cover the
same sorts of topics we're going to talk about the
set of values that define this stage we're going to
talk about a long list of characteristics that define this
stage so you got a real good sense of what
the essence of this stage is we're gonna talk about
when the stage emerges wide emergence what are the forces
that cause it to emerge and then what are the
forces that cause it to to dissipate and ultimately die
off and evolve into the next stage so there's a
set of circumstances that causes blue to come forward it
has utility then that utility is exhausted it sort of
peak and then it starts to die off but then
the next stage comes and evolves we're gonna also cover
tons of examples dozens maybe even hundreds of examples that
I've compiled I spent a lot of time compiling examples
of each stage which are going to be very useful
for you because it's through these examples that you really
understand what these stages are and it's also gonna explain
a lot of stuff in the world that you probably
don't presently understand or that you misunderstand we're gonna talk
about trigger points what triggers each stage and there's a
specific set of lists of items that trigger each day
that spent a lot of time thinking about what the
trigger points are and perhaps most importantly were gonna talk
about what it takes to transcend each particular stage and
I spent a lot of time compiling lists and brainstorming
ways what are the specific techniques and methods you could
use to actually transcend stage blue into orange and then
orange into into green and the green to yellow and
so forth so that's going to be like the the
application of spiral dynamics in your life now I want
to make sure to give credit here to the originators
of this model because certainly a lot of the ideas
that'll be sharing here I ripped out of books just
straight out of their books I ripped out of their
websites I ripped out of their their graphs and their
and their their charts so credit goes to clare graves
dawn Beck Christopher Colin and this website that I relied
heavily on called spiral dynamics integral dot and L for
Netherlands now let's move into talking about stage blue what
is the essence of stage blue if you want to
give it a title we could call it absolutist conformist
rule and the rise of civilization blue is absolute belief
in one right way and obedience to authority which was
the driving force behind the right of the rise of
civilizations if you think back to ancient Mesopotamia ancient Egypt
ancient Greece ancient Rome what was going on there in
world history and of course we shouldn't forget the east
you know the rise of of ancient China with the
the empires there and the rise of empires in India
right and then even in the Middle East a little
bit later you had the rise of empires so what
was going on there before mankind was living well very
long before in small tribes but that nice tribe started
to accumulate and they started to become bigger and that
was the development of stage red stage red is a
very sort of totalitarian high sort of like tribal like
alpha male leader of the Wolfpack sort of style of
government and social organization so that of course has its
limitations and problems which lead to the rise of blue
because you can't really build a large well-functioning civilization like
the Roman Empire just purely based upon one tribal leader
dominating everybody see to have the rise of civilizations you
need to develop a set of organizing principles for that
society people have to be under the same sort of
programming mental programming so that they're all on board with
the same sort of purpose and they all have to
conform to a certain set of rules and laws so
really civilization is all about taking a tribe of barbarians
and then giving them a bunch of laws and codes
which are enforced by police and legal system court system
all the sorts of stuff so now you're developing a
well-functioning bureaucratic civilization so it's highly bureaucratic and of course
to do this what you need is you need the
development of writing which is what led to the to
the rise of these giant civilizations you couldn't do that
before you had writing because you need to keep accounts
you need to take taxes you need to keep Ledger's
and and you need to you need to be able
to write down names of all your bureaucrats and you
need to have a postal system you need to have
roads interconnecting uh so you're you're basically creating a rudimentary
network it was sort of the rise of the Internet
the early internet that allowed these civilizations to develop and
now that wasn't that wasn't our internet that was the
Internet of 2000 years ago through writing and through these
networks of of roads and trade routes and and laws
and all the institutions that enforce those stage Bleu relies
very heavily on belief in some sort of higher authority
a God and this God is usually a father figure
a stern father figure who lays down the rule of
law and if you cross him he will punish you
he's not a forgiving lenient God he is like that
hard-ass dad stepdad who will beat you if you do
something even a little bit wrong it's like that that's
the essence of blue now as I'm going to be
telling you all sorts of lists and characteristics and values
I want you to be careful about judging this stage
try to look at every stage we'll be talking about
as objectively as possible without saying oh this is bad
and evil and this this one is good it's not
about good and evil it's about just what is necessary
for humans to survive so be careful about these judgments
you might say oh well I don't believe in God
and so this stage is false or you might say
Oh leo but these civilizations they were so cruel and
they had slavery and all this and that means that
they were bad no don't make these judgments yes that's
technically true but we'll get to that we'll talk about
the dot the downsides of of these stages at the
very end another s essential feature of stage Bleu is
that it's collectivist and individualistic so every stage on the
spiral is even is either gonna lean more collectivist or
more individualistic the collectivist stages are going to emphasize sacrificing
of the self for some higher cause or organization or
in this case the civilization whereas the individualistic leaning colors
and stages here they're going to emphasize more the development
of the self rather than the collective and the group
so what happens is that each stage sort of alternates
where you have blue which is collectivist then it shifts
to orange which is more individualistic than orange shifts back
to green which is more collectivist and then that shows
back to yellow which is more individualistic and so on
it goes so it's a sort of oscillating swinging back
and forth pendulum kind of deal but the essence of
blue is that you're sacrificing yourself for your particular civilization
in the hopes of getting a deferred reward oftentimes in
the afterlife so there's a strong emphasis on religion and
the afterlife now let's give you a list of all
the values of stage blue and this don't underestimate the
power of this list these key words that I'm about
to give you if you if you take a stage
blue person and you talk at him with these key
words you are gonna become his best friend you are
gonna resonate with all the deepest stuff that he believes
believes and that's what values are all about that's why
values are so important and each stage has its own
unique set of values so if you have a sneaky
manipulative politician he could literally take all the key words
in this list and go with a bullhorn to a
rally a political rally and say these key words and
if the key words are properly aligned with the members
of his audience let's say the members of his audience
are stage blue then he will win their undying support
because he will tell them precisely what they believe in
and what they want to hear and of course this
can be a very dangerous thing because it creates a
sort of echo chamber because people aren't looking for a
new set of values most people are just blindly looking
to reinforce their existing set of values without thinking in
an objective manner about the limitations of their existing set
of values so here we go and before I even
tell you that one more one more comment I don't
know what stage you're at most of you who are
watching videos for me just to even watch my videos
you already have to be probably at stage at least
a high orange green maybe yellow a stage blue person
probably isn't watching one of my videos so when you
hear these words they may not resonate with you these
these value key words but when I talk about your
stage so if your as stage yellow and I'm gonna
be talking about stage yellow in the next two episodes
all the key words I'm gonna say they're gonna completely
resonate with you and you're gonna be saying like yes
yes yes this is Leo that's perfect that's exactly what's
what's right that's exactly what we should be doing in
the world so I want you to notice that and
if you are at stage blue then everything I'm about
to say is gonna resonate with you completely but on
the other hand if you're not at stage blue if
you're at stage yellow a lot of the things I'm
gonna say right now are not gonna resonate with you
at all and it's not gonna make much sense to
you you have to get good at being able to
look at the world from the perspective of the stage
that we're talking about and not from your perspective that's
very important to be able to jump between perspectives and
that's actually not an ability that you develop very well
until you're all the way at stage yellow which is
why it's so challenging to to address these issues at
the lower stages so anyways here's the list of blue
values absolute truth and ideology these things are important to
stage blue people they believe in an absolute truth it's
unquestionable they have complete faith in this blind faith and
for them the word ideology is not a dirty word
that's their whole life is is grounded within ideology that's
a good thing because they believe their ideology is right
there's no doubt that their ideology could be mistaken there's
no room for other ideologies there is only one ideology
my ideology and it's the correct ideology how else could
it be belief faith and certainty are another set of
values there's a sense of clear right and wrong four-stage
blue stage blue values hardwork discipline and duty they also
value law and order those are some key words for
you they value justice because justice goes hand in hand
with the enforcement of the rules of my civilization and
see stage blue is not about civilization in the abstract
they don't just want to civilize the whole world they
want their civilization my civilization is the only right civilization
and if you disobey my civilization you deserve punishment you're
a sinner they value hierarchy social order and the status
quo there's no need to innovate or to be progressive
this is a dirty word for someone who's at stage
blue the status quo our traditions the way it's been
for for hundreds of years the way our ancestors did
it that's the way we got to do it and
that's the way our children got to do it why
reinvent the wheel when it already worked so well that's
how they think stage blue values patriarchy women are there
to serve men men are the enforcers they do all
the work and women get the benefits of that and
they raise the children and women are never allowed to
be priests or rabbis they're never really given any power
they're not on the same footing as men and that's
not a problem that's not bad that is the hierarchy
that's what keeps our civilization running if we take this
away our entire civilization is going to collapse that's how
stage Bleu meaning and greater purpose our values for stage
blue blues greater purpose is not selfish it's not to
advance himself and to earn millions of dollars it's to
be a good citizen it's to follow the rules it's
to be a good Christian or a good Muslim or
a good Hindu it's to raise his family or it's
to be a good wife and ultimately it's to serve
the Lord serve God that's what it's all about that's
the purpose of civilization that's the purpose of individual lives
morality is huge for stage blue these are the moralists
they have a strong sense of morality a strong sense
of right and wrong and if anyone breaks this morality
they deserve justice because they're a sinner and of course
my morality is the only right morality morality is not
some relativistic cultural norm morality is absolute God laid down
the Ten Commandments or Allah and Muhammad laid down the
rules and we got to follow those rules to the
tee and the better I can follow those rules the
better citizen I am the better human I am the
better my rewards will be in the afterlife stage blue
values very highly culture tradition and heritage these are sacred
to them so they are very sensitive to being attacked
on cultural grounds they don't want culture to change culture
is good in fact we need to defend our culture
preserve our heritage against the heretics stage blue values crusading
for a righteous cause stage blue values serving God stage
blue values theology and doctrine orthodoxy Dogma and conformity these
are not bad words these are all good because when
you believe in in an absolute truth and you think
you have the absolute truth and that the absolute truth
has been written down in a book because that's what
stage Bleu believes it's been written down in a book
then conforming to the absolute truth is is the best
way to live your life why would you do at
any deviations from the absolute truth as written down in
scriptures is is corruption and failure staged blue values family
very highly these are the people on TV you see
who talk about Family Values they also value obedience and
reverence respect for your elders they value God and country
patriotism these are the red-blooded Patriots our country is the
best country and there's no question about that it's always
been the best it will always be the best and
that's why I've got to defend it because it's the
best they value also righteous living you live your life
according to principles you have a strong moral code of
conduct you have a sense of honor and you don't
why your honor besmirched your reputation is important to you
your reputation within your community such people value good manners
decency and etiquette proper dress maybe uniforms or maybe certain
hairstyles hair regulations they find profanity offensive and they're sensitive
to blasphemy don't speak down to Authority don't speak down
to God he is your authority you need to submit
to him blue values prayer you pray to God for
the things that you need Blue has a pride in
one civilization that's what makes them a patriot blue values
canonical texts like the Bible the Quran the Torah the
Gita the Constitution the Upanishads the Vedas these are the
founding documents of that culture and that civilization and blue
believes that you can write down the absolute truth in
a book you can memorize it as a prayer or
you can memorize it as an oath pledges and allegiances
are important to blue ritual and ceremony are important to
blue Blue is very eager to obey Authority so whether
it's the Pope or Mohammed or Allah or the Christian
God or Christ or the Buddha or Confucius or the
Emperor there is some authority figure who has defined rule
or like the Pharaohs for example would be would be
perfect examples the authority oftentimes isn't merely just an authority
he has divine status he's a divine monarch and he's
treated like God because God bestowed him with powers to
run this civilization blue values the afterlife heaven hell and
salvation these things are very real to blue these aren't
just ideas these aren't just myths this is their reality
this life is really just serving your afterlife blue also
values strict church attendance every Sunday or whichever day of
the week values ceremony and ritual values sobriety chastity anal
self-control and the restraint of passion you see because what
gets in the way of of this well-functioning well-oiled civilization
machine that blue is constructing it's the passions and the
emotions it's letting your ego become wild it's letting sex
run free none of this stuff is allowed so we
have to practice very stern self control even though we
have these these emotions and passions within us we have
to suppress them we have to suppress our sexual urges
blue values charity giving back to his community blue values
loyalty and he hates traitors because a traitor is someone
who is betraying the absolute truth and the building of
this grand civilization blue values borders borders with their neighbours
and blue values building moral fiber and character character is
important integrity is important to blue so when does blue
emerge blue emerges from red like I said it emerges
from red when the limitations of red become too obvious
what are the limitations of red red is very egocentric
selfish and impulsive and it lacks discipline and it lacks
hierarchy and structure so of course there's only so much
of a civilization or society you can build with this
sort of impulsive lack of disciplined approach it doesn't work
at a large scale with tens of thousands of people
so then blue comes in and reacts against that and
says ok we got it now get really disciplined we
got to control our passions we can't just be selfish
we have to sacrifice for our civilization and so structure
structures are put in place to to enforce this discipline
rules and laws are laid down also in red you
have abuse of personal power which need to be put
in check in order for a civilization to run you
can't just have a bloodthirsty dictator running a big civilization
it actually doesn't work so your leaders even though they
can be monarchs they can't just be complete ruthless thugs
they can't just be a Caligula type of person because
you need discipline and so what blue values is not
just a monarchical leader but it's sort of like the
epitome of a good monarch in blues eyes would be
someone who has perfect self-control perfect restraint and control over
his passions who's like very anal very retentive type of
person not not overly give it into his cravings and
and lust for sex and for food and all this
but someone who's just like very straight-laced like you would
imagine the perfect bureaucrat that would be their ultimate ideal
for who should run the civilization also blue emerges because
with red red is so selfish that it has no
higher purpose mmm red doesn't submit to any God but
blue now develops a belief in a monotheistic God usually
mm-hmm and from that is derived all the higher meaning
and purpose of life also the limitations of red become
very obvious with war and violence so with red comes
chaos comes warlords lawlessness and just thievery rape and pillage
so blue is not about any of that blue is
is reacting against that with all this discipline all this
hierarchy he wants civilization so that's when blue emerges now
the thing with blue is that if you are born
into a strongly blue civilization then you are not going
to notice blue emerging you're gonna be just indoctrinated into
blue because blue is all about the one absolute right
truth and doctrine and scripture so you're just gonna be
indoctrinated into blue values from birth so much that is
gonna be a complete brainwashing you're not gonna know that
you're within blue you're not gonna know or feel that
you've been indoctrinated it's just gonna be the truth this
is going to be your reality and most likely it
will be until you die that's if you're in a
very strongly blue civilization now of course there's degrees of
blueness it starts off with how you might imagine maybe
medieval Europe was a thousand years ago you know very
very strongly blue but then the blue it starts to
grow more and more into orange and orange is more
individualistic it's more materialistic so if you're gonna have gradations
of it we're at first so you're really indoctrinated into
blue but then the indoctrination you start to see the
limits of indoctrination it starts to crumble and dissolve a
little bit then once you get into orange there's not
so much of a strong indoctrination although orange has its
own version of indoctrination but so it kind of depends
what society you're in certain societies are very strongly blue
other societies are sort of half blue half orange other
societies are all orange very little blue so it's going
to depend but if you're in a strongly blue society
watch out for that a doctrine ation it's gonna get
you alright let's talk about now some of the characteristics
of blue four blue life has meaning direction and purpose
with predetermined outcomes if you do these things you will
get these results and if you do these other things
you will get these other results blue is always searching
for order security and stability blue is organizing managing trying
to be concrete and develop structures blue is dedicated responsible
and meticulous attention to detail the perfect bureaucrat blue is
trustworthy predictable and loyal he is engaged in righteous stable
living obedience is enforced through a sense of duty and
guilt guilt is very big for blue impulsivity is controlled
through guilt so why do you not have sex because
you're gonna feel guilty afterwards because you know that you've
sinned why you're not gonna go out and party because
again that goes against the Scriptures the strict scriptures of
the Lord and then you're gonna feel guilty because you
think you're a sinner because you've been programmed with this
condition with this with this belief that if you don't
obey the rules then you're a sinner and you're evil
and you're bad blue is engaged in purging of impure
thoughts because of course blue has lots of impure thoughts
he's tempted by the devil but he knows that the
devil must be resisted to blue the devil is not
a metaphorical symbol to blue the devil is real the
devil is tempting him to stray from the path of
God and so blue tries really hard to resist the
devil and that's usually all his emotions and passions and
temptations that's why he's so anal and strict and disciplinarian
the blue is all about surrendering worldly pleasures for a
higher calling for the afterlife - blue everybody has their
proper place and civilization there's often caste systems within blue
societies and you do not question the caste system the
caste system is not a problem the caste system is
good that is the hierarchy and we are here to
defend the hierarchy we're not here to reinvent the hierarchy
and make life better for other people that's not what
blue cares about - blue the hierarchy has been handed
down by God it's our tradition our heritage so we
don't question any of that to blue the existing order
is good so it must be reinforced to blue codes
of conduct are based on an eternal order within the
cosmos the entire cosmos revolves around man and not just
man but my race and my civilization God has designed
the entire universe for my civilization to be at the
top to rule everybody including all the animals all the
lesser races all the minorities all the women and all
the children this is patriarchy you are patriarchal rule blue
never questions authority elders or teachers because they are carriers
of the truth blue loves laws regulations and discipline building
character blue enforces laws and order because otherwise we will
get chaos and anarchy blue is reacting against chaos and
anarchy blue sees himself as bringing order to the chaos
so blue sees himself as civilizing the heathens the pagans
the barbarians and the savages those are not at the
same level as he is they're all below him blues
the rise of civilization the rise of cities the rise
of empires the rise of laws of codes of law
and of monotheism for blue reality is strictly objective blue
has high rigidity low open-mindedness and high dogma right and
wrong are absolute they are not social constructs cultural traditions
and values are also absolutes they are not social constructs
they are not arbitrary for blue blue sees the world
very much in black and white it's clear what's right
it's clear what's wrong it's clear what's good it's clear
what's evil and blue has a very strong sense of
objective good and evil and he will call out the
evildoers and the sinners for blue knowledge is set down
in enduring form on stone tablets and scriptures which are
revered and placed into temples and preserved for hundreds of
years and they are worshipped blue takes a very strict
and literal approach to the interpretation of religious texts blue
almost always has a holy book or holy scripture like
the Bible to Torah the Koran the Vedas the Gita
and there is only one interpretation the literal interpretation so
if the Bible says that you need to stone homosexuals
that's exactly what they deserve because that's the Word of
God and if the Bible says that the earth is
5,000 years old that's precisely how old it is because
that's the most literal interpretation there are no fuzzy interpretations
there are no multiple interpretations you don't have one scholar
saying this and those gone no it's just black and
white there's no room for variance in interpretation there's no
metaphors it literally happened Jesus was literally born to a
virgin that's not a metaphor that literally happened blue defense
doctrine against heresy and corruption because blue thinks that his
Bible or his worldview is the absolute that means any
deviation from that is gonna be a corrupt influence of
the devil and so of course the enemy of blue
is the devil so he's always fighting against the devil
and of course that means he has to look out
for heretics the heretics are those who try to make
clever interpretations of the Bible non literal interpretations blue is
really just a congregation of believers that's what the civilization
or society is about blue invokes almost always in a
anthropomorphic father figure God God is not pantheistic God is
not disembodied God is a bearded man in the clouds
just like it's depicted in our books just like it's
depicted in the Sistine Chapel in our temples God is
a human because I'm human so of course I am
made in the image of God blugh believes that there
is a higher power and that this higher power wants
us to win God is interested in the survival of
my team of my culture and my civilization God is
on my side God is blessing my war my holy
war has been blessed by God and ultimate judgment awaits
to those who do not obey God rewards will come
to the faithful and justice will come to the wicked
the rewards will be sweet and heavenly and the punishments
to the wicked will be hellish so we have the
notions of heaven and hell and heaven in hell of
course to blue they're not metaphors they're not stories and
myths they're not parables to teach you morals they are
literally there you're either gonna go to heaven or you're
gonna go to hell and if you go to hell
you're gonna be stuck with pitchforks for eternity that's literally
going to happen in blues opinion blue is sacrificing himself
for his civilization and for God blue believes that evil
must be stamped out because ultimately God is in a
battle against the devil that's the higher game being played
here blue is careful not to be a sinner and
blue is extremely judgmental of sinners very very judgemental sinners
must be punished they must be called out as evildoers
and they must be exterminated without compassion because they are
Devils they are servants of the devil literally blue is
all about the rightful exercise of just authority and how
do you know that authority is just because that's whoever
is the leader of our civilization and ultimately he's a
servant of God so the reason you know that your
authority is just and the reason why your war is
holy is because ultimately it's all happening in the name
of God so the Crusades for example are good and
we need to crusade for goodness all around the world
and of course we to spread the word of God
and the might of our civilization all around the world
we need to civilize all those barbarians and heathens who
haven't awoken to the one true faith blue rejects multiculturalism
there's no such notion it's like oh that culture is
is just as good as my culture no my culture
is obviously the best culture other cultures and peoples are
inferior they're not just different they're inferior they're lower on
God's ultimate hierarchy and whatever gods those other people believe
in those are false gods that's idol worship and so
we need to destroy their holy books need to destroy
all their statues and images of all their false gods
because obviously that's devil worship in blues eyes in blues
eyes foreigners animals and plants and mother nature largely exists
to serve blue to serve mankind to serve this one
true civilization so they can all be exploited blue fears
excommunication because his whole sense of purpose and meaning is
being part of this community so if he's kicked out
of this community he's excommunicated from his church that's gonna
be like a life and death situation for for blue
blue believes in rules rights and duties to him these
are very significant and blue is all about building empires
and kingdoms that's what this whole set of values and
characteristics is ultimately kind of geared towards all right so
let's get to some examples of blue I got a
lot of examples I'm going to run through them really
quickly here and of course with some of these examples
I'm over generalizing you understand that I'm sort of taking
blue and I'm distilling it down to its essence so
not always will blue be a hundred percent blue cranked
up you know to the maximum it could be 50
percent blue 75% blue you know blue can have different
intensities you could have a very deep dark color blue
or you could have a kind of a light pale
blue and that of course depends kind of where where
you and your civilization your culture are in their evolutionary
arc so here's some examples of blue the Middle East
today although there's also a lot of orange in the
Middle East these days but still many elements of the
Middle East many countries or many segments of those countries
are still heavily heavily blue they're very kind of traditional
Palestinians Zionists Saudi Arabia is a good example of blue
although also in Saudi Arabia you see some some emergence
of orange a sort of a business culture and it's
interesting to see how the blue and the orange are
kind of like it's in a transition phase you can
actually see Saudi Arabia going through this transition where it
was very strongly blue let's say fifty or hundred years
ago and now it's becoming more and more orange and
some of the reforms that are happening now in Saudi
Arabia like this year they're allowing women for the first
time ever in their history to actually get driver's licenses
and drive cars so that's blue involves starting to evolve
into Orange although there's still many segments within Saudi Arabia
who believe that now of course this is a corruption
see the way they see that they say all women
are driving no that's the work of the devil you're
disturbing our status quo so of course they are going
to fight against that because they see it as a
corruption medieval Europe is a really good prototypical example of
blue elements within Iran Pakistan the Indian caste system Puritanism
Confucian China Islamic fundamentalism mohab ism Hasidic judah's Judaism the
Salvation Army patriotism standing up for the national anthem what
is that brouhaha all about that's pure blue blue wants
to defend the national anthem Zen monasteries are very heavily
blue Catholic Church evangelicals the religious right wing in America
conservatives Republicans tend to skew heavily blue the Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts Sharia law banning birth control banning abortion
banning flag burning these are all blue style moves building
border walls that's a blue move anti-immigration witch trials Crusades
Roy Moore is a really good example of someone who's
stuck in in stage blue he actually got he was
a judge he got kicked out of his judgeship because
he wanted to post the Ten Commandments on on the
wall in the courthouse or in his office I never
get exactly where so if you notice what was happening
with the Roy Moore brouhaha earlier this year or last
year it was you see that that that's a battle
with stage stage blue right there the all right skews
heavily blue neo-nazis white supremacist KKK what is this this
is heavily staged blue Noah's Ark when lead when red
literally that sage blue the Ten Commandments a stage blue
uniforms Catholic nuns the Amish the shakers the Bible Belt
in America the moral majority Newt Gingrich Bill O'Reilly Billy
Graham the Reverend Jerry Falwell James Dobson Pat Robertson George
W Bush Mike so Mike Pence is a really good
example of stage blue you can see it even in
his body posture the way he holds himself this sort
of anal-retentive a disciplinarian manner in which he carries himself
just prototypical stage blue gate conversion therapy that's a stage
blue initiative kamikaze pilots the samurai code harakiri cutting your
stomach open out of Honor the way the Japanese samurai
did the marathon monks of Mount Hiei which I talked
about they're very big into discipline Hindu religion Hindu family
the Islamic family it's very blue Mormons tend to skew
very blue creationism of course is a is a blue
creation the war on Christmas that the Conservatives are always
railing about that's a blue thing Glenn Beck Rush Limbaugh
Alex Jones Bill O'Reilly these sort of talk show conservative
speakers who are always ranting about the degradation of culture
and the corruption of the moral fabric of America the
sort of stuff this is pure blue fox news is
your blue second amendment mandatory military service codes of Honor
virginity pledges nationalism Victorian England military families oftentimes police officers
and firefighters and blue-collar workers tend to skew heavily blue
did they have to be very kind of traditionalist and
they have a strong sense of of justice and authority
Nazi managers and generals or very blue have you watched
the movie Starship Troopers the ethos behind Starship Troopers is
very blue religious terrorism happens when blue goes to its
most extreme excesses the Spanish Inquisition is blue Tyrael ISM
missionaries Spanish conquistadors Magellan the Hari Krishna's when a soldier
jumps on a grenade that's a very blue move take
one for the team theocracy is blue prayer in school
communist China the colonial South Imperial Japan patriarchy culture Warriors
TV of Evangelicals Bible school colonial duels like in the
South when people used to duel each other out of
a sense of honour malice China 20th century Marxism holy
war battles over holy ground like you see happening in
in Israel grand cathedrals and temples and mosques these are
creations of blue protecting the children from Sexual corruption or
moral corruption preventing children for example from wearing makeup that's
a blue move killing apostates is the blue move imprisoning
homosexual unequal women's rights prayer in school the sanctity of
marriage the Japanese tea ceremony these are all examples of
blue here are some statistics about blue which are interesting
about 40 percent of the adult global population is blue
and about 30% of the total influenced cultural and social
influence in the world is dominated by blue so it's
a pretty large chunk of the world population still if
you live in a Western democracy like in Europe or
in America and you're relatively well-educated then you have a
tendency of under estimating how blue the world is you
might even have a tendency of under estimating how blue
your country is like if you live in New York
or in California then you have a hard time understanding
just how blue middle america is rural america and of
course don't confuse this with the color blue for democrats
now but this is what you see when you look
at the political map you see that the the east
and west coast of the united states is is heavily
democratic and in the middle of the country is pretty
much all republican and conservative and then the east and
west coast can't fathom why is the middle of the
country so backwards it's not per se that they're backwards
it's just that you haven't really fathom how much of
the world is still at this stage of evolution in
their consciousness and in their psyche where they are deeply
blue the style of government that comes with blue thinking
is authority structures order driven hmm hierarchies theocracies and empires
what triggers blue what pushes blues buttons well this is
very easy it's very easy to trigger blue in fact
it's pretty much easy to treat her almost every single
stage if you know what their trigger points are which
I will tell you right now we have to be
careful promise not to abuse this these trigger points I'm
telling you so that you can become conscious of how
you yourself become triggered not so that you can weaponize
these and go attack blue people attacking their weaknesses all
right so let's out for that in a in a
nutshell what triggers blue is stage red stage orange stage
green and stage yellow it's basically all the surrounding stages
that are not blue which are triggering blue and you'll
have a better sense of that once you watch my
future episodes about the other stages relativism and not knowing
uncertainty really triggers blue atheism secular and skepticism really triggers
blue because it goes against the heart the heart of
their whole philosophy which is a absolute truth calls that
into question calls all their ideologies into question for blue
this is deeply disturbing and unsettling it's threatening to them
it's an existential threat to them you're not just playing
with ideas you're playing with their whole sense of reality
which is why they will resist you oftentimes to the
death also they are triggered by intellectuals academic elites and
post-modernism you want a really triggered blue start talking to
him about Jacques Derrida you're gonna drive them up the
[ __ ] wall blue is triggered by Obama Barack
Obama why did the Republicans and conservatives so dislike Obama
why did the Christian evangelicals so dislike Obama because Obama
in their mind represents this sort of intellectual overly academic
overly strategic sort of philosophical relativistic complex thinking kind of
like worldly individual who actually is multicultural cares about different
cultures cares about considering values of different societies like no
for blue this is this is treason Obama is a
traitor to them that's why they don't like him fundamentally
it doesn't matter what Obama does it's the fact that
what he represents is he represents the sort of gray
scale complex thinking and diplomacy around the world which is
anathema to blue blues thinking is black and white thinking
it's patriotism and Obama wasn't a blind Patriot Obama was
deferential to different cultures and different needs of different nations
and so he says he's sort of a complex strategic
negotiator this does not flow I in blue that makes
them seem soft it makes him seem like a socialist
and makes him seem like a like a European because
really Obama was sort of in the green stage and
so blue is reacting really heavily against green and that's
generally what's happening within American culture and politics right now
is you see a clash between blue and green and
between orange and green and people are really resisting green
and of course they're gonna resist the idea that they're
resistant Green because what I'm saying here makes it sound
as though Obama is above Green is above blue and
it's true it is above but you have to be
careful not to think of it as like better than
it's not better than it's just evolution you know it's
not like the dinosaurs were worse than today's Birds evolution
is not about being better or worse than previous species
it's about how well do you fit into your environment
and your environments always changing and also it's um you
can't judge it too much because the way evolution works
that you have to go through the intermediary steps to
get to the next level steps you can't just skip
around so you can't really blame blue for being blue
and you can't blame green for being green because they
have to be that way because that's how life unfolds
what else triggers blue space cadets philosophers and free thinkers
hippies free sex drugs rock and roll rap music materialism
hedonism and unabashed sinning so those people who just kind
of go around and you know they they're gluttons they
just indulge themselves with sex and food and and money
and wealth this this is gonna or blue because blue
wants to sacrifice that for the greater civilization that's blue
reacting against orange moral corruption triggers blue change to the
traditional status quo triggers blue changing things just for the
sake of changing things progressivism this triggers blue lawlessness chaos
disorder and anarchy triggers blue when people are breaking the
rules that triggers blue when justice is not served to
the sinners when sinners get away with their sins that
really triggers blue lack of hierarchy triggers blue terrorism triggers
blue because terrorism represents sort of the pinnacle of chaos
and disorder and anarchy and the devil because terrorism really
stems kind of from from from either very low blue
or kind of a high orange but that not high
orange but a high red a high red stage multiculturalism
and globalism trigger blue excessive selfishness and egotism people who
are not willing to sacrifice for the team or for
one civilization that triggers blue disrespect for the status quo
like disrespecting the flag breaking agreements and disloyalty to their
civilization that's huge blue is very sensitive to traitors and
a traitor is basically anyone who betrays the culture that
blue was indoctrinated into blue is triggered by questioning of
existing orthodoxy so when someone opens a Bible and starts
to say oh let's let's think about how we could
reinterpret the Bible in different ways for modern times that
totally triggers blue because to blue there's no such thing
as reinterpreting the Bible for modern times blue doesn't really
believe in evolution for blue reality is stat the truth
is static it's clear it's black and white so you
don't question orthodoxy you just follow it with discipline and
for the same reason blue is triggered by people who
question classic social roles so when stage green starts to
question gender roles racial roles the roles of females in
the household this sorts of stuff women in the workplace
this is all disturbing the applecart changing the status quo
trying to change the culture and blue perceived this as
an existential threat he sees this as corruption of the
culture not a progress not evolution but corruption Bleu is
triggered by heresy sacrilege and blasphemy so sometimes you will
see people under my video saying leo I love your
videos I love this let me talk about but I
wish you wouldn't say [ __ ] so much and
they get sort of offended by that so that's sort
of a blue a blue sensitivity because blue wants to
keep this sort of appearance of order and propriety and
kind of like honor and decency of course what actually
goes on behind the ski the the scenes in Blues
closet well that's often a different story blue is triggered
by science encroaching on religion for blue science is it's
okay it's tolerated but only so long as it doesn't
encroach upon religious territory when science starts to find contradictions
in the Bible or when science starts to dictate public
policy and when science is taught in school but prayer
is not allowed in school this really upsets blue because
in blues mind religion is the most important thing because
it's it's it's the closest thing to God the highest
authority figure and so science is kind of getting in
the way of that and so blue is very sensitive
to the sort of secularization of society which is happening
in America and all over the world these days let's
talk about some of the unhealthy manifestations and excesses of
blue so even though I said that blue is not
good or bad nor is any other stage what you
have to understand is that all of these stages can
be taken to their extremes and can become unhealthy and
toxic and dysfunctional because life is all about finding the
right balance and harmony and so when you go too
much into this direction of blue it can become very
dangerous and very toxic as as I'll mention here in
a minute but also you have to understand that just
because blue has all of these toxic elements does not
automatically mean that blue people are somehow automatically violent or
evil most people who are deeply blue are decent hard-working
loyal kind individuals most of the time but when it
gets excessive and you get a sort of mob mentality
and you have an entire civilization of blue and it
sort of creates this echo chamber then you can have
all sorts of nasty dangerous excesses so what are some
of those well ideology and radical fundamentalism this is a
hallmark of blue when it goes to its excess blue
becomes so sure and so right so certain of his
rightness that he's willing to kill and wage a holy
war to do that because when you really believe that
your God is the one true right god and that
you know his mind you can read his mind and
you know his divine plans and that you are now
an executor for his divine plans and you are literally
fighting the devil well this gives you the perfect system
justifications to commit all sorts of crews and evil while
at the same time deceiving yourself blue tends to be
very closed-minded rigid stubborn and unwilling to evolve even when
that evolution is necessary for blue to survive blue will
often resist evolving he will be hard and stricken inflexible
oftentimes blue will be unloving especially to those people who
are not within his encircle who are not part of
this tribe blue taken to its success traps the mind
in rigid intolerant belief systems belief is confused with the
truth blue people tend to be inside the box thinkers
so they get stuck within a paradigm and they cannot
see the world from any other perspective this becomes very
limiting becomes very difficult to grow blue is very prone
to mob mentality lynch mobs mobs with pitchforks blue is
unable to think about metaphysics which tends to be very
limiting especially when it comes to spirituality blue cannot really
experience true spirituality because blue is so wrapped up in
these rigid belief systems true spirituality is letting go of
all your beliefs and blue can't fathom that because Blue
has been indoctrinated usually very strongly from birth to a
point where it's it's beyond cure Blue is prone to
idol worship blue often worships the map rather than the
territory worships the statue worships the art in the Cathedral
worships the image of Jesus rather than the more abstract
values that Jesus taught for example blue is almost constantly
under the pressure of guilt because blue is constantly failing
to live up to his religious high principles and ideals
because the only way you can actually be truly religious
and live up to those ideals like the Buddha or
Jesus or Muhammad the only way you can do that
is actually by shedding your ego and getting rid of
all your beliefs but blue is not gonna do that
blue is trying to get to Buddha level through self-discipline
and following rules and beliefs and scriptures and this is
absolutely never going to work so what blue has to
do blue has to repress the fact that it's not
working and he has to guilt himself and he has
to always be walking around and telling himself how he's
a sinner and you know why am I so weak
why can't I be a better human being well the
reason you can't be a better human being cos you
have this massive massive ego with this very rigid ideology
which of course you're gonna do a lot of selfish
stuff you can't just overcome selfishness through lofty ideals and
principles that's oftentimes why blue comes off as very hypocritical
to the other stages like orange or to green because
even though blue professes to be this holy religious person
who is above sex and above emotions and above corruption
and all of this but in fact blue hasn't actually
worked through all of that psychological baggage it's it's it's
actually been suppressed and buried very deeply in there and
so blue behind the scenes often times engages in all
sorts of sexual activity homosexual activity of course all of
this is denied and repressed and and hidden it's part
of blues shadow and blue is often corrupt and susceptible
to gluttony into all all the temptations and that that's
why you have these preachers these Emin evangelical preachers who
can go there and preach a good thing but then
behind closed doors they're having sex with with men and
all sorts of stuff like they're having sex with children
you know all sorts of stuff like it happens that's
right because you're not actually doing real spiritual work you're
just indoctrinating yourself with belief systems and you cannot substitute
belief systems for a real spiritual purification what needs to
happen is that you actually need to start to admit
that all of your belief systems and your religious systems
that they're they're not doing the job but that is
exactly what blue does not want to admit another excess
of blue is low tolerance for outsiders and for foreigners
this leads to xenophobia blue tends to be very judgmental
and very moralizing blue is always looking out for who's
a sinner blaming and demonizing sinners but then of course
as you're judging everybody else you also judge yourself very
harshly as well and so blue is again in this
constant state of guilt blaming himself for all the sin
that he's done and therefore he lives a pretty miserable
life below the surface bluest prone to demonization because blue
really believes in a true good and evil as being
objective he actually believes that certain people are demons Nazis
or demons Islamic radicals are demons Devils certain countries like
the axis of evil of George W Bush North Korea
Iran Iraq these are the evil doers this they serve
Satan that's what they actually believe so there's this tendency
to demonize other people and to not be open to
seeing the world from their perspective because that would open
the floodgates or relativism and as soon as you open
the floodgates for relativism that's like opening Pandora's box and
now all the sudden all of Blues beliefs they all
or threatened and that becomes very scary for blue-blue loves
to assign blame blue loves crusading holy wars and these
holy wars can become very violent and dangerous blue becomes
easily self-righteous blue can become a martyr and other people
can rally around these martyrs that starts a whole movement
starts a new holy war lots of violence all the
name of the martyr classic stage blue type of behavior
blue can easily justify cruelty with Scripture blue will use
the scriptures unwittingly unconsciously to actually justify his egoic fears
and insecurities and just basically he turns the scriptures into
a system of justifications for his ego which can become
very dangerous battles of the civilizations like East versus the
Middle East or I mean West versus the Middle East
or West versus East these sorts of conflicts these civilization
wide conflicts or white Europeans versus the Native American savages
these sorts of conflicts often come from stage blue you
have a clash of civilizations when blue becomes very excessive
it becomes close to progress and to new technology all
throughout human history you see how blue civilization has resisted
certain technological developments whether it was the printing press or
whether it was mmm innovations within science new scientific theories
or invention of birth control condoms cloning genetic modifications there's
all sorts of stuff media technology is like radio television
this stuff was all resistant before blue finally came to
accept it in its excess blue denies science and blue
denies reason in a sexist blue can do a lot
of puritanical censorship like censoring television radio against bad words
against nudity the sorts of stuff because blues not comfortable
with that that's seen as a corrupting influence blue can
be unable to let loose and have fun because blue
is so anal blue is often sexually repressed blue is
conflicted very conflicted about sexuality because his religion tells him
that sexuality is evil it's a corrupting influence and at
the same time blue has he's strong just animal urges
and so how does he reconcile those two that's very
difficult usually it's it's all hidden under the rug and
so it's done behind closed doors with skeletons in your
closet with a lot of justification and guilt blue will
often prohibit sexual education and birth control because sexuality needs
to be controlled and repressed blues that's why blue is
against marriage before sex that's why blue values virginity so
highly in its excess blue often lacks empathy for other
civilizations and people's it fails to see the commonality that
all humans face blue has a lack of intellectual curiosity
about the world very often blue of course is closed
off to mysticism and non-duality even though mysticism and non-duality
is the core of blues religion what blue doesn't understand
is that his religion and his Messiah like the Buddha
or Christ or Muhammad that they were full-blown non-dual mystics
they were not blue they were wave more evolved than
blue but of course blue doesn't understand this because blue
takes spirituality literally and so the deep irony is that
even though blue is very religious on the surface it's
only the surface deep down blue is not really religious
or spiritual at all it's just the opposite what blue
engages in is a sort of material spirituality not true
spirituality because blue sees everything within the spiritual world as
physical heaven and hell' these are real physical places God
is a real physical human being living up in the
clouds the devil is a real creature with with horns
and a pointy tail and a pitchfork literally these are
not metaphors to blue and so therefore blue is closed
off to enlightenment and if blue ever does become enlightened
through accident for example some monks do it that way
they pray so much they accidentally become enlightened but then
they're terrified of it because what they discover is that
enlightenment means that everything is completely relative it's all a
hallucination and it's it's infinite and it's nothing reality is
nothing that there really is no God God has no
form and no substance and that completely terrifies the stage
blue mystic or believer because everything he's been taught was
the opposite of that so that's because blue is closed
off to mysticism and non-duality he's gonna burn witches he's
gonna be fearful of anything supernatural he's gonna suppress all
of that because for blue religion is about belief it's
not about having mystical experiences generally speaking there are exceptions
you have evangelicals for example who will undergo certain religious
experiences or mystical experiences but then usually what they do
is they they they reinterpret those experiences to support their
old ideologies which is the wrong way to go about
it blue taking to its excess is anti multicultural which
tends to be problem anti-globalist which tends to be a
problem because our world is becoming more multicultural it's becoming
more of a mixing pot more interconnected with the internet
and with airplane travel and all of this it's becoming
more global economically and you're not gonna stop any of
that you're not gonna stop evolution from happening you're not
gonna stop progress from happening so because blue is so
rigid it tends to stick its heels into them into
the mud and it has to be dragged forward by
progress and evolution which can be frustrating to the other
stages other people have to do that blue can have
a lot of repressed anger blue tends to be homophobic
racist and misogynistic blue taken to a success can be
oppressive to minorities sometimes viciously so blue reads sacred texts
way too literally so he doesn't really understand true mysticism
and spirituality blues prone to black and white thinking which
tends to not work so well in a complex grayscale
world blue is prone to us versus them thinking dividing
people into these rigid in-groups and out-groups blue tends to
not have enough understanding and compassion for the weaknesses and
frailties of other people which is why for example in
blue societies and cultures there's not really good support systems
for drug addiction for sex addiction porn addiction this sorts
of stuff because blue sees that as sin and so
you don't support sin you don't help people who are
sinners what you do is that you you blame them
and you maybe you put them in jail maybe you
punish them but you don't you don't have compassion for
sinners in excess blue often is very strict with children
the way children are raised and children are never really
allowed to be children because all these perfectionistic standards are
placed upon children to be good and not to be
sinful and then the children grow up also becoming anal
retentive just like their parents who are and they never
feel like they're good enough and so they're constantly living
with guilt and with shame participate disappointing their parents and
then of course they teach that to their own children
blue in its excess is unable to see the commonality
between all cultures and between all religions blue thinks that
each religion is really different when in fact they're all
basically talking about exactly the same thing just with different
window-dressing blue can be excessively bureaucratic blue can be excessively
theocratic where the government starts to dictate what you should
believe blue does not believe in separation of church and
state because that's a betrayal of the absolute truth a
betrayal of God God the state is supposed to be
serving God see that leads to theocracy Bleu is prone
to authoritarianism in its excesses nationalism and communism and this
is something that a lot of people misunderstand this is
why this model can be so helpful spiral dynamics is
because people think that oh but nationalism and patriotism is
the opposite of communism no it's not it's the same
exact mentality just different content the structure is the same
communism as it was practiced in the Soviet Union and
in China not today's China but China maybe 50 or
hundred years ago like the old school original communism that
was not staged Green these were not hippies these were
not progressives the original Communists and Marxist were not progressive
at all they were deeply blue so the difference between
ideological capitalists and communists and nationalists is much less than
most people think keep that mind it's very useful to
know because actually those people for example a lot of
conservatives in America a lot of the conservative religious right
in America and the alt-right they're they're more are their
arch enemy is communism right progressivism liberalism and communism as
they see it socialism but that's really a mistake because
what they're not noticing is they're not noticing that it's
there they're blue style of thinking which actually leads to
the kind of communism and socialism which they cite as
being the greatest evil because what do they do they
look back 100 years into Soviet Russia and the sort
of sub is they all look that's that's what's really
bad we don't want America to turn like that right
but America is never going to turn like that because
America is already evolving into orange and green it's already
way beyond that actually the closest thing in America to
the old suit old-school-style communism and Marxism that these blue
thinkers are afraid of is themselves which of course is
why they are so triggered by this stuff it's not
an accident they're triggered by it because they're actually not
accepting the fact that the religious right in America has
a lot more in common with the theocracy of Iran
and the the theocracy of Sharia law in the Middle
East and Saudi Arabia and also the sort of ideological
Marxism that took place in the Soviet Union then it
does with the soy drinking West Coast liberal progressives and
also with Nazis you know there's a lot more in
common with Nazis and with the religious right than there
is with the soy trinken progressives and that's of course
why stage blue people when you talk to stage blue
people about studying Hitler and studying knots Nazism and tried
learn the lessons there they never want to go there
they never want to actually study the lessons in history
from Nazism or from theocratic countries they don't want to
see these commonalities because to see these commonalities is to
admit that you yourself and your entire worldview is very
closely aligned to that and only a few things need
to change a few circumstances and then what you'll have
is you'll have a recurrence of nationalism and of Nazism
very easily so when people these days in America are
sort of surprised and shocked that oh how can America
be going all right and how can America be having
these sorts of authoritarian tendencies no it's it's not shocking
at all it's completely understandable when you understand that a
large part of America is stage blue it's completely understandable
but you can only understand that when you really understand
the spiral dynamics model very deeply and perhaps the worst
excesses of blue is genocide and ethnic cleansing that's what
happens when blue gets taken to its to its pinnacle
of excess and you can see that happening all around
the world in stage blue societies here are some slogans
that epitomize the stage blue mentality God gave us this
land this is the way God intended it to be
they will be punished in the name of Jesus make
America great again a revival of traditional values say what
you do and do what you say just stick to
the rules actions speak louder than words honesty is the
best policy better safe than sorry take one for the
team and blood and soil all of these slogans are
the heart of blue thinking and that's why when they
are said if the people who are in the audience
and they are stage blue they will completely resonate and
love these slogans and all the other stages will probably
hate these slogans and see all the limitations and problems
with these types of slogans now let's talk about how
to transcend blue perhaps most importantly is to read very
deeply about stage blue not just what I said here
this is a beginning point but you need to actually
read about it familiarize yourself with the stage you are
at as you read about yourself that gives you self
awareness and you start to see the limitations of your
own worldview also read and depth about stage orange which
is the next stage that you should be moving into
it's helpful to read about your stage and also the
next maybe one or two stages ahead of you because
then you can see the things that you're resisting in
the stage you've got to be moving up to the
thing that's keeping you in blue if you're stuck in
blue is that you're resisting orange and you're resisting green
sea so what's keeping for example a lot of the
Middle East stuck in stage blue is people who are
indoctrinated into these Islamic ideologies that are sort of very
archaic and medieval they look at the West and they
look at the moral corruption and decadence of the West
all the materialism all the all the money and the
sex and and and the the freedom that woman's have
and all this homosexuality is normalized all this and they
see that as a threat to to solid blue and
so of course they are resisting moving into orange but
what they don't realize is that if they read about
orange some more and also green they would realize Oh
orange is what I should be aspiring to yes there
are excesses to orange but I will pass over those
and those will get corrected over time the mistake is
too retreat back into blue another really important thing for
blue in order to transcend itself is to stop judging
orange and especially green and yellow stop judging the hippies
and the liberals and the progressives stop judging the intellectuals
and the elites and the globalists this is really damaging
as long as you're judging others with these sorts of
labels you're never going to be able to evolve to
that level and beyond that level stop judging materialism and
success stop judging sexuality stop judging relativism stop judging post-modernism
this is really holding you back you might say Oh
leo but what about all the excesses of liberals and
hippies and post modernists and the axis of excesses of
sexuality what about the excesses yes there are excesses at
every stage the trap is to become overly focused on
the excesses to the point where you're paralyzed and now
you're stuck in your stage that's happening because of fear
judgement is happening because of fear you're refusing to accept
reality you're refusing to accept how human consciousness and the
human psyche evolves because you want to cling to your
comfort zone and I understand that and every stage basically
does that to a certain degree I'm just pointing out
how to transcend if you really want to grow if
you really want to self actualize follow what I'm saying
here stop judging all this stuff stop judging mysticism stop
judging New Age spirituality stop judging moral depravity stop judging
evil sinful people in fact eliminate the notion of evil
altogether eliminate the notion of the devil that's very important
for blue because blue is so stuck with moralizing your
moralizing is killing you every time you moralize to somebody
else you're also moralizing to yourself and it's slowly drowning
you in guilt and it's preventing you from being able
to overcome your own inner weaknesses and demons limitations so
long as you judge the inner demons of others you
will also be judging and being stuck with your own
inner demons also to transcend Bloo stop clinging to tradition
let it go notice that everything evolves notice that all
traditions die there has not been a single tradition which
has survived uninvolved and unchanged for the last 2,000 years
everything is evolved the Bible has evolved language has evolved
countries have evolved religions have evolved everything has evolved Christianity
today is nothing like Christianity of 2,000 years ago Islam
of today is nothing like Islam 1,000 years ago etc
etc etc you cannot cling to anything there's really no
security in materiality which is something that blue doesn't want
to accept also to help you transcend become more skeptical
and start thinking independent for yourself it's is very important
for blue because blue is so stuck thinking along the
the programmed lines that he's been indoctrinated with start to
question all authority certain notice that authority is often wrong
start to notice that authority is often abused therefore you
need to become your own Authority start to notice the
limitations of religion start to notice that the things that
religion preaches it itself often cannot actually embody and actualize
that should be a clue or a hint to you
that the way religion is trying to do it is
not going to work there are much more effective ways
at practicing spirituality than religion start to notice abuses of
the church like the all the sexual scandals and all
the hypocrisy that that within the church all the corruption
that's there notice that actually the devil has infiltrated the
church and your holy book and your religion and your
culture long long long long ago such that he has
perverted it and turned it inside out such that now
when you're following the religious teachings of your of your
culture actually most often you're just being a servant of
the devil just don't you notice that notice that beliefs
can be extremely self deceptive and that belief is not
equivalent to truth and to reality reality is much larger
than belief itself you can never capture reality within a
system of beliefs notice that all beliefs are ultimately false
creations of the human mind and they are relative and
that beliefs basically just serve the ego they serve the
devil start to be iconoclastic and rebellious start to notice
the limitations of judgments and moralism notice that when you're
judging others you're simultaneously judging yourself and see how that's
hurting you start to acknowledge that reality is more relative
than you ever thought that this notion of absolute truth
may be it doesn't exist at all start to acknowledge
that start to acknowledge that good and evil do not
exist start to see that what you call evil somebody
else calls good and what you call good somebody else
calls evil that depends on your ego and what its
agenda is start to question whether God exists at all
start to question what God is start to question your
religion and your culture start to question your culture's exceptionalism
if you're blue you think your culture is the best
start to notice that there are many other cultures which
are equally great if not better and to help you
with that go visit other countries other cultures do a
lot of traveling eat exotic food that you would normally
never eat break your cultures conventions start to notice how
arbitrary culture is start to notice cultural relativity start to
notice how the hierarchy of your civilization is repressive and
how it hurts other people especially minorities try to put
yourself in the shoes of the minorities who are victims
of the hierarchy of your caste system or of your
culture put yourself if you're a man like if you're
a white Christian male put yourself into the shoes of
a black woman or put yourself into the shoes of
a gay transgender person and try to think of what
would my life be like if I was like that
rather than a white Christian guy how would the hierarchy
that I'm in be mmm prejudicial against me acknowledge the
commonality of all people notice that all people regardless of
their race regardless of their gender or whatever beliefs they
hold all people are basically just people none are better
than any other acknowledge the validity of other religions notice
that it's more fun to be independent rather than to
be reliant on a culture or society start to read
self-help books about success Tony Robbins style stuff stop being
an anal rule keeper relax your rules don't be so
disciplined develop a thirst for personal success that's what's going
to move you into orange start to have a desire
to climb the hierarchy and become the best and to
achieve something of yourself something material not religious notice that
separation of church and state is a good thing secular
society is actually a good thing it's good that you
don't live in a theocracy start to study history and
the abuses that you find in history of stage Bleu
study the Nazis study Hitler study communism study Marxism in
all its different forms and notice that that's all blue
study the Crusades study the Spanish conquistadors who butchered and
murdered savages or what they called savages in the new
world start to see the the enslavement of other races
that has happened throughout human history start to see all
those evils and abuses the cruelty of all of that
and how that's all enforced by these staged blue ways
of thinking that will really open your eyes read lots
of diverse books start to become a real student for
yourself don't just blindly accept what your culture tells you
read and research for yourself read loss of different perspectives
read perspectives from from minorities and from women and from
different cultures and from this and that so you get
a much broader view than just your little circle the
problem with stage blue is that stage blue surrounds itself
with just stage blue and it just lives within a
bubble of stage blue and it doesn't see anything beyond
that it's not exposed to two different opinions and perspectives
go to a diverse University and you will see this
diversity of perspectives and cultures start to study science that
will move you into Orange practice radical open-mindedness as I
talked about in some of my episodes notice that reality
is much more complex than nuanced and that black-and-white thinking
doesn't work very well embrace your feminine side stage blue
is terrible at embracing his feminine side acknowledge that humans
are not superior to animals acknowledge that men are not
superior to women acknowledge that whites are not superior to
any other minorities and finally the master key for transcending
any stage including stage blue is contemplation and self-reflection sit
down think all of this through study it take notes
ruminate upon it reflect on your own behaviors connect it
with human history that you learned through all your reading
and that should shift you into the next stage which
for you would be orange so that's blue basically in
a lot of detail in conclusion I want to stress
that you be very careful about abusing the information that
I'm teaching to you here it's very easy it's very
easy to start to stereotype people and to demonize people
you can look around and say oh look at that
blue person and dab blue country and that blue business
and now blue church and that blue organization look at
how bad they are and how evil they are look
they're gonna become Communists and Nazis and this and that
be very careful about that I've talked about the excesses
of blue but you have to remember that most blue
people are not fanatics and these excesses come out sometimes
but oftentimes not the majority of the time they don't
show up the majority of blue people are just decent
hard-working blue-collar you know your typical church-going grandma type of
lady you know she's probably not a neo-nazi so be
careful with these stereotypes and demonizing others if you start
stereotyping and judging and demonizing and moralizing too much using
spiral dynamics as your weapon then what are you doing
you're just actually taking what I taught you here and
you're entrenching yourself in stage blue and now you're acting
it out that's not the intent of this teaching the
intent of this teaching is to have you go Mehta
to see the world from up from much higher perspective
remember that blue is not good nor is it bad
also remember that people fit into multiple stages people are
not simple and this spiral dynamics model is not meant
to be a simple model it's not like a person
is either blue or orange or green and nothing else
it's not an either/or most of the time because people
are complicated and they're evolving they're always evolving whether they
know it or not they are usually somewhere in between
and they're usually somewhat of a mixture of things same
thing with countries very few countries are strictly blue you
might say Saudi Arabia's strictly blue no it's not certain
elements within Saudi Arabia are very blue but certain elements
are very orange a lot of the Middle East you
might say the entire Middle East is blue no it's
not that's very simplistic that's way too simplistic you need
to see that in the Middle East in countries like
Iran and Saudi Arabia and then you have countries like
Dubai which is very orange right you have you have
you have various mixes so these countries can be like
50% blue 50% orange or 75% blue 25% or vice
versus 20 75% orange 25% blue right you have different
mixes and human beings in visually can also be like
that and it doesn't just have to be blue and
orange it can also have a little mixture of green
in there and even maybe a little mixture of red
in there so it's complicated it's like a painting right
different colors but you can still look at a painting
and just kind of eyeball and say well this painting
yes it's got a bunch of colors in it but
basically it's an orange painting or it's basically a blue
painting or it's it's 50% blue 50% orange you can
kind of eyeball it right it's a model we're oversimplifying
reality here that's the point of models is to oversimplify
it's to generalize and be careful not to confuse the
model for the territory models are limited spiral dynamics should
not be your only tool for understanding politics and societies
and governments and individuals it's just one tool in your
tool belt recognize it has its limits and you will
notice them as you start to apply this model your
start to notice these limits so acknowledge that if anything
here that I said kind of triggers you and you
disagree with it remember I might have said something here
that offends you because you are in stage blue and
maybe you feel like I have mischaracterized stage blue no
I didn't I tried to be very fair and objective
here just notice that the biggest impediment to growing to
new stages is resistance denial and ego the ego is
trying to maintain homeostasis the ego is trying to keep
itself at blue if you were in blue it doesn't
want to evolve this is not exclusive to blue this
is true of orange this is also true of green
it's also true of yellow stages do not want to
evolve they're stubborn blue is especially stubborn but they're all
pretty stubborn they're all egotistical in their own unique ways
so the best thing you can do is just stop
judging stop judging the model stop judging yourself stop judging
other people and notice that you've got some inner work
to do judging is not inner work judging is distraction
the inner work is the contemplation self-reflection it's the studying
of all this of its thinking about it it's analyzing
your own behaviors and noticing like oh yeah I'm a
part of this organization here I'm a part of this
online forum here and that's a very blue influence on
my life and if I want to evolve to orange
maybe I should leave that forum stuff like that that's
where the real growth happens remember you're gonna have to
evolve through blue you can't just escape blue you can't
skip blue you can't wish it away be honest about
where you are if you're at blue admit that you're
at blue admit these limitations become aware of them bring
them out into the light of consciousness rather than stuffing
them under the rug into the shadows and notice that
you're gonna have to evolve into a stage Orange and
there's probably stuff and stage orange that you don't like
that you don't want to evolve into yes that's why
it's difficult if that wasn't the case then you would
already be at the very top of the whole hierarchy
you would be a perfectly evolved human being you would
be a Buddha or a Christ and you're not why
because you got this massive ego you have all these
ideologies all these opinions all these judgments all these fears
all these emotions and things you hide and repress all
this guilt and shame and and you're very dogmatic and
you've been programmed with all these ideas and so now
that's that's a lot of stuff to overcome it'll take
you years maybe decades to overcome that just to go
from blue to orange and that's just one jump and
then you're gonna have to go higher and higher and
higher about that but we'll talk about that in the
next episode so the next episode will be orange alright
I'm done here this was a lot of material to
cover but this is only 1/6 of everything we need
to talk about free to really understand spiral dynamics so
I'm out of here please like button for me come
also check out actualized org check out my book list
