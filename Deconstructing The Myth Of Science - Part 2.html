deconstructing the myth of science part two. Now we're gonna
get real serious. I've got dozens of killer points for
you here, we're gonna be discussing what is science and
how it really works and all of the limitations that
are common to science, but go denied and unrecognized and
unacknowledged by our culture and society. We have a lot
of material to cover, let me just reiterate once more,
that my teachings are non ideological. What I'm teaching here
is not a belief system, I'm making specific individual points,
which correspond with insights about the nature of reality and
human knowledge and science that you can have for yourself,
you can either have these insights, or not have them.
You can form beliefs. But that's not the same thing
as having the insights. So the only purpose of this
communication is to show you the possibility for the insights
that you have not yet had. That's the value of
this work that we do. Right? It's not enough just
to listen to me, you have to actually contemplate the
things that I say very deeply. And you have to
independently derive these insights for yourself, in the same way
that if I was teaching you mathematics, it wouldn't be
sufficient for you just to believe me that five times
five is 25, you have to actually go and derive
that for yourself. And check whether that is in fact,
the case. If all that you're doing is you're learning
mathematics, through blind memorization, without actually going through any of
the derivations of the truths of mathematics, then you're misunderstanding
the spirit of mathematics. Likewise, if all this you're doing
is you're listening to me talking, and you're not thinking
about the stuff for yourself and having these insights, you're
not doing this work properly. So just be careful about
that. You will never understand the things that I talk
about, without deep and long contemplation. That's just a baseline
for all of our work. Now, I was going to
leave the objections section to part four of this series.
But some of the objections because I know you guys
have so many objections. And honestly, they're warranted, you should
be skeptical of the things that I'm telling you. Because
I'm telling you radical things, which challenge the basically everything
you've been taught about science and human knowledge, and about
reality. So yeah, of course, you're going to be skeptical.
Sure, there's no problem with being skeptical about my teachings,
just be skeptical. But also keep an open mind and
realize that we're covering very tricky territory here, where your
mind can easily trick you into misunderstanding the things that
are being said. So I'm going to cover a few
of the objections, not all of them. But I'm going
to cover a few of the objections here, right off
the bat, to get us warmed up. And then we'll
get into the main points. Now. The reason I'm having
to cover these objections so early is because of how
your mind works, you see, you still don't get the
significance of what I'm about to say is that your
mind is the gatekeeper. Your mind is the pupil through
which all knowledge and information and truth arrives into your
skull and into your consciousness, through your mind. Anything that
your mind wants to filter out or deny it will
easily do so without any hesitation or even your awareness.
Are you getting this? So as we're talking here, and
remember, ultimately, we're what we're trying to do. Our ultimate
objective is to help to jailbreak your mind to deconstruct
your entire mind and then alongside with it, all of
reality. To get to the truth, as it turns out,
your mind is the thing that is preventing you from
getting to the truth. So that's why we have to
deconstruct your mind. Now your mind is composed of many
different facets. Science is one of them, that we need
to deconstruct there's a lot of other stuff we have
to deconstruct in addition to science, but here we're focusing
on science. See The problem though, is that like I
said, you know, in that metaphor of jailbreaking your mind
like your phone when you're trying to jailbreak your phone,
it has anti jailbreaking software operating at a very low
level in the kernel of the operating system, which is
going to prevent you from ever getting close to jailbreaking
it. Every move you take, your mind will take a
countermove that's going to be more intelligent than the moves
you make in order to prevent you from jailbreaking your
mind, which is the only reason you haven't jailbroken your
mind up to this point in your life. And if
you had, you probably wouldn't be listening to me anymore,
because you wouldn't need it. So just by the fact
that you're listening to me already, there's a selection bias,
which means that you're not aware of the anti jailbreaking
mechanisms which are operating in your mind, therefore, I have
to be aware of them for you, and I have
to preempt them for you. And your mind is so
sensitive and so fragile, fragile, that any wrong word that
I say, on this touchy subject, for example, if you're
a materialist, or you're a realist, or you're a rationalist,
or you're an Objectivist, any, any word that I say
that rubs you the wrong way rubs your ego the
wrong way, immediately, your mind will shut down, all your
mind has to do is just get offended, or just
go off. That's bullshit, and then click the off button
on this video on this recording. And that's it. That's
it, you've locked yourself off from the truth forever. That's
how easy it is for your mind to shut down.
And the kind of information that is going to really
seriously challenge your worldview. You see, so I want you
to stay very cognizant of that. Watch for any word
that I say that rubs you the wrong way and
observe that reactivity within you and that desire to click
the off button. Observe that and wonder whether that's a
healthy reaction or not. For somebody who's interested, supposedly as
you in pursuing the truth, in really understanding reality. Because
if you're not really interested in understanding reality at a
deep level, then why are you even watching this, go
watch some cat videos, there's a cat video right over
here, you can just click on that. And that will
be perfect for your level of intellect and interest. In
reality, go watch some of those cat videos. They're great.
But if you're gonna stick around here, be very cognizant
and mindful of the gatekeeper function, and the anti jailbreaking
software that is running inside of your mind as I'm
speaking. Okay, so enough of that. Let's get to the
objections. The first one is, but Leo. So what you're
doing here is you're undermining science. And this is dangerous
because you're opening Pandora's box to all sorts of pseudoscience
and crack pottery and quackery and new age, you know,
gobbledygook and nonsense. Well, what I'm doing here is I'm
questioning science. And we you say that that's dangerous when
you say that questioning science is dangerous. Do you see
the problem with that? That in and of itself is
dangerous. In fact, I would say that's the greater danger.
Yes, of course, there is a danger that the ego
mind can abuse these teachings very easily. That's always been
the case with anything that I teach, and especially this
subject, and you're right, you know, the creationists and the
Flat Earthers, and the climate change deniers, and the COVID,
virus deniers, all this sorts of stuff, and the anti
vaxxers and whatever, conspiracy nut cases are out there? Yes,
they will take these very valid points that I'm making
against science, and they will use them for their own
devilish egoic purposes. Of course, they will. But that does
not invalidate the points that I make. Just because the
points that I make are inconvenient for you. Doesn't make
them untrue. Please see that distinction. It's always the case
that advanced truths and teachings can be misused by the
ego mind. But the pursuit of truth and ultimately, science
cannot be done out of fear. It has to be
done out of a positive motivation to understand reality as
it actually is. Or as close to that as we
can get. See, we can't be worried that well, I
shouldn't you know, we should investigate this part of nature
or that part of nature or this part of science.
We shouldn't question this or that thing, because it's sacred.
In a sense, your argument here is that science is
too sacred to question. I mean, religious people have been
using this defense for Milan onea against any criticisms of
religion, when you criticize the Catholic Church for its abuses,
that the priests have their various kinds of sexual scandals
and so forth. What is the common defense of Catholics
against any of these criticisms? The defense is always something
like but, but Catholicism is sacred. And after all, I
mean, what do you want me to do? You know,
leave my church, I still have to keep going church.
And so they they hand wave away the criticisms? Because
in their mind, it's dangerous to question Catholicism, it's dangerous
to question its authority, because as soon as you find
one little flaw, of course, your mind knows what that
means. If we find a little flaw within Catholicism, then
that means there can be more flaws. Makes you start
to doubt your faith in Catholicism. And if we make
you start to doubt, a little bit in Islam, that
little crack can rip apart into a giant fissure. Well,
it works exactly the same way with science. So the
reason people are so defensive about science is because of
course, as soon as a little doubt, is sewn in
there, as soon as your mind starts to really consider
the things that I say, then yeah, that little crack
will eventually turn into a fissure and rip apart the
entire enterprise of science. That's what I told you about
at the very beginning. The things I teach are, are
threatening to the ego mind threatening to your sense of
reality, threatening to your worldview. And this always happens with
whistleblowers, consider someone like Edward Snowden, he comes out, you
know, he reveals some secret information about NSA, wiretapping and
spying that the government has illegally been doing on the
American public. And and what are people thankful for this?
No, at least not the people in the government. Most
of the people in the government consider him a traitor
for doing so. Because, of course, under the justification that
it's dangerous, it's dangerous for Edward Snowden to come out
there and reveal classified information. That's dangerous. We can't allow
that. Well, yeah, but is it true? Well, it doesn't
matter if it's true. It's dangerous. Yeah. But is it
true? No, but it's dangerous. It's dangerous. Forget about whether
it's true, it's too dangerous. You see, this always happens
when you criticize any kind of institution. And science is
no different. So that covers that. The next objection is,
but Leo, the great thing about science is that it
evolves and betters itself, that is the nature and spirit
of science. So you criticizing science is pointless, because science
is already bettering itself. It doesn't need you. This is
just absurdly contradictory, hypocritical and ridiculous. This objection, I get
to this objection, so much from different people whenever I
try to try to critique science. But what you have
to realize is that science doesn't just automatically improve itself.
Science only improves itself, when people like you and me
are willing to change our minds about how science works.
You see, and if we're not, if you and I
are going to be stuck, and be defending science as
it is, then science will not evolve, and it will
not better itself. We will be obstacles to its evolution.
So consider the following crazy. I know this is a
crazy idea that this talk right here, this whole series
is the evolution of science, but only if you are
willing to contemplate the things that I say for yourself
and get them and then so other people are also
able to do the same thing. And then when we
all see the limitations that were pointed out by somebody
who spent a lot of time thinking about it, then
science will evolve. Otherwise, it won't. You see? So while
you're objecting that science evolves all the time. Ironically, it's
that which is shutting down the evolution of science. Can
you see that? If every time somebody comes up with
a critique of science, you shut him down. how science
is going to evolve? And do you really think that
science is going to evolve in a sort of a
happy go lucky manner where everyone's going to be happy
about its evolution? Or do you think think that, in
reality, what's going to happen is that people who are
stuck on the old paradigms of science are going to
be frustrated, and are going to be angry and upset
about it, and will not want it to evolve. Or
do you think everyone's just going to be eager to
change their entire worldview all of a sudden, When has
that ever been true in human history, for any institution,
or any group of people, that they were just eager
to evolve? Know, the ego minds, natural tendency is to
be stubborn, and to refuse any change revolution. And its
way is this is true, collectively, for institutions. And it's
true individually for us. And you've, you've experienced this in
your own life, how other people refuse to change, refuse
to evolve, including yourself. And you've seen it in institutions
to. And science, of course, it's no different. So this
right here is the evolution of science if you're able
to comprehend what's being said. And of course, you have
to also consider that the evolution of science is not
going to take you to a place that you already
anticipate, the next stage of science is going to be
something new, something you're uncomfortable with something that isn't obvious,
something that people haven't thought of before, because if they
already thought of it, and they're already comfortable with it,
then it's not new, it's already part of science. So
you have to really contemplate what it means for science
to evolve. It's not just this easy, smooth process. It's
a contentious process more like a war or a battle
than it is just some effortless evolution. This is the
process. All these people in the comment sections that you
read, who are denying anything that I say here, as
legitimate, that is the very resistance that is put up
by science against the evolution of science. Now, of course,
they're going to deny that because they're going to deny
any legitimacy to what I say. And I'm gonna say
that what I say has nothing to do with the
evolution of science, of course, but that's always said about
anybody who tries to advance science. They're always denies denied
on the grounds that what they're proposing, is it true
science. But that, of course, is the whole the whole
epistemic issue here that we talked about, in part one
who gets to decide between what is and isn't valid
science, that's the whole problem. We don't really know what
is and isn't valid science. The next objection is billy-o.
Science doesn't claim to pursue truth, it's just a way
of making our life better. This is a very sneaky,
very intellectually dishonest critique, or objection to my critiques. And
I noticed that a lot. You see, ideally, most scientists
actually are interested in the truth. But what happens is
that when someone like me social level, serious critiques about
science is an ability to reach the truth. Eventually, these
people are backed into a corner and they have to
make a sort of a, what I call the programmatic
retreat. They need to formulate science as a pragmatic activity
strictly a pragmatic activity which is divorced from any truth
seeking. Science is unconcerned with truth. And in fact, all
that science is concerned with is just the manipulation of
reality and improving our ability to survive as a species
through technology. At first glance, this seems like a legitimate
defense. Actually, it's not it's a grossly prep problematic defense.
Let me point this out to you. So let's talk
a little bit about pragmatism. That's actually a very important
point. What is pragmatism pragmatism is a is a sort
of a school of thought, within the philosophy of science
that arose may be actually in the like 1880s and
90s, with with the pragmatic philosopher, some American pragmatic philosophers
like Pierce, he basically started it, but but then it
evolved. And then like Richard Rorty was a philosopher of
science who, who really kind of popularized this notion of
science as pragmatism, this sort of idea that, well, philosophy
has been interested in the deep questions of reality about
like, is there a God and what is the ultimate
truth and such questions? But ultimately, you know, we did
science and we discovered that these questions are impossible to
answer. They're just even meaningless questions. No serious scientist should
be interested in these questions. All that science is interested
in is just going into the laboratory doing its laboratory
work producing some Technical results, and then doing some, you
know, technology based upon that. And that's really all that
that sciences and in a sense truth here is then
reduced down to a much more mundane notion, not some
lofty metaphysical, you know, ultimate truth. But just truth is
simply whatever works. That's the pragmatic formulation. And this has
become very popular amongst scientist, it's a very effective defense
against any critiques of science, because one of the most
powerful critiques of science is the fact that it's, it's
not true. And it doesn't get you to the ultimate
truth. And so of course, the easiest way to defend
against that is to just cut off the possibility of
ultimate truth and to say that such a thing doesn't
even exist. Well, that's not true. So but let me
address this more substantively in a way that you can
understand. Alright, so it's really problematic to equate the manipulation
of reality, with truth. And that's essentially what pragmatism does.
If I can manipulate reality using some sort of mental
scheme, in a sense, pragmatism says, that's what makes the
scheme true. But of course, this is patently absurd, if
you think about it for even a few moments with
some examples. Just because something is useful, doesn't mean that
it's true. In fact, there are many instances in life
where the most useful techniques and methods are false. And
it's precisely their falsehood that makes them so true, which
is why people lie. Why do people lie so much?
Why do you lie so much? Why are people so
dishonest? And I've always been throughout history, why? Why do
politicians lie? Why do business people lie? Why do you
use Carl sell car salesmen lie? Because it's very useful.
It's very useful for manipulating people. And for getting the
kind of results that you want within society. It's very
useful for survival, but it doesn't make it true. You
see. Now you say, well, Leo, but scientists are generally
an honest sort of people, they don't lie outright, the
way that used car salesmen do. And I would agree
with that. And most scientists, I don't, I wouldn't say
that they're outright liars. They're just not conscious of the
things that they're doing, and the beliefs they're holding, and
the limitations of their worldview. So I'm not calling them
liars. But I'm just trying to use that as a
point to illustrate that just because something is useful doesn't
automatically make it true. These are two distinct and independent
variables. For example, Newtonian mechanics, is extremely useful. I can
use Newtonian mechanics to calculate the trajectory of a projectile
very accurately. And I can use this information in this
model to kill my enemies if I'm threatened by my
enemies. And I might really start to believe that Newtonian
mechanics is true, because it allows me to kill my
enemies and to predict these projectiles that I'm shooting at
them. And after all, what I care about is my
own survival and my tribes survival, right. But of course,
modern science recognizes that Newtonian mechanics isn't true. It's still
useful, very useful, but it isn't true. How about atomic
theory, the sort of standard model of atomic theory that
was taught to you and in elementary school in high
school, you know, with little balls in the nucleus with
little ball electron orbiting around, I mean, this entire model,
as useful as it is, you can use that model
to successfully do certain chemical reactions and predict certain kinds
of phenomena, electrical phenomenon, magnetic phenomena, whatever, chemical phenomena. But
modern science again, has recognized that this model isn't true.
Yet, it's still taught in high schools all around the
world. Consider a primitive tribe of people living in the
Amazon. They have a very radically different, what you would
call an unscientific worldview, full of animistic beliefs and deities
and voodoo and witchcraft and all sorts of weird stuff
like that. That they practice, you would say all of
that, that they believe is false. Right? That's what you
want to say. But if you want to be a
pragmatist, here's the hypocrisy of pragmatism. See if you're gonna
adopt the pragmatic sense of science than I get to
use pragmatism to defend any crazy belief system and worldview
as long as it's useful. So, if we take you
and we drop you into the middle of the Amazon
sea with your current scientific worldview, materialistic worldview, rationalist worldview,
you will not be able to survive in the Amazon
for longer than a few weeks, you'll die. So how
useful is your worldview in the Amazon, not very useful.
But these tribal people have been living in that jungle
for centuries, and millennia very successfully. And they are going
to be able to run circles around you in that
jungle, they will be able to hunt and to feed
themselves and to find water, and to find herbal medicines
and treat their their diseases and build shelters and all
sorts of stuff. But all of this will be done
under an animistic worldview. They will not be done under
a materialist worldview, they will believe in spirits and deities
that help them to do all those things. You see.
So if you're going to use a pragmatic defense, I
get to use the pragmatic defense to and I get
to say that all of their beliefs and their worldview
is completely true, because it's useful. And hey, as long
as useful, it's true, right? That's your logic, not my
logic. I didn't argue that you argue that. So watch
with your double standards here. And also what's patently absurd
about this defense of science, the pragmatic defense is that
you would never, ever grant this kind of leeway to
religion. So if I was a religious fundamentalist, let's say
an Evangelical, and I was telling you about God and
angels in heaven, and all these, you know, wacky religious
beliefs that I hold, view as a scientifically minded person,
you would say, Yeah, but but those things are true.
And maybe he would make some points, he would say,
like, the Earth isn't actually 5000 years old, it's billions
of years old. And he would say, there's no evidence
for angels. And you would say, there's no evidence for
God and blah, blah, blah, right. And eventually, maybe I
would be backed into a corner. And I would say,
Well, you know, maybe, you know, you're right. I haven't
I haven't seen an angel myself. And you're right. I
haven't seen God myself. So yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe it
isn't true. But But. And here's the pragmatic defense. It's
useful. It's useful. And you, you know, that religious people
make this this point, when they're backed into a corner.
They say that, but But religion, even if it's not
true, it's a, it's like a, it's a binding mythology
that binds our nation or our tribe together, it helps
to shape the morality of our people and our children.
It helps me to raise good children and make people
happy. And in fact, if you do scientific experiments, and
they have done clinical experiments like this, studies, and so
forth, where they have found that actually, the happiest people
are oftentimes the most religious people in the world, not
the atheists and not the rationalists, the religious people. So
if you're gonna say that the pragmatic defense is legitimate,
than I get to say that all religious dogma and
belief is true on the grounds that it makes people
happier, and it's useful for them in their lives. Agreed.
Are you agreeing to that? Of course not. Of course
not. You're gonna say no, that's bullshit. And you're right
to say that it is bullshit. Because truth is not
the same thing as survival. Truth is not the same
thing as manipulation. Truth is not the same thing as
happiness. And science is not the same thing as pragmatism.
Science is much deeper than merely the pragmatists claim. And
in fact, no serious intellectual or scientist considers science to
merely be a pragmatic scheme for manipulating reality, which isn't
really true. That is not how you hold signs is
that and that is not why serious scientists pursue serious
science. When a serious scientist is pursuing serious science. He
really believes in his heart, that he's finding something out
about the nature of the universe, something deep, something profound,
something true, not merely a scheme to manipulate some numbers,
not merely a new technology, but something deep that has
been understood. Every great scientist, whether it was Einstein or
Newton or liveness, or I mean, you name them these
Scientists we're after something much deeper than merely pragmatism. This
sort of pragmatism is really a modern invention of last
100 years. And in a sense, science has been corrupted
by this pragmatic notion, because what it's done is it's
completely stripped science of its deeper metaphysical aspirations, which have
always been there, and are still there for most serious
scientists. Now, there are many scientists who just are like
monkeys doing lab work. They're technicians, they're not deep thinkers
about the nature of reality for these people. If all
you're interested in just is doing some, some standard basic
science using basic lab work, or whatever, then yeah, for
you, science has no deeper dimension. But that is not
really how you hold science. You see, even if you're
not a professional scientist, even if you're just an ordinary
person, for example, when science tells you that the that
the earth is 4 billion years old, and that dinosaurs
used to roam the Earth, because we have fossils, and
that the earth is orbiting around the sun. And that
the you know, and that that we are located inside
of a larger galaxy called the Milky Way, which came
from some big bang that was, you know, 14 billion
years ago or whatever, this, this whole model that you
hold, you don't merely hold this model telling yourself well,
yeah, it's a sort of a convenient fiction that I
invented in order to make sense of, you know, some,
some in order to help me to manipulate reality better.
No, the way you hold that is as truth. You
want to say that's true. You actually believe that that's
what's real. This is actually what is generally driving your
sense of sense making See, you're not just using science
merely to manipulate some variables within reality and to build
some technology. Sure, science, of course, does that. But science
serves a much deeper cultural function. For us, as a
society, science creates a narrative to explain our origins, where
we came from, and where we're going, and why things
are happening. Without this, you wouldn't know anything, nothing would
make any sense to you nothing would have meaning for
you. See, when you look up at the stars at
night, you don't just consider them as you know, those
little lights in the sky as just little variables of
light quantities and numbers that you're going to manipulate. And
that's it. No, no, you look at the stars and
you wonder, and you say, Wow, that's amazing. Those are
actually suns that are bigger than our sun that are,
you know, millions of light years away, or whatever, and
they're shining down. And it's and there might be planets
over there. And there might be aliens on those planets,
and God knows what else is out there. And it
gives you a sense of all. That's probably what inspired
you to become a professional scientist, if you ever became
when it's something like that. You really care about understanding
reality. And you think that whatever science you're doing, if
it's successful, truthful science, you think that you're actually understanding
something deep and profound about reality. And you're right about
that intuition. That is the spirit of science. But the
problem is that these models that you're coming up with
are not identical with truth. And we'll be talking more
about that as we as we go. Right? And see,
in ordinary language, we have a notion called Truth. And
we don't just call in ordinary language, truth, those things
which are convenient and practical. A lot of things are
convenient, practical, doesn't make them true. And you want even
as a scientist, you want to preserve the notion of
truth, because you want to say that, well, this science
is true, and that science is false. Not on the
basis of this one is more utilitarian and practical, whereas
that one is not. Or this one allows me to
manipulate reality better, but that one does not matter. You
want to say that, regardless of how well I can
manipulate reality. With my models and theories, there's truth, independent
of all that. And the truth stands on its own,
the way that reality actually is. You see, and also
consider that there might be many aspects of science or
truth that have no practical consequences whatsoever. Nowhere in the
universe is that written that to have the truth that,
that will allow you to then manipulate reality however you
want, and to live a cushy, comfortable life and to
whatever other pragmatic, you know, considerations there are. It might
be the case that the truth is completely impractical. And
you're gonna have to deal with that. How do you
know that the truth is a practical thing? Who told
you who did you ask that you ask God, and
he told you all truth in the universe is practical,
is absurd. This idea that truth must be practical is
a completely unscientific dogma that many scientifically minded people hold.
That's one of the dogmas of science. So, in a
sense, what pragmatism devolves into is devilry. Now I use
the word devilry. Not in a literal sense, but sort
of in a metaphorical, deeper, allegorical sense. See my episode?
What is the devil where I explain what Tillery is?
All that devil really means devilry really means is that
it means that if you if you equate the truth
with your own personal survival, or the survival of your
species, which a lot of people do when they talk
about science, that turns into devilry, because what that means
is that now all of a sudden, you open the
door for lying, deception, manipulation, as long as it can
be manipulated and lied, and you can succeed with it.
That is, then that becomes your definition of truth. And
then anything goes, see this is sort of the Donald
Trump conception of truth for Donald Trump. Truth is, whatever
makes him successful, and prosperous, and allows him to survive.
That's his definition of truth, which is why he's the
devil. Again, I'm not saying this with moral condemnation, I'm
just telling you, the mechanics of the ego mind. And
that when the ego mind equates Sir, its own survival
with the truth, which commonly does, because most ego minds
don't care about the truth, other than its own survival,
then that's when that's when the ego goes crazy. And
that's when all hell breaks loose. Because now, you're free
to lie, you're free to cheat, you're free to manipulate,
you're free to say anything that comes your way, you're
free to fake documents, cheat on your taxes, cheat on
your wife, whatever, as because for you, it doesn't matter
what's true, it matters, what allows you to survive. And
a lot of times falsehood and deception is what allows
you to survive within human society. And then lastly, the
final ultimate blow to pragmatism is, of course, that absolute
truth exists. There is such a thing as absolute truth,
and you can access it with your consciousness. But the
problem is that you can't access it with modern science.
What is the Absolute Truth? Well, I can't get into
that here. If you want to know what truth is.
It's a deep topic, go check out my episode called
what is truth where I explain what truth is, although,
of course, absolute truth cannot be explained. So one of
the biggest problems of science is that the symbolic methods
that it uses are incapable of actually grasping absolute truth.
Therefore, what science does is science then is sort of
forced to either admit that it's limited, and that it
can't access the Absolute Truth using its methods, or at
least its current methods, or science has to deny the
absolute truth is even a thing. And that's usually what
happens is that usually a scientifically minded person gets so
drawn into the pragmatism of science, and everyday survival of
technology, that they completely forget about truth, and then to
the point where they even deny that it even exists.
Because to admit that there is an absolute truth outside
of the methods of conventional science, this is a huge
problem for science, you see. Because, again, and this is
one more, you know, problem with pragmatism is that for
us as a culture, for science to have the authority
that it has, we can't just say that science is
practical. We have to hold science as the ultimate truth.
That's part of the mythology of science is that it's
not merely practical. It's not merely a collection of schemes
we use to manipulate reality that will change in the
future and have nothing to do with the way reality
actually is. No, we hold it as actually true. We
hold it as actually true. but it isn't. And that's
something you can discover for yourself. But the only way
you can discover it is by, again, deconstructing science. You
see, this is why we're working on this. Because you
can't access absolute truth without first deconstructing science. And you
can't deconstruct science, so long as you're stuck on all
these different objections that you have. For example, if you're
stuck in pragmatism, you're never going to deconstruct science, and
you're never going to discover the ultimate truth. Because pragmatism
says it doesn't exist. But that's just a dogmatic assumption.
You don't actually know that it doesn't exist. In fact,
in truth, science derives all of its value and function
from the fact that it corresponds, if it does, if
it's good science, it corresponds to the absolute truth in
some way. The Absolute Truth is basically everything. This very
moment in this room that I'm sitting in, that you're
sitting in, this is absolute truth. Science, basically, is the
study of absolute truth. You might put it that way.
Without absolute truth, there couldn't be any science. So that's
that. Next objection. But Leo, how can science work? If
it isn't true? This is a this is a very
common objection. very understandable objection. At. And this is perhaps
the biggest illusion of science is that it working so
well makes everybody give science a pass on his truthfulness?
Because you just assume that if it works, well, it
must be true. Well, that's how science fools you. That's
how it sneaks under the radar. See, because as long
as something works for you, as long as I can
make a gadget using it, then you're going to think
that well, what more is there, I got everything I
want out of science. But you see, truth isn't about
what you want. Truth is truth. It's independent of whether
it works for you, whether it's practical for you. So
the reason science can work is like I said, with
some of those other examples like those, you know, primitive
people living in the Amazon, their worldview works for them,
too. There is an infinite number of worldviews, and even
an infinite number of sciences that you can invent, that
will work in different ways. They don't all work the
same. They have their pros and cons and trade offs.
Every scientific model, in theory has certain pros and cons,
it will work in some areas, it'll have limits and
not work in other areas. And then it's a matter
of for you to determine, you know, what works for
you, what kind of what kind of work do you
need it to do, and so forth. But just because
some mental scheme works like you can come up with
a mental scheme to explain something about the functioning of
nature. But that mental scheme is not the same thing
as nature itself. And there can be many alternative mental
schemes to describe or to explain, or even to predict
the phenomena of nature. So your mental scheme isn't true.
It's just loosely corresponding with a few elements of nature.
This is what trips people so much. Remember, we talked
about the underdetermination problem in part one? Well, so the
underdetermination problem comes in here is that, of course, due
to the under determination problem, we have our models and
theories, but all of them are basically underdetermined. That means
you could have multiple models and theories for exactly the
same set of data points. Right, in fact, you can
have an infinite number. It's similar to culture. You know,
you culture also creates a sort of illusion, if you
grew up in a closed culture, in a closed society,
you're going to feel like all of the customs and
norms and ways of operating of that culture that you
grew up in your your sort of your motherland culture,
you're going to feel like that's the only way that
reality could work. Because it works. And it's useful and
it's functional. And you're gonna hold those as, like, absolute
truths. But then when you travel to some foreign, radically
different culture, like you go to Japan, or Australia, or
China or India, Indonesia, you know, into the Amazon, you're
going to discover radically different cultures with radically different norms
and customs and worldviews, which also work. Some of them
work even better than yours did. And some of them
work a lot worse than yours. Not all cultures are
the same. Again, there's pros and cons to different cultures.
But it all depends. It depends on the environment you're
talking about and depends on what you need your culture
to do. You know, there's different demands placed upon culture
based on the environment and the people and The level
of technology and development of the the people that the
culture is helping to facilitate and all of this, right.
But you can clearly see when you travel around the
world a lot that there can be hundreds, even 1000s
of different cultures. And that not one, no one culture
is the best. It's all about trade offs and pros
and cons. And sometimes there's multiple ways of doing something.
See, this is obvious with culture, this is less obvious
with science. But I assure you, it works the same
way with science. There is not one science, you can
have hundreds 1000s even more different kinds of models for
exactly the same phenomena within science. sort of imagine if,
if if reality is a cake. And science is slicing
the cake in one particular direction. Other epistemic schemes and
worldviews and even other forms of science can slice the
cake in different pieces in different directions. So there's not
a single way to slice the cake, there's an infinite
number of ways of slicing the cake, and how you
slice the cake determines on what you need for your
survival. Since humans need technology, to manipulate material reality, so
it's very useful for humans, we tend to slice the
cake in a way that allows us to do that
we will slice the cake in a way that facilitates
our manipulation of material reality. And in this way, we
fool ourselves into thinking that first of all material that
reality is material, it's not. Secondly, that and, and secondly,
that our way of slicing the cake is the truth.
And the only way it could be and that there
are no alternatives, and that this is the best alternative.
And of course, that's false. The only reason you think
that is because you haven't explored other epistemic paradigms beyond
science, or other sciences even. You see, there's no such
thing as a singular science, science changes the science of
today is not the science of 500 years ago is
not the science of 1000 years ago. All of the
models of science have changed, but science was still practical.
500 years ago, is still practical 1000 years ago. Now,
of course, as as our models become more sophisticated, we
become better at manipulating reality. But that doesn't solve the
problem of truth. Another objection is that BillyOh? Science is
simply observation. That's all that science is. No, it's not,
not at all. You see, the trick is that all
observational data can be ignored and denied and contested. That's
the whole problem. For example, if I tell you that
I saw a ghost that's observational data, I saw a
ghost. Are you going to admit that ghosts exist? Of
course not. You're gonna deny my data. You're gonna say,
Oh, that was just hallucination. You're imagining stuff is just
wishful thinking, you can't be trusted. obser your observations don't
count. Okay, so my observations don't count. But how come
yours? Do you see, the way that you define observation?
The notion of observation is a completely relative notion, you
and scientists, as a community define observation according to their
certain standards. Now, you might say, well, Leo, one person
seeing a ghost isn't enough. We need scientist to actually
measure the ghost, we need a bunch of scientists to
see the ghost and then we will admit the observation
as legitimate. But see, again, there's nothing objective about that
method. That's a subjective, relative method that you invented. That's
a certain standard that you set. But that doesn't mean
that the ghost needs to pass that. That rigorous standard.
See the standards you set. Nature doesn't have to clear
your standards, you have to adopt your standards to nature,
not nature to your standards. This is a common problem
that many scientifically minded people don't understand. And I mean,
ghosts, are set to be observed by 1000s, hundreds of
1000s of people even. But see, you're going to deny
all that data, you can say, well, they're all deluded.
Exactly. And you're going to always say that about anything
that you don't want to admit into your paradigm of,
of nature or reality. You see, they say, well, Leo,
surely if they've seen ghosts than they should be, we'll
take pictures of it. Well, maybe. But see, if I
show you a picture of a ghost, are you gonna
believe that? Of course not. You're gonna say that's a
fake picture. And you'll say, well, Galileo, because those people
can't be trusted. You know, anyone can fake a ghost
on Photoshop these days. So of course, that doesn't constitute
legitimate evidence. Well, that but then how do you prove
a ghost? How do I prove a ghost to you?
By the way, I'm not saying that ghosts are real.
I've never seen one. I'm just using this as an
example because I know it triggers you guys. You scientists.
I'm just trying to get you like to really question
what would it take? How much evidence would it take
for you to actually admit that ghosts exist? See, you'd
never consider this question because you just assume ghosts don't
exist? That's begging the question, of course. But consider for
a moment that ghosts do exist, but the fact that
your mind is too close to understand this phenomenon called
ghosts, see, part of the problems that you assume all
of reality is material. Therefore, when you, when you hear
about ghosts, you assume that well, so the ghosts must
be material, so I should be able to take a
photograph of it, or I should be able to like,
grab it, grab it by the ankles, and drag it
into a laboratory and dissect it. But maybe Ghosts don't
work that way. See, maybe ghost is a sort of
phenomenon that you can't approach with your material, gross material
methods. But then, of course, you say, well, but I
can't approach it with my gross material methods, then it
isn't true. Again, begging the question. Because the question here
is, are your methods themselves sufficient to account for all
the phenomena of the universe? Which of course, we mentioned
in part one? They are not, you don't know that?
See? You of course they will Lea. But this is
a cop out. Because see, you're saying that ghosts exist,
but then you're not giving us any method for proving
that they actually exist? No, there are many methods to
potentially prove that they exist. First of all, seeing one
yourself. But see even that you're not going to admit
as legitimate evidence. But of course, if you did see
a ghost yourself. Please understand that if you actually saw
a real ghost yourself, you would, you would count that
as legit evidence. You just don't count it from others.
And hey, I get you. You're skeptical. I understand. We
shouldn't just believe people who say that they saw ghosts.
We want some, you know, hard, tangible evidence. But all
I'm trying to prove with this point is that what
you call observation is completely relative. There is no such
objective standard for what counts as observation. And this applies
not just to ghosts, but to UFOs. To Bigfoot, to
remote viewing to psychedelics to telekinesis, to mystical experiences. People
have been talking about mystical experiences for 1000s of years.
For example, do you as a scientist admit the validity
of mystical experiences? Of course not. You think they're all
nonsense? Why? Because of your methodological biases? How about psychedelics?
Do you admit the validity of psychedelics? Do you admit
that psychedelics can give you profound insights about the nature
of science and reality? No, of course not. You completely
dismiss that? Why? Because the scientific establishment that you're a
part of has brainwashed you into believing that that is
the case. Have you actually tried to psychedelic yourself now?
Probably not. And if you did, maybe you were like
a teenager or something he didn't seriously understand what you
experienced. See, there are hundreds of 1000s of, of UFO
sightings, even many credible ones. So you say well, Leo,
but you know, people who talk about ghosts, those people
they're not credible. They're just bullshit artists and fraudsters. Oh,
yeah. Well, what about your foes? I mean, you'll also
say the same thing about UFOs just say, Oh, they're
they're also all bullshit artists and and whatever. They're just
doing it for money. But then, how do you explain
when a credible person comes forward with a UFO story,
like somebody from the US Air Force, or the Navy?
We have plenty of examples like that. Reports. Government reports,
even from from various governments around you know, around the
world, we even have video footage, see, Ed, but the
problem was, see the problem with video footage of UFOs
is that any video footage of UFO that you see,
you're going to denies Israel, its validity, no matter how
real it looks. Even if it Israel, you're going to
deny it. Why not? Because what you say is real
in your mind, what counts as real is simply that
which validates your existing worldview. In a sense, nothing outside
of your limited worldview is considered real by you. Unless
it's like thrown into your face. Like if, if you're
sleeping tonight and a UFO abduction, you and Ainley rapes
you, then they'll change your mind about UFOs. But until
that happens to you, you're going to consider it unreal.
I mean, that's just how your mind works. So all
of this just goes to say that observation is not
as simple as you think it is. Because your mind,
like I said before, has an infinite capacity to deny
observation, you will always find a way to rationalize why
some observation isn't a legitimate observation, if that observation doesn't
fit the confines of your worldview. Next objection, but Leo,
show me some evidence that contradicts science. I mean, you're
here telling us that science has all these flaws and
errors in it. Sure. Surely you should have some evidence
of where exactly science is wrong. I will give you
a list of over a dozen areas in which science
is factually demonstrably wrong about nature. In part three, but
you have to understand the issue here. The issue is
not that I cannot provide you with this list, I
can, it's easy to provide this list. The problem is
that you will not believe the list. That's why we're,
we're building up to it. We need time to make
all these points and you need time to contemplate all
these methodological points. Because the problem is that as anytime
this list is presented to you, anytime some error within
science is presented, it's going to be denied. At least
any error that is significantly outside of the current paradigm
of science, you see, if there are errors within the
paradigm, those will be easily admitted, with some peer review
and stuff like that. But there are two types of
errors within science, internal paradigm errors, which are fine, because
they don't challenge the paradigm. And then there are errors
that actually challenge the whole paradigm challenge the foundation of
your worldview, those errors are virtually always denied. Because you
assume your worldview is true. Everyone does. Not just scientists,
everyone. That's just the nature of the mind. Right? So
the problem is not me giving you evidence, the problem
is what you consider as evidence. That's the problem. There's
a meta problem here. You see, you're still thinking about
all of this on the plane of ordinary conventional material
science. And I'm telling you that there's a higher plain
that you're not even aware of yet. There's a meta
level to this. What you count as evidence, and as
proof is the very problem that defines the paradigm. That
is the thing that needs to be changed and expanded,
then you'll be able to see more of the evidence
and more of the problems. Otherwise, you're locked into a
little bubble outside of what you cannot see. That's how
the mind works. We're talking about the mechanics of the
mind here is very tricky stuff. Next objection, but Leo,
isn't this just post modernism? If you're making this objection,
I almost guarantee that you don't understand what post modernism
is, you're just parroting the word. Because you've heard it
from somebody like Jordan Peterson or some other right winger,
reactionary, who themselves doesn't understand what post modernism is. Please
understand that Jordan Peterson does not understand post modernism, even
though he criticizes it, which is exactly why I criticize
it. But anyways, regardless of that, what I'm teaching here
and talking about is not post modernism, it's way beyond
post modernism. I have my own critiques of post modernism,
critiques of post modernism from above, but the critique that
you're making is of post modernism from below the Jordan
Peterson critique of post modernism is the critique of it
from below, you're critiquing it without understanding what you're critiquing.
post modernism is actually a complicated, an important intellectual philosophical
development. In the Western intellectual tradition, you should really study
what it really amounts to, and what its lessons are.
Now, of course, there are excesses and problems with post
modernism, I'm not saying it's all perfect. And it still
devolves into ideology for most people. But the actual developers
of post modernism, they were on to some very profound
truths about the nature of language and relativity, which are
virtually not understood by anybody in human society, or even
scientists. There are very important developments and insights about relativity
there and language from post modernism that you need to
take very seriously. But basically, the biggest problem with post
modernism is that it doesn't go far enough. post modernism
doesn't deconstruct itself. That's its biggest problem. So, so what
I'm teaching here is not post modernism. These are independent
points that I developed, many of them myself, after 1000s
of hours of personal independent contemplation. Of course, I've also
read post modernist works, and I do borrow some ideas
from them here and there. But largely, I derive most
of these independently for myself, through just my own contemplation
and thinking about these things. So just be careful parroting
these words, calling somebody a postmodernist, as if that this
is like a smear these days similar to calling somebody
as socialist or communist without understanding what socialism even is,
so just be careful with that. You could call what
I'm teaching you post post modernism. But even it's really
even beyond post post modernism, if you get what I'm
saying. And then the last point I wanted to make
here is that oh, yeah, it's, it's this. I mean,
if you're gonna criticize me as a post modernist, then
I get to criticize you as a modernist. Because I
mean, you're not a post post modernist. You don't even
know what post modernism is. If you don't know what
post modernism is, that means you're a modernist, or even
a pre modernist. And that's worse than a post modernists
who see this as the problem. It's not like you're
criticizing post modernism for a position of neutrality. No, of
course not. Your cuz your, your, your position is modernism.
Most, most hard material scientists are modernists in a sense.
And this is this is even dumber than post modernism.
So watch out. Okay. And I think this is the
last objection here, a lot of objections. But Leo, you
use science yourself, therefore, you're a hypocrite. This is a
very stupid objection. I'm sorry to say. It's the same
objection, as people say like, if you criticize America for
the Iraq War, which I did, I was an early
critic of the Iraq War. Even back when I was
like, in high school, the Iraq war never made any
fucking sense to me, I thought it was idiotic. And
so, so I was always shocked. Even when I was
like a teenager, I was shocked that someone could be
against a war. And that makes them anti American. Like,
it's absurd. This sort of this this dumb, right wing
idea of patriotism, where to be patriotic means that you
support everything that your country does, even if it's evil,
and wrong and devilish and, and, you know, kills millions
of people, whatever it is, it's right, simply because, you
know, we're Americans or something like this. I mean, you
see, this is this is your, the same thing happens
with science, people who are dogmatic defenders of science, will
call me a hypocrite for questioning science. But of course,
this is how we improve science. In the same way,
when I question American foreign policy, or whatever, or the
evils of the government, I'm not anti government, I'm not
anti American, I'm actually I'm pro American, when I do
that, because I want America to be better. Does it
make me a hypocrite? Likewise, a similar kind of foolish
critique is made by capitalists against socialism, like what a
socialist says that, hey, there are problems within capitalism, the
capitalist stands up and says, shut up, sit down, you're
being a hypocrite, because you, as a socialist yourself, are
participating in the capitalist system, you have a job, you
have a boss, you, you, you pay your taxes to
the government, which what you know, you, you know, if
you want, you know, if you want to, if you
want to be a socialist, why don't you just, you
know, take 90% of your paycheck and mail it to
Uncle Sam. That's what socialism is, right? But this this
criticism is, is absurdly naive and ignorant. Because, of course,
the Socialist is entangled with the system of capitalism, that's
the socialist critique, the Socialist has no option. You see,
it's not like the socialist can leave capitalism isn't like
the socialist can stop paying his taxes. And even if
the socialist, you know, to support his government, you would
think like, you know, if a socialist wanted to protest
the government, he might, a capitalist government, he might stop
paying his taxes, but of course, that he gets locked
in jail. So that's not going to really work. The
socialists goal is to reform the system to improve it.
And it doesn't help to send Uncle Sam 90% of
your paycheck. First of all, because you need that paycheck,
and a capital society to feed yourself and your family.
Second of all, because just because one person or two
people send 90% of their paycheck to Uncle Sam, this
doesn't change the system. What we need is a systemic
change of the system. According to the socialist, again, I'm
not arguing for socialism here. I'm just using this as
an example of the absurdity of this critique that I'm
a hypocrite for criticizing science. I'm not a hypocrite, I
can use science. I'm not saying that we will never
do more science. That's not my point. My point is
that there are corruptions within science that need to be
reformed. That doesn't mean I can't use technology now, because
I said that he was like your Leo, you should
stop using YouTube now because YouTube is run on fiber
optic cables that were made by science and you're criticizing
science, so no more YouTube for you. Okay, well, when
your government comes to take your guns away and oppress
you, I will tell you the same thing I will
say. You can't criticize the government, when socialist take over
the government and they oppress you, in the way that
you might imagine this sort of communist revolution. When this
happens, I'll say, Ah, you can't criticize the government. Because
you're anti American now. Because whatever the Orban does is
true by definition, you can't criticize it, you're being a
hypocrite, ah, you're part of communist America, you can't criticize
it, you can't rebel against it, because you're, you're a
hypocrite if you do. So, you see how absurd that
is? All right. So we've settled those objections. Now, let's
move on to some serious points. So there are many
problems within science that I've given labels to these are
my labels. The first one, I call the problem of
anomalies, how to deal with anomalies. So here's how this
one works. You see, the way science works is that
you have a theory, the theory tries to explain some
set of data. But there's always new data that is
being created by new scientists, and researchers. So let's say
we have a theory like general relativity, of Einstein. And
then some researcher comes forward and says, Hey, I found
some data, which contradicts Einstein's theory of general relativity, what's
going to happen? In practice, what's going to happen is
that the scientific community will look at that guy and
say, Ah, your, your instruments were probably just wrong, you
probably just did bad data. It wasn't replicated by anybody
else. So that's just justice, some noise. And in this
in the system, it doesn't really invalidate general relativity. Okay.
Then a few years later, a second guy comes forward
second researcher a different one, and says, I got new
data that says that general relativity is wrong. And scientists
look at that. And they say, well, that's just more
noise. Your instruments were just wrong, you didn't do the
experiment correctly. We're gonna ignore you. And this keeps happening
and happening and happening as new researchers come forward with
more data. The question is, at what point do enough
researchers come forward with enough data that you say, Okay,
wait a minute, maybe there's actually a problem here. Maybe
this isn't just noise. Maybe this is actually evidence to
the fact that the theory itself is limited and needs
to be expanded or entirely changed. This is the problem
of anomalies. The problem here is that there is no
objective criteria by which you can adjudicate these anomalies. It's
very easy to dismiss even legitimate anomalies that disprove a
theory as merely noise. And this is, in fact a
common tactic that is used by otherwise very intelligent people
and scientists. Is that because there is no standard? You
don't? I mean, how do you know when something is
noise? And when it isn't? You don't know. That's the
whole problem. That's why science needs to be done. But
it's very easy to use this excuse that something is
just noise. And then it can be dismissed or ignored.
Because, you know, part of the myth of science is
this assumption that science is just as clean, simple discovery
of facts and data. It isn't, for example, even to
calculate something like the speed of light, most of us
would, you know, layman would think that all the speed
of light is just a constant that we all know,
right? Like it was written in our textbook that it's
like 100,000, something feet per second, or whatever, I don't
know, I don't remember what it is, anyways. But that
number, if you actually look into how that number is
generated, that is a gross average, this average actually changes
with eras and decades, this number is changed and tweaked.
Because the reality is that calculating the speed of light
is a highly precise technical and noise, noisy experiment, you
never get the same exact result, with the same exact
instruments in the same exact places all around the world.
So you need hundreds of laboratories all around the world
generating hundreds of different data points, then those are averaged,
you know, somehow averaged together to generate some sort of
consensus number. That is sort of a ballpark. In the
end, it's not some precise number that was found in
the universe somewhere. It all depends on the precision of
our instruments, which changes with time and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And in fact, there's actually arguments that can
be made that the speed of light is technically not
constant, we just assume that it's constant. But how would
we know that it's constant? Well, we can't really know
because our instruments are too noisy, to really give us
a constant readout of the speed of light. So if
our instruments were perfectly accurate, we might be able to
actually tell that the speed of light is actually not
perfectly constant. But that that's just one of the hidden
assumptions of science. So so this anomaly problem is actually
a much bigger problem than most people realize. It's a
huge relativizing After to how scientific theories are developed, and
then challenged, and then up ended, and changed. The next
point, the next problem is what I call the recontextualization
problem. I've addressed this in an earlier episode of mine
called Understanding recontextualization. Go check that out if you want
a really deep explanation of what recontextualization is with many
examples. But here, I'll just give you a quick summary
in a single quick example. So usually, we assume that
facts are just a static, objective truth that you find
out in the world. Of course, this is not the
case. Facts only make sense within a context. So really,
there's two types of qualities of mind, you could have
a mind which is, we could say not context aware.
And you can have a mind which is context aware.
So a mind that is not context aware is a
mind that thinks that facts exist and make sense, independently,
have meaning independently without a context, a context aware mind
is a more cognitively developed advanced mind, which understands that
there's no such thing as a fact, outside of its
context. So therefore, context becomes crucial. And to and then
this, of course, then leads to the problem of recontextualization,
which means that you can have a certain set of
facts within a certain context, that didn't give you a
certain sense of meaning, and understanding of a situation. But
then the context can be changed or expanded, such that
the original facts even though they don't change at all,
their meaning becomes exactly the opposite of what it used
to be, simply by changing context. Most people and most
scientists are not seriously aware of this problem, and do
not take this problem seriously. But let me show you
how this works with a very clear, simple little example.
So here, I'm going to show you a picture. This
is a picture of a child with a boot on
his face, we might say those are the facts of
the situation. This is a picture of child abuse, right?
Sure seems that way at first. But then we changed
the context by zooming out just a little bit. And
here you can see that oh, what looked at first,
like child abuse is actually the child punching himself in
the face effectively. And the scene has basically changed its
meaning by 180 degrees, just a little bit of a
change of context. So this is the recontextualization problem. The
problem is that any scientific fact, can always be radically
recontextualized in the future, by zooming out, or discovering some
other variable, outside of the original context that the fact
was interpreted in, to give it a totally different meaning.
These recontextualization can be minor, but they can also be
very major, you can have a recontextualization that's so radical,
that it completely reverses the meaning of a thing. Black
becomes white, white becomes black. Good becomes evil, evil becomes
good. Real becomes unreal. lies become truth, and truth becomes
lies. This is what recontextualization makes possible. This is a
very serious, epistemic sticking point for science, because any scientific
fact, or theory or model can be radically recontextualize in
the future. In fact, I guarantee it will be just
a matter of time. The next problem is a big
one. Is this actually a category of problems, not just
one? This is the entanglement problem, the entanglement problem, there
are multiple sub problems within the entanglement problem. So let
me explain. The entangled problem basically means that because reality
is one singular thing, you can't separate it neatly into
parts. And this leads to all sorts of entanglement problems.
So for example, the measuring instrument that a scientist uses
to study nature is entangled with the data that it
produces. So for example, if you're using a telescope to
observe the moon how the moon looks to you through
that telescope is entangled with the mechanics of the telescope.
If there is a crash Back in the lens of
the telescope, you will see a crack on the surface
of the moon. And you might mistake that as a
feature of the moon, when in fact, it is a
projection of the instrument that you used that was entangled
with your data, we tend to assume that data can
just be independent of the instrument that is measuring it.
This is untrue. And by measuring instrument, we're not just
talking about microscopes and telescopes and radars and X rays,
and whatever else, we're also talking about human eyes, ears,
the entire human nervous system, that also counts as a
measuring instrument. Okay? The measuring instrument can be living, or
it can be inanimate, it doesn't matter. Any data that
is generated is going to be entangled with that measuring
instrument. So we tend to assume that the moon is
just the moon, it's just it's up there, and it
just looks the way that it looks. No, no, the
moon only looks that way, because of the eyes that
we're using in the brain that we're using to interpret
that into. See it, if you have an ant on
the on the ground looking at the moon, he's gonna
see something totally different, because his neurology has a different
entanglement with the data that is being generated. See, this,
this creates a very big problem for science. Another entailment
problem is that the scientific method is entangled with the
results and the data and the conclusions that are produced
by the method. There's no such thing as a scientific
result, without a specific method that is used to generate
that result. If you have a different method, you're gonna
get a different result. The question then becomes which methods
generate which kinds of results and which results are valid?
And this leads us to all the problems we talked
about in part one. Right. So there is no facts,
and there is no conclusions without proper methods. And all
methods are always under question. And there's always the question
of what are the limits of the method, there is
no infinite method, every method is limited, and finite. Sub
methods are better than others. That's very problematic. Figuring all
that out. Another entanglement problem is that, like we said,
in part one, individual statements of fact, of scientific fact,
are entangled with the entire scientific framework for evaluating that
fact. This is the point that client was making in
that long quote that I read to you. So what
this means is that a statement that you would ordinarily,
this is part of the myth of science, within the
myth of science, there's this idea that we can have
an objective scientific statement, such as I don't know, snow
is white. And that snow is just white. That's just
true. And this is independent of the scientific framework, it's
just true that snow is white. No, it's not to
determine whether snow is actually white. And that that that
is a true statement. To determine that you need to
bring in the entire scientific apparatus, your entire worldview, to
interpret and test with validity that statement. See, because you
need to Inter, you need to break down every word
in that statement, you need to evaluate what it actually
means that so your language is entangled also with the
statement. And because if there, if there are problems within
your scientific framework, then the statement will come out, not
true. Or false statements will come out true, depending on
your framework. And the frameworks can be different. There's no
single scientific framework, there's an infinite number of different ones.
And they're always constantly evolving. A further entanglement problem is
that the scientist is entangled with his experiment. There's this
again, part of the myth of science is this idea
that, well, the scientist is just a subjective guy, who,
you know, he comes into the laboratory in the morning
does his experiments, then he comes home at night. And
the science can be just a neutral observer of nature.
But of course, this is not how it works, because
the scientist is part of nature. Science is part of
nature. So the scientist and his mind is entangled with
the experiment that he's doing. This is very important to
understand. Many scientists are in denial about this. Because in
science, there's this ideal of separating oneself and one's personal
biases from one's experiment, such that there's a sort of
neutrality, but this is pseudo neutrality. It's not a real
neutrality, because the scientists ego mind is always running the
show, the scientists ego mind and his paradigms and his
frameworks, and even his personal ideas and prejudices and worldviews
and his religious inclinations, whatever he has his spiritual inclinations
or lack thereof, all of that is influencing how the
science how the scientist does the experiment, it influences which
experiments he does. It's not just how you do the
experiment is which experiment you even have a desire to
do. Given your prejudices, and and even your upbringing, you're
going to want to do different experiments, and you're gonna
want to do them in different ways. And you're gonna
have different ideas about what constitutes a valid experiment and
what doesn't. This is huge. All of the scientists, executive
decisions affect how these experiments are done. His personal beliefs,
you cannot separate the scientist from the experiment, you can
try. And I'm not saying it's not useful to try,
I mean, it's useful to try to be neutral. But
don't fool yourself into thinking that you can completely sever
these two things. When you do that, that leads you
to deny biases, and to pretend like you're neutral when
you're actually not. For example, if you were raised as
a scientist, in a very, let's say, you were raised
in a very religious environment, as a kid, you were
sent to Catholic school where the nuns beat you, and
treated you horribly as a child. And you were traumatized
by this and you really didn't like it. You didn't
like all the superstition of Catholicism and whatever. And then
when you grew up, and you know, you went to
university, you outgrew all that you became an atheist, you
became rational, hyper rational. And then you adopted this worldview,
and you said, You know what? All that superstitious stuff
is all nonsense. I'm devoting my life to rationalism from
this point on. And now you tell yourself, this is
now I'm doing science. And now I'm neutral about how
I do science. You're not neutral? Actually, what you're doing
is you've adopted this bias of hyper rationalism. And that
has been a reaction against how you were treated when
you were raised. And this now influences how you see
the world and what kind of experiments you do and
how you interpret the results of those experiments. See, it's
very significant. Don't underestimate how big of a corrupting influence
this is. Remember, your ego mind is running the whole
show your ego mind as they are prior to science.
Your ego mind has more power than science. Your ego
mind invented science as part of its function to making
sense of reality. I can't go fully into all that
here. I'm just pointing this a little bit out to
you. All right. The next entanglement is that reason, and
emotions are entangled. Again, there's this idea within science or
even in the in the popular culture, the myth of
science is that science is purely reason and logic and
emotions have nothing to do with science, they're completely separate.
This is utter horseshit. Of course, this is not true.
reason and emotion are entangled. In fact, your life is
mostly run by emotion. This idea that facts don't care
about your feelings is complete horseshit, in fact, that that
whole idea came from emotions. It didn't, it didn't come
from facts. The fact is that reason and emotion are
intertwined. And that in fact, it's emotions that run your
reason, not reason that runs your emotions. If you're a
highly rational person, actually, you're doing that from a position
of emotion attachment, not of true neutrality. That's, that's the
hypocrisy of what you're doing. That's the nonsense of what
you're doing. To be hyper rational is actually very irrational.
Because the only reason you're hyper rational because you're attached
to it on some deeper subconscious, emotional level. See, you're
emotionally reacting against emotions. You don't feel your emotions, you're
disconnected from your emotions. This makes you this doesn't improve
your science, this actually makes your science worse. Next, Next
entanglement is that of course, science is entangled with perception
with consciousness. If your perception and consciousness and nervous systems
changed, all of science will change. Science is completely contingent
on perception, consciousness and your nervous system. And you can
never disentangle those two. Science is also entangled with survival.
Scientists like to pretend that survival is is not something
that science is interested in science is interested in just
the raw abstract truths of nature. But in point of
fact, individual scientists themselves are strongly influenced by survival needs
and agendas, and so are scientific institutions. We'll talk about
that a little bit more here in a lot of
depth as we get into the topic of culture here
in a minute. Hold on for that. But really, survival
is such a huge function. It's not just a physical
survival of your body. I'm talking about survival of your
ego mind primarily even more so than your body. Um,
but if you really want a chance survival to understand
this point, I can't, I don't have time to get
into here, you need to go watch my two part
series called Understanding survival part one and part two, which
will explain a little bit of that. And then you'll
be able to see how science and survival are entangled,
then there's the entanglement of science and culture, these two
are entangled, such that you can't separate these two either.
And we'll be talking about this in a lot more
detail. Because culture is hugely significant for science. So basically,
the myth of science that scientists just find the truth,
and that cultural stuff is kind of like non scientific.
This is not the case at all. There's a there's
a deep connection between science and culture. And in fact,
culture corrupts science very, very easily. We'll talk about that
in a minute. So all of these entanglements and more
are very serious problems. They're ill irresolvable problems, you can't
just hand wave them away, they can't be ignored. And
ultimately, what this leads to is the realization that all
scientific claims are in fact perspectival, relative biased, and partial
due to these entanglements. These entanglements, Forbid science from being
objective, or absolute, or neutral. There is no such thing
as neutral, because your mind is completely entangled with science
and with reality and culture and survival and perception and
consciousness and everything else. If your mind is so entangled
with reality, as I say, then how is it possible
to do objective science? Of course, the answer is, it's
not. But most scientists are now about this, they think
they can somehow just sweep this entitlement problem under the
rug. Now, of course, there's going to be a counter
critique of Microsoft here. And objection that comes up here
is but Leo, you got this idea of entanglement from
quantum mechanics and entanglement is, you know, you're misusing this
idea. You're being a Deepak Chopra here, because you're talking
about entanglement and you're misusing quantum mechanics. And quantum mechanics
is talking about micro level phenomenon. You're talking about macro,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This stupid objection, this objection
is so fucking stupid. But okay, so But let's, let's
address it. So first of all, when I say entanglement,
I'm talking about a much broader problem than just quantum
mechanics. There is a form of entanglement specific to quantum
mechanics, which is very micro level and very technical. Even
if that even if all of quantum mechanics turned out
to be false, it would not have any bearing on
my discussions here of entanglement. Entanglement is much much of
a deeper problem than even what quantum mechanics understands. Ultimately,
entanglement is a feature a deep feature of reality, because
reality is one. So if everything is one, you can't
really separate things into parts, and therefore everything is entangled
everything else. That's ultimately what entanglement means. This has nothing
to really ultimately do with quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics is
just a single instance of a larger issue that stems
from the oneness of reality. But again, I can't even
explain I don't have time to explain why reality is
one. You just have to trust me on that for
now. But, but I know that that still won't convince
many of you rationalists and skeptics and materialists. So anyways,
I've prepared some ammunition here against you from from some
scientists. So I have a quote here from an interview
with Leonard Susskind. LEONARD SUSSKIND is one of the foremost
modern theoretical physicists in string theory, relativity, quantum mechanics. So
if you don't trust this guy, then I don't know
who you can trust. He's a he's high quality guy.
So anyway, so this is an interview. I'm taking this
quote from an interview with Lex Friedman and Leonard Susskind.
So the interviewer here, Lex Friedman, he asks Susskind the
following question. This is in the context of them talking
about quantum mechanics and entanglement. He says, quote, you are
observing stuff right now, on the conscious level. Do you
think there are echoes of that kind of entanglement on
the macro scale? Susskind response? Yes, absolutely. For sure. We
are quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room. If
we weren't, well, we wouldn't be observing it. On the
other hand, you can ask me, am I really comfortable
with it? And I'm uncomfortable with it in the same
way that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions,
my brain isn't wired for it, and quote. So there
you go. From the man himself, Leonard Susskind. So here
he's obviously saying that there is a macroscale component to
this entanglement, which is him recognizing what I'm saying. But
still not fully recognizing it. So when he says that
he's uncomfortable with it, it's actually there. very illuminating, because
what it shows you is that his his mind, and
this is correct. The dualistic mind is incapable of fully
grappling with the, with the radical implications of oneness, which
is what entanglement really is all that entanglement means is
just oneness ultimately. But theoretical physicists have a long way
to go to fully understand what that means. But if
that wasn't enough for you have some more ammunition and
some more quotes. So here I have a quote from
Werner Heisenberg, you trust him as a reputable source. Werner
Heisenberg, he says, quote, we have to remember that what
we observe is not nature herself, but nature exposed to
our methods of questioning. And quote, I have another quote
from the great physicist David Boehm, do you trust him?
He says, quote, both observer and observed are merging and
interpenetrating aspects of one whole reality, which is indivisible and
on analyzable. And, quote, I have more. I have a
quote for Max Plock. Do you trust Max Planck? Is
he reputable enough for you? You see, you're forcing me
to make appeals to authority. I don't want to I
would rather have you just contemplate the points that I
make without any appeal to authority. But because you're a
scientist, and you're scientifically minded, your whole game is appeals
to authority. I mean, that's what science is. It's all
appeals to authority. So I'm playing your game, by your
rules for your fav for your sake. Right. So Max
Planck says, quote, science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of
nature. And that is because in the last analysis, we
ourselves are part of nature, and therefore part of the
mystery that we're trying to solve. And a quote, I
have one more by John Archibald Wheeler, who's a very
significant theoretical physicist. He popularized the notion of black holes.
And he worked on information theory. And he says, quote,
that which we call reality arises in the last analysis
from the posing of yes, no questions and the registering
of equipment evoked responses, in short, all things physical are
information theoretic, and origin. And this is a participatory universe.
And, quote, a participatory universe. That's what I'm talking about.
You are the universe trying to understand itself. That creates
entanglement. And the last quote I have for you here
is from a philosopher, Morris Merleau. Ponty, and he says,
quote, the body mind is an open circuit completed by
the world. I like that one. So there you go,
I hope that settles the entailment issue once and for
all. entailment is real. And it's a problem. And it's
a huge relativizing factor for all data and facts. Think
of it this way. A scientist wants to approach nature.
A materialist thinks he can approach nature in the following
fashion, as though he was in a laboratory dissecting a
frog. He's just standing there neutrally observing, observing the the
frog, you know, cutting its guts open and and studying
it, and seems to work. But when you try to
start to understand reality, at a deeper level, you realize,
reality is not like dissecting a frog. Reality is I
actually like dissecting yourself. You can no longer just stand
there. As a neutral observer, now you're entangled with the
thing that you're studying. Now, every cut that you make
in your body, you feel when you are pulling your
own guts out, it's painful, it's dirty, it's nasty, it's
emotional. There's suffering involved. It's a survival problem. It's not
merely that you're a neutral observer anymore. And the problem
is, how do you stay neutral? How do you objectively
observe yourself when you are cutting your own self open
and pulling your own guts out? See, so, in practice,
what most scientists do is they carefully avoid what I
call the self reflection problem. They do science in such
a manner where science never fully gets to see its
own circularity and never looks itself in the mirror. So
most scientists are in the business of doing science sort
of externally in the world out there, but they never
connect the dots such that they realize that their own
mind is connected with the science that they're doing. If
they did, that's when they would start to get into
this loop of self reflect reflectivity, which then will lead
them down this rabbit hole of deconstruction which ultimately will
destroy all of science and all of reality if you
get to the very bottom of this I have this
sort of vortex. So part of the myth of science
is the idea that you can do science objectively and
neutrally that science is a neutral, impartial perspective. It's not,
it's highly partial. Every aspect of scientific method is partial.
If you say science is rational, that's partial, that's biased,
you're gonna get certain results based on that rational scheme
that you've invented, and you project it upon nature. You're
forcing nature to fit into the rational Spock's, so it'll
appear rationalist to you, because that's the box, you've put
it in. Likewise, if you're a materialist, and you look
at nature, through the materialist lens, all you're gonna see
is materialism. That doesn't mean that nature is material, it
just means that that's how you look at it. That's
what you project onto it. And you reject everything outside
of that little box that you look at through. See
any kind of method that you invent any kind of
rules for science, any kind of standard, any kind of
norms, all of them are going to be finite, and
all of them are going to limit your view of
reality. And we're going to create bias. This is inevitable,
absolutely inevitable. And this, this right here is a mortal
blow to science as an objective enterprise. It's impossible for
science to ever be an objective enterprise. If you think
it is, you're participating in the myth of science. And
that's exactly what we're trying to deconstruct. Science is not
objective. Science is not neutral. Science has very serious and
specific methodological biases. And you might say, well, Leo, so
what? Not so what, it's hugely significant, because that means
any methodological biases you have will cut off portions of
reality, you're going to be blind to them. Those portions
will be true and real, but you won't be able
to see them because of the lens that you've chosen
to see reality through. You got that. Okay, next point.
Now, I have a thought experiment, for those of you
who argue that metaphysics and epistemology and philosophy is irrelevant
to science, this thought experiment, if you really contemplate it
for a while, this is the final nail in the
coffin of the idea that philosophy and science are supposed
to be separate. And independent. Here's the thought experiment. Imagine
that you're in a really high quality VR simulation Majan
you were born into it. Matrix style. This simulation is
amazing. It has objects, and it has a whole world
flourishing world like a video game world, with people and
animals and trees and stuff to study and examine. And
so you're still fascinated by this virtual world that you're
living in, of course, you don't know that it's virtual,
you're living in it. And you decide to become a
scientist within this virtual world and to study this virtual
world. Okay, so you devote your entire career to that
you spent 3040 years doing that. And then as you're
sitting there studying the simulation, I come in, like me
comes to you one day and says, Hey, you know,
you're really good at studying the mechanics of this simulation.
But have you ever thought about what the simulation actually
is? That you're studying? What is the actual substance? What
is the truth? What's really going on here? What is
what is this life that you're living? Have you ever
thought about this? And the scientist says, of course, as
they typically do, ah, that's not that's outside my domain
of concern. I don't care about that. I'm a simple
scientist, I just do my experiments. I just study this
phenomenon. I don't care about anything else. I don't care
about philosophy. Those are those are, those are questions beyond
science. Science does not care about that. These these are
issues of truth and sciences pursue truth. Science is just
a simple pragmatic activity. All we're doing is we're just
mapping some variables in life. And that's it. See, science
is humble. And so you hand me waved me away.
So of course I leave because I can't convince you
otherwise. And then, one day after a long, rich life,
the simulation ends. And a new simulation begins. You're in
a totally different world. Imagine switching video game discs, you're
now in a totally different world. Totally different Vironment, totally
different people, animals, creatures, lot physical laws, every absolutely everything
has changed. Now, here's my question to you. What has
remained of your science? All of that science that you
spent 40 years doing? Is any of it true anymore?
What has remained nothing. Nothing roommates. Everything you thought was
true. was only relatively true. Maybe it would have been
useful for you to wonder about the bigger picture, rather
than just getting locked into your little endeavor of studying
the laws and mechanics of the particular simulation that you
were in. That's the thought experiment. Contemplate that for yourself.
Now, people will misunderstand me here, people to think that
oh, Leo, so are you saying that we're inside of
a VR simulation? Are you saying reality is a simulation?
Actually, no, I'm saying exactly the opposite. I, I am
conclusively saying that you can become conscious that reality is
not a simulation. You are definitely not in the simulation,
you can become directly conscious of this. But you may
be in a dream. All right, next point. The next
point is that all scientific truths are relative. And of
course, you're wondering how can this be the case? Well,
the previous example, give you a little taste of it.
But I want to just make this very explicit, a
little bit more. So. Here are all the relativizing factors
of scientific truths. scientific truth is always relative to culture,
society, era, language, mental categories, your paradigm or method, the
instruments that you use to collect your data, your neurology,
which is related to your DNA, your perception, your intelligence,
your mental capacity, your ego, mind and your state of
consciousness. All of these factors, completely relativized any truth of
science, such that if all these factors were changed sufficiently
enough, any truth of science would no longer be true,
it would be false. So whatever give me give me
some Tell me some statement that you think is absolutely
true. Within science. What do you think is absolutely true?
It it can't be false. What do you think that
is? All of it can be relativized. That statement that
you're thinking of can be changed. You might even say,
Leo, what about one plus one equals two? That has
to be true in every conceivable universe, even now, it
doesn't, you're wrong. It doesn't have to be true in
every conceivable universe. That's just something you're assuming. The only
reason that you think one plus one equals two is
absolutely true in all conceivable universes, is because actually, of
the particular state of consciousness that you're in right now.
If your state of consciousness changed, and your neurology changed,
one plus one equals two would not be true for
you. So what it is, and so whatever every other
scientific fact. So, so yeah, that's a problem for science.
See, scientists really don't like admitting this. They really don't
admit to this. Because they want their discoveries to be
absolutely true, but they aren't. Here's some examples of how
this works. So early humans might have said that objects
fall down the snap salute, truth objects fall down. Of
course, once you zoom out, and you see the larger
context, you realize that objects don't fall down, down, it's
just a relative notion, to the local curvature of the
of the earth that we're on. And then in fact,
there's no such thing as down because down every direction
is down. When you're in space. There's no There's no
down down was relative. So the idea of your soil
down, it seems true only when you're on on the
surface of the earth. And then it's not true when
you're in outer space, or on some other planet. Or
even when you're on the opposite side of the globe.
Now, up becomes down. You might say today is 12
o'clock, that's a scientific statement. Is it really? No, it's
not. It's 12 o'clock here. It's one o'clock. One state
over it's two o'clock in the next country, and so
on, of course. So obviously, that's relative time is relative,
Einstein showed that. How about the Eiffel Tower, you might
say the Eiffel Tower is 800 and or 984 feet
tall. That's the number they gave me on Google 984
feet tall. So if the Eiffel Tower is 984 feet
tall, that's an objective fact. Right? Nope. Completely relative. According
to Einstein, depending on the speed at which you're moving
at, relative to the Eiffel Tower changes. Its length, if
you're moving to the closer you move to the speed
of light, the Eiffel tower will look shorter and shorter
to you. So that measurement of 984 feet that assumes
that you are within the same inertial frame as the
Eiffel Tower. But of course, that's that's going back and
change easily could change. How about the statement that snow
is white? That's true, right? No, of course not. It's
relative. If you take LSD snow is not going to
be wet anymore. If you have a neurological disorder where
you can't see colors correctly, people have those, then White
is not gonna look white to you, it might look
gray, might look purple, who knows could look any color.
In fact, you don't even know what the word white
even refers to what you call White might be my
black. This is called the reverse spectrum problem. And in
fact, there's no way to scientifically resolve this problem. So
this is just a little taste of how scientific statements
work. Any scientific statement that you think is absolutely true.
If you think about a little bit harder, you'll realize
that it's relative, and conditional, and can be changed as
long as we change the the context within which you're
holding it. All right. Next point. The number one enemy
of truth is belief. And science is 99%. Belief and
authority. When I make this claim, some people don't understand
what I'm saying. We are how could it be that
science is 99%? Belief? Well, how could it be otherwise?
Of course, it's belief what is science but belief? It's
9%. Believe, if you don't understand the science is 9%
Believe. The reason you understand is because you don't actually
understand what a belief is. See, most people misunderstand belief
to be either crazy religious ideas. They call that belief,
or belief in their mind is something that isn't true.
But that's not what belief meets a belief. And here's
where you need to do some entry introspection work. You
can introspect and actually contemplate what a belief is, and
have a direct experience of what a belief is. Feel
yourself holding a belief, any belief, and you'll, you'll soon
realize what beliefs are. So for example, you believe that
I'm real. I could just be a computer simulation here.
I could be just an AI invented by Google, teaching
you this stuff. But you believe I'm a real human,
you've never seen me, but you believe I'm a real
human. That's a belief you hold. You believe that the
Earth has an has a rotation that it rotates every
24 hours, you believe that you have no direct experience
of this. You've never seen it actually happen. You've never
tested it or verified in any way you believe that
the Earth rotates. Now you'll you'll object here and you'll
say, well, Leo, but this has been tested by scientists,
and has been validated. So it's not a belief. No,
it's still a belief. In fact, you have a belief
that it's been validated by scientists, because you've actually never
checked whether it was validated by scientists, you just believe
that. So you have a belief wrapped inside of a
belief. Now, you have many other beliefs, you believe that
your parents, for example, are actually your parents? You've never
checked, have you? Have you actually gotten a DNA test?
Maybe you have, in which case is no longer a
belief. But there's still a belief that the DNA test
is actually valid. That's a belief. So you have to
trust the DNA test. But let's just assume that all
DNA tests are valid. And in which case, if you
did get a DNA test that told you that your
parents are actually your parents, then now that's no longer
a belief. But did you actually do that? Probably not.
You say, Well, Leah, but I could I could I
bet you if I, if I went and I checked
the DNA of my parents, I didn't I didn't do
it because it costs money. But if I really wanted
to, I could do it. And then I they would
be my real parents. That's a belief. Because if you
haven't done it yet, then it's a belief. See? You
believe that your your hand is made out of atoms.
You've never seen these atoms. You've never actually done any
experiments to prove these atoms. You believe it? You say?
Well, Leo, no, Leo. I've seen pictures. I've seen YouTube
videos of atoms, where like, they take a microscope, a
scanning electron microscope, zoom, they zoom into, you know, whatever.
And they actually can see little individual ball atoms, and
I've seen pictures like that. So atoms are not a
belief. But that's a belief. You're believing that those microscopes
and those pictures are showing you atoms which correspond with
actual stuff inside your hand. That's a belief. You're believing
those videos you saw earlier but but that was real
science, it was verified by a bunch of peer reviews
people at Harvard. Yeah, that's a belief and also an
appeal to authority. See, science is a pyramid scheme of
belief, built upon belief, built upon belief so tightly. That
once you find yourself inside of this pyramid, you can't
see any way out. Every belief is justifying every other
belief. And it becomes extremely convincing. This belief system then
takes on a reality of its own. My question to
you is, have you actually ever done any signs in
your life? Ever? For most people, the answer is no.
Isn't it amazing? That over 90% of the entire population
of this planet has never done a single science experiment
ever. And they take all of science as true. Isn't
that amazing? This is utterly mind blowing when you really
contemplate this. This should shake you to your boats. Just
this simple fact. I'm not I'm not making any outrageous
claims here. I'm just stating basic facts about science. facts
that they really should have taught you in school. But
of course they didn't. For obvious reasons. You see, science
has this very interesting problem. I call it the overleveraged
problem. Science is way over leveraged like a bank. I
use this term from the banking industry, when we have
economic collapses, how do they happen, banks become over leveraged,
they lend out way too much money, they don't have
enough actual gold or currency and their reserves to cover
any kind of loan defaults. Or if everybody makes a
run to the bank, they don't have enough money to
cover everybody. And then the bank can collapse and the
economy can explode, it can be bubbles and the sorts
of stuff. And the reason this over leveraging happens is
because a bank is always supposed to keep some sort
of minimum amount of currency or gold in their coffers,
so to speak, in their vaults to to insure against,
you know, a run on the bank's money. And the
federal government usually sets that at like 10%, or 5%,
or 20%. I don't know what the number, what the
rate is right now. But usually, it's somewhere around maybe,
let's say 10% of the bank's total assets need to
be actually tangible. So it's not just you know, fake
money. But some banks become so over leveraged that they
only have like 1%, hard assets, the rest 9% is
just loans and, you know, certificates of deposit notes, kinds
of things like this intangible assets, and so they become
very vulnerable. Well, science has exactly this problem. Because if
99% of science is belief, which it is, and if
over 90% of the population on the planet has never
done a single science experiment, do you see the problem
here? The problem is that there's so much, there's so
much room for error, that you would never even know
is there. Now, you're gonna see below, all the majority
of science, this is the majority of scientific beliefs, they
can all be validated, and they have been validated by
peer review, and so forth. That's a belief. See, that's
a belief. But even if it's true, even let's grant
it to you, let's say the majority have been validated.
First of all, again, it's a belief, you're just, you're
just blindly believing that second of all, a majority is
still not that much. Even if 95% of all scientific
beliefs have been validated by peer review, that still leaves
a 5% that haven't, that's very significant. 5% is very,
very significant. Those 5% can kill you. So I'm not
claiming that the majority of scientific beliefs are empirically fallacious.
I'm claiming something more subtle than that. I'm claiming that
there's a subtle and very deep overleveraged problem here. And
this creates a sort of a bubble until it creates
these intellectual bubbles that will burst in the future when
someone like me comes along and challenges them sufficiently enough.
And this is what creates paradigm shifts in science, as
Thomas Kuhn talks about, in his classic book on the
scientific revolutions, but so you know, his the history of
science is the history of scientific revolutions that are caused
by these intellectual bubbles. Because it's a pyramid scheme. What
did you think science was? It's a pyramid scheme. And
so lurking within this pyramid scheme are gargantuan truths, which
no scientists understand. And you don't understand, because you believe
they don't exist. Because you just basically buy the entire
pyramid scheme, and you just assume that the whole thing
is true and real. And that's the end of the
story. And the only thing left is just a little
bit of minor, you know, adjustments on the outside. But
no, there are monstrous errors and problems and truths lurking
within the very center of that pyramid scheme that you've
never personally tested. You see, this is the whole problem
of knowledge, is that if you really want to build
up a very giant knowledge base, the larger your knowledge
base becomes, the less testing of it any individual can
do. And this means that the potential for dilution of
the entire culture and mass of people becomes larger and
larger and larger and larger and larger. And that's exactly
what's happened over the last 500 years what science there
is a special part of science which goes extra untested,
which is the meta scientific parts of science, the the
metaphysical and epistemic and, and methodological assumptions. These especially go
on validated untested and just believed in blindly. Also, I
want you to notice that institutionally, science is indoctrination. Pretty
much like religion. Children are in fact, this is a
factual statement. Children are in fact indoctrinated into science for
12 years. And then even more if they go to
university. Why do I say indoctrinated? Is this a slur?
No, this is an accurate factual statement. Because in fact,
children are not taught epistemology, or metaphysics or alternative worldviews,
or alternative methodologies. In school, for the first 12 years
of their growing up, they're not taught this at all.
They're not taught philosophy. They're not taught different ways of
looking at the world. None of these none of these
things are ever mentioned. Science is learned by children through
brute rote memorization. Do you remember science tests, chemistry, biology,
physics. Whatever other science you took, all of it was
just blind memorization, you didn't derive a single biological fact,
you didn't drive a single physical fact you didn't drive
derive a single chemical fact. And even those few bullshit
experiments that your chemistry teacher might have forced you to
do, while you were just, you know, probably laughing with
your friends and dicking around you were just like, write
numbers down, you know, make a numbers out of your
ass while you're doing doing those experiments. You weren't actually
thinking about anything while you're doing those experiments. You didn't
actually do any real science there. You didn't actually validate
anything or invalidate anything. You didn't test anything. You were
just following instructions. Even when the chemistry teacher told you
to do the experiment. He or she gave you a
list of steps to follow an exact method and you
just follow it like a blind fucking monkey. That's what
you did. And you generated exactly the kind of results
that he wanted you degenerate. You weren't seriously testing anything.
So truly, you were indoctrinated into science? Exactly. Like a
Muslim is indoctrinated into Islam in a Islamic madrasa religious
school you know, they will beat Muslim children with sticks
in Madras is forcing them to memorize the Quran, word
for word, the entire fucking Quran. Well, that's essentially what
happened to you. In the West. When you were learning
science in school, they did this to you for 12
years. And you don't even know that they did this
to you. You just assume that this is how it
is, and you took it for reality. This is highly
significant might say, Leo, but why? Why does this matter?
This is not important. Isn't education good? It's highly significant
at the point that I'm making because your first 12
years of development, from age six to let's say, 18.
These are the most formative years of your mind. Your
entire sense making apparatus of your ego mind is formed
during this time. If you give me 12 years to
indoctrinate a child into anything I want. I can make
that child believe anything for the rest of his life.
He'll believe that it's real and true. This is imprinting
of the mind Do not underestimate the significance of this
indoctrination. It's, it's utterly radically profound. Your entire worldview is
shaped by this. You are virtually incapable of thinking outside
of this worldview. You were indoctrinated with materialism, realism, objectivism,
rationalism, skepticism, whatever else will other isms. And you're not
smart enough to think outside of this. This is the
operating system that you are now using to make sense
of the things that I'm telling you, every word coming
out of my mouth has been run through that operating
system, and being corrupted by all of the faulty assumptions,
metaphysical and epistemic and mythological within that system that you
were indoctrinated with that you never questioned. And if you
don't think that's a significant problem, you're kidding yourself. As
you were learning science, you have never ever validated the
scientific method itself. You never, it never even crossed your
mind to test it. Never, never. And as you went
to university, it never even crossed your mind to test
it. Because you were too busy cramming for tests, drinking
beer with your buddies, smoking weed, going to parties, and
just barely struggling to maintain your grades. That's what you
were doing. You weren't doing a serious investigation of anything
true or real. You never gave a fuck about reality
or truth ever, in your entire educational career. It was
all memorization and belief. And, of course, now you have
to hope you have to hope it was all true.
Because as soon as you start to realize that some
of it wasn't true, well, that that's those little seeds
of doubt, which are gonna grow and grow and grow
until the whole thing collapses. See, if you allow me
I can easily design a school curriculum that will teach
students false science, I can invent a system equivalent to
science, which is completely false. And I can teach it
to children for 12 years. And they will become so
convinced of it. By the end of those 12 years,
that they will be utterly irredeemable for the rest of
their lives, the majority of them, you will never be
able to convince them of an alternative system. That's the
power of imprinting on a young mind. And guess what?
It's happened to you. See, all this time you were
laughing thing had happened to somebody else, to those crazy
religious people, to those Mormons, to those Scientologists to those
Muslims to those evangelicals. It happened to you. It just
happened in a scientific way. That doesn't mean it's true.
That's just an alternative worldview. See, science is a social
cultural activity and game. Modern science is actually impossible without
society, culture, bureaucracy, institutions, funding schools, books, language, standards, norms.
Science requires building consensus. This requires bureaucracy, massive bureaucracy, Sciences
Authority. 100% depends upon this consensus that is built. This
building of consensus is a highly social, psychological, sociological, cultural,
political and survival activity. This consensus is not built on
truth. It's built on what is useful for the survival
of the institutions and the bureaucracy that is doing the
consensus building first and foremost, truth is always a secondary
concern. The number one concern of any bureaucracy is the
survival of that bureaucracy. And that is, of course true
for all universities, schools. And science. Scientifically people, scientifically minded
people love to defend their belief system with this idea
of peer review, as if peer review will save you
from the problems that I'm talking about Leo, but this
stuff was peer reviewed. Leo, why don't you get your
work? You're reviewed, if you're so smart, and you're talking
about all this stuff, Hey, where's your peer reviewed research
study? This is such a stupid objection. Because peer review
is the very definition of confirmation bias and question begging
and circular logic. Peer review is pure groupthink and collective
ego. When you are submitting your article for peer review,
who are you giving it to, to review to peers
like you, and who do you consider a peer, a
peer is a relative notion, you only call those people,
your peers who you consider doing valid science as doing
valid science. And, of course, who you consider as being
a valid scientist is, of course, completely circular, depending upon
whatever methodology you have. So whoever agrees with your methodology
is going to be your peer. And anybody who doesn't
read the methodology is not going to be your peer.
So all that you're doing when you're going through peer
review as a scientist, is you're giving your paper and
your research to somebody who already has exactly the same
metaphysical and epistemic and methodological biases and prejudices, and worldview
as you do. And all that they do is they
look at it and they evaluate, and sure they can
reject your work based on the fact that your own
work doesn't even fit your own, you know, stated a
metaphysical and epistemic and mythological standards. That's all that peer
review does. Peer review doesn't review the meta science, it
only checks whether your science just accords to sort of
the traditions of your field. That's all that peer review
does. It's pure groupthink. It's a pure circle jerk. Don't
go asking somebody to peer review. This is so stupid
when you do that. See, you might be tempted to
do that. Well, Leo is making some good points here,
but I'm not sure. So I'm going to take this
video, I'm gonna go show it to a scientist that
I know and ask him is Leo Right? Or maybe
he's wrong. I'm gonna go take it and post it
on Reddit and ask some reddit people Hey, guys, is
maybes Leo's right or wrong? Give me your opinion. What
do you think? Or I'm gonna go give this to
my university professor and ask him, What what do you
think? Do you think he's right or wrong? It doesn't
matter. You can't get truth by asking somebody else for
truth. Because how do you know you can trust that
person? The only reason you respect that person or trust
that person's opinion is because you think that he fits
within your pre existing paradigm. So all you're doing is
you're just question begging, when you're asking somebody else to
validate my work, the only way to validate my work
is to actually sit down and validate it yourself, test
it yourself, contemplate what I say yourself, don't ask somebody
else. Mainstream academia is spiral dynamics, stage orange, green, roughly
in between there somewhere, it's not even fully green, it's
not fully pluralist. It doesn't even understand post modernism fully,
it doesn't understand relativity fully. So all of your peer
review will be happening within the spile dynamics stage, orange
green paradigm. If you're gonna be presenting yellow ideas, or
turquoise ideas, to a circle of peers who are stage
orange and green, they're not going to understand what you're
talking about. You will pass their peer review not because
what you have to say is not true, but because
they themselves are not at a cognitive level of development
to understand the depth of what you're saying. You see,
scientific consensus is orthodoxy. I mean, what you're doing when
you're doing peer review is is analogous to the following
absurd example. Imagine that I'm a fundamentalist Islamic person, and
you come to me and you say, well, Islam is
all full of bullshit and nonsense. And I say, No,
it isn't. Islam has been peer reviewed. Just last year,
I took the Koran to 20 different slopes, Islamic scholars,
and they all and I asked them all I was
I was very skipped. I was, you know, I took
your concerns seriously, because, you know, you said that there's
some bullshit in Islam. And I took that seriously. I
thought, yeah, maybe there is some bullshit. So I went
to 20 different scholars of Islam presented to them, you
know, my critiques and objections. And they all said, Actually,
Islam is truth. That that's, that's what peer review is.
Because what you consider as an expert is, of course,
completely entangled with your paradigm. So the peers and experts
that you consider as valid experts, are those people in
this case, who already Islamic, you know, who have been
born and raised and into this Islamic worldview. And so
of course, they're going to think it's truth, and they
will have all sorts of valid justification. Since an evidence
and also to back it all up, just like scientists
do. You see, the problem with scientific peer review is
that when you're giving it to your peers to review
your your work or whatever your peers were indoctrinated through
the same education system that you were the same metaphysical,
epistemic and methodological biases and assumptions and blind spots and
beliefs, all of those came to us from from your
culture. You see, you have to understand that all of
science, the only reason you know science is because of
culture. There's no other way you could know science without
culture. And chances are that you and your peers grew
up in the same culture, basically, the same scientific subculture.
So you believe all the same shit. So any blind
spots within your paradigm are going to be spread throughout
all your peers. Of course, of course. You see, the
trick with changing and evolving science is that changing science
requires changing culture. And changing culture is a marketing problem.
And this is something that scientists are in denial about,
because most scientists are not marketers. They don't like marketing.
They don't they don't want to associate their science with
marketing. But actually, it is. Changing culture requires a culture
war, a marketing war, massive marketing dollars need to be
invested into an idea in order to get a spread
through society to change across society. And this is especially
true when the idea is not beneficial. To the low
consciousness survival needs of the people in society, the majority
of people. scientific consensus has a very long tail, it
takes about 50 to 200 years for a scientific idea
to fully percolate and make its way into culture. So
if some radical truth is discovered today, it might take
100 or 200 years for that radical truth to permeate
all of culture and be taught in schools and to
be accepted by laymen. People assume that the hard part
of science is discovering the truth. Now, that's the easy
part. The hard part is getting millions of unthinking people
who don't do any science to understand and accept the
truth. This requires a culture war. This requires a massive
marketing campaign. Marketing and science are entangled. You can't disentangle
these two. And if you think you can, you're fucking
deluding yourself. And this is going to lead to huge
problems for you. There are in fact, many scientific truths
that were discovered 100 years ago that have still not
percolated through, into mainstream culture. One of them, for example,
is just Einstein's general relativity. I mean, people know about
Einstein, and they've heard about general relativity, but people don't
understand that time is relative. People still walk around thinking
and so time is absolute. Now, of course, the professional
scientists understand this, but but the layman don't. 90% of
90 probably 95% of humans on the planet don't understand
that time is relative, they don't understand that distance is
relative. They believe that objects actually have an objective length
to them. They don't say that length is relative to
your velocity into to the speed that you're moving it.
That's just one ideal example of one idea and another
is quantum mechanics. I mean, people have heard about quantum
mechanics they loosely know about quantum mechanics. But the epistemic
and metaphysical implications of quantum mechanics were so radical in
the early 1900s, that today, even today, most people don't
understand these these implicate I mean, quantum mechanics almost virtually
completely debunked. Materialism and realism. People still don't understand that
in culture. By large today, and even many professional scientists.
Still don't understand it. Go check out my two part
series called quantum mechanics debunks materialism where I go into
much depth about this. I even called you know, like,
for example, Sean Carroll Sean Carroll is a well respected
professional physicist at MIT. He studies quantum mechanics and other
such things, quantum field theory, yet he he himself still
does not understand the metaphysical and epistemic implications of the
things that for example, Niels Bohr or understood, Werner Heisenberg
understood and their colleagues Max Planck understood, still still doesn't
understand it. Why not? Because he's bad at doing philosophy
of science. He's good at doing science, but he's bad
at doing medicine. Because like I told you, the doing
of science is a completely separate thing from understanding science
as a system, and epistemology and metaphysics, these are different
things. Just because you're good in one doesn't mean you're,
you're good in the other. So be careful with that.
See, science is conservative by its nature, why is science
conservative, because there's a sort of a filtration problem. There's
a lot of bullshit out in the world. And science
is supposed to be a system for filtering out all
the bullshit in the world. So the way it does
that is by erecting a strong barrier or shield, it's
almost like an antivirus system on your computer, you know,
erects a very strong shield such that no virus can
come through. But also, it has false positives, which means
that good software and webpages also get blocked accidentally, because
they're thought to be a virus, but actually they aren't.
So science has this, this problem, erects its shield too
tightly. In a sense, it gives a lot of false
positives. It excludes many aspects of reality, which are true
and real, and important, but don't fall within its narrow
mythological biases and constraints that they consider, you know, valid
science. They do this because for them, because science is
built upon authority, the entire pyramid is is built upon
authority, they need to maintain their authority, that's the most
important thing for scientists is to maintain their authority. As
soon as there's any doubt about a scientist reputation, or
about his research, anything he's done, he's over, he's got
lost his whole career. So science is all about maintaining
this bastion of authority. And the way he does that
is by being extremely rigorous, overly rigorous. In fact, the
justification here is that science is trying to preserve the
purity and truth of the system of science. But actually,
of course, as these things go, since life is so
counterintuitive, it ends up backfiring, it boomerangs on them by
erecting your shields too, too strictly. And defining your method
too narrowly, what ends up happening is that actually, the
thing that you think is supposed to preserve the purity
of your system ends up backfiring and actually undermining its
purity, it becomes the root of the corruption. That's how
tricky this stuff is. being conservative is not the same
thing as pursuing truth. These are different things. If you're
bias is to be hyper, hyper conservative, and to only
allow those things that have been triple and quadruple proven
beyond a shadow of any doubt, that's fine, you can
create a system like that, but just realize how it
will how narrow and limited that is, you cannot then
assume that you have a complete understanding of truth. There's
a lot then you have to admit that is outside
of your little narrow, rigid formulations. There's a sort of
a rolling edge to science that people overlook. Let me
explain how this works. The rolling edge of science works
like this. There's usually some genius, radical revolutionary scientist who
thinks totally outside the box, and outside the norms of
all culture and all society. He's usually considered to kind
of weird and wacky, and maybe even a little bit
crazy by normal people, because he thinks outside the box.
But thanks to that he makes some groundbreaking new discovery
that recontextualizes the entire status quo of established science. Then
what happens is that there's a battle that ensues as
this idea is put forward. It's so radical and so
threatening to people that people of course deny it and
they attack this person. They attack him as being a
nutcase as being crazy or stupid or whatever. But eventually,
that generation who denies it, it dies out slowly, over
time, it dies out. And then a new generation is
born, who's more open minded, and they generally come to
accept this new discovery. But this only happens after much
battle. This is not a smooth process. Because this new
worldview, a new new paradigm is seen as dangerous, crazy
and insane. Think, for example of Charles Darwin, when he
proposed the theory of natural selection evolution. At that time,
it was a crazy, insane, dangerous idea relative to the
standards and culture of the time, which is kind of
more religious. And this idea that you know, man evolved
from apes, and so fourth, this was very, very much
a no no for people that didn't like it. And
they didn't accept it. The only way we move forward
is people died a new generations were born, who were
not indoctrinated into those old ideas but into the new
ideas. So anyways, the old generations die off the truth
finally prevails, and a new generation is born with the
new worldview. At but but there's a problem here. The
new generation now just takes it as obvious takes it
for granted. The new Gerrish thinks that evolution was obviously
the true all the time, it was easy to develop
this, and in that original problem, and the new generation
now becomes dogmatic about this new paradigm, just like the
old generation was about the old paradigm. And they use
the new generation to deny the next new paradigm, new
discoveries, new discoveries beyond evolution, they're gonna deny those on
the grounds that evolution is what's true. And the cycle
continues over and over and over throughout all of human
history, which with every generation dying off and the new
generation, being born, and taking things for granted, taking epistemology
and metaphysics for granted. And nobody is acknowledging the meta
structure of this entire thing. Everybody is taking the entire
mechanism for granted. And so the problem just keeps repeating
itself over and over and over again throughout human history,
and we keep making the same stupid mistakes. epistemic blunder
after epistemic blunder metaphysical blunder after I miss metaphysical blunder,
ignorance and dogma after ignorance and dogma, ideology after ideology,
the content of the dogma changes, but the structure is
always more dogma. Dogma, on top of dogma belief on
top of belief authority on top of authority. The only
thing that really changed between religion, the religious worldview, and
the scientific worldview is simply that the content has changed.
The mechanisms have largely all stayed the same. There have
been many discoveries within science in the last 100 years,
that have completely undermined materialism and realism. Including discoveries from
quantum mechanics, biology, general relativity, cosmology, chaos, theory, logic, Mathematics,
Philosophy of Science. All of this has undermined classic modern
science. post modernism also has done that, to some degree.
But the myth of science persists, because it takes a
long time for culture to change. The majority of humans
today still do not understand the lessons of quantum mechanics,
or general relativity, or chaos theory. Or, for example, the
works of Georg Cantor with multiple sets of infinities, infinity
of infinities, or the works of Google, and his incompleteness
theorems, or tar skis, incompleteness theorems, or what post modernism
is 99% of humans do not understand these things. Even
many scientists don't understand these things. They might understand them
superficially, but they don't, they haven't fully contemplated the epistemic
and metaphysical significance of these things. Because oftentimes, they just
tell themselves, there are none. There are no implications, there
is no significance. But there is. The history of science
is full of these sorts of epistemic blunders, which are
denied and then whitewashed after the fact. I'm going to
give you one very powerful example that I think just
encapsulates this entire point. And that is the example of
a man by the name of Ignace similes. Maybe you've
heard of them. I'm going to read here a little
quotation from Wikipedia. about some of these, is it some
of these are some wise, I don't know. It's a
weird Hungarian name. I'm going to call them several weeks.
All right. So here's the quotation. Quote, Ignaz. Simone Weitz
was a Hungarian physician and scientist now known as an
early pioneer of antiseptic procedures. Some always discovered that the
incidence of child bed fever could be drastically cut by
the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Child bed
fever was common in the mid 19th century hospitals, and
often fatal. Some always propose the practice of washing hands
with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847 while working in the
Vienna General Hospital, despite various publications of results were handwashing
procedures reduced mortality to below 1%. Some of these his
observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of
the time. Time and his ideas were rejected by the
medical community. He could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for
his findings, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion
that they should wash their hands and mocked him for
it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Somalis supposedly suffered a
nervous breakdown and was committed to an asylum by his
colleagues. He died 14 days later, after being beaten by
the guards. Some of these his practice earned him widespread
acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed
germ theory and quote, this is in reality, how science
deals with contrary theories and worldviews. The Myth of science
says that if you just discover the truth, we will
accept it, just prove it to us, and we will
accept it. That's the myth of science. In reality, what
happens is, you discover a truth, you try to present
it to your colleagues, your colleagues, because they've indoctrinated in
the old paradigm, they think you're an idiot. And they
might even think you're crazy. And they might even put
you in insane asylum and kill you. That's the reality
of it. A very similar situation, by the way, happened
with Georg Cantor with mathematics. gare Cantor discovered some groundbreaking
new mathematics of infinity, roughly actually around the same time
of SEMO. He's a little bit later, around the turn
of the century there. And, and his his mathematical colleagues
thought he was insane. He basically ended up losing his
mind. Also, I think in an insane asylum. This is
not just one example. There are many, many, many examples
in science similar to this. Science routinely. talks about how
willing it is to better itself and to evolve itself,
when in practice isn't historically, all these errors are whitewashed
away. And we'd like to pretend as though like, oh,
well, Galileo, that happened back in the 19th century. It
doesn't happen today. It happens today. It happens today. Science
is constantly moving the goalposts this notion of science, can
you see that it's it's an elastic notion with every
generation, the boundaries of science, which used to be small,
are expanded a little bit, a little bit, a little
bit. And the people who expand these boundaries are the
revolutionaries, the crackpots because the notion of a crackpot is
relative to your boundaries. So your boundaries, expand, expand, expand,
but these the expansion of these boundaries, this happens through
a through a challenging battle process. It's a culture war
process. It is not, it is not some sort of
cordial process where you come up and you just present
the truth to people and say, oh, yeah, that's the
truth. Okay. You've convinced me. Okay, I accept it. Now.
Let's go have some cake and tea together? No. That's
not how it works. Because the truth is threatening to
ego minds. Ego minds are threatened by new models and
theories of reality, new possibilities of reality. This scares people.
It scares people to tell them that the Earth is
round when they thought it was flat. It scares people
to tell them that time is relative and doesn't exist
when they thought it was absolute and did. It scares
people to tell them that, you know, mathematical truths or
projections of their own mind are not objective. It scares
people to tell them that they evolved from apes. It
scares people to tell them that all of science is
99% belief and a pyramid scheme. This is scary to
people, they don't want to hear this shit. And of
course, they shoot the messenger. It's a story as old
as human civilization. Science is not immune to psychology, prejudices,
biases, attachments, ideology, arrogance, cultural norms, groupthink, closed mindedness and
survival concerns. Scientists have to worry about survival all the
time. Institutions, scientific institutions have to worry about survival all
the time. What I mean by survival here is for
example, if you're a scientist, you have to worry about
your career. You have to worry about maintaining your reputation.
You have to worry about publishing papers, you have to
worry about peer review. You have to worry about not
pissing off your peers. As soon as your reputation is
tarnished as a scientist, you're done. If you get labeled
as a crackpot, you're done, which is why you're not
allowed to have true free rein to go out there
to explore weird new alien phenomenon that is foreign to
the established paradigm of science. You're not really allowed to
challenge the paradigms of science from within the scientific establishment.
Because all of the people who are your peers, their
careers depend upon their reputations. And so all together, you
have come together to defend each other's reputations. Of course,
this is all done subconsciously and under the surface shut
that such that you will pretend as though you're really
pursuing truth, when in fact, what you're doing is you're
just saving your own careers. Of course, there's no science
done really outside of institutions. The majority of science is
done inside of major institutions who have huge survival biases
and concerns that take priority over any matter of truth.
If you're working at Caltech, MIT, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford,
Stanford, wherever these institutions they are, they have massive budgets
of billions of dollars, 10s and hundreds of billions of
dollars. Endowments they have to they have to they have
to make sure that this money Where does money come
from it comes from donors. That means the donors only
get to these institutions because these institutions give the donors
authority and legitimacy. That means the institution like MIT needs
to preserve its authority, and legitimacy. That means it can't
have any crazy crackpot scientists on its rosters. It fires
those people, it doesn't hire them in the first place.
The only scientists that MIT will hire are the people
who already confirm all of their pre existing methodological, epistemic
and metaphysical biases. These institutions are not primarily concerned with
truth, they're primarily concerned with donors and survival. Which is
why they charge their students so much for attendance and
why they charge so much for books and all this
other stuff. This is all corruption within science. Now, I'm
not saying you can't do some good research within these
institutions, you certainly can. These are valuable institutions, they have
their purpose. I would rather trust some research coming out
of MIT than I would from, you know, some Christian
organization, or some Islamic organization, or some right wing organization
or think tank, of course, but understand the limits. When
you have consigned your life to working at MIT, you
have written a tacit agreement that you will play by
the rules and jump through their hoops and do everything
they want you to do. And you will only generate
the results that fit within the paradigm that they have
drawn for you. And as soon as your results do
not fit in that paradigm, you will be kicked out.
You need to understand that when you go into MIT
or some other academic institution. The problem is that once
you've already spent, you know, many years trying to get
those pieces, those those positions are so difficult to get
these tenured professorships are so rare people are fighting over
them so hard, you know, PhD students, students, and so
forth. It's such a brutal and competitive system that you
get just to get that position, you're going to be
so thankful and lucky that you got that position that
you finally know pay off hundreds of 1000s of students
in student loans, and you can finally maybe support yourself
and your you know, your children and your family, that
you're going to forget all about the truth by that
point. And you're just going to want to stay within
the narrow confines of the parameters, they lay it lay
out for you. And then you will your ego mind
will rationalize to you that oh, well, Leo, the truth
doesn't even matter. It's not important anymore. Science isn't about
the truth. Science is about doing what's within little circle
that MIT has drawn for me, that's what will become
your science. And that will be the the nice little
shock collar that MIT places upon you. And as soon
as you wander off the territory, they're gonna, they're gonna
push that button. And this is, this is how your
mind keeps itself jailed. And once you've sunk in, you
know, 10 years into a PhD $100,000 in student debt,
and you've finally gotten your position, are you going to
be in a mood to question that? No, you're way
too bought into it. You've been completely indoctrinated by all
of the norms and values and standards and methodologies and
metaphysics and epistemology and culture of that institution. You're going
to be a complete loyalist and you're going to be
fully convinced that what you're doing and what your solution
doing is good and normal and proper and truthful and
there can't be anything better. Why do you think I
didn't become an academic? I would have become an academic.
When I was 20 years old, and university I seriously
wanted to become an academic, professional philosophy professor and get
a PhD, I was seriously going to do it until
I talked with some of the philosophy professors at my
university. And I realized that this isn't truth. They're not
interested in truth. They're just surviving in their profession. That's
what they're doing. They're not doing real philosophy, this is
horseshit. And I had too much integrity to put myself
into that system. Now, of course, the critics will say,
Oh, that's just because you couldn't cut it. That's just
because your ideas are unscientific. And that's why you couldn't
get in there. Well, that's one way to frame it.
Another way to think about it is that, actually, you're
never going to discover the truth through academia. Academia is
not about truth. Academia is about maintaining a certain status
quo, and playing the function that serves within society, and
the education system at large. Our education system is not
designed for truth. If it was, there wouldn't be all
the tests, all of the memorization, all of the cramming,
and all the other ways that things are taught, both
in schools and in universities. Our entire education system is
utterly corrupt, and in the dark ages. It's laughable. It's
laughable. Our children are not even taught basic epistemology and
metaphysics. For 12 years, is a complete travesty. This is
not education. It's horseshit. And you've been indoctrinated into it,
recognize that expertise, credentials, status, popularity, success, none of this
is equivalent to truth. All of that is authority. It's
all an illusion. Another problem with science is, of course,
the funding problem. Science is happening within late stage capitalism.
Today. late stage capitalism corrupts the entire University System. Where
does funding go? Within science? How do you get funding
for serious research? Funding mostly goes to practical issues that
have survival payoffs. No one is interested in giving you
millions and billions of dollars to answer non useful questions
or to answer weird mystical, new agey questions and other
sorts of things like that. Most science these days is
done actually, not even in universities, but inside of corporations.
What are these corporations care about? They don't care about
truth at all. They care about profits, they only do
research for profit, whatever is profitable, whatever the public wants,
whatever will produce a better technology, that's where the money
mostly goes. So true, science is actually starved. Scientists are
not allowed to freely choose the things they want to
study. Without any pressures, there are all sorts of hidden
and implicit pressures within the university research system and also
within the corporate research system, to do the kind of
research that makes money and this corrupts the research. That
doesn't mean the research is wrong. I'm saying something more
profound than that. I'm saying that I'm not saying that
the research necessarily wrong, you know, I'm not saying just
that, like, yeah, you know, like a tobacco company will
will make fake research to justify that, you know, smoking
doesn't cause cancer. I mean, that's obviously you know, devilry
and, and not science. But, but even shy of that
kind of, you know, worst case scenario, there's still a
very big problem. Because when you grow up doing research
in an environment where the entire thing is motivated by
a profit motive, and whatever is most profitable and more
most successful and produce the best technology that consumers want,
you're going to start to think of science as that
kind of endeavor to you, that's what science will become,
science will not become about the truth anymore, or about
exploring new domains of, of nature and reality that perhaps
maybe don't have practical implications, or maybe they do, but
you know, only a century down the road. Or maybe
they're not going to be immediately profitable for a decade
or something. You're not going to your what you think
of a science is going to be so narrow, as
to like be consumer, basically consumer products and goods. That's
what you're going to define science as, which means there's
going to be all sorts of new domains of reality,
which you're not going to properly be able to explore
and understand. And that's going to limit your methodology. It's
going to then end up turning into sort of an
echo chamber in a self reinforcing feedback loop for your
metaphysics and for your epistemology. Because see, nobody in the
government or in your corporation is going to fund you
researching new metaphysics or new epistemology. GE they don't give
a fuck about that stuff. Hardly you care about it
assigned the most your colleagues don't care about it. If
you are one of those scientists is care about it.
Who's going to support you? Who's going to fund you?
If somebody gives you going to give you a $10
million grant to go research, you know, something like a
paranormal activity or phenomenon or something, or some mystical experiences
or psychedelics? No, of course not. And as science becomes
more complicated, the experiments become more expensive. They require more
labor. This means you need large teams, large teams mean
more groupthink. It requires larger budgets. larger budgets require also
more groupthink and more being beholden to donors. And of
course, your donors want to pay off. They're more like
investors. They don't care about the truth, your donors and
investors, they care about their profit margins. There's a lot
of amazing research that we could be doing on all
kinds of non material phenomena, that is not being done
right now. Because there's simply no funding for it. You
know, something like creating a particle collider can cost $10
billion, and take 10 years to build one. That's a
huge investment. All of that just to discover a new
subatomic particle. Imagine if that kind of funding was available
for mystical research for psychedelics, for paranormal phenomena, there will
be groundbreaking discoveries made. But of course, it's not immediately
profitable. And most scientists don't even think that this is
a fruitful or worthwhile thing to do research on, because
they think that is pseudoscience. Alright, let's talk about another
problem here. In science, there's a problem that I call
the reductionism problem. It's also associated with how universities are
structured. Last second, I got something stuck in my throat.
Lots of stock. Alright, so science is becoming increasingly more
over specialized, which means that people are becoming narrow, narrow
experts in fields. This is like putting blinders on. It's
very problematic if you're trying to understand the nature of
reality at a deep level, because that can only be
understood holistically. So as science is developing, people are becoming
so specialized that they do not look outside the domains
of their fields. And they don't care about anything outside
their little field. This makes everybody basically stupid and ignorant,
even though they can be very good experts at the
particular thing that they're good at. See, science likes to
break nature apart into fields and subfields. And they think
that these are natural divisions within reality, they're not, there's
nothing natural about this at all. So you could have
biology, chemistry, physics, then within physics, you can carve that
up into you know, quantum field theory, plasma physics, you
know, laser physics, gravitation, general relativity, string theory, blah, blah,
you can see all these subfields, those subfields will have
their own subfields, and so on, and so on, and
so on. It gets very, very technical. This technical science
is important. I'm not saying it should stop. Of course,
we need technical science. But also, if your concern is
understanding the nature of reality, and doing groundbreaking research, then
the problem is that all the subfields once they're subdivided,
they're not communicating with each other properly. And nobody is
responsible for what the entire says system is doing, and
how its conceiving of reality. So basically, the branches aren't
properly communicating with each other. And also, all of science
is not properly communicating with other epistemic modalities beyond science.
Science is not communicating with shamanism shines is not communicating
with mystics, with Yogi's with meditators with psychedelic users. And
I can go on and on and on. Because everybody
considers that, hey, you know, I'm not responsible for that.
All I do is I do plasma physics, I do
plasma physics and everything else doesn't matter to me. And
you know what all I do, I do evolutionary biology.
That's all that matters to me. And somebody else says,
All I do is I do psychology on mentally disabled
people. That's all I do. I don't care about anything
else. When you take that kind of attitude, to, to
science and to understanding nature. This is, this is this
is so problematic. Can you see this how problematic This
is? Because what this results in is a very fragmented,
techno kradic sort of picture of reality. You've artificially subdivided
reality, all these little fragments, and nobody is seeing the
whole picture. This makes people easily, easily fooled. Because actually,
reality is not simply the sum of its parts. Reality
is more than the sum of its parts. And what
we deeply and badly need within science is a breaking
up of many of these boundaries to get all the
branches communicating with each other, such that if you're in
if you're doing plasma physics, that's fine. You can do
plasma physics. But you can't just say, well, anything outside
of plasma physics, I don't care about. Because the ego
mind will latch on to this and use this as
the perfect defense mechanism against ever deconstructing your own mind
and getting to the truth. You see, because anytime someone
like me comes along and says, Hey, you know, I
can teach you about meditation and psychedelics and other things
like that. And you're a plasma physicist, you just say,
Ah, I don't care about that doesn't apply to me,
all I care about is plasma physics. That's all I
know. I'm not going to be arrogant and pretend like
I know stuff outside of that. And every, every scientist
can do that. And in this way, every scientist can
be both smart and dumb. At the same time. They
see the little picture but they don't see the big
picture. This is part of the reductionist bias at the
heart of materialist science. Material Science basically assumes that if
we just subdivide reality into little pieces, we can reduce
it all down to smaller and smaller parts. And eventually
all of it will boil down to just physics. This
is an utterly unscientific and false assumption. You cannot reduce
all of science to physics, and to bouncing atoms, or
strings, or quanta, or anything like this. This is absurd.
I gave that example in part one where I talked
about putting a frog in a blender, blending it up
and just studying the the juice the frog juice. And
thinking that you understand the frog, no, you cannot understand
a frog that way. That's one way to understand a
little bit about a frog. But there are many other
ways to understand a frog. The reductionist delusion is to
think that if you put a frog in a blender
and study its juice, that you will understand everything about
the frog, because the frog is nothing but the molecules
that are inside of it. That's the rational. That's the
reductionist delusion. It's very problematic. And this, this infects almost
all disciplines of science. There are way too narrowly focused.
One of the strengths that I have in that I'm
not in a university system, I can do independent research
is that I have the complete freedom, my mind has
the complete freedom to research everything I want. This is
extremely powerful, I'm able to read about all sorts of
crazy fields and theories and like that nobody, that no
other scientist or researcher would really have the luxury or
freedom to do, given how specialized they have to become.
See, this is one of the advantages that I have
by not being an academic, which is how allowed me
to run circles around academics, and to understand reality in
such a broad and deep and profound way that they
can't even comprehend as possible, because of the system they
have signed themselves up into. You see, this is not
an accident, I deliberately saw when I was 20 years
old, this problem, and I deliberately said no to this
problem. And I made myself independent, I worked, create my
own businesses so that I could pay for my fucking
self. So I don't have to be relied on advertisers,
or be relied on investments or other kinds of survival
forces that would corrupt my work. Now, that doesn't mean
I'm immune from corruption, of course, I can be corrupted
to, I have to be careful, I'm always cognitive that
I'm, I am capable of corruption. But also, I take,
I take that very seriously. I've tried to mitigate those
things. And I feel sorry for many scientists who have
consigned themselves to that bureaucratic system. Now they're stuck. Now
they're wedded to it. And, in fact, they're so wedded
to it, that they're not even going to admit to
themselves now, they don't have the luxury of admitting to
themselves, the system is corrupted. Because literally their children won't
be fed. If they leave the system, they've invested so
much time and energy into that system, what would they
do? How would they do work outside the system? How
would you even do work as an independent scientist? How
would you get funding? How would you publish your work?
I mean, it's only now becoming possible with YouTube and
the internet, it is now becoming possible, more and more
viable for you to be an independent scientist. And actually,
you know, many of the early scientists, people like Newton
and Leibniz and and so and, you know, even Einstein,
you know, these were independent scientists. They weren't working in
some large institutions, which is why they were able to
make amazing groundbreaking discoveries. This is becoming more and more
rare with late stage capitalism, because all of our resources
are are being funneled up to the top of society
such that if you want to actually be independent, you
got to you can't be independent because you got to
All suck up to some to some capitalist who has
a bunch of money and then you gotta become his
bitch. And he doesn't care about the truth at all.
He cares about more money. So of course, the solution
to this reductionism problem is holism. But the problem with
holism is that it's not financially rewarded. You can get
paid very well as a specialist. Companies need specialists, businesses
need specialists, Universities need specialist who needs a generalist who
needs a whole list? Well, they do need them, but
they don't recognize that they need them on what you
would call a whole list. But it's hard to survive
as a whole list, you can be a lot more
successful as a general as a as a specialist. The
next problem is a problem of falsifiability. There's this false,
ironically, this false idea within the myth of science, that
every theory and statement about nature needs to be falsifiable.
This is a common objection that is made against religious
people and so forth, you know, like, someone will say
that Allah is exists, and a scientist will say what,
but that's not a falsifiable claim. How could you ever
falsify a law? Because all all has no, supposedly like,
no predictive power, right? And there's also this idea that
every every theory needs to have predictive power. And if
it doesn't, then it's not a real, legitimate theory. And
it doesn't even make sense. There's this even further delusion
within science that a question that has no predictive power
is not a bad, it's not even just a bad
question. It's actually meaningless. The idea that it's a meaningless
question, you know, like a question, you could ask a
question like, What is existence? And some scientists are so
pragmatic, so deluded with pragmatism that they will tell you
that that's not even a valid question to ask, it's
not even meaningful? Because the answer to what is existence?
It can't exist. Such an answer can't exist, and it
would have no practical purposes, and it would be unfalsifiable.
Well, this is bullshit, of course, because it's question begging.
The fact is, is that you don't know what can
and can't be falsifiable in the future, things that don't
seem like they're practical today, end up being practical. 100
years from now, or 200 years from now, in fact,
the history of science is filled with examples where things
were discovered these discoveries. At first, they seemed like they
were impractical, that they were pointless, that they were insignificant,
that they had no meaning to them whatsoever. And then
100 years later, 20 years later, we discovered that actually,
oh, my God, this is the most amazing thing. It
has so many practical implications. How could we have been
so stupid? See, the mistake is to try to judge
the practicality of of a truthful thing. You don't know
the practicality of every piece of truth. Some truthful things
are very practical, others are not so practical. But also,
since science is all about connecting different pieces of truth
together more and more and more and more. As you
connect things, you find hidden meanings, hidden relationships, and then
one truth helps you to build upon the next and
the next and next. So even when a truth isn't
immediately practical or useful, it might be a stepping stone
to one more truth, or two more troops above it,
truth above it, which actually ends up you know, creating
a technological revolution. This happened, for example, with non Euclidean
geometries. When non Euclidean geometries were originally discovered in mathematics,
people thought it was just sort of a triviality. It
didn't really matter. Because it was it was mostly just
sort of a little kind of like a little quirk
of mathematics, but it wasn't important because it didn't apply
to nature. Because nature was obviously just Euclidean. Well, today,
of course, we know much better. And today, non Euclidean
geometries are extremely powerful, have been used for general relativity,
and have been used for all sorts of you know,
string theories. And God knows what else that I'm not
even aware of. That's beyond my, my expertise to talk
about. But But yeah, so I mean, and this, this
is going to keep happening. A lot of times the
criticism, one of the biggest questions I get is that
I talk about all this abstract stuff, and people just
say, Leo, it's all so abstract and theoretical. There's no
practical consequences to any of the things you say. In
fact, you probably said yesterday about this series, you probably
said, Leo, all of this talk about science, but ultimately,
it's completely irrelevant, because it's impractical, right? You've said that
you've thought that? Well, actually, there are huge practical implications
to the things I'm saying, but what you have to
understand is that they're not going to materialize immediately. You're
not gonna be able to see them immediately. It might
take you five or 10 years of studying this stuff
and pursuing it and working on it, contemplating it and
doing practices and exercises before you get the full fruit.
The practical fruit I have this work and these ideas.
But people are so myopic today that if they can't
see if their ego can't see an immediate practical survival
advantage to some idea or some teaching, they immediately just
dismiss it as stupid. This is, this is not scientific,
this is just idiocy. This is pure idiocy. This is
why you have to separate very carefully between survival and
pragmatism and truth. Truth can have all sorts of hidden
value to it, that you never expected you'll be amazed
at how practical truth can be, but in the long
term, not in the short term, you have to be
farsighted, not nearsighted. Another try to see how much time
I got left here long. Okay, I got a little
bit more material for you here. Another problem within science
is the problem of infinity and incompleteness. So if you
don't know this yet, reality is infinite. Science is in
denial about the fact that reality is infinite. Science treats
reality as though it's finite. Science does not understand infinity,
and doesn't know how to deal with infinity. The problem
with infinity for science is the following If reality is
truly infinite, as I say, and it is, this is
a verifiable claim, then no finite method could ever describe
infinity. That means that any formal method, including mathematics, any
axiomatic system, any scheme of logic, or any scientific method,
is going to be finite. And if it's finite, by
definition, it is incomplete and it is incapable of grasping
the infinite. Any method you articulate will be incomplete. Which
means that your method will always be expanding. But you're
also going to resist the expansion. Which means there's always
going to be truths that lie outside of your method
that your method cannot prove or cannot access. That's just
the nature of what happens when you have infinity and
then you have a finite circle within infinity. The finite
circle does not encompass the entirety of infinity. So the
bottom line is that the scientific method lacks the requisite
variety to handle reality. The only way to handle reality
is with infinite requisite variety. This is a concept from
cybernetics. That means, if you want to truly be the
best scientist, you can, and you want the most truthful
and powerful in pure science, your method and your approach
to the study of Nature needs to be so creative,
so open, so flexible, so radical, that it has equal
requisite variety to nature itself, which is infinity. The more
closer to infinity your mind is, the less limited imposes
on itself, the more it will be able to understand
nature. Scientists still do not understand the significance of this
problem. Scientists treat nature like It's finite. And the reason
they do that is because their methods are finite. So
it's actually very convenient. Their methods cannot access infinity directly.
And therefore, to them. It seems as though nature is
finite, because hey, if I can't access it with my
methods, and I believe my methods are complete, then and
there's no problems with others, then that means that infinity
doesn't exist. Of course, this is question begging, and gross
confirmation bias to blind spot. Now, of course, you might
wonder, well, Leo, but how do you know that reality
is infinite? Prove It, if this is true, but of
course, this begs the whole question. Because the notion of
proof is a finite notion. Any notion of proof you
have is going to be finite. And infinity, by definition
is not finite. It's infinite. So actually, it's impossible to
prove infinity. Now you'll say but that means infinity isn't
true. No. Infinity is true. It just means that it
can't be proven, at least not according to your narrow,
narrow confines of what proof meets. Actually the notion of
truth will always outstrip the notion of proof. Proof is
a smaller subset of thing than truth. That means there
will always be things in nature and in reality that
are true, but cannot be proven. If you want to
know more about that, go check out my episode about
the metaphysical implications of girdles and completeness theorem. That's the
title, where I explained that in more depth, it's a
it's a very important result that most scientists do not
understand the significance of most scientists are under the false
impression that nature can be quantified, analyzed, dissected, explained, and
reduced and formally proven, it can be formalized the idea
of formalization. You can take nature and you can symbolize
it and formalize it. This is false, you can't do
this. Google proved that you can't do this with mathematics
and logic. And, of course, it extends beyond that Tarski
extended that beyond mathematics and logic. And of course, just
you can use common sense to extend it beyond that
as well. It is possible to demonstrate to yourself that
reality is infinite, but that requires your consciousness, you can't
do it indirectly through peer review. You can't do it
indirectly through through a formal proof like a mathematical proof
or something like that. But you can do it directly
with your consciousness. Using the methods that I talked about
elsewhere, you can become directly conscious that reality is infinite.
And then you will clearly understand why science is finite.
See, science requires personal insight and deep intuitive, holistic intelligence
to function at all. This is something again, many scientists
and rationalist don't comprehend. People think that they can understand
nature through a mechanical meat grinder process. This is not
true, you can't do that. That's extremely limited. All the
greatest scientists and their achievements came from direct personal intuitive
insight, holistic pattern recognition, beyond anything formalized or explicable. It's
completely nonlinear, and you can't write rules for it. And
all proof, the whole notion of proof beyond just being
relative, the notion of proof hinges on personal intellectual capacity.
Proof assumes that your mind can have enough capacity for
personal insight and intuition to grasp the truth of the
proof. You see, this is not a given. People have
different capacities for insight. In the same way that for
example, a donkey has a much lower capacity for insight
than a human, which is why math and science does
not exist for donkeys. Have you noticed this? It's so
obvious, but again, overlooked, and most scientists don't understand this.
There is no science or math for donkeys. There's no
numbers for donkeys. There's no gravity for donkeys. There's no
quantum mechanics for donkeys. There's no Adam's for donkeys. Now,
most people assume well, that's because the donkeys are stupid.
And the donkey can't understand these truths. And therefore, the
donkeys just aren't aware of them. None are real. It's
not the donkey is too stupid and isn't and isn't
aware of them. For the donkey. These things literally don't
exist. They exist for you as a human, because of
your level of consciousness and your neurology and the projection
and the invention of these things that you've done with
your mind. Science is an invention of the human mind.
It's a projection of the human mind, which is why
it doesn't exist for donkeys. And likewise, for you to
be able to understand infinity, it would be as problematic
as trying to explain arithmetic to a donkey trying to
explain infinity to a rationalist, materialist, reductionist realist, who is
stuck within spiral dynamics stage orange, is as difficult and
impossible as trying to explain arithmetic to a donkey. It
can't work. But if you evolve your level of cognitive
development, to post rational and you have some, you know,
breakthrough direct consciousness awakenings, you can have a direct experience
of infinity yourself. You can't do it through peer review,
though, if you insist on doing it through peer review,
you're always going to Miss infinity because infinity is not
a thing that comes to you through peer review. Because
peer review is finite, not infinite. So you have to
be smart enough to understand this. So sort of the
contradiction with inside Science is that, although science likes to
claim itself as this very hyper rational, objective method, in
reality, what makes the heart of science function and what
has generated all the amazing breakthroughs in science has been
intuition. This soft, fuzzy thing, it's not hard, and it's
not rigid. And it's not rule based. It's intuition. There's
a great scene from Star Wars, the very original Star
Wars, at the end, where Luke is flying through the
trench and the Death Star, and you know, he's using
his, all the all the other pilots are using their
navigating computers to you know, to try to shoot that
bomb that proton bomb or whatever it is, into the
death hole, that star, you know, exhaust port. And, and
you know, the scene, right? What happens. Everybody is using
their marketing computers, but they're all missing, they're missing. They're
missing, they're missing. And then Luke, he's about to use
his targeting computer, and he's about to take the shot.
And then he hears he hears opioids tell him something
like, you know, use the force, use the Force. And
this is the this is a perfect example here, because
the force is supposed to be this mystical, anti scientific
thing, right? But then, of course, Luke turns off his
computer, everybody else is like, No, you're crazy. Don't turn
off your computer, he's going to, you know, he's going
to screw up the whole mission. Because they don't understand
what the force is. But then he uses it, boom,
gets the shot, saves the day. That's actually how science
works. Science isn't done through a fucking targeting computer. It
is not done. By sticking nature into a meat grinder
and getting truth out the other end. It is done
by highly intuitive minds that are using the Force. And
then it's backwards rationalized as having been objective and rigid
and hard science. But in truth, it was done using
the Force. All the greatest scientific discoveries of mankind have
been highly intuitive leaps of consciousness, not achievable through a
dumb mechanical process, as the rationalists. And the materialists would
like to have you believe this is a delusion and
part of the myth of science that we are deconstructing?
All right, that's it for this episode, I still have
more to say still have a lot more stuff. Make
sure you stay tuned for part two. In conclusion, let
me just say this look, all that we're doing here,
all that I'm doing here is I'm just questioning every
assumption ever made by science. That's it. That's it. I
don't have an ideology. I don't have an agenda. The
only thing I did in my life is I said,
I want to know the truth. And I'm willing to
burn everything. To get to the truth. I don't care
how sacred it is. I don't care if it's religion,
I don't care if it's science, I don't care if
it's logic, I don't care if it's mathematics, I will
burn the entire fucking world down to get to the
truth. That's all I said. And that's what I've been
doing. That's it. And whatever remains, after throwing all of
this stuff into the fire, whatever remains, that will be
the truth. That's all that we're doing here. Don't be
afraid, afraid to throw things into the fire. Have faith
that the truth will survive the fire. The only thing
that will burn away is the bullshit. So don't be
afraid of of questioning science, science, and truth. These are
not fragile things. They benefit from rigorous questioning. You get
that? Again, it all comes down to where do your
loyalties lie? Do your loyalties lie with some sort of
human invention? Some human bureaucracy, some human institution like science
or religion or government? Or do your loyalties lie with
something that is prior to humans? Truth? That's the value
of truth is that it was there before humans. It's
non human. It's not a human invention. That's the amazing
thing about truth. Whereas everything else that you run into
in society is all human made bullshit. Humans spin bullshit.
Better than spider spin silk. This should be obvious to
you. If you've spent even a couple of decades here
on this planet, how much bullshit is spun? And don't
let anybody convince you that scientists do not spin bullshit.
Scientists are some of the greatest bullshitters out there, which
is why in fact they bullshit you into thinking that
they don't bullshit you. That's even more bullshit bullshit double
dose of bullshit right there. So watch out bullshit is
everywhere. Be careful. And of course you bullshit yourself too.
So it's not like they're guilty of it. This isn't
some conspiracy theory. Scientists are not conspiring against you to
bullshit you scientists are bullshitting themselves as much as they
are you. This is the human condition we're talking about.
There's no group of elites who are trying to control
the world with bullshit. Every individual human is generating enough
bullshit, such that we end up in the state that
we're in, everybody is full of shit. Tara, it's pretty,
pretty obvious what to think about it. I'm not saying
anything revolutionary here. It's just that most people are in
denial about it. All right. Anyways, we still have a
lot more left. So stick around for part three. If
