hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to become a
leader leadership is a very very interesting topic and I
didn't realize how deep this topic went until I took
some seminars I really started to delve deeper as far
as research goes into this topic and one of the
first things you start to realize when you start studying
leadership is that you really need to be a leader
in order to live a full life leadership is not
just something that's reserved for CEOs or some corporate bigwigs
like we would stereotypically think in fact what I'm trying
to recognize the more I study it is that the
greatest joys in life come from leadership because the greatest
joys in life can only come when you're contributing to
the world and to contribute powerfully to the world you
really need to become a leader so this video is
relevant for pretty much everybody leadership is not just for
big business leadership is for yourself as in leading yourself
that's where all leadership starts leadership is also for small
businesses even if you have a one-man shop business or
just a couple of people in your business leadership is
very relevant leadership is important with your social circle with
your friends leadership is important for your marriage or for
your intimate relationship because whether you know it or not
you actually either are serving as a leader in that
relationship or you're not and if you're not then you're
not going to be getting good results and leadership is
important for community if you want to have an impact
on your community a lot of the ideas I'm gonna
be sharing with you here are insights that I got
from Evan pagans amazing seminar on leadership and after I
watched that seminar and I took a lot of notes
and did a lot of exercises from that seminar and
had a lot of insights about leadership there and also
going to be sharing some insights from Napoleon Hills classic
book Think and Grow Rich which has a section on
leadership and has some really good points about how to
be a powerful leader we've got to start by clearing
up a common misconception I think this is just intuitively
something that we kind of a sue about leadership is
that we tend to think that well what's a leader
a leader is someone who fights for power and control
right well actually wrong that's not what leadership is leadership
is not about controlling or fighting for power that's a
very antiquated notion of leadership that's leadership 2,000 years ago
that's not modern leadership and leadership in fact by force
the kind of leadership that you would see in Empire
builders from previous generations or there's a few more despots
and authoritative authoritarian rulers left in the world so some
of them rule by force but if you look at
history and you look at evolution which you find is
that throughout human civilization over the last 10,000 years or
so what's been happening is that there was a rise
of Empires and there was a rise of leadership by
force but then what started happening is actually that leadership
started dying out and that's because leadership by force is
not sustainable not over the long run and why is
that well because people actually don't like being led by
force instead what people want is the modern leader and
the modern leader is someone who leads by consensus building
very different it's not about leadership for egos sake or
for taking control over a society or a culture or
people or a business it's about coming up with a
more powerful future for everyone involved who's following you and
it all has to start with some dissatisfaction all leadership
starts with dissatisfaction so you're dissatisfied with the status quo
for some reason in whatever context your leader in right
and you can be a leader in in all these
different contexts but let's say you're dissatisfied with some element
of society the way society is structured society is a
system right so there's something that you're not happy with
and it arcs you and then as the leader what
happens is that you basically start to think about well
how can we make it better and what you do
is you conceive of a better world and as soon
as you're able to conceive of a better world than
what currently exists then right there the seed is planted
for you to lead others at its core as a
leader you need to be able to imagine a better
future and communicate it to others very effectively and because
of this the core skill of leadership is something very
interesting it's the ability to see the future it's being
a visionary as a leader you have to see a
greater future for other people your followers then they see
for themselves and you need to be able to communicate
this vision that you have with passion conviction integrity and
emotion so the key skill of being a leader is
visioning how good are you at that skill visioning the
visioning skill in its basic form a vision is simply
a clearer picture of the future for whatever change you
want to make plus emotional charge not enough just to
have any old random vision but you need to have
a compelling vision an inspiring vision something that when people
see it when they hear it they get fired up
they get excited about the future they want to go
out there and actually create it and that's what really
powerful visionaries throughout history have done is they've been able
to formulate a vision that's so strong of the future
that their followers buy in and then their followers can
go fight to the death in the most extreme circumstances
for that vision to materialize because they believe in it
so much but it's very interesting because all of that
starts with just this very ethereal thing called a vision
and how do you quantify if a vision is a
high quality vision or a low quality vision kind of
hard it's a nebulous thing and yet that's what the
leader excels at is that he's able to work with
these nebulous things called visions and he's able to articulate
very powerful visions that typical people are not able to
articulate see there's a problem with the common masses and
it really is kind of a problem of homeostasis I
just recently shot a video about homeostasis but it is
also the case that not only as individuals do we
have homeostasis but as a collective we have homeostasis this
which means that any system that you try to change
and that's what leadership is about as changing systems means
that you have to shift its center of gravity and
every system almost by definition has a center of gravity
doesn't that doesn't want a shift it has a certain
inertia to it and so the leaders job is figuring
out how do we shift that center of gravity how
do we get everyone moving in the right direction and
that can only happen with a cohesive vision but interestingly
enough most people are stuck so badly in present circumstances
that they're not able to see a really compelling powerful
future of what their life could be like or what
society could be like or what business could be like
or what the family could be like or what this
marriage could be like or what their personal lives could
be like right most people don't think that far ahead
most people aren't bad visionaries and so the leaders job
is to serve as the proxy visionary for those people
who lack vision and creating a powerful vision can be
difficult most people are so stuck in the present moment
they're so crippled by their immediate problems and needs and
their own selfishness that they're not able to see their
own greatness their own potential or the potential of this
business or this society or this culture or this relationship
they're not able to see past themselves the leader is
able to see past himself and in a sense the
leader kind of lives in his own little bubble of
fantasy really he lives in a higher reality than the
average person because the average person is so concerned with
what reality is right now that they become stuck in
it mired in it like in quicksand the leader though
is able to detach from present limitations in reality and
see the potential in the future and then tell everybody
around him hey reality is this way but it can
be that way too let's work towards that over there
and to do that he has to be in in
his own little bubble of reality because it's interesting how
reality works is that reality is what it is until
it becomes something that it wasn't and once it does
become something that it wasn't then people look back and
say oh this is so obvious it should always been
this way and yet all these same people when they
existed prior to the change they resisted the change and
in fact they said the change was impossible the change
was crazy was not going to work and they laughed
at the leader and they called him a space cadet
and they called him crazy and they called him weird
names and made fun of him and criticized him but
the leader he had such a powerful vision that he
was able to persevere past all that nonsense and he
was able to bring everyone along with him into the
future he didn't just go himself but he went to
the Future himself first in his mind then he got
everybody else to somehow come along with him for the
ride not in his mind but actually in reality and
through this means you can create huge changes in reality
if that's something you're interested in and I hope that
you are because I think that this is where you
can get the most fulfillment in life where the the
sweetest joys of life come here is when you're able
to shape reality for the better I don't know how
else to describe it it's a it's an amazing feeling
when you're able to do that when you're able to
have that kind of impact and I think it's one
of those P experiences that very few people in life
get to savor because they're just so stuck being part
of the middling masses and they miss out I think
we need a lot more leaders in this world a
lot more people who understand what leadership is and who
understand that leadership is not just like I said for
some you know CEO and a fortune 500 company but
it's for you for a normal everyday person and if
you're a CEO and a fortune 500 company it's is
for you too right it's for everybody the leader needs
to know how to rally people by showing them that
change and evolution is in fact safer than staying in
your comfort zone so when I talk about that center
of gravity that homeostasis what that is really is that
that's the minds default tendency to want to stay in
comfort zone the human mind wants to do this and
also human social systems behave this way too we have
these comfort zones and we don't want to change and
whenever someone comes in there says hey let's evolve let's
progress to the next tier let's transcend all this stuff
that we've been mired in what do people do usually
what they do is they pull their pitchforks and they
get the noose and they start lighting the bonfire kind
of thing right because people are very afraid of breaking
out of their comfort zone except what the leader realizes
is that actually evolution is the way to be the
most safe in this reality because in this reality the
only constant is change stuff is changing all the time
we live in a competitive environment businesses are competing organisms
are competing species are competing who knows maybe planets and
solar systems will be competing when we discover some nearby
neighbors right so life is about competition and it's about
evolution and so if you want to survive and one
of the reasons that human beings have been so prosperous
as a species on this planet is because we've been
very adaptable and we've been able to evolve in all
these different extreme circumstances into all these different extreme environments
well how does that happen in large part that happens
because we've had powerful leaders right but just because that
evolution is happening doesn't mean that everyone is going along
with that there's been a lot of resistance and if
you're a student of history you know how much resistance
has existed since since prehistory to all these changes that
society has experienced so it's really cool that as a
leader your job is to go out there to convince
people that hey if you want to be safe staying
in your comfort zone that's not actually the best way
it seems like it'll be the safest way but actually
counterintuitive if you do that you're going to go the
way of the dinosaurs which is not what we want
plus it's not nearly as exciting as doing something new
and fresh and progressive don't confuse leadership and being a
visionary with idealism it's not that you need to have
a vision you need to have a dream as Martin
Luther King would say but you also need a realistic
plan see being a leader means you need to have
the ability to shape the world not just talk and
be a demagogue and be a preacher but also actually
get [ __ ] done so you need to be
able to build realistic plans based on your visions and
one of the most challenging things for a leaders that
the leader needs to learn and understand how systems work
and how to affect change within a system this means
that the leader needs to be savvy the leader needs
to be able to see the world and society and
different people from multiple perspectives and situations he's to be
able to step outside of himself outside of his own
selfish Enda and see other people's self agendas and he
needs to be able to moderate and mediate between those
to find a workable practical solution and this is a
skill that very few people have this is not a
skillet you're just born with it's something that you need
to practice and really develop and I don't see that
many people consciously working towards developing this skill they don't
even know that this is a skill that they need
in their life a leaders job is also of course
to create the vision then to champion the vision which
we've already said but then also it's to stand in
the eye of the hurricane so to speak so when
[ __ ] goes down when everything's going wrong when
there's chaos around and people are losing their heads and
they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off
the leader needs to stay and be like a pillar
in the middle of all that and he used to
be even more calm and even more grounded than ever
before and needs to be able to champion that vision
and push it through he like the backbone of this
social organism and again that could be in a business
context it could also be in just a one-on-one relationship
context so like in a marriage for example if you're
a leader in a marriage you need to be able
to be that pillar in the marriage even when the
other person your partner your spouse is losing his or
her mind and doing some crazy nonsense you need to
be able to stay strong and me love all that
and it should be clear by now why we have
so few leaders it's because being a leader is hard
doing all this stuff is like a balancing act it's
like you're watching walking on a tightrope I need to
balance something just perfectly so you don't tip over and
fall off and break your neck see if if you
want to bite off the challenge of being a leader
then you can never play victim you need to take
full responsibility for yourself but also for what's going on
around you and also you could never sit back and
cruise and coast in your comfort zone you're always going
to be outside of your comfort zone a leader needs
to get comfortable being outside is comfort zone which is
a pretty rare character trait and one of the things
I learned when I went through my life coaching program
to get certified as a coach is one of things
they taught us is that all leadership begins with self
leadership if you can't lead yourself then how are you
going to lead other people who's going to trust you
to lead them if you can't even lead yourself so
all leadership begins with self leadership and the key things
you need to learn as a self leader is you
need to learn how to manage your own fears and
stresses you need to also learn how to manage your
self-talk and you need to learn how to manage what
influences you so fear self-talk and influences if you can't
manage these for yourself then you cannot lead yourself and
you cannot lead other people and also you need to
study and learn how to systems because in whatever context
you're leaving you're going to be leading a system it's
all about systems that's a bit of a tangent topic
that I don't have time to go into now the
study of how systems work and how to affect changes
in systems that's a very deep field of study but
you need to start studying that and also developing niche-specific
knowledge of how to change the specific system you're working
within right so your specific business your specific market your
specific marriage or your specific social circle let me give
you eight key roles that a leader plays that I
got from eben pagan I think these are very important
because this kind of defines the domain of what it
means to be a leader first is visionary leader needs
to be a visionary next is a liner a leader
needs to be able to align different agendas and values
together to create a cohesive direction for the system to
go into conflict resolver leader needs to be able to
resolve conflicts a creator a motivator a conscious role model
the leader is always a role model the question is
is he conscious of what role he's modeling or is
the role that he's embodying and playing as a leader
actually sending the wrong signals to his followers that one's
hard because as a leader that means you've got to
walk your talk you can't just come up and preach
and then after the preaching is over go back home
and then go drink some booze and have some sex
and do some drugs and all that kind of stuff
because then you're not a congruent leader and then you're
not a very good role model and then people follow
you also a facilitator you got to be able to
facilitate and what this means is you don't solve people's
problems for them but you help you facilitate them to
solve their own problems that's a whole skill you need
to learn how to develop and lastly leader needs to
be a bringer of people from the known to the
unknown see people like to live in what's known the
known right here existing society the existing relationship to your
existing social circle your existing business that's already known people
are comfortable there and then they tend to get conservative
and dogmatic and what the leader needs to do is
he needs to be able to open up their minds
to go into the unknown to venture into new uncharted
territory where perhaps there might be dangerous animals and rough
terrain and unknown traps potential dangers maybe even death lies
over the horizon right makes me think of how the
the Explorers the Columbus's and the Magellan's of the worlds
ah how they led people literally over the edge of
the world because at that point in time people weren't
even sure if the world was round and they would
lead sailors and men and entire expeditions into uncharted waters
uncharted territories not knowing where they were going right going
from the known to the unknown from Europe to South
America or from Europe to the Spice Islands or wherever
explorers would go and that takes a very special kind
of skill and determination speaking of which what I want
to do is I want to give you ten key
qualities of leadership that are necessary for successful leadership and
these come straight from napoleon hill's book Think and Grow
Rich but I think that these are very powerful and
important to mention so they are unwavering courage self-control a
keen sense of justice definiteness of decision definiteness of plans
the habit of doing more than paid for that's an
interesting one a pleasing personality sympathy and understanding mastery of
detail willingness to assume full responsibility which we've already touched
on and cooperation so those are the ten keys from
Napoleon Hill and now I don't give you is ten
more fail your points for leadership from Napoleon Hill so
these are the things as a leader if you're going
to engage in these activities right here then you're going
to fail these are also important to know because these
are very very common pitfalls that we make and I
notice myself making a lot of these so here we
go first is inability to organise details next is unwillingness
to render humble service nobody likes an arrogant leader humble
service expectation of pay for mere knowledge and what this
means is if you expect that people are going to
respect you just for how much you know and how
much you read then you're mistaken a leader doesn't get
paid or respected for mere knowledge he needs to actually
use that knowledge apply it to get stuff done to
create results and then that's what he's judged on is
the results he creates the change he actually creates gathering
of knowledge by itself doesn't create change next is fear
of competition from followers so if you are afraid that
your followers will out lead you then you're not much
of a leader are you lack of imagination that's the
next one make sense given that the leaders whole purpose
is to be a visionary and create powerful visions if
you lack a strong imagination then you're going to be
stuck in present reality and then you've got nowhere to
lead to selfishness another pitfall in temperance or anger another
pitfall disloyalty another one emphasis of the authority of leadership
so are you abusing your authority are you flaunting your
authority and you're not a very powerful leader and lastly
emphasis of title kind of goes along with the last
point of authority so those are the 10 failure points
so notice those notice how much there is here how
much depth there is what I wanted to do with
this video is I wanted to give you kind of
a big-picture overview of just how important how broad and
how deep this topic of leadership is because there's so
much here I can't cover all of it even in
a one-hour video so what I want to give you
instead is I want to like give you a sense
that oh man this is so important you put leadership
on my radar because if I put this on my
radar then I can create a really powerful organization really
powerful relationship I could really influence the world in a
powerful way so hopefully you're seeing how much meat there
is in this topic right and then you can go
off and maybe you buy a leadership book or you
take a leadership seminar leadership course or you just start
being more conscious of how you lead others in your
life maybe right now you don't even think of yourself
as a leader because you tell yourself well Leo I
mean I don't have a business or I don't have
a marriage but even if you're just part of a
family even if you're not even adult yet and you're
still part of a family you can be a leader
in that family and in fact you kind of a
leader the question is are you a shitty leader or
you powerful visionary leader right anywhere where you're engaging interacting
with people or you're working inside of a system in
a family unit is a system at school in college
that's a system a relationship intimately is a system the
career you have and the job you're going to defer
work that's a system right so structure to be more
cognizant of how you're playing the leadership role because that's
the first step is realizing that you are a potential
leader in the making whether you realize it or not
you know one of the things that I stress in
all the actualized org material is the importance of personal
development but one thing that I realized is I was
doing research for this video here is that one of
the most compelling reasons that I can find for doing
personal development is leadership because to me a powerful life
a fulfilling life comes from changing the world for the
better and to change the world for the better you
need to be able to lead other people to help
you do that and to lead other people what do
you need to do you need to master yourself first
you need be able to lead yourself how are you
going to lead other people how are you going to
change the world if you can't get up out of
bed in the morning on time if you can't eat
healthy food the way you're supposed to if you can
get your ass off to the gym on time if
you can't put in a full day's work consistently at
your job who are you going to lead you're not
a master of yourself you're not a master of your
own thoughts your own bad habits if you can't fix
this stuff in yourself if you can't master your own
psychology then you're not going to be able to change
the world and so for me that's why personal development
is so important right because a leader realizes that he
isn't just born a leader no one's just born a
leader like this is a massive area of development of
skills you need a lot of skills you need to
develop across the board both within leadership but also just
like personal skills interpersonal skills social skills understanding of how
emotions work understanding what charisma is and how to use
it to influence other people building mental tools such as
creativity the ability to imagine and to visualize a more
powerful future the ability to write to speak to communicate
through whatever medium you want to do it through right
because all these are going to come together leadership is
like a it's really kind like a Renaissance man skill
because all these little things have to come together to
create a powerful leader a leader is not just uh
you know a single-minded one focused specialists he's not like
a computer programmer who can just know his computer programming
and then just be good at it that's enough know
a leader has to kind of be a bit of
a jack-of-all-trades but also he has to be at the
same time a jack-of-all-trades but still get a lot of
[ __ ] done at the same time right so
it's uh it's a really challenging skill to develop because
it it takes a holistic development of your entire being
of your body of your mind of your emotions all
that has to be grown and developed if you want
to live into your full potential as a leader if
you take anything away from this video what I want
you to take away is that to lead others you
need a strong vision for them notice not a strong
vision for you but a strong vision for them you
see the difference you can have a personal mission statement
for example for yourself in your own life and you
should I hope you do but that's not enough need
to have like a mission statement for them what's in
it for them why should they follow you hopefully it
connects with your own mission statement too so what I
want to wrap up on here at the end is
I want to give you my vision for you with
actualized org if you're watching these videos and you're vesting
a lot of time my videos are pretty long interesting
all this time watching my videos what are you gonna
get for it why are you doing this I mean
maybe you found one of my videos because you thought
like well I just went through a breakup I need
some advice about how to deal with my breakup so
you search that and you found my breakup video or
maybe you want to get better at dating so you
find one our dating videos or maybe you have some
emotional issues so you found one of my emotion videos
or maybe you want to learn how to meditate you
found one of my meditation videos and that's fine you
know that helps you with a specific little problem you
got in your life and that's cool but that's not
my vision for you my vision for you is a
lot bigger than that I don't want to just help
you put a band-aid over a little problem in your
life what I want to do is I want to
help you to find a cause that's worth fighting for
in your life I want you to go and put
yourself on track on the hero's journey the hero's journey
that's a concept from Joseph Campbell very common mythical archetype
is the hero on the journey fighting for a cause
that he is willing to bleed for that he's willing
to die for because he's found something like that in
life he's found something where previously he was just kind
of like a lazy bum just sitting around kind of
twiddling his thumbs in life or doing the ordinary stuff
but then something came across his radar and something's like
damn that's something really important in life that I need
to be a part of that's something I need to
go take some action on there's some injustice in the
world or there's some improvement that needs to be made
and I'm the one to do it I'm not gonna
I can't let this is to impart I can't let
somebody else come in here and do it for me
I can't sit around and just wait and hope that
somebody else will do it for me I have to
be the hero I have to be the leader and
my vision for you is that you find that thing
for yourself and that you live you make your life
living about something for something that's larger than yourself because
what most people are doing if they haven't undertaken hero's
journey is that they're living a very shallow petty existence
and they don't realize that they're they're wasting their precious
one opportunity in this life you only get one right
only once do you live and it's going to go
by all too fast so instead of living this petty
existence that you currently live what I want you to
do is I want you to find something outside yourself
something that you're living for something outside your family something
outside your social circle that you're willing to fight for
to work for to bleed for to die for and
then what I want you to do is I want
you to develop yourself I want you to put every
bit of energy that you have into growing yourself growing
your consciousness growing your your body growing your emotional awareness
growing your skillset for years for decades until you become
that fully realized leader who's able to congruently powerfully make
change in the world happen and then what you do
and this is the part I like best about this
whole thing is that it's as though you climbed a
mountain like imagine that you climbed Mount Everest and if
you ever seen footage from Mount Everest then that thing
is so high up in the stratosphere that is it's
higher than you are when you're taking an airplane ride
it's about the same altitude as a jumbo jet flies
except you're standing on the Mount and you're looking down
and you're seeing this this beautiful range of Peaks beautiful
range of peaks and clouds and the the sun shining
through it's just like this this pristine crisp air and
you're standing there and you you are on top of
the world and you're looking down on the entire world
kind of like a God God's eye view of the
world and it feels like you conquered it you conquered
the world and really what you've done is you haven't
conquered the world so much as you've conquered yourself and
that clean feeling that high consciousness clean feeling of having
conquered yourself having climbed all the way up here this
giant slog through the mud and the snow and the
dirt and the rocks and all the perils and this
journey that you went went on right and you made
your life about this this mission to climb this mountain
to get to the very top and then you finally
did it and to do it what you had to
do is you had to persevere and you have to
you have to really break yourself down because that small
little person that you started out as at the base
of the mountain is not the same person that's standing
on the top that small petty little person down there
at the base he could not get to the top
he had to die along the way and then what
made it up to the top is something something very
interesting something godlike something spiritual something that is beyond the
ego transcendent if I was to speak of it poetically
and what you get is you get that taste of
the highest beauties and joys of life right that's satisfaction
not of a little titillation or some pleasure that you
kind of get when you go eat a fine meal
or when you go have some nice sex or do
some drugs not that kind of pleasure I'm talking about
a high cautious of satisfaction and this this feeling of
connection to the world into reality and to life right
you feel really alive and you feel this immense like
gratitude well up inside you and that to me is
what life is about is that living your life to
the fullest that's what I mean by living your life
to the fullest and then after that what you can
do is you can die your life with no regrets
and that's what I want for you is I want
for you to be able to lie on your deathbed
and look back at your life and have this feeling
of this this solid confidence that you really live that
you gave it your all and that you sucked every
last ounce of beauty and joy out of life that
was there for you and you look around at everybody
else and you and you say to yourself how grateful
I am that I did this when nobody else around
me had the balls to do it everybody else around
me is going to die not knowing what life is
really about but I'm gonna die having savored the highest
beauty in life that's my vision for you hope you
like it now my parting question for you is what's
