hey this is Leo for actualised org and I got
a question for you do you ever feel like you
have a ton of untapped potential but you just don't
really know how to tap into it like your life
was meant to be about something great and positive and
making a big difference and impact in the world but
that you haven't really been able to to fulfill that
dream of yours maybe you just got stuck or maybe
you didn't even find what it is yet maybe you're
feeling a little bit lost and or maybe you just
got sidetracked by why the realities of life my family
life my friends by what society's been telling you to
do by college by by an easy career that's been
making you relatively comfortable but hasn't really been quite what
you wanted or maybe you feel like you've had a
dream but that dream has died and that you've had
to settle or maybe you feel like the job that
you currently have isn't exactly what you envision for yourself
maybe you feels like a waste of time and that
you should be doing something greater and that your true
values aren't being honored right now well if you resonated
with any of those then you probably coming from a
position where I came from which is where I struggled
for a long time to find my purpose and I've
been able to find it and then I lost it
and then I found it and then I've lost it
so I've gone through the ups and downs and not
only is it about finding the purpose I found the
biggest challenge is actually having strategies and techniques for staying
on purpose and making sure that you execute because all
of us know how to dream all of us can
daydream all of us have big ambitions but in the
end what are you actually carrying out in your life
the fact is that you have so much more potential
in you than you're realizing it's insane your potential is
almost unlimited if you really think about it and when
you think about it what is holding you back from
tapping into that full potential a lot of people will
come up with excuses and stay that it's stuff like
a lack of money a lack of resources a lack
of support a lack of this a lack of that
a lack of opportunity but let's be real that's not
what is stopping you what's stopping you is a lack
resourcefulness and not having the mindsets that you need to
be successful because there are people out there that have
million-dollar businesses there are people out there that are living
exciting lives there are people out there that are doing
what you would dream to be doing and the only
difference between them and you is really how they think
about it and the action that they took to get
it there so what is exciting for me is figuring
out how to create exciting lives for other people because
I've struggled so long so many years figuring out how
to create an exciting life for myself and at some
point I figured that I know exactly what I should
be doing and I went out there did it I
spent years doing it got my dream job and then
found out that oh this is this sucks this is
not really what I wanted it's not exciting it's not
fulfilling my deepest values and that's because I didn't know
that much about myself and that was been that has
been a big learning curve steep learning curve that has
taken me years to kind of get through and that's
still something that I'm evolving so life purpose is not
something that you figure out once and for all it's
something that you evolve over and you have to always
struggle and come up with with ways to stay on
track with it so that's what I'm about that's what
I'm here to do is I'm here to help you
create that exciting life that you've always dreamed of I'm
here to challenge you to step up and take a
lot of action because those those high-quality emotions that you
get like excitement that feeling of being energized and alive
and inspired and motivated to me those emotions are priceless
and I love figuring out ways to get more of
that in my life so what can you expect by
working with me well what I'm talking about is not
just like a 20% increase in in your results I'm
really excited about working with people that want to get
a 5x a 10x a 20x 100x improvement in what
their life is like the quality of their life so
quality of life for you might mean different things it
might mean financial success it might mean fitness goals it
might mean a certain level of feeling in your body
and excitement that eagerness to jump out of bed in
the morning may be a feeling of high consciousness of
awareness and connection with the world or just making a
certain big impact that you want to make or getting
a certain level of status or prestige out there becoming
famous whatever it might be that is what I'm thrilled
to help you get and to give you strategies for
doing that that's really the point of this site is
to give you a lot of free resources for showing
you how it's actually done not some sort of magic
pill technique or technology but the real process of how
someone goes about creating something massively successful creating extraordinary success
and creating an extraordinary life so by working with me
you can expect some of the following really total clarity
and about the purpose in your life we want to
give you strategies for moving forward we want to give
you mindsets to be much more resourceful and create that
kind of easy discipline and effortless motivation that it takes
to accomplish big things in your life we want to
help you discover any hidden potential within yourself and really
push it out because it's one thing to know about
it's another thing to actually get it out and realized
in the world we want to get you to have
the courage to take action towards maybe that dream job
that you've been contemplating that dream project that you always
thought you should be doing but you haven't all that
stuff is something that you can get by working with
me what else productivity creativity time management if you're into
creating creating things in your life and creative expression is
important for you then coaching can be really useful for
that we really want to drive you to take a
lot of massive action and do it an effortless way
where you're not grinding through so that's another benefit of
the coaching that we do we specifically coach around that
issue you're also going to get a lot of personal
growth that would have otherwise taking you years coaching is
the fastest way that I know to get a lot
of personal growth advancement really quickly so if you're into
self-development appearance of self mastery coaching is especially the type
of coaching that I do is it's very much the
fastest way that you can go and get those games
you're also going to get a lot of expertise from
me I've literally probably studied over $100,000 worth of self-development
material from books to seminars to videos and everything in
between and I really that has that that's what that
was already golden material and what I've done is I've
distilled all that down even further to get just like
the juicy nuggets that are specifically applicable to the issue
that we're talking about here which is creating that exciting
kind of life where you're on purpose so all those
challenges and there are many of them on this journey
getting on it staying on it and getting to the
kind of results that you want I've spent a lot
of time studying that training on it coaching a lot
of other clients doing a lot of self observation because
I faced all those issues myself and also talking with
a lot of clients about the issues that they have
in helping them and getting a lot of third third
third hand experience through them we're also going to create
a lot more balance in your life so for me
a successful and fulfilling life means a holistic life a
life where you're happy in all areas that means whatever
the important areas are for you work family health fitness
your social life you know your personal development any of
those areas we're going to make sure we're gonna look
at them we're gonna make sure that those are all
coming together for you in the way that you want
we're gonna develop solid long-range plans for you that's something
that I love to do because for me this is
not about just talk and and theorizing and philosophy this
is about getting your inner game dialed in which is
a very tangible thing despite the abstractness of it and
then getting it your outer game dialed in so making
sure that you're out there you're taking action you're taking
steps and the kind of plans that you have laid
out for you make it very clear what steps you
need to be taking and also hold you accountable so
we lay out specific goals for you and then really
as a coach what else I offer is a lot
of encouragement a lot of support a lot of ass-kicking
to make sure that you're doing what you need to
be doing and holding you accountable for the stuff that
you say that you want to do so as you're
going through this process and you're getting this stuff really
to me the value of it all is how you
feel it's not even what you get because you can
get financial success you can get the fitness goals that
you want you can get that body fat percentage that
you want you can you can get the car you
can get the house you can even get the family
and that job that you that you think you like
you can get all that but you can still be
unfulfilled in fact I've come from that place I've had
the dream job I've gotten financial success I've gotten financial
independence and let me tell you it's not cracked all
it's cracked up to be if you don't have your
inner game dialed in because it's not what you get
externally that is ultimately getting you the good feelings that
you want what kind of feelings am I talking about
what really it starts with excitement for me if we
can capture everything in one word it's probably gonna be
excitement that feeling of energy and aliveness that you get
when you know that you're on purpose and you're having
a big impact and everything is going away you got
a sense of confidence with you you get a sense
of power that you're able to control the world in
the sense that you're able to control your world the
things that you think in your mind the things that
you dream the things that you visualize you're able to
manifest and put out there and those things are positive
and help people and help you in return because they
lead to financial success freedom and all the external rewards
that you want I know means am I saying that
that's not something worthwhile to pursue so that power that
you get is amazing the confidence that you get when
you have a life purpose that you are really in
tune with because what we're really doing here is we're
aligning your whole life we're gonna clarify your purpose we're
gonna clarify what you want what you don't want we're
gonna clarify your weaknesses and your strengths and when I
say that it might seem kind of basic like well
I kind of know what I like and what I
don't like not really you'd be surprised how much people
don't really take the time to think about that and
when you do decisions become easier motivation becomes more effortless
you get more engaged you start to ignore opportunities that
are not important to you and you start to really
take on the ones that are you start to be
able to prioritize your life so that you're not always
overwhelmed because you're not doing everything under the Sun you're
just doing the stuff that you know you need to
be doing so don't dismiss the fundamentals the fundamentals are
80% of your results so we really take a look
at all those fundamentals and those these are probably things
that you haven't really even thought about consciously you know
what have you taken an hour or two to really
think about what you like what you don't like what
your values are what your purpose is for a lot
of people they haven't done that and even if you
have vague hazy notions of it it helps to clarify
those because once they're clear your motivation starts to come
through decisions start to become easier it's all that stuff
so the feelings that we're talking about here are really
important other stuff is that you're gonna feel we want
to help you feel successful and accomplished and that comes
about by getting the results you want it also starts
to come about just by putting you on track so
it's not necessary if you're pursuing a long-term goal like
if you want a certain amount of money in your
bank account it might take you months or years to
get there this is not a get-rich-quick scheme this is
not a magic pill technique that I'm giving you but
by putting you on track with that you're gonna start
to feel the feelings of excitement and success and confidence
those will come to you immediately you don't need to
wait for years to get that also you're just gonna
feel inspired and motivated usually from every session the client
comes away excited ichael Kohima excited because for me it's
exciting to get other people excited about what they're doing
in their lives and we're gonna get you optimistic and
positive about your future if you're not positive about your
future right now then there's definitely something wrong stuff is
not in place the way you want you're either suffering
through things you don't need to be suffering through you're
grinding through life you're not enjoying it you're not aligned
with your values something is amiss there so we want
to get you feeling very positive about your future so
you think that every day that's going by is is
you getting stronger you getting more powerful and finally the
kind of feeling that I love and this is kind
of like a high level high level thing is really
getting your mind focused and centered so you have that
high consciousness feeling of taking action executing really being proud
of the accomplishments and being proud of your life and
feeling like you're very well equipped to take on the
challenges that are come because challenges will come I can
guarantee that the question is how resourceful are you how
will equipped are you to handle them in your mind
what are your reactions going to be and if you
are then you're going to be able to stay on
track so that is what I'm talking about here with
coaching how do you get started well if you still
have more questions take a look at this page down
below see all the information you can see my rate
so you can see what I what I coach around
you can see the types of clients that I like
to work with but generally what I'm offering right now
is a 50-minute session it's a free coaching session with
no strings attached it's a full session that means is
not just some sort of little little teaser teaser type
of talk you get full coaching on your issues issues
revolving around life purpose whatever those may be we're gonna
really dig into it and take a look we're also
gonna spend some time explaining what coaching is and what
coaching is not setting up the logistics for the college
or how the whole process works so if you're new
to coaching this is a great way to to find
out if it's right for you that's really the purpose
of the session find out what's right for you you're
also gonna get a lot of value so don't think
of this as just it's just promotional in fact I
don't really spend any time in the session upselling you
I just coach you and if you're getting value from
the coaching I just trust that that is something that
if you want to continue you'll you'll see the enormous
value of it and and then perhaps we can work
together now one caveat is is that I don't hire
and I don't take on all clients I am really
looking for people that are excited to tap into their
full potential so wherever you are on that path whether
you're just getting started you're feeling kind of lost and
stuck or whether you're already feeling like you're on track
but you're just not getting the kind of results that
you thought you might get and you want more out
of out of what you're doing with your life then
that's someone that I want to work with then I
really want to work with you and I want to
make sure that you're you're someone who's gonna take action
and and pull through because for me I don't get
excited by giving someone a 20% boost in their results
I get excited like I said with those 10x 20x
hundred X improvements where people are transforming their lives that's
why I got involved with coaching that's why I love
this stuff so I encourage you to give me a
call or shoot me an email to start scheduling that
50-minute sessions I have limited slots in my schedule to
do these so do ask and make sure that that
I have availability and jump on it while I will
have free slots and I look forward to talking with
you on the phone getting to know you a little
bit better and see how we can help improve your
results dramatically also you've probably seen this website here actualise
org make sure you use all the resources that are
here most of them are free you can take a
look at all amazing videos and articles that I have
coming out every week with first-hand experience of mine journey
through the same kind of challenge and issues that you
guys have been having with creating the kind of awesome
life that you want making that kind of big difference
that you want and getting that kind of excitement that
you want out of life so tap into that if
that if you find that useful you can get more
advice from me and more guidance for me on how
to get that kind of result in your own life
and it's not something that you want to put off
doing if you're not feeling optimistic and positive about your
future then you want to start taking action right now
