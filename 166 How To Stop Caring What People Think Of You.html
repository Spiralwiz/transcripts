            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/HZm4B4foybM' target='_blank'>How To Stop Caring What People Think Of You</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Adapting to a New Culture and Attitudes Towards People-Pleasing</b>: Leo describes his early life struggles in adjusting to the culture in the United States after immigrating from Russia. He developed a tendency to constantly assess how others perceived him. From observing his father's apparent indifference towards others' opinions, Leo initially aspired to be the opposite: a people-pleaser who cared deeply about others' perception of him.
</li><li><b>Impact of People-Pleasing on Self-Image</b>: Leo discusses how trying to please others is often linked to maintaining a certain self-image. He emphasizes that individuals with people-pleasing tendencies have a self-image of being noble and caring and seek validation from others to confirm it. This results in continuous effort put into upholding their self-image and earning approval, which can be exhausting and difficult.
</li><li><b>The Trap of People-Pleasing</b>: Leo asserts that constantly seeking approval and validation limits personal growth and genuine fulfillment. He argues that the strategy of seeking approval for one's self-image is flawed and damaging, leading potentially to feelings of resentment and bitterness.
</li><li><b>The Futility of Controlling Others' Opinions</b>: Leo stresses that attempting to control others' opinions is futile and potentially harmful. He highlights that opinions are random and more reflective of the person giving them than the person receiving them. Therefore, it is unwise to let others' opinions dictate one's actions or self-worth.
</li><li><b>Dependence on External Validation Hinders Potential</b>: Leo states that constant reliance on external validation obstructs personal development. He asserts that fear of criticism or rejection shouldn't hinder individuals from pursuing their dreams and living authentically. Ferrying others' opinions and seeking approval can suppress one's potential and limit progress.
</li><li><b>Redefining Value and Fulfillment</b>: Leo stresses that true value and fulfillment cannot be gained through external validation or aesthetic achievements. Rather, living according to one's values, dreams, and potential leads to genuine fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Challenging People's Opinions</b>: Leo encourages listeners to challenge others' opinions, embrace criticism, and be okay with standing out. He opines that experiencing rejection and disapproval can foster resilience and perspective, helping individuals realize that people's opinions don't significantly matter in one's life journey.
</li><li><b>Authenticity versus People-Pleasing</b>: Leo asserts that striving to build a grand and purposeful life might attract criticism and misunderstanding. However, he emphasizes that being authentic and expressing oneself, despite the potential tension it could cause, is crucial. 
</li><li><b>Exercise for Independence</b>: Leo introduces a repetitive affirmation exercise designed to promote independence from others' opinions. This exercise involves repeating, "I am completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of others" daily for 90 days. This approach isn't about going to the extreme of not caring at all but about finding balance and earning respect.
</li><li><b>Risks of People-Pleasing</b>: Leo warns that pleasing everyone is impossible and counter-productive. As individuals become more successful and assertive, they are likely to attract more attention and criticism. Therefore, Leo encourages the dismissal of the notion of maintaining a flawless self-image and the constant pressure to please others.
</li><li><b>Exercise to Break the Pattern of People-Pleasing</b>: Leo suggests intentionally causing minor inconvenience to others, like taking extra time to place an order at a busy café as an exercise to break away from people-pleasing tendencies. This simple exercise can challenge one's fear of judgment and the desire to always please others.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Not Caring About Others' Opinions</b>: Leo illustrates how disregarding others' opinions, especially as it pertains to seeking validation, has benefited his work as a YouTube content creator and resulted in a more fulfilling life. He encourages viewers to apply this advice, promising its positive outcomes.
</li><li><b>Constant Seeking for Validation</b>: Leo discusses how people continuously seek validation and confirmation to maintain their desired self-image. They work hard to avoid evidence contradicting their self-image, causing significant emotional disturbance and driving them towards hyper-corrective behaviors. 
</li><li><b>Empathy as a Trap</b>: He warns that, for some people, empathy can become a trap that pulls them into self-neglect and self-denial. Their nature as living beings is inherently selfish, and trying to please others often contradicts this basic nature, leading to emotional conflicts and resentment.
</li><li><b>People-Pleasing Prevents Building Dream Life</b>: Leo highlights a major problem in being overly concerned with others' opinions: it prevents people from creating their desired lifestyle. Their own values and dreams are often ignored or sidelined, making it impossible for them to work on personal development and achieve their ambitions.
</li><li><b>An Alternative to Extremes</b>: Leo introduces the "middle way" as an alternative to the two extremes of self-sacrifice and selfishness. In this paradigm, a person is independent of others' opinions and grounded in their own values. This mindset allows individuals to pursue their own ambitions without sacrificing their well-being or becoming abrasive.
</li><li><b>Ineffective Strategy of Seeking Approval</b>: Leo criticizes the strategy of seeking approval as ultimately ineffective and counterproductive. He notes that implementing such a strategy blocks personal growth, denies personal values, and prevents pursuit of personal dreams.
</li><li><b>Opinions are Just Thoughts</b>: He challenges the listeners to understand others' opinions are merely thoughts. He finds it ludicrous to allow these mere thoughts, especially from strangers, to control one's life and dictate its course. He argues that no ones opinion should have overbearing power over a persons life other than the person themselves.
</li><li><b>Solution: Grounding In Own Values</b>: Leo suggests the solution to this problem is to be grounded in one's values and beliefs and not be affected by random opinions. This will ensure personal fulfillment and the ability to confidently pursue one's desires and goals without seeking validation or approval from others.
</li><li><b>Being subject to others' opinions for validation</b>: Leo emphasizes the pitfalls of relying on other's opinions, both negative and positive, for self-validation. When individuals know their values and what fulfills them, they need no external affirmations or directions. He points out that caring overly about others' perspectives distracts from personal vision and progression.
</li><li><b>The potential confusion with need for feedback</b>: Some may argue they need feedback to understand if theyre on the right path, whether in their art, work, or relationships. However, Leo counters that this seemingly logical point often masks an emotional, irrational fear of standing alone, reinforcing that it's not feedback but external validation that they seek.
</li><li><b>Dangers of criticism and praise</b>: Leo addresses the double-edged sword of criticism and praise. Overly weighing criticism can sabotage ones confidence and potentially discourage them from pursuing their dreams. On the other hand, the intense desire for praise and approval to uphold one's idealized self-image can create unhealthy reliance and distress when such praise is not forthcoming.
</li><li><b>Shifting the paradigm from validation-seeking</b>: To overcome the pitfalls of seeking validation, both negative and positive, Leo advises becoming completely independent of others' opinions. Rather than entertaining the comments of others who likely have different values and agendas, individuals should enforce their own values.
</li><li><b>An exercise to reinforce independence from others' opinions</b>: As a tool to facilitate this mindset shift, Leo suggests an exercise - repeating the affirmation "I am completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of others" for five minutes a day, for 90 days, which he believes will effectively reprogram the subconscious mind.
</li><li><b>Admitting your ineffective strategy</b>: This part emphasizes the need to admit that seeking approval for your self-image is a flawed strategy that needs to be abandoned. It argues that this people-pleasing strategy cannot deliver success, as it relies on controlling the opinions of others, which is an impossible and exhausting task. It encourages viewers to confront their fears and move away from people-pleasing behaviors, acknowledging that obstacles and reservations are expected in this endeavor.
</li><li><b>Independence from others' opinions</b>: It advocates for independence from the good or bad opinions of others. People may praise or criticize you, but these practices should neither affect your trajectory nor become a source of need. It emphasizes that the sustenance of an ideal self-image is a losing game as it is impractical to align every opinion out there with your expectations.
</li><li><b>Nature of opinions and questions to ask oneself</b>: This section highlights that opinions are very random and capricious, often reflecting more about the critic than the recipient. It asks viewers to question whether they are willing to entrust their life dreams and aspirations to the random opinions of others, and if they could live an extraordinary life while being dependent on such random circumstances.
</li><li><b>True fulfillment and final realizations</b>: This part states that true fulfillment does not come from praise or criticism but from living according to one's potential, values, and dreams. It introduces the thought that no one can offer anything of true value or fulfillment to another beyond temporary material things. Lasting fulfillment comes from one's path, honoring their values, living up to their potential, and creating their dream life. 
</li><li><b>Exercise in non-dependency</b>: An exercise of repeating an affirmation about not depending on others' opinions is shared for encouraging independence and reprogramming the subconscious mind. It also makes clear that this exercise doesn't serve to make individuals cold-hearted or evil. Rather, it aims to maintain a balanced approach while gaining respect.  
</li><li><b>Strategies against pleasing everyone</b>: It advises against trying to please everyone as critics would always emerge irrespective of how accurate you act. It suggests relinquishing the need for an impeccable self-image and releasing the ceaseless pressure of pleasing others.
</li><li><b>Exercise on prioritizing personal values</b>: An exercise of purposefully taking more time to place an order at a packed coffeehouse, despite inconveniencing others, is suggested to help break free from people-pleasing tendencies and put personal values ahead of societal expectations. It encourages individuals to challenge societal norms and uphold that it's tolerable not to please everyone always. 
</li><li><b>Importance of tension in building a big life</b>: This segment implies that one should be prepared to face tensions and clashes with others while being authentic and expressing oneself genuinely to build a grand life. People-pleasers often sacrifice uniqueness and self-expression for approval, which should be avoided.
</li><li><b>The Drain of Upholding a Self-Image</b>: Leo explains that maintaining a pristine self-image and seeking constant validation is not only difficult, but ultimately unfulfilling. He emphasizes that it's okay to have a tarnished self-image and face criticism from others. He makes it clear it is okay to hold unpopular opinions and not fit in all the time. Leo encourages people to challenge the status quo and argue that doing so builds a tougher skin. Leo maintains that having a self-image tarnished every now and then is normal and doesn't affect personal worth.
</li><li><b>Being Authentic Can Create Tension</b>: Expressing one's unique qualities and being true to oneself can sometimes create tension with others. However, Leo argues that this is preferable to hiding the unique aspects of oneself and presenting a bland, societal-approved image. He emphasizes that being genuine can actually attract others more and that the tension caused by being authentic is real and, therefore, acceptable. 
</li><li><b>Pursuing a Vision Despite Criticism</b>: Leo discusses that if one wants to pursue their big vision or dreams, there will be people who won't understand or agree with it. People, including family, friends, or colleagues, may criticize or ridicule one's dreams or vision. He maintains that when faced with such criticism, it's important to stay focused on personal values and mission, ignoring the naysayers and building a thick skin.
</li><li><b>Choosing Between a Shiny Self-Image and Living Dreams</b>: Leo underlines that individuals must make a choice between maintaining a shiny self-image or building their dream life. He asserts that these two options often conflict and urges listeners to choose to live their extraordinary life, suggesting an exercise to help overcome the need for others' approval. The exercise involves repeating the affirmation "I am completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of others," for five minutes straight, every day, for ninety days.
</li><li><b>Rethinking People-Pleasing Habits</b>: Leo concludes the section by advising viewers to consider letting go of their people-pleasing habits because trying to please everyone and be the perfect human being for all is a losing game that tires one's soul. According to him, it's crucial to prioritize self-expression, values, and personal vision over people's opinions and societal norms. It's important to take charge of one's life, create boundaries, and not sacrifice oneself for others.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Hatred and Criticism</b>: Leo Gura points out that no matter how much effort people put into creating a perfect self-image, they will still face criticism and hatred from others. He emphasizes that striving to please everyone is a futile exercise that can result in personal frustration and reduction of self-worth.
</li><li><b>Overriding the Need for Validation</b>: Gura advises listeners to stop pursuing validation and approval. He argues that success and assertiveness often attract more attention, and as a result, more criticism and hatred. He advises building resilience by letting go of the desperate need to maintain a pristine self-image.
</li><li><b>Exercise to Minimize People-Pleasing Tendencies</b>: Gura proposes an unusual exercise to help viewers minimize their people-pleasing tendencies. He suggests standing in a busy line, like at a Starbucks during peak hours, and taking unnaturally long to place an order. This is meant to challenge societal expectations and disrupt the individual's desire for a perfect self-image.
</li><li><b>Practicing Authenticity and Independent Response</b>: He encourages viewers to practice authenticity by being mindful of situations where they are inauthentic or are sacrificing their own interests and pleasure to satisfy others. In these situations, he advises viewers to ground themselves in their own values and respond independently of societal expectations.
</li><li><b>Independence from Praise and Criticism</b>: Gura shares his own experience as a content creator on YouTube, stating that he has weaned himself off both negative comments and positive feedback. He claims this has helped him become more self-reliant and fulfilled and encourages his viewers to also gain independence from external validation.
</li><li><b>Closing Remarks and Promotion of Newsletter</b>: Gura ends his video by inviting viewers to post comments, like, and share the video. He promotes his newsletter, which he claims consists of exclusive content to help viewers lead passionate lives. He shares his hope to provide tools and mindsets for individuals to be more authentic, on track with their goals, and capable of creating a successful and fulfilling life.
