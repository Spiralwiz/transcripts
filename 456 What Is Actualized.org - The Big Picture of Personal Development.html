            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/6vVIbPdfjxg' target='_blank'>What Is Actualized.org - The Big Picture of Personal Development</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Actualized.org as a concept</b>: Actualized.org, created by Leo Gura, is a comprehensive catalog of life principles and powerful concepts aimed at aiding their users in understanding life, reality, and how to live the best life possible. It covers a broad spectrum of topics such as self-help advice, relationship advice, health advice, developmental psychology, psychoanalysis, and other therapeutic strategies. The intention is to go both broad and deep in the understanding of life and living it, providing a holistic approach to various areas leading to a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Societal limitations and self-realization</b>: The societal structure and understanding of life are criticized for being primitive and unevolved, with humans believed to live at just around 1% to 2% of their potential. Actualized.org aims to challenge this notion and offer teachings for achieving a 'superhuman' state of consciousness, breaking out of the artificial limitations set by societal norms.
</li><li><b>Significance of self-mastery in personal growth</b>: Key to personal growth, according to Leo Gura, is internal focus, understanding one's own mind, and its workings as it shapes reality. He hypothesizes that most problems people face come from a lack of mastery over their mind and its machine, exacerbated by the materialist paradigm that overvalues the external, material world and undervalues the power our minds have in shaping reality.
</li><li><b>Uni-directional approach and lack of questioning in people</b>: Leo Gura points out a lack of holistic and unifying understanding in most mainstream teachings and educational methods. Individuals typically follow life paths already dictated to them such as careers and relationships, without challenging or questioning these paths' benefits. The major focus is usually on achieving outwardly defined goals like money, sex, love, entertainment, among others, which often leads to underachievement in terms of living a fulfilling and profound life.
</li><li><b>Focus on personal responsibility and internal change for a better life</b>: True change, according to Leo Gura, requires that individuals take responsibility and be willing to transform every aspect of themselves. The limitation comes from our fear of change and underlying fear of death that needs to be overcome to move beyond mediocre living. This requires active effort to understand the machinery of one's own mind and taking direct responsibility to influence it positively for improved life outcomes.
</li><li><b>Development of a personal instruction manual for navigating life</b>: Leo Gura compares an individual's life to the most advanced bio-machine, needing its own instruction manual like any other machinery. Unfortunately, most individuals lack this manual resulting in a lack of deep understanding of their own functionality. Creating this personal guide to life involves self-exploration, understanding one's desires, goals and taking charge of their life, much like a CEO coordinates and integrates different departments in an organization.
</li><li><b>The role of philosophy, spiritual connection, and personal vision in living the good life</b>: According to Gura, philosophy is crucial in understanding reality and living a fulfilling life. There is a need to develop a profound connection with life and reality rather than focusing on material possessions and achievements. Spirituality in this context involves experiencing moments of profundity and rejecting societal programming. Finally, individuals are encouraged to create a compelling personal vision and commit to a journey that will unlock new levels of consciousness, understanding, love, and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Understanding oneself</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that most people have a lack of understanding and awareness about themselves at physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual levels. This lack of understanding is likely because people are born into this life without an instruction manual and they accept the societal narratives they receive about their existence, without questioning it, rendering life as ordinary and mundane.
</li><li><b>Role of mind in self-development</b>: The video highlights the crucial role of the human mind in mediating and interpreting reality and generating life outcomes. The mind is presented as the gatekeeper that either allows or hinders self-improvement and spiritual growth, and taking control over it can lead to increased satisfaction and passion for life.
</li><li><b>Survival versus Spiritual growth</b>: Leo Gura draws a clear difference between living a life that is purely focused on fulfilling survival needs (financial, emotional, or material) and living a life that's grounded in a rich, spiritual connection with reality itself, with the latter resulting in deeper satisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Self-Validation, not Belief</b>: Actualized.org's non-dogmatic approach is clarified as focusing on individuals validating principles and concepts for themselves, without blindly believing or trusting in anyone else, including Leo Gura himself. The ideas presented are positioned as universal truths, and it's the individual's responsibility to investigate and validate them.
</li><li><b>Mind as a gatekeeper</b>: The mind is compared to a programmed computer, which influences life results remarkably. Since the mind gets programmed with beliefs and worldviews from a very early age, it's important to question and revise these pre-installed programs to achieve better results in life. 
</li><li><b>Challenging the status quo</b>: Leo encourages questioning societal narratives we receive during our upbringing and education, arguing that these are merely interpretations and belief systems that limit our potential. Any struggle or suffering in various aspects of life such as relationships, addictions, finances, fitness, or emotional well-being, is linked to this programmed mindset. Achieving personal growth requires taking responsibility for one's own life and altering this mindset.
</li><li><b>Passion through self-improvement</b>: The video promotes the idea that developing passion for life involves taking control of oneself and committing to a lifelong journey of self-improvement. The journey involves going beyond simple survival and connecting with life on deeper levels, including emotional, intuitive, and spiritual dimensions. 
</li><li><b>Importance of internal journey</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of turning attention inwards, pushing beyond societal narratives of normalcy, and reflecting upon the mystery and wonder of human existence. He encourages viewers to explore the influence their mind has on their perception of reality and their life results.
</li><li><b>Understanding societal programming and overcoming it</b>: A significant part of the video deals with societal programming, which determines our thoughts, actions, and thus the quality of our lives. Leo encourages his audience to challenge this programming, recognize its limiting nature, and work towards personal growth and self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Belief System</b>: Leo Gura posits that belief systems operate like computer software that is installed in our minds. These belief systems or 'pre-installed apps' are shaped by factors like upbringing, education, environment and even religion. Most people, he argues, are unaware of or fail to question these belief systems and hence, remain hold on to them, living life on autopilot without realizing their potential.
</li><li><b>Role of Mind</b>: Gura suggests that our mind is like a computer and is responsible for perpetuating negative patterns in our lives. These patterns make individuals feel stuck, demotivated, and unhappy. The solution to these problems and improving your life fundamentally lies in changing how your mind works.
</li><li><b>Taking Responsibility</b>: Gura emphasizes that instead of blaming external factors for your life situation, you should take responsibility for it. Admitting that you are not taking enough responsibility may hurt your ego, but it also allows you the opportunity to change and improve.
</li><li><b>Questioning and Changing Worldview</b>: Gura encourages viewers to question their worldview, which he compares to questioning and rewriting the operating system of a computer. Although it might be difficult to break out from the beliefs and principles instilled during upbringing, doing so empowers you to rewrite your worldview and fundamentally change your life.
</li><li><b>Social Norms Limiting Potential</b>: Leo blames the limitations on human potential largely on societal norms and pre-installed belief systems. Just changing habits or following societal norms will limit personal growth to a marginal level. To achieve significant improvement in life, and to reach their full potential, individuals need to change these belief systems. 
</li><li><b>Changing Operating System & Beliefs</b>: Just like updating an app or jailbreaking a phone, Leo encourages individuals to upgrade or fundamentally change their operating worldview and beliefs. This, he says, will allow individuals to get better results in life than just rearranging the pre-existing 'apps' or beliefs.
</li><li><b>Super Human Potential</b>: To reach 'superhuman' potential or a state of consciousness beyond ordinary, individuals need to delve deep and tinker at the kernel level, essentially the most basic level of beliefs and assumptions, and not simply stop at changing surface-level behaviors or beliefs. This, Leo acknowledges, is rarely encouraged by society, and can often be met with fear, skepticism or criticism.
</li><li><b>Resisting Change:</b> Leo acknowledges the resistance that individuals may experience when they consider changing their existing beliefs, norms, and practices. He enables viewers to understand that the fear of such changes is rooted in the fear of stepping into the unknown. To truly transform, one needs to let go of these fears and be open to embrace the shift.
</li><li><b>Enjoying the Journey:</b> Leo advises individuals to enjoy this journey of self-transformation rather than perceiving it as an uphill task. He underscores the importance of perseverance and consistency to confront failure, and learn from mistakes as inevitable steps in personal development efforts. 
</li><li><b>Taking Control</b>: He emphasizes the need to take control not just of external aspects of life, such as career and finances, but more importantly, the mind. Only then can one break free from negative behavioral patterns and invite organic change.
</li><li><b>Concept of a closed vs open mindset</b>: Leo Gura discusses the analogy of a closed mind as an Apple ecosystem, which like Apple, is designed for simplicity but limits freedom and magnifies conformity. On the other hand, an open mind is likened to a Linux operating system that offers freedom and allows the individual to explore and make changes.
</li><li><b>Criticism of societal programming</b>: Leo emphasizes that societal norms, education, and belief systems are not designed with the objective of maximizing individual potential but rather for societal convenience. Schools and universities, according to him, do not teach individuals how to live their best life possible as they themselves lack the knowledge.
</li><li><b>Need for self-education for self-liberation</b>: Leo asserts that in order to reach one's fullest potential, individual exploration is critical. This involves 'jailbreaking' the mind, which refers to breaking free from societal norms. However, this comes with potential dangers, and requires persistence, nuance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.
</li><li><b>Denial of objective world</b>: Leo refutes the belief in an objective external world that is separate from the mind. According to him, the belief system and worldview of an individual shapes their reality.
</li><li><b>Challenge of internal resistance to change</b>: Leo discusses the internal conflict between the part of the mind that seeks liberation and the part that resists change. This resistance stems from fear, laziness, and skepticism.
</li><li><b>Role of personal responsibility</b>: In order to reach top levels of personal development, Leo emphasizes the need for taking personal responsibility. This involves questioning and potentially changing societal beliefs and programming for individual growth. 
</li><li><b>Importance of personal transformations</b>: According to Leo, individuals must aim for personal transformations through self-awareness, introspection, and diligent efforts. This transformation, while challenging, will eventually lead to higher levels of consciousness and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Exploring uncharted territory</b>: Leo Gura elaborates on the difference between doing something that has been done before and is well-documented, versus doing something new or being one of the first to do it. The former is safe and free of potential dangers due to the vast amount of tried-and-tested information available, while the latter is susceptible to risks and dangers associated with the unknown.
</li><li><b>Venturing beyond societal norms</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of going beyond societal norms and suggests that achieving this involves stepping away from traditional teachings and outside one's comfort zone. He warns of the inherent danger in this journey due to its drastically different nature from societal norms and the lack of support from those adhering to these norms.
</li><li><b>Self-driven personal development</b>: He encourages viewers to approach life as a personal development project, using their direct experiences and tested ideas as validation points and guides. Gura stresses that these processes should result in positive transformation, otherwise the ideas should be discarded as detrimental.
</li><li><b>Writing one's instruction manual for life</b>: Gura asserts that life entails creating one's personal life instruction manual influenced by factors such as genetics, personality types, physical appearances, desires, fears, strengths, weaknesses, upbringing, environment, and many more. This life manual, according to Gura, can only be written through self-exploration and a deep understanding of one's desires and goals.
</li><li><b>Questioning desires and programming</b>: He discusses how most people blindly pursue desires without questioning their validity or if they will result in a fulfilling life. Gura suggests these desires might be tricks and traps of societal programming and urges viewers to question their emotions, which he believes run the show of life.
</li><li><b>Emotional manipulation of the mind</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that the human is controlled and manipulated by their mind and the emotions. He asserts that logic is secondary to emotions, and that our thoughts and behaviours are determined by how they react to emotions rather than logic.
</li><li><b>Mind's resistance to change and deception</b>: He highlights that the mind resists change even though we desire the benefits that change can bring. Gura illustrates how the mind deceives us into believing that we cannot or shouldn't change, and stresses that the fear of the unknown and of death are the common trigger for this resistance. 
</li><li><b>Dynamic nature of change</b>: Gura emphasizes that to achieve fulfilling lives, individuals must be willing to radically transform themselves, potentially discarding their former selves. He acknowledges that change can lead to unfamiliar or worse situations before improvements are seen, and that this dynamic nature of change frightens many people.
</li><li><b>Limitations and Personal Growth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that personal growth and change require a readiness to shed old identities, even if it is a challenge. This willingness can lead to significant results and life changes. However, he stresses that this is just the beginning and that actualizing growth is a process that might take decades.
</li><li><b>Siloed Knowledge</b>: Gura criticizes the fragmentation of knowledge in various fields such as science, medicine, philosophy, and spirituality. He argues that these fields tend to focus on their own isolated areas without proper communication and integration with each other. This leads to a lack of holistic understanding of reality since all parts of reality are interconnected.
</li><li><b>Taking a CEO Approach to Personal Development</b>: Gura recommends a holistic approach to knowledge and personal development, similar to a CEO coordinating various departments in a company. Individuals also need to integrate different perspectives and advice, and making executive decisions about their life goals. This requires taking charge in their own life, a task that ultimately can only be fulfilled by individuals themselves.
</li><li><b>Enjoying the Journey of Self-Improvement</b>: Gura advises individuals to enjoy the journey towards self-improvement rather than viewing it as a mere grind to reach an ultimate enlightened state. He re-emphasizes the importance of self-enjoyment, as the realization after reaching ones enlightenment could show that decades of life have been wasted on stress and struggle. 
</li><li><b>Philosophys Role in Personal Development</b>: Gura considers the pursuit of personal development as a philosophical journey. He criticizes the mainstream conception of philosophy both as mental masturbation irrelevant to human life and as a detached academic pursuit studying the works of old philosophers. Gura advocates for philosophy that seeks to understand and embody deep realities of life. He thinks it is crucial to address epistemological and philosophical questions in every field of knowledge to understand reality at its deepest levels. 
</li><li><b>Shortcomings in Modern Science and Psychology</b>: Gura criticizes modern science and psychology for their lack of a personal transformation dimension. He emphasizes that understanding should not be seen as separate from the one who understands, but rather an understanding so deep that it transforms the individual themselves. 
</li><li><b>Becoming a Philosopher for Progress</b>: Gura stresses that truly becoming a philosopheran individual deeply understanding reality and embodying that knowledgeis an essential step for progress. He argues that truly understanding facets of life, such as suffering and happiness, is intrinsically linked with transcending or disarming their negative effects.
</li><li><b>The Fragmented Approach to Reality and Lack of Personal Transformation in Science</b>: Leo Gura criticizes the current specialization approach in academia, where scientists focus on a specific field without considering their personal growth and well-being. He asserts that the true function of science should be to deepen our understanding of reality, transform ourselves, and shape society accordingly. 
</li><li><b>Total Understanding of Reality as a Goal</b>: Leo presents a radical idea that total understanding of reality is possible, arguing that this should be our ultimate goal in life. He encourages a deep inward journey to understand oneself, which will, in turn, help in comprehending the world and reality better. 
</li><li><b>The Inevitability of Mistakes and Importance of Perseverance</b>: Leo asserts that self-deception and mistakes are inevitable in personal development. However, he encourages individuals to embrace these failures, learn from them, and change their behavior. He emphasizes the significant role of perseverance in achieving success. 
</li><li><b>Commitment to Personal Growth</b>: Urging viewers to take life seriously, Leo suggests that real commitment to personal growth can unlock new levels of understanding, consciousness, love, and fulfillment. He warns about the radical nature of his content and recommends an open and serious mindset towards life.
</li><li><b>The Desire for a Profound Connection with Life</b>: Leo believes that true fulfillment comes from a profound connection with life, surpassing materialistic desires. He posits that spirituality and consciousness enable this connection, leading to a fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>The Limits of Societal Programming</b>: Leo criticizes societal norms and mainstream beliefs that prevent individuals from experiencing a profound connection with reality. He points out that the good life cannot be achieved by blindly following societal norms; instead, it requires personal effort and autonomy to engineer one's path to the good life.
</li><li><b>The Need for a Personal Vision and Work</b>: Leo concludes by emphasizing the importance of having a compelling personal vision that drives individuals to put in the necessary effort towards reaching their goals. The 'good life', he says, needs to be engineered by each individual, supported by resources likes his catalog of content.
