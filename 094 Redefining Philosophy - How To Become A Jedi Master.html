            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/v_poNe3gDEM' target='_blank'>Redefining Philosophy - How To Become A Jedi Master</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Philosophy's original definition</b>: Leo Gura discusses how the word "philosophy" originates from the Greek words for "love" and "wisdom"; implying an admiration for knowledge. Notably, this knowledge referenced understanding life and psychology, not just academic subject matter.
</li><li><b>Philosophy as a practical discipline</b>: The ancient philosophers, ranging from Socrates to Aristotle, did not just theorize, but lived according to the truths they discovered. True wisdom is not theoretical but practical knowledge that can be applied to improve one's life and live virtuously.
</li><li><b>Role of Philosophy in Society</b>: Philosophers in ancient times operated as self-actualized individuals, living up to human virtues and influencing society positively. They represented a subset of people who pursued knowledge and virtue beyond societal norms, making significant contributions to humanity.
</li><li><b>Deviation of Philosophy over the years</b>: Universities today have strayed from philosophy's original intent, focusing instead on academic minutiae with no meaningful real-life applications, creating a negative perception of philosophy as a discipline.
</li><li><b>Philosophy as a path to self-understanding</b>: Leo Gura argues that everyone should engage with philosophy as it's about learning how to live a good and fulfilling life. It's a practical discipline that encourages us to contemplate fundamental questions about our existence and purpose.
</li><li><b>Critical thinking in everyday life</b>: He points out that many people go through life without critically examining it, merely absorbing information without discerning its worth. He argues for becoming a "master of reasoning" who can distinguish between valuable knowledge and false claims.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of philosophy and psychology</b>: According to Gura, philosophy and psychology are deeply connected. He aspired to become a philosophy professor but found academia's approach to the discipline disappointingly shallow and bureaucratic. 
</li><li><b>Practicality of positive psychology</b>: For Gura, the most practical field to study today is positive psychology as it focuses on living a good life and aligning with ones values, which is more relevant for most people than dealing with abnormal psychological conditions.
</li><li><b>Lifelong interest in philosophy</b>: He advises viewers to develop a lifelong interest in philosophy, urging them to read widely and to think critically about their life and societal standards. 
</li><li><b>Using Star Wars as an analogy for philosophy</b>: Gura uses Star Wars as an analogy for the principles he advocates: the Jedi, as philosophers, work towards larger ideals and live virtuous lives while other characters like Han Solo and Leia lead more ordinary, comfortable lives without pursuing higher values.
</li><li><b>Star Wars Analogy</b>: Gura compares various Star Wars characters to types of people in society. Han Solo and Leia live ordinary lives focused on personal desires and maintaining the status quo. The Emperor and Darth Vader are the conscious but evil individuals. Generally, people tend to live unconsciously, paralleling Jabba the Hutts satisfaction with complacency and comfort over higher values. Gura challenges his viewers to question their roles in life and strive to be like the Jedi, the conscious ones who value wisdom and self-mastery.
</li><li><b>The Force as a Metaphor</b>: In this analogy, Gura explains that the Force in Star Wars parallels the practical understanding and control of one's own psychology in our lives. Mastery of the Force equals discipline, willpower, emotional intelligence, wisdom, and the pursuit of the right values in an individual's life. A person exercising mastery over their own psychology is compared to a Jedi Knight who has skill and power admired by others. Gura emphasizes that pursuing this course is challenging, requiring commitment and long-term thinking.
</li><li><b>Value of Philosophy</b>: Gura explains that many people dismiss philosophy without seeing its value or seeking immediate, tangible results. He argues that the true power comes from mastering one's own psychology and emotionsachievable through the path of philosophy. He acknowledges the difficulty in convincing those who are comfortable in their ways to embark on the path to self-mastery.
</li><li><b>Mastering the "Force"</b>: The "force"the ability to control oneself, master psychology, and control emotionscan be likened to the wisdom derived from philosophy. Mastery of this "force" leads to the ability to enact significant changes in life, paralleling the Jedi's power in the Star Wars universe.
</li><li><b>Obstacles in Achieving Mastery</b>: This journey to self-mastery is tough, and not everyone will see the value in it. Drawing parallels with the Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt, who represents those too comfortable and not willing to change, it may be hard for such individuals to appreciate this wisdom, which sees philosophy's potential power in tangible, everyday life, paralleling it to the force in Star Wars.
</li><li><b>Gura's Offered Wisdom</b>: Gura shares knowledge acquired from years of studying, attending seminars, and reading, for viewers to gain from his wisdom. However, he ponders whether viewers can see the value in it or dismiss it out of comfort and fear.
</li><li><b>Mindset Limitations</b>: People often limit themselves by their mindset and internal beliefs, unaware that these are not real limitations. Understanding and mastering these psychological "rules" opens up limitless possibilities in life.
</li><li><b>Journey Towards Mastery</b>: Gura urges viewers to embark on this journey towards self-mastery, emphasizing the fulfillment and performance improvement it brings. The journey is not necessarily fast or instant, but stepping on this path and staying opened-minded can lead to profound experiences. 
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Join This Path</b>: Gura encourages viewers to join this path of self-improvement and self-mastery by subscribing to his website, where they can access more wisdom and resources to aid their journey towards becoming the "Jedi" of their own lives.
