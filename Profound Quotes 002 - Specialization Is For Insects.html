hey this is Leo for actualised org and I am
at you with another profound quote specialization is for insects
a human being should be able to change a diaper
plan an invasion butcher a hog con a ship design
a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall
set bones comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate
act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure
program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die
gallantly that is a quote from Robert Heinlein author of
Starship Troopers science fiction novel ok so what is this
quote about specialization is for insects I love this idea
there's something powerful here and the power of this quote
lies in the fact that as our society advances we
tend to get more and more specialized and we tend
to be putting ourselves in positions where we become very
focused on one or two things in our life that
we get really good at and this is usually revolves
around your career your your vocation we get so focused
on that and the pressures of the world the pressures
of business the pressures of the marketplace are forcing us
to specialize that we lose touch with really who we
are the robustness of being a human being and on
the one hand market forces are pushing us to be
more specialized and by more specialized I mean if you're
an engineer you need to be a specific type of
engineer you need to maybe be an electrical engineer and
then within Electrical Engineering you need to pick a subspecialty
of something maybe computers and within computers you need to
pick another subspecialty of maybe you work on micro processors
chips microchips and so you work on that and maybe
within that there's another subspecialty another subspecialty and another subspecialty
and ultimately what you end up doing is working with
in a very very very narrow narrow slice of what
is possible for you out there in life and then
what happens is that the rest of your life is
kind of like a little appendage a little appendage to
that specialty that you're really good at and maybe if
you're for example a graphic designer then you're a graphic
designer but you start to specialize within something in graphic
design so maybe you do graphic design for magazines and
maybe a specific type of magazine you only do graphic
design for health and fitness magazines and maybe even more
specialized than that it's health and fitness magazines for elderly
women or something like that right and you're very focused
on that and that becomes your niche there's something powerful
in that and I actually think that you need to
have that you need to be able to develop a
deep proficient C in something to be successful life but
there's also something lost there so you also need to
scale back and step back and become really that concept
of being a Renaissance man whatever happened to that idea
of being a Renaissance man just the value that was
placed on that to be a full robust fulfilled human
being to be like really fulfilled in your soul I
think you need this you need to challenge yourself to
be a student of life and I don't even now
mean just psychology I mean have broad interests be interested
in everything in life I like to tell myself that
I can literally be interested in anything and I am
I have diverse interests and I'm interested in lots of
things I'm interested in cooking I'm interested in fitness I'm
interested in psychology obviously because I'm shooting these videos I'm
interested in science I'm interested in cosmology I'm interested in
philosophy I'm interested in literature I'm interested in history I'm
interested in biographies I'm interested in politics and social dynamics
I'm interested in computer programming I'm interested in graphic design
I'm interested in fine art I'm interested in human relations
I'm interested in management I'm live interested in business I'm
interested in marketing I'm interested in like all of it
whatever the list is I'm curious about it some things
more than others but generally any topic I could find
myself being interested in I mean I love art I
love just the beauty of looking at a nice painting
like a classic painting like a van Gogh going to
a gallery looking at a van Gogh up in person
or looking at a Cezanne we're looking at any of
the post impressions which I really love I love to
look at just paintings and books because I don't get
to go to museums that often but I like to
look at paintings and books I like to look at
graphic design I like to look at designs of web
sites to me even though that can have value in
my business I like to do that just for itself
just for the sake of it I'm curious and I'm
curious about history I'm curious about how human Humanity has
evolved I'm curious about all the historical events that have
happened in all historical figures figures like Hitler and Hitler
was like Napoleon and I'm interested in philosophers from ancient
times and I'm interested to pick the brains of of
great figures in history both figures that were great in
a good way and figures that were great in an
evil way like Hitler I have books on Hitler sometimes
people come to my apartment and they see my bookshelf
and one of the baddest books I've got is this
book and it's just a says it's been bright white
and red letters it says Adolf on it and people
are kind of shocked like why do you have a
book about Hitler because it's fascinating I mean aren't you
fascinated about that phenomenon aren't you fascinated about a human
being who created such a profound impact in the 20th
century who has such a profound impact who whose actions
and thoughts literally influenced the trajectory of humanity they have
led to the deaths of millions tens of millions of
people but also not only that but looking beyond that
just seeing the whole repercussions of all that what that
led up to the technological advances the you know the
motivations that Hitler had like he was that's fascinating to
me how could a man like that come about what
drove him so you know I think that everyone should
be fascinated by Hitler I think everyone should be fascinated
by by philosophy I think everyone should be fascinated by
science and history and art like this is this is
life why are you not fascinated by this stuff and
there's two points here one point is that this opens
you up this really makes you a humanist this gives
you a a worldly view of what the hell is
going on it makes you more open-minded and what it
does is it builds wisdom in you so first of
all it's just beautiful this is something that you can
take a lot of pleasure in just for its own
sake but also it builds that wisdom which actually find
is quite rare and I find that it's powerful in
subtle ways so right now you might be listening to
this video and thinking well how does this apply to
my job or my life or my love life or
something like that and there's no direct easy way to
say that reading books about history and science will have
direct application but actually they will because what's going to
happen is that over time as you're reading and you're
studying these subjects and you're just curious and you're expanding
yourself and you're you're being fully human what you start
to develop in yourself is you develop a sense of
judgment in a sense of the wisdom so you're able
to have a more keen perceptive mind that will then
spill over into all areas of your life it will
most definitely impact your business and how you manage your
business what's going to happen with businesses if you become
someone who is worldly who knows history who knows science
who understands politics and his interest in all these things
first of all you're going to have more creative ideas
with the directions that your business can go in you're
also going to be more conscious about the impact of
that business on the world at large and on people
so you're going to run a more conscious business the
values of that business will not just be about making
money it will be about making a positive impact also
you are going to be more of a long-term thinker
and you're going to be able to deal with some
of those tough decisions that you have to make in
business you're going to be able to deal with them
better you're going to be able to be a better
strategist you're going to see very far down the road
you're going to make very wise decisions rather than making
some of those easy quick fix decisions that might do
something for you right now but eventually will lead to
problems and catastrophes down the road so in the end
developing this kind of wisdom and judgment can really make
the difference between whether your business is going to fail
or succeed I've definitely seen this in my life so
that's just one powerful example how about in your relationships
it will have an effect there how about in your
personal development that wisdom and judgment is going to have
a huge effect on your personal development how about your
hobbies do you think your hobbies will be influenced by
this yeah I mean basically your whole life the way
you raise your family the way you educate your kids
the way you interact with your spouse the way that
you interact with people the leader the kind of leader
that you are the kind of manager that you are
if you're in a leadership or in a management position
your vocabulary your ability to spell your understanding of issues
your ability to be conned and to be swindled and
to be susceptible to the shady marketing that is so
rampant in society nowadays to to withstand that even your
ability to stay healthy will be affected by this right
so this is the power of this idea do not
become too specialized and this can be a challenge because
you have these forces these forces in the marketplace that
are telling you to specialize in specialize and specialize but
you got to do is you got to kind of
be a bit of a rebel and yes on the
one hand you do have to specialize sometimes and you
should with your work but also at the same time
you have to step back create opportunities for you to
build your worldliness to build your understanding of culture of
life of science when you do that you become a
well-educated grounded human being and this is part of the
self-actualization process is a self actualized human is not someone
who's just really good at one thing you can find
excellent people who are really I would say stupid they're
so limited in what they know that they're just very
mechanical they become a machine and they might become a
very efficient and good machine but then what do they
really know about life what did they know about humanity
what do they just experience overall for example maybe take
someone like an Olympic athlete an Olympic athlete trains their
ass off for years and years and years really really
hard and they become really really good at what they
do and to me that's a beautiful thing but also
I think that they sacrifice because they become so specialized
they become like an insect they become very good at
mechanically doing that one thing but they might sacrifice some
of these larger larger things I mean do they understand
business do they understand marketing do they understand psychology I'm
sure some of them do I'm sure some of them
are great and in fact there's both specialized and generalized
but I also think that you can imagine that some
of them are so focused and so specialized on just
one domain of life that they're really missing out and
I think that one of the beautiful things about life
is that you have an opportunity to experience a lot
of it I think people really limit themselves when they
say that well I'm only interested in in this little
hobby here this little topic here why why aren't you
interested in all of it why are you making why
are you making judgments and tastes why not be someone
who tastes and samples all of life when you do
that what you'll realize is you actually come into a
true deep understanding of who you are and what your
true likes and dislikes are a lot of people they
will specialize in one thing and they will be so
focused on it that they never really went out there
and sampled and when they didn't go out and sample
their decision to specialize is only based on really circumstance
they just happen to fall into something they didn't really
choose it and they don't know maybe there's something better
out there this is one of the ways that you
go about finding your life purpose your true life purpose
is that you go out and you take the time
you do the work and you actually go out there
and you look or around you travel you read books
you read blogs you enjoy different types of food you
you enjoy different types of art and culture and film
and you're open-minded to it all and music so you
listen to club music you maybe listen to rap music
you also listen to classical music you don't have to
focus on one of them go and try all of
it you'll naturally have some inclinations towards one or two
of those but why not expand expand yourself experience life
I mean ultimately what are you here for what is
your purpose is it to just work is it to
just earn a paycheck is it to just buy a
house and retire comfortably no I think for self actualized
human being the purpose of life realizing that it's short
is to experience it I mean is that a purpose
that you have that's personally a purpose that I have
is I want to experience life I want to both
experience it sensually with my senses I also want to
experience all of life with my intellect with my mind
that's why I love reading on diverse topics I love
studying diverse topics I like talking about diverse topics I
like philosophy and history and science because I want to
experience all those with my mind it's interesting there's differences
in similarities and you find patterns like it's it's cool
and then also essentially I want to experience it I
want to live in different countries I want to try
different foods I want to live in different cities different
types of cities big cities little cities compare and like
have those experiences there's something that happens to you that's
very difficult to quantify and articulate it's something intangible when
you have a lot of life experience when you've lived
in different places when you know different languages when you've
interacted with a diverse group of people this is one
of the reasons why in colleges they will force you
to take breadth requirements and why they will try to
have a diverse population of students on the campus it's
this idea of building up a certain worldliness within you
they're trying to instill that within you that's why they
make you take art classes if you're a science major
and if you're art major that make you take some
science classes it opens you up but that shouldn't stop
at college and in fact I think College College is
just like the tip tip of the iceberg after you
graduate you should be out there experiencing life taking it
in don't be so specialized that you become an insect
a drone on the one level on one hand that
that is a way to become successful but on the
other hand you also notice this is something that self
Godin talks about is that really to be successful in
this new century you need to develop some skills and
some thinking abilities that are beyond just simple mechanical functions
mechanical functions are very quickly being made obsolete with technology
technology is getting very very good at replacing human beings
in doing mundane things and this even goes for specializing
in something that right now maybe humans cannot or robots
or machines cannot do but over time they will be
able to do it the really difficult thing may be
the impossible thing at least in the foreseeable future for
computers or robots to do is to get at this
very intangible high level level of thinking judgment and wisdom
that is something that we're not even close to replicating
and so that is where you want to be at
because that's where you can generate a lot of value
and when you're there it feels so good it feels
so rich your life feels rich and you have all
these opportunities to share with people and you know so
much more about yourself and you know how to make
yourself fulfilled and just that process of expanding yourself becoming
open-minded becoming a Renaissance man that's powerful there's a power
there's an ineffable power there that's difficult to articulate and
I think that we take for granted so take Robert
Island's advice and don't specialize because specialization is for insects
