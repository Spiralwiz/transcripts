            <ul>
    <li><b>Identification and Pursuit of Passion Requires Effort</b>: Passion doesn't just materialize; it requires conscious thought, effort, and investment of time. Many people desire to find their passion but shirk the work it involves which restricts them from achieving it.
</li><li><b>Rewards of Discovering Your Passion</b>: Real passion in life is very rewarding and can significantly enhance the quality of life. It is an element of life worth allocating years of one's life to find.
</li><li><b>Authenticity and Discovery in Passion</b>: Authenticity is integral to passion. Recognizing one's true identity and preferences results in a naturally-developing passion.
</li><li><b>Impact of Limited Life Experience on Discovering Passion</b>: Limited life experiences restrict explorative opportunities, affecting the discovery and pursuit of passion. Exploration and broadening horizons are essential for identifying one's passion.
</li><li><b>Adopting an Explorative Approach</b>: Life should be treated as a buffet of choices, where every option is sampled before settling on a favorite. This approach also applies when choosing different jobs to identify what aligns with one's passion.
</li><li><b>Identification and Analysis of Preferences</b>: Recognizing and analyzing what one does not like in their current job or environment provides significant hints about where their true passion could lie. 
</li><li><b>Role of Self-questions in Finding Passion</b>: Regularly inquiring about one's likes, dislikes, and passion can assist in the continuous pursuit of passion. This approach enables one to connect with their authentic selves and lead a more engaging life. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Personality through Job Preferences</b>: Examining one's encouraging and discouraging elements in their current job can provide insights about their personality and possible job alignment. This information can guide the individual in making informed career decisions.
</li><li><b>Engineering Example</b>: Leo uses the example of an engineer who discovers he doesn't enjoy his job due to corporate environment and lack of human interaction. These insights allow him to make informed decisions about his next career move, perhaps seeking a job in a smaller company with more autonomy and interaction.
</li><li><b>The Buffet Analogy</b>: Just like choosing food from a buffet, exploring different jobs allows one to understand personal preferences. The first career choice might not be the perfect fit but it informs the process of alignment, leading closer to authentic desires and providing valuable insights for future career exploration.
</li><li><b>Iterative process and commitment</b>: Discovering your passion is a continuous and iterative process. It might require changing jobs multiple times and can be challenging and stressful, but with commitment, this exploration can lead to finding one's passion.
</li><li><b>Impact of finding your passion</b>: If you find your passion, numerous life problems like financial struggles, relationship issues, or lack of motivation can dissolve. The individual becomes more engaged and finds an improved quality of life. 
</li><li><b>Exploration methods</b>: Leo suggests several ways to explore and discover oneself such as reading widely, acquiring a comprehensive college education, traveling, trying different jobs, living in different places, meeting new people, trying new experiences, and spending time alone.
</li><li><b>Constant self-interrogation</b>: Engaging in introspective conversations about personal likes, dislikes, and passions consistently helps in discovering your passion. This reflective practice involves questioning personal experiences, preferences, and interactions for an overall understanding of one's self.
</li><li><b>Role of actualized.org</b>: The platform aims to assist individuals in finding their passion and leading a more engaged life. By offering weekly newsletters, insights, and bonuses, it promotes a constant exploration of self, leading to a better understanding of life, mastering personal psychology and connecting with an authentic self. The process takes time and commitment but can deliver transformative results over time.
