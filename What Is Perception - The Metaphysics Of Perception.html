[Music] you what is perception that's a question which we
will answer in this episode very conclusively by this question
what we mean is not only what is perception but
what is the relationship between perception the mind the brain
consciousness and reality how is it that perception can happen
at all this is a very deep philosophical question that
Western philosophers and scientists have been pondering literally for thousands
of years and still struggle with today and I've been
wracking my mind over this question for probably two decades
until I finally resolved it around six months ago during
my 30-day solo meditation retreat now that retreat didn't quite
go fully to plan I only completed half of it
14 days but nevertheless in those 14 days that I
did complete I had some pretty epic epiphanies and one
of the things that I discovered is that I discovered
they answered this question and I discovered that perception actually
does not exist it's an illusion and that was one
of the deepest mind [ __ ] of my life
and I've had many mine flux which I've shared with
you but this one in particular was quite astounding and
so I want to go a little bit into the
mechanics of how it is that we get perception so
wrong wise perception so tricky why do so few people
understand it there are many philosophers and academics and neuroscientists
right now in top-notch universities who are trying to understand
this problem and they still aren't getting it because of
how tricky it is but we will explain it for
you here today and that's not because I'm arrogant it's
not because I have some kind of special knowledge that
I think that I'm above everybody else that I know
something that other people don't know it's not that it's
just that this problem which is otherwise known as the
mind-body problem which we will result today this problem has
been resolved for over 5,000 years it was resolved by
saints and sages but the problem is is that in
modern Western culture modern science doesn't really go to thee
to these ancient sources to to study them into and
to do the practices to realize what they realized 5,000
years ago and even before that so and that's a
shame and that's what we're gonna correct here today so
my explanation is gonna try to address this question from
a sort of a very modern 21st century perspective for
modern materialists so I'm making a pretty big claim here
I'm saying that perception does not exist and you should
be rightly skeptical about what it is exactly that I'm
saying their perception does not exist I mean am i
contradicting all the stuff that you're experiencing right this very
moment well obviously I can't be but at the same
time then what am I talking about I promise you
though that what I'm talking about it's not merely a
word game or not merely some philosophy but something very
significant something life-transforming if you stay with me and really
grasp what I'm saying here something is being pointed to
that's a little bit tricky to grasp but with some
luck today with some examples and metaphors and even some
demonstrations that I'll show you some props that I brought
it'll be a little bit easier for you to understand
so perception contrary to what most people are taught is
not a biological or a neurological process perception doesn't actually
occur but when I say that I don't mean what
you think I mean because obviously the raw data of
perception is undeniable so I'm not denying colors I'm not
denying that you see shapes I'm not denying that you
hear sounds so then what am I really saying well
we're gonna get into that in a second but first
let's let's really clarify what I mean by the word
perception what are we really talking about so bring it
into your direct experience perception and we're not just going
to be using the word perception we're going to be
talking about experience or the visual field all of these
words and labels are gonna be synonymous basically interchangeable for
us here so when I'm talking about the visual field
of course that's that's only part of perception there's also
the auditory field and your body sensations on it that's
part of experience that's part of perception but I'm gonna
focus on the visual field today because if you can
grasp the visual field then all the other perceptual fields
you'll be able to make sense of just as well
so what I mean by perception or experience is this
sensory bubble that you are in have you noticed that
you're inside the sensory bubble whatever room you're sitting in
wherever you are indoors outdoors doesn't matter you're basically encased
in this bubble of perceptions and this is how you
interact with reality right you know humans are very visual
creatures so for us it's mostly this visual bubble but
of course there's sort of all the auditory sounds are
here and all that but it's all basically happening in
this bubble it's almost as though you're living your entire
life in this snow globe or this at the inside
of a Christmas ornament this round Christmas ornament that's how
I like to conceive of it in my mind which
is painted from the inside not from the outside and
so all you see is the inner walls of this
Christmas ornament so every time that I'm using the word
perception or experience or visual field that's what I'm talking
about and I want you to become aware of that
right now look around you and notice that what you're
in right now is this perceptual bubble and that's we're
gonna be talking about this entire time here in this
episode so what you have to understand though about the
word perception and also experience that these are very sneaky
words very sneaky they carry in a hidden metaphysics because
perception and experience the way that they're used in language
they imply a subject in an object duality and this
is a very important point a lot of people overlook
so it doesn't make sense in our language or any
human language to say that there is a perception or
an experience but that nobody is having it so this
is what I mean by subject object so the subject
would be like me leo and the object would be
let's say the color red that I see on the
wall over there so the color is the subject is
is the object I'm the subject and so I am
perceiving that color we would say like that so by
definition really perception and experience requires a subject or someone
who is having the experience and so if I just
told you one day that there's a free-floating experience somewhere
out in the universe like the color red is just
floating around somewhere that would make sense to you say
something is wrong with you something's wrong with your with
your head Leo because you can't just have the color
red floating around in the universe someone has to be
perceiving it because that's the implicit metaphysics that comes with
thinking about perceptions and experiences so now I want you
to kind of open up your mind a little bit
more and think about what do what does an experience
or perception look like when we remove the subject or
the owner of the perception or the experience so try
to imagine like the color red literally just kind of
floating out in the vacuum of empty space not something
that's happening to you you're not seeing it you're not
experiencing it but it's there so what would that be
really what we're doing is we're we're stripping the object
of the subject we're taking away the subject or another
we can think of it is that we're collapsing the
subject and object together such that that thing is just
being out there without a creature or an entity or
a sentient being looking at it and experiencing it would
you still call that thing an experience or a perception
if that was even possible well on the one hand
you might be tempted to say that yes it's still
a perception it's still basically an experience leo it's just
that it's not occurring to anybody but then again that
really changes what you think an experience or a perception
really is if it can be experienced or perceived without
an experiencer or a perceiver that sort of redefines radically
redefines what those terms mean and not just in sort
of a a word gaming kind of way something very
significantly different is happening now so here's what I want
you to consider is that if this could happen the
raw data let's say of this experience or perception would
still stay exactly the same so colors would still stay
the same shapes they wouldn't change the color red would
still be the color red but what would happen is
a radical recontextualization such that this raw data of red
or whatever it is is no longer yours and is
own no longer a thing that is happening to you
and that's very very significant it's been depersonalized you might
say and along with that it's also no longer biological
it's no longer something that is related to your brain
or to your mind and it's no longer even a
part of your life because all of that assumes a
you or a subject that is part of this relationship
with the object it's just a pure object we might
say or another way to say it is that we
removed all the personal selfhood out of this thing and
we've just turned it into a universal experience so you
might think of it as the universe who is experiencing
this color red out in a vacuum the universe not
you not some of the creature knots other person but
the universe but the trick here is that you don't
want to think of the universe as a human or
a person or even as a sentient thing it's just
that that object is just like floating out there sort
of the way that you might imagine for example that
an object might have been flowing out in the vacuum
of empty space billions of years ago long before there
were humans long before there was even a planet earth
long before there were any planets in the entire universe
there were no sentient creatures of any kind no biological
life anywhere in the universe and yet we still think
that they were like asteroids planets forming stars star dust
nebulas supernovas and black holes and stuff like that right
so you might kind of wonder like well who was
perceiving those obviously nobody there was nobody there to perceive
them and yet you still believe that those objects were
out there and that they existed so I want you
now to try to imagine an object that exists all
by itself in an empty universe with no one perceiving
it what might that be like how would the universe
even know or register that this object is there this
is a very tricky and deep problem you see how
does the universe even know itself like if an asteroid
existed 10 billion years ago so did the universe kind
of have a record like this the universe have a
database of all the asteroids and it's kind of knows
what asteroids are inside of it well you could think
of it that way but still it's not quite right
because what does it mean for the universe like so
if this database exists is there somebody in the universe
like some entity looking at the database seeing the database
perceiving the database no you can't quite say that because
we're saying that the universe hasn't evolved yet to the
point where there are sentient creatures so you're sort of
in this weird situation where you have to say that
there there is this kind of database but yeah nobody
knows about it so what does it even mean to
say that there is a database because what we mean
when we say that something is is we really mean
that we're perceiving it someone is perceiving it so this
sort of gets us into some very deep metaphysical waters
that are tricky to navigate but let's back up a
step it lets go sort of go back to the
beginning let's simplify this conversation and let me explain to
you what your current conception of reality is the conception
which gets you confused about what perception is so number
one what you believe is that there is an objective
external material world and that this world exists independently of
you right that's what 99.9% of you believe number two
is that there are two kinds of objects in this
world there are dumb objects like rocks cars buildings and
planets and then there are sentient creatures like humans cats
dogs and apes number three you believe that these sentient
objects sentient creatures that they perceive the external world and
that every creature has this perceptual field or bubble that
is their perception of the external world number five you
believe that you were born into the world as one
of these biological sentient creatures you believe that that's what
you are and number six you believe that the perceptual
field that you have as one of these creatures is
inside of the brain or is produced by the brain
which is itself a dumb objects from like a rock
which exists as part of the external world and you
would say well we don't know exactly how this dumb
object called a brain can produce this perceptual bubble field
but nevertheless obviously it does because here it is so
that's the conventional model this is the sort of scientific
materialistic model that everybody follows even religious people still basically
buy into this model so what I realized during my
meditation retreat is that all of this is an illusion
created by the ego that's not actually how it works
here's how it actually works number one there is no
objective external material world only one thing exists in all
of existence and that is one universal field of consciousness
that's what everything you've ever interacted with has been is
this one universal field of consciousness number two you did
not come into existence as an object not as a
dumb object nor as one of these sentient creatures that's
an illusion actually you were born as an idea follow
me here this is very mind-warping you're not an object
you're an idea you right there that thing that thinks
it's a physical object you're actually an idea now you'll
see leo but no I'm a physical object I can't
be an idea that's silly how could I be an
idea when looking look on physically on physical yeah that's
the idea that you're a physical object you're not actually
a physical object you're the idea that you're a physical
object you following this it gets a little weird they're
still number three this idea of you when it spawned
into being into existence it took ownership of this field
of consciousness that exists and misinterpreted it as its own
perceptions and here we are so you are sitting here
right now listening to me and you find yourself in
this bubble and you believe that this bubble is yours
you believe that it's you you actually believe that this
is comprising your life like if this bubble was extinguished
that's what you imagine death is right is the ending
of this bubble the cessation of this bubble lights out
the bubble is gone and what you imagine your birth
was was the instantiation of this bubble and what I'm
telling you is that that's not the case what actually
happened is that there was this field this field stretches
out to infinity and then one day this field had
an idea and the idea was that oh this field
is mine and this is my life and so what
you did is you've actually constructed the ego when it
came into existence it constructed out of this field this
sense of this is me this sense of selfhood and
it took ownership of it and then it convinced itself
that well if this is me and this is my
life and this is what's happening then I must be
perceiving some external world out there behind the scene somewhere
and this is these are my perceptions of that external
world behind seen somewhere that external objective material world which
of course you've never encountered because all you ever encounter
is this perceptual bubble that you're in and so literally
your sense of selfhood has distorted this non-personal field and
has made it personal for you and you've actually constructed
your own life out of it you've sort of carved
your own life out of this giant block of stone
and you have can confused it with yourself and this
is where the idea of perception comes in but of
course there's really no such thing as perception in the
same way that when let's say you're a child and
you're given a toy and you really are attached to
this toy you start to actually believe that this is
this is my toy now of course when you were
given the toy nothing changed about the toy the toy
before it was your toy it was just a toy
nobody owned it you didn't own it it was just
an object floating around the universe they gave it to
you you got attached to it and now you call
it my toy mine it's mine but of course you
created that nothing about the toy changes when you call
it my toy except it is significant to realize that
this toy is not really mine and that I'm creating
the idea that it's mine you see so that's why
what we're talking about here is not merely a word
game because it does matter if the child is deluded
and really believes that he owns this toy that ownership
is some sort of objective property of the universe rather
than a projection of his own mind right and so
that's what I'm trying to get you to realize here
is that this belief you have that this bubble of
perception is yours it's part of your biological being the
creature that you are that this is just like that
child buying into that toy so this this sort of
co-opting of this field of consciousness by your ego happens
so seamlessly that you just took it as a physical
fact and you just completely bought into the idea that
you're a biological sentient creature and your parents reinforce this
idea inside of you when you were young because well
they also bought into this idea and they weren't very
conscious and they reinforced this idea that you are a
sentient creature and they told you that other sentient creatures
exist like birds and dogs and cows and cats and
all this other humans and you just started to believe
that oh yeah all these other things out there are
also sentient creatures like me but really what happened is
that you were carved out of the universal field of
consciousness like a negative sculpture and I want to show
you an image here of a negative sculpture so you
understand what that looks like you see this rectangle at
first glance it seems like it's there it's real and
it exists but that's only because of how it's been
carved out by all the surrounding material and so that's
what you are you are not an object that came
into existence rather you are the whole that was sort
of carved out of this field of consciousness you see
and so what you believe death is is the disillusion
of this structure which will break apart this rectangle if
if you're the rectangle in this analogy see but that
rectangle isn't really real it's just like a negative space
and so that's what you are you are just sort
of like a negative space within this bubble of what
we're calling perception but if we remove the you from
this bubble of perception what do we have left the
perceptions don't change per se the raw data of the
perceptions don't change so the colors are still there the
shapes are still there the sounds are still dil all
of that is there the only thing we're removing is
the you and you might at first think well that's
not very significant but think about a little bit deeper
it's extremely significant because what we're saying here is that
these perceptions are not happening to a biological creature these
perceptions are just floating out in the vacuum of empty
space you might say are you getting this it's pretty
twisted but actually also it's very very simple actually it's
your models the model that I showed you before it's
that model that you have the conventional model that's what's
really twisted what I'm explaining now is actually very simple
the only reason it seems twisted is because it's it's
so counterintuitive and it's so weird it seems so foreign
it seems like magic or it seems like it's just
impossible or it seems like it's some sort of science
fiction story so it just it seems very radical and
it is it's very very radical we're talking about a
radical recontextualization of everything you've ever encountered in your life
see so as I talked about in my understanding recontextualization
episode make sure you go watch that when I was
rather profound and important for understand you what I'm talking
about here when I use the word recontextualization we are
reinterpreting how you've been interpreting all of the raw data
of reality your entire life you have been mistaken that
for perceptions of a biological creature organism that you think
you are and now what I'm saying is that there
never was such a biological creature organism that was an
illusion it was the sort of negative space that you
bought into and thought was real so you can think
of what we're talking about here in two different ways
and this of course again is non duality non-duality means
that all boundaries and dualities and categories must collapse so
of course you must expect that the duality between subject
and object must ultimately collapse but you can think of
that in two ways you can think that the object
disappears and only the subject remains or you can think
of the subject disappears and only the object remains so
what that means in this example is that you could
think of it as what I'm saying is that it's
as though the external world is not real and never
actually existed so that external material objective world that you
thought was out there behind your perceptions causing your perceptions
what we're saying here is that there's no such thing
it never existed another way to say that is to
say that appearance is reality there's nothing more to reality
than appearance so that's sort of one side of this
coin but actually there's sort of a rather more profound
way to think about it which is actually the exact
opposite way which is not to eliminate the external world
but rather to eliminate the internal world you know because
if we eliminate the external world then all you might
think there is is just the internal world just appearances
and appearances we think of as the internal world but
now think of it the other way the second way
you can think of it as imagine that the internal
world is not real and never existed and that all
there ever was was the external world but you have
mistaken the external world for the internal world and so
now we're reinterpreting it and putting in its proper place
that what you thought was the internal world all of
this of all these colors and sensations right this is
what I mean by the internal world you've thought about
this as being the internal world because you know of
course these we call these by definition subjective we say
that well certain people can be color blind so they'll
see a certain color but then another person won't see
that same color or you know maybe like a dog
they say has black and white vision dog can't see
in color so you would think that well if a
dog is looking at that flower he's seeing in black
and white and when I look at the flower I'm
seeing red and yellow and blue and green and all
these other colors so we're thinking that these are like
you know our individual bubbles and that these are subjective
internal worlds that biological creatures create using their brains but
no no what I'm saying now is that forget all
that there never was an internal world what you thought
was the internal world is actually the external world so
what this means is is that the external world we're
changing really kind of like the definition of what the
external world beans here the external world is not something
behind-the-scenes that is hidden that you never get to interact
with it's the exact opposite the internal world is completely
open to you and not hidden from you at all
now at first glance you might say well leo these
are like polar opposites ways of thinking about reality which
way is correct but actually they're identical they're identical it's
just different ways of looking at it different perspectives notice
that in both of these examples the raw data doesn't
change the colors all stay the same the shapes stayed
the same the sounds stay the same the feelings in
the body stay the same all that's changing is how
you're interpreting all of that and that's extremely significant that's
life-changing stuff don't think of interpretation as just some odds
just some interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo no no interpretation is
everything here because now what I want you to imagine
is that as you're sitting here right now imagine being
able to reinterpret your very experience that's happening right now
all the colors and sounds and sights imagine reinterpreting that
so radically that you actually cease to exist you reinterpret
yourself out of existence because you're removing the subject what
you thought was an experience or a perception where there
was you back here the subject and the object out
there that you back here in the subject that just
gets completely eliminated like it never even existed that's that
empty rectangle from the negative space that gets eliminated and
now all that you see is you just see the
material the substrate that was that was carving out that
negative square or rectangle see so literally if you're able
to accomplish this you reinterpret yourself out of existence and
that's pretty radical it's pretty radical because then you no
longer think of this everything that's going on here as
your life it stops being personal it's no longer your
life is no longer your perceptions what is it it's
been universalized this is universal it's being rather than perception
and that's one of the key things I want you
to take away from this episode the difference between experience
perception which are the same and being which is different
I use the word being sometimes in my various talks
but people don't really register what being is and they
can't because they don't understand what perception is so that's
why this episode is so important because it draws the
distinction between perception and being so the definition of being
is perception - the ego or experience - the ego
is being and another way to phrase it is that
what perception is is being plus ego so when we
take experience and we separate off the subject and we
kill the subject and all we have is the object
that's being that is like when you were imagining an
object or the color red just floating out in the
middle of empty space like an asteroid that existed ten
billion years ago before there were any sentient creatures in
the universe that was being because there was no subject
there and then conventionally what you've been experiencing your whole
life is perception or experience which is an illusion because
really perception or experience really is nothing but being you
see there is no difference between being and perception other
than the way that you interpret it or rather the
way you misinterpret it so perception and experience is actually
technically speaking a misinterpretation of being and this misinterpretation happens
because the ego comes in there and it takes ownership
over being and it says me mine this is all
mine this is all happening to me this is my
life mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine and
when that happens you get experience or perception and if
you stop doing that if you train your mind to
undo that then you will decontextualize perception and experience and
it will go back to just being being but of
course that means that you're gonna be dead there's not
going to be a you anymore there's gonna be being
but there's not gonna be you so just to be
very clear what this means is that again that doesn't
mean that these colors and shapes and sounds that you
hear that they will change they will still be here
but there will not be a you who is hearing
them or who is experiencing them and that's a pretty
radical change in perception very radical so I have a
little analogy here that I like to use to think
about how this unified field of consciousness works and here
an old prop for you it's a sponge so what's
cool about a sponge of course as you know and
as you can see here is that it's got all
these tiny little bubbles in it they don't actually look
like complete bubbles because we've actually sliced through them such
that you're actually seeing like half bubbles but inside you
can use your mind's eye to imagine that actually inside
the sponge deep in there where we haven't sliced through
there our entire complete self-contained bubbles and so what this
sponge represents it represents all of reality or all of
existence this is everything that ever existed or ever will
exist right here this is that one unified field of
consciousness that I'm talking about this is everything you've ever
experienced and a lot more because what you are in
this analogy is you are one of these bubbles so
imagine if you could kind of like look through one
of those bubbles what do you see well you only
see the back of the bubble there right like this
and like if you're looking through it you just see
the back of the bubble like this you're looking through
this way and so that's like your whole life you've
lived your whole life as that bubble and here you're
living it right now this very moment that's happening right
now the room that you're sitting in wherever you are
that's you inside of this bubble now what you believe
your whole life is you believe that yes there is
this bubble but you've also believed that there's something beyond
the bubble some objective material external reality beyond the bubble
and you've also believed that this bubble is happening to
some kind of object like to there like a brain
somewhere in the external world back there or there's some
kind of biological creature who is experiencing this bubble but
what you can see from this analogy and why we're
talking about it is that there's no subject there's only
the bubble there's only the object this entire sponge is
just free-floating out in the vacuum of empty space you
might say and now you might wonder well Leo but
who's experiencing who's perceiving this sponge and of course that's
the mindfuck of it is that the answer is nobody
there's nobody to perceive the sponge the sponge just is
that's what we mean by being being is just a
thing that just is without anybody looking at it that
doesn't necessarily change how it looks it just changes what
you understand looking to be and it eliminates you from
the equation it D personalizes everything C now it's still
a bit inaccurate even to say that this sponge is
just floating out in the vacuum of E space because
actually time and space this sponge does not occur within
time and space I mean it does here because we're
limited to that right now but if we're gonna take
this as the analogy for all of reality time and
space is happening inside the sponge the sponge is actually
itself not constrained or limited to time and space nor
is it constrained or limited by physical or logical laws
because all of those physical and logical laws is you
know them that's happening inside of these various bubbles in
fact you could have different bubbles with different logical laws
different time lines different spatial dimensions and so forth you
could have like four dimensional bubbles five dimensional bubbles and
anything else you can imagine this sponge itself is actually
infinite so of course even though here right now I'm
only presenting it to you as a as a three
dimensional object in the analogy and the full analogy that
I'm trying to get across to you imagine that this
sponge it doesn't actually have a shape it extends this
way and this way and this way up and down
and in every direction and of course not just in
three dimensions but an infinite number of dimensions so if
you imagine that of course if you did that now
the sponge becomes infinite and it doesn't even have a
shape anymore you can't think of it as being ground
or square or anything it's just it literally takes up
everything it's total it's infinite that's what infinite means and
you are just one of these tiny little bubbles in
this giant thing and your mom your dad your cat
your dog your boss your brother your sister what are
they they're just other bubbles in this thing but look
look at this are the bubbles actually a thing are
they actually real no they're just negative space what's actually
real you might say is the yellow substance the foam
that's what's real the bubbles are really just sort of
illusions there's no substance to the bubble it's Hollow see
and moreover all of the bubbles are really what are
they are they separate no it's the exact opposite they're
all unified in fact the space of all of these
bubbles is the exact same space it's one space it's
just emptiness it's one emptiness so as I've said before
in my episode about the radical implications of oneness I
said we're all one well this explains why when I
say we're all one I'm not speaking metaphorically or poetically
or I'm not saying some wishy-washy new-agey platitude like oh
yeah we're all one let's love each other no no
what I mean is very literally physically we're all one
in the same way that all of these bubbles in
this sponge are all one and in fact this entire
sponge is just all one but in order to realize
that you need to stop identifying with being one of
these bubbles and you need to realise that you are
the entire thing and not only are you entire the
entire thing but that the entire thing itself is also
infinite and if you grasp that that is enlightenment enlightenment
is going from believing that you're one of these bubbles
to realizing that you're the entire sponge and that the
entire sponge is infinite and that this right here this
yellow sponge this is God this is what God is
this is what God consciousness is is when you realize
that you're this entire thing and that is believe it
or not actually possible to do now of course you
probably won't do it in five minutes you probably won't
have this realization while you're sitting here listening to me
although you could that's sort of the the ideal scenario
but you know it used takes a lot of work
takes a lot of meditation contemplation psychedelics and other things
like that to help you to realize this but but
this is this is what enlightenment is this is what
every mystical teaching and school and religion is pointing to
is it's pointing to this but notice because this thing
you know it's so totally so vast that it's so
epic and mind-blowing that it it's really difficult to explain
it to you and that no analogy or metaphor really
does justice to it so don't take this foam example
too literally because of course there's limitations you know I'm
a limited to 3d space and time and we're limited
to language which is necessarily dualistic but but you can
grasp this in one go you can just use your
consciousness to directly realize that you're not perceiving the sponge
you are the entire sponge and that in fact there
is nobody who will perceive this sponge there is only
the sponge there's only the external world so to speak
there is no internal world but really that's the same
thing as saying that the internal world and the external
world that they merge and collapse into one another which
is what non duality is right it's the collapsing of
all categories and distinctions including the distinction between subject and
object and inner and outer internal and external mind and
bodies this is how we resolve the mind-body problem you
see so we're going from the mind-body dualism of Descartes
and we're unifying it all into one field of consciousness
so let's try to get you to grasp this right
now maybe you can get it maybe you can actually
experience this shift so do the following exercise first of
all ground yourself in actuality as I said in my
what is actuality episode so pull out your hand take
out your hand like this and actually look at your
hand and realize here's the hand and that this this
is actuality everything I've been talking about so far all
that was just ideas fantasies and concepts and imagination ground
yourself by looking at your hand at actuality and notice
what this is this is part of this perceptual bubble
that I've been talking about here it is alright so
I wasn't just talking about airy-fairy stuff I'm just pointing
to something concrete so find that thing that I'm pointing
to this is the visual field find it become conscious
of it right now put your awareness on top of
it right now and now what I want you to
realize try to notice this is that this is not
biology you are not a biological creature this field is
not some part of some biological creature that's coming from
some brain somewhere that's not what this is also notice
that this visual field is not yours you don't own
it it seems as though this field is your life
it actually constitutes your whole life that's what you believe
your whole life but try to unsee that right now
try to look at your hand and look at it
and see it as just an object floating out in
the vacuum of empty space like that meteor or that
asteroid that was floating around ten billion years ago try
to see this hand that same way right now and
try to notice that there's no you here looking at
the hand what there is really it's just a hand
and it's being so deep personalize your experience of the
you D personalize all this try to not see this
as your life or your emotions or your perceptions or
your sensations but that this is the external world right
here there's no external world somewhere else the external world
is not hidden from you it's totally laid bare before
your eyes this is how the external world looks or
rather not looks but is this is not you as
a creature experiencing the external world no no no this
is the raw unmediated external world you have full access
to reality right now this visual field that you have
always thought is your biological part your biological creatures stuff
this is not that this is the raw fabric of
the universe try to see it that this literally is
the universe and here it is it's existing that means
the universe has colors and shapes and smells and sounds
and emotions and feelings and thoughts and ideas and it
can think and it can understand that's not biology that's
the raw physical universe it can do that now of
course you're wondering now believe how is it possible that
the fabric of the universe itself has all these things
when these are all subjective qualities well that's the mind
[ __ ] you have to recontextualize that and realize
that it's possible because here it is it's always been
possible the only problem is that you have misinterpreted at
your whole life and you've always just assumed that these
are all subjective properties stuff that happens to biological organisms
inside of brains just stop assuming that you see that
was a groundless assumption that was a bad assumption rather
what the raw universe is is that it just is
this and it's not happening to you it's happening to
itself it's happening without you it's always been happening without
you the only time that you think it's happening to
you is when you think it's happening to you you
see you have to think that it's happening to me
for it to actually appear as though it's happening to
you when you're not thinking about it it's not happening
to you it's just there for itself so try to
get that right now if you can if you succeed
at this what you're doing is you're stripping the you
or the ego or the self away from this experience
here this changes the experience to not being an experience
anymore but to just being absolute being absolute being or
truth with a capital T so what is true the
capital T it's this stripped of the you don't expect
it to look different don't expect the colors to change
don't expect the sounds and sights to change don't expect
unicorns and angels and harps playing and the light of
God shining down upon don't expect that stuff none of
that stuff will happen what will just happen is that
you will realize that there never was a you here
and that what this is is just absolute pure truth
pure being can you get that I mean don't beat
yourself up if you can't this is this is very
deep stuff this takes a lot of focus and attention
and contemplation to get this is not something you get
in five minutes which is not to say you should
limit yourself you certainly could get it in five minutes
if your mind was very open you might get a
glimpse of it right now some of you will post
me a comment down below if you do but many
of you won't many of you won't won't be able
to break through and that's okay it's just you're gonna
have to work through it you know you can you
can pause you can rewind you could try this exercise
a hundred times and you probably will need to and
then one day you will break through and realize what
I'm talking about and what's being pointed to so this
is why it's so difficult to realize God or to
realize the absolute is Heisley because it's not different than
what you've always been experiencing it's just a reinterpretation a
very very radical reinterpretation or recontextualization of what you've always
been experiencing and this is why they say that enlightenment
is already here this is why they say that you're
already enlightened this is why they say that there's nothing
you can do to become enlightened because you're I mean
they're right in a sense because this I mean there's
only one thing happening here the problem is that you're
misinterpreting it so what needs to change is your misinterpretation
you're sort of in this spell or in this illusion
and you need to break out of the solution and
that's what we say waking up is that's what we
mean by waking up is you wake up to the
thing that was always here but you just somehow misinterpreted
and why did you misinterpret it because of your drive
to survive your drive to live and your fear of
death because you want you to survive that's your number
one priority in life is to be you so the
reason that God is so difficult to realize the reason
enlightenment is so rare is because you don't want to
surrender the you so it's not merely that you have
to understand what I'm talking about here and be able
to to grok it before you can accomplish the grokking
part you first need to surrender a lot of your
psychological fears because if you're doing this process correctly you're
going to start to feel your heart pound you might
start to experience a panic attack you might get depressed
you might have some fit of anger you might have
some kind of egoic knee-jerk reaction that's right because your
mind doesn't play fair because it wants you to survive
and survival is not about fairness and it's not about
truth it's about lies and deception so your mind is
going to be working overtime right now to maintain the
deception that you have under your entire life because your
entire life hinges upon it and if you were to
realize what I'm saying here that would be the end
of you you'd be dead but of course death here
doesn't mean what you think it means death doesn't mean
the cessation of perceptions and colors and stuff it just
means the elimination of the idea of you which is
what you have always been from the very beginning is
just an idea there's never gonna be a physical death
of you because that assumes that you were a physical
object but that was a false assumption so there could
be no physical deaths the only thing that can be
is a conceptual death what you think of as physical
death is actually conceptual death and of course they know
Leo that that can't be right there actually is physical
death what is that but another concept see the mind
traps itself with concepts mistaking these concepts for physical reality
and that's why people are so touchy when we come
and question their metaphysical beliefs or their religious beliefs or
their scientific materialistic beliefs why is that because if we
question it too much it literally starts to pull apart
their entire reality and what they fear is not that
reality will will fall apart although that is a that
is a certain fear that you can encounter that's what
I would call the fear of insanity because when your
reality starts to fly apart you actually feel like you're
going insane and it feels very scary but before you
even get to that fear there's gonna be a more
urgent and immediate fear which is going to be a
fear of death and that's right that's right when you
question reality deeply enough you experience your own death and
then what remains is just this sponge floating out an
empty space without you anymore you have realized that you're
not one of these bubbles so really your whole game
in life is trying to maintain the sense that you're
one of these bubbles and as soon as you get
anywhere close to realizing that you're not one of these
bubbles your ego goes crazy hyper reactive and emotional in
order to distract you away from the truth and to
drive you deeper into falsehood and that's usually what most
of your emotions do most of the negative emotions is
they drive you deeper into the illusion that you're one
of these bubbles pretty deep huh yeah pretty deep I
mean we're we're we're explaining the mechanics of the entire
game of life here I mean we're or we're revealing
the full monty we're spoiling it all for you here
once you understand this and you get this at a
cellular level your life will never be the same again
this transforms your entire relationships to life and to human
beings and living creatures and non living creatures and everything
else now you might still wonder Willie oh so it
seems like you're saying that the universe is like self-aware
is that what you're saying because if there's nobody to
perceive this sponge then how is it possible that it's
being perceived like by who by nobody that means like
it's perceiving itself it's self-aware but awareness is something that
only living creatures can do the universe can't be self-aware
that's impossible no it turns out that it actually is
possible you merely assumed that awareness is something that living
creatures do when in fact there's no such thing as
a living creature your mistake was coming up with this
imaginary idea of a sentient living creature there are no
such things that's a fiction there are no such things
so never were such things and you are not such
a thing so then you want to believe it but
how how is it possible that there can just be
awareness without a living creature well I can throw the
question back to you how is it possible there can
be an awareness with living creatures I mean no matter
how you try to explain it or how you slice
it awareness is a very mysterious and weird thing and
that's precisely what science can't explain science and philosophers have
been trying to explain what awareness is for thousands of
years and have been very unsuccessful at it especially in
the Western intellectual tradition and that's because awareness is not
a thing and it can't be explained and it's irreducibly
mystical and mysterious you will never explain it because it's
the most fundamental thing you can't get more fundamental than
awareness awareness is not a property of biological creatures it's
not like rocks are not aware but then one day
when matter evolves into microbes and complicated creatures than like
fish and lizards are crawling over on land and then
you have rats and mice and stuff like this and
mammals that finally one of those like the lizard becomes
aware no no no no no no no that's not
how it works awareness isn't actually a thing technically speaking
awareness doesn't even exist awareness just is pure nothingness it's
a pure void or vacuum awareness is simply that in
which the sponge is suspended it's not a thing nobody
has awareness no brain produces awareness awareness is just nothingness
and so to even think that there is such a
thing as awareness he's already a mistake because usually when
we think of awareness we think of like some sort
of field and it's kind of mystical and weird and
all this no awareness is not really that it's just
nothing so imagine that there is some alternate universe in
which awareness doesn't exist in this universe there are no
living sentient creatures in this universe there are no internal
worlds there are no perceptions no feelings nothing all there
is in this universe are like facts you might think
of like objects like a ball floating out in the
middle of this universe or a sponge floating out in
the middle universe or an asteroid or something like that
but there's nobody to perceive these things so the collection
of everything in that universe this alternate universe the collection
of all the facts of that universe is what we
call the truth the ultimate absolute truth of the capital
T and there's nobody perceiving it or looking at it
but it's the truth because it just is it's being
that asteroid that ball that that sponge that's just floating
out there it's just there you might think of it
as just like a database with a bunch of entries
and and you might think well that's kind of a
boring universe nothing exciting can happen there you can't have
love you can't have emotions or thoughts you can't have
knowledge you can't have anything interesting you can't have living
creatures so it's kind of this dead stale universe well
what I'm describing this alternate universe is our present universe
that's exactly what's happening right now try to get this
try to get it right now our entire universe consists
of only one thing the raw truth the raw facts
the raw data and that's what this is all these
colors and shapes sounds and everything else is just pure
raw data happening to absolutely nobody perceived by nobody with
no awareness that's truth but then you're gonna wonder believe
yo but if but if that's possible then how come
I'm perceiving it here that's your mistake is you think
you're perceiving it but you might want to believe oh
how come the truth knows itself how can the truth
just be how come it looks as though it's being
aware that's what truth is truth just is it's pure
isness it's got nowhere else to go because it's the
only thing that there is it can't go anywhere so
here it is and by virtue of this it's self
apparent or you might say self aware but you can
see now where we're getting into sort of paradoxical territory
language is starting to break down as I'm talking about
this that's precisely because non duality cannot be talked about
with language and it can about cannot be put into
analogies and metaphors and concepts so you know I'm trying
I'm doing the best that we can with with language
and with with the limits of of sponges and stuff
but you need to go beyond all of that to
actually grasp what's being pointed out here I'm not talking
about beliefs I'm not talking about ideas I'm not talking
about philosophy and I'm talking about concepts look look at
actuality look at your hand look at what's happening around
you this is what I'm talking about pure truth that's
the only thing that's ever been here is pure truth
now there's one final and ultimate objection that people have
on this topic which is will Leo how do you
explain that the brain effects perceptions so for example if
if my brain is damaged then maybe might like my
visual cortex let's say is damaged then I won't be
able to see colors properly maybe I'll lose color vision
I'll start to see in black and white like a
dog so how do you explain that leo well firstly
you have to understand that the brain is itself a
perception that's super important to understand the mistake that neuroscientists
and various philosophers in the West's materialists have always made
is that they have assumed that the brain is something
other than a perception something more fundamental something more prior
to perceptions that is not the case what we're doing
here is we're putting the brain on the same level
we're bringing the brain up to the same level as
all of the perceptions that we attribute to the brain
such that the brain itself is just one of the
perceptions so when you do that the brain ceases to
be or to have that same kind of explanatory causal
power that it used to have you can no longer
use the concept of a brain to metaphysically ground the
rest of reality and perception but it's still nevertheless true
that the brain although it is a perception it's a
rather special perception it's a perception that tends to have
a global effect on all other perceptions if it's tweaked
and changed in a certain way so for example you
can take a drug or a pill or psychedelic and
that will change all of your perceptions now of course
the psychedelic or the pill is itself a perception so
look what's happening we're taking a pill which is a
perception we're sticky inside our mouth which is a perception
then it's going through our blood blood is a perception
then those chemicals are going inside our brain chemicals is
a perception brain is a perception so what we have
here is how the entire universe works is it's a
field of perceptions interacting with themselves in various ways sometimes
perceptions can have local effects sometimes an interaction between two
perceptions can have sort of a global effect which is
what would happen if your brain was damaged let's say
and of course how do you damage the brain you
take a perception like a hammer and you hit the
back of the skull which is also perception and so
you know perception affects perception affects the perception of course
I'm using the word perception here but there really is
no perception we're really talking about being so we have
being which is interacting with other being being effects being
effects being effects being so it's really no different than
the way that you think of how molecules interact how
is it possible that one molecule can hit another ball
he'll bounce off of it and cause some kind of
effect well it's no different with perceptions this one unified
field of consciousness is self interactive it's it's not static
like this sponge it's constantly morphing and changing and twisting
and all sorts of super super complicated stuff is happening
inside of it all the time these bubbles they're not
static they're popping in and out of existence that's what
you would think of as your physical birth and death
these bubbles so it's just like this bubbling boiling roiling
soup of stuff is just constantly happening but from the
vantage point of one of those bubbles you know it
seems like 80 years and it seems like this long
life that you have with all these experiences and emotions
and stuff but that's just like one little blip on
the radar screen of this entire infinite thing that's happening
you know and it's gonna happen forever it's never gonna
get created or destroyed it's just it's constantly bubbling away
like a lava lamp and it'll bubble away or forever
forever for infinity and it can do all sorts of
very complicated things it can create emotions it can think
it can feel it can it can make love it
can trick itself into thinking that it that it's seeing
things it can it can trick itself into thinking that
it's a self and that has a life and all
of this and that's what it is this is God
this is everything this is the ultimate self this is
the Buddha this is Christ consciousness this is everything so
in conclusion what is perception really perception is actually being
or absolute truth when properly interpreted but most people on
earth misinterpret this because they have a sense of self
and so their sense of self co-opts absolute being and
mistakes it for the self makes a mistakes it for
my perceptions and mistakes itself as being a sentient creature
but these sentient creatures aren't really real they're just illusions
like negative sculptures in this one Unified Field now of
course the final objection that people have when I talk
about this is but Leo how do you know all
this how is this possible how is it possible to
know any of this it seems like science fiction it
seems like a bunch of stuff that you just sat
down one day and pulled out of your ass just
stuff that you believe well it's not that it's possible
for you to realize this you can realize it because
it's right here here it is it's right here right
before your eyes all you got to do is properly
interpret what's right here which mostly means shutting down your
mind becoming very very focused on the present moment and
just sitting there in meditation with a very quiet and
focused one point in mind and doing that hour after
hour day after day week after week for months and
for years until finally it clicks you can't make it
click it will click on its own but what you
can do to sort of make it click is put
in the work of sitting there quieting your mind and
meditating contemplating or there are various other techniques doing yoga
or that shamanic breathing technique that could help or psychedelics
that's very very powerful and would really help you to
understand this you know if you really want to get
a lot of this episode try watching it or listening
to it not during your trip but right before your
trip and then contemplate about this maybe do some of
these exercises that I showed you in the middle of
your trip and then you'll get it and then you'll
see just how profound this all is so there you
go we've explained perception and we've resolved the many thousands
years old mind-body problem it's done it's simple the solution
is very simple I'm not the first person to have
discovered it for sure so I don't take any special
credit here I'm just explaining in a way that I
think would be would resonate with people in 21st century
that's all I'm doing that's all actualize that org is
is it's me basically taking timeless truths that have been
known for over 5,000 years by mankind pretty much everything
I've talked about has been known by mankind for centuries
and I'm just popularizing it I'm just communicating it in
a way that works with youngsters on YouTube and which
is kind of hip and modern and which integrates a
lot of stuff together and just which isn't talked about
in mainstream culture very much that's it and if you
were lucky enough to stumble upon this then here you
are and that's why you know about it whereas 99%
of people I'm not going to watch my stuff they're
never gonna sit through a hour-long two-hour long video week
after week or to seriously do the practices to realize
this stuff that's it that's it what makes this stuff
so challenging is that it takes a lot of work
it takes a lot of work and it's emotionally difficult
you are intimately involved with this inquiry it's not only
you can just sit on a couch and navel gaze
and just philosophize idly no like when you're doing this
right what's gonna happen is you're gonna realize that your
entire emotional system all of your deepest fears and and
problems and all of your anger and anxiety all of
that is deeply connected all your inadequacies as a human
being all of the challenges and problems you have in
your life all the suffering all of that is deeply
connected to this entire inquiry which is why isn't quiet
this inquiry is so life-changing because if you go through
this whole process it will transform your entire life every
corner of it will get transformed because what we're talking
about here is transforming your entire perceptual system literally the
doors of your perception will be cleansed and what you
will be left with as William Blake said so eloquently
is the infinite you will realize that you are the
entire universe the entire universe is this thing that's here
right now this is it you're the whole shebang you're
not just some little object in the universe you are
the whole universe but to realize that will be an
ordeal for you you see because even though it might
sound like a kind of a pretty and a nice
truth it is it's very pretty it's it's it's hauntingly
beautiful and it's it's profound beyond description and it produces
feelings and emotions of joy and bliss that you can't
even imagine your wildest imagination joy and bliss beyond that
of a heroine hi but to get there you must
go through all of your fears through all of your
neuroses through all of your hangups through all of your
ego quarks you must surrender your arrogance you must surrender
your judgment you must surrender your demonization of others you
must open your mind very very radically and you must
ultimately lay down your entire life as a self as
an ego to eventually break through and have this awakening
and then you will have your bliss so the end
results of cleansing the doors of your perception is the
most amazing joy that you could ever imagine but the
process of cleansing the doors of your perception is some
of the greatest hell and struggle that you could possibly
imagine so that's why so few people do it and
what I encourage for you is that you make a
commitment in your life to do it you will never
regret doing it and you will never know what you
missed unless you do it and what you will miss
will be the greatest thing ever so great that it's
impossible to put into words and that's what motivates me
to talk about these topics in such length and depth
is because it just gives me joy to know that
one or two people will get it out of the
thousands and millions that watch one or two will get
it and they will have that kind of profound joy
that metaphysical joy of discovering their full infinite nature having
cleansed the doors of their perception that's it I'm done
here please remember to click that like button and come
check out actualize that org we've got a blog you've
got a forum we've got resources like book lists and
life purpose courses and other courses that I'll be releasing
in the future and some other ideas that I have
planned coming up soon so keep abreast of all of
that if you have questions come interact on our forum
and just ask there we have some people that can
help you figure stuff out and the last thing that
I'll say here is what actualized org is is I'm
trying to create a comprehensive catalogue of the deepest explanations
of life that I wish existed when I was young
when I was a teenager when I was in my
early 20s because I had all these deep profound questions
about life like what is perception what is consciousness what
is awareness does God exist why is there something rather
than nothing where did the universe come from what does
all this stuff what is happiness how do I become
happy why do I suffer how can I eliminate my
suffering how can I be a good human being and
so forth and so forth so all these questions I
add I was just passionate about figuring them out and
so I spent decades trying to figure all this stuff
out and the more I researched it and the more
I figured out the more amazed I was at why
this stuff wasn't talked about everywhere because this is the
most amazing stuff this is what life is about he's
figuring this stuff out and then crafting a life around
this around these answers and so it was always just
mind-blowing to me that that there weren't videos about this
why why aren't there why am i one of the
first people releasing videos like this like it just it
honestly it still baffles me but of course you know
I also understand why why it's not done it's you
know these are challenging ideas they're challenging to communicate they're
challenging the study they require radical open mindedness to understand
they require enormous work to actualize to glue evenly let
alone to master all these ideas so there's there's just
so much here you know there's so much that goes
into creating a great life to being a great human
being because as it turns out you're not just trying
to be how a great human being you're realizing that
you are the entire universe see and that's that's a
big project to go from being a tiny little human
being what you thought you were when you were born
to realizing that you're this infinite universe god thing you
know that's that's like night and day you're basically going
from 0 to infinity that's a hell of a ride
a hell of a gear shift to go through and
that's not easy to do you have to go through
so many challenges but what I'm trying to do is
I'm trying to create this catalog so I'm trying to
create these various episodes that address very fundamental questions like
what is consciousness what is intelligence what is God what
is enlightenment what is in this case perception and so
forth and so forth so in the future you'll see
more of these sorts of what is episodes that tackle
very fundamental metaphysical questions but there will also be a
lot of practical stuff that I'll release in the future
as well so I'm kind of going through this phase
where I'm addressing a lot of this kind of metaphysical
stuff you might think it's not too practical for you
because you're chasing success okay that's fine I understand that
but uh but bear with me you know I'm I'm
gonna release these then we're gonna go back into practical
psychological type stuff I'm gonna help you to figure how
to be more confident how to have higher self-esteem how
to attract friends into your life how to be more
social how to be more confident how to be more
charismatic so all that stuff we'll get to it you
know we'll get to it one of the things that
I'm most passionate about though is the very metaphysical stuff
because like this is the stuff that that has sort
of motivated my entire journey and so without these questions
really there wouldn't be an actualized org so that's why
I cover some of these sorts of very nerdy you
might think kind of esoteric philosophical type topics and also
because there's a deep lack of videos talking about this
stuff at the level of depth that I think is
required to really understand this stuff there's just a lack
of this information you know maybe in two hundred years
that problem will be solved but right now I feel
like it's sort of my duty to to solve this
problem that's sort of my purpose here is to be
a solution to this lack that exists in society and
so you know over the years that's sort of what
I'm angling at is creating this catalog we're gonna have
hundreds of these videos that explain all of these topics
and then my hope is is that that transforms someone's
life somebody like you so stick around and maybe that'll
happen you
