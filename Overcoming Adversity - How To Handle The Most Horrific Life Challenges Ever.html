hey this is the leo 4 actualized org and I
have a question for you have you ever doubted yourself
doubted whether you could handle the kind of tough situation
that came up for you in life so maybe life
threw you a curveball maybe you're in this position right
now where you're just dealing with something whether it's a
relationship or some trouble at work just something that is
exceptionally hard and you feel like you don't know if
you can do it you don't know if you can
handle it why is it so hard why is life
unfair what's going to happen if you fail how are
you going to get through this maybe there's a money
problem you don't know how you're going to get those
bills paid and you don't know what kind of catastrophe
will happen if you don't maybe there's a relationship and
it's going to break up and you don't know how
to salvage it or what you can do and it
seems like it's a lost cause well I think we've
all been there I've certainly had many moments like that
in my life and one of the things that I've
been doing lately as a practice to build myself up
against these kind of situations I've been doing affirmations and
specifically the affirmation that I've been doing is one that
goes like this try it on for size and see
how you like it and the affirmation is I can
handle any challenge any situation that life throws at me
so that's my affirmation I can handle any challenge any
situation that life throws at me now why did I
pick this affirmation and what's the importance of it so
the reason I brought this up is because I've been
doing also not just affirmations but I've also been doing
a contemplation exercise where I've been thinking about this so
by affirmation I mean that this is something that I
say to myself for at least five minutes every every
day so I'll find five minutes in the day either
in the morning in the evening to just sit down
and affirm to myself consistently this one message just repeated
like a mantra so it'll just go like this I
can handle any situation any challenge that life throws at
me I can handle any situation any challenge that life
throws at me I can handle any situation any challenge
that life throws at me and I'll just do that
for five minutes straight if you do in five minutes
your mind eventually really buys in and gets on board
with this and especially if you do it consistently every
single day and if you do this and you actually
start thinking about what this affirmation really means you'll get
this kind of insight that I got and to me
what's amazing when you drill your mind like this using
these kind of exercises is some of the profound insights
that you get and I've been doing it just tonight
and I was thinking about what this really means and
how powerful and amazing this is that no matter what
challenge I'm faced with it really is true that I
can handle it I can handle it and why is
this true well there's a couple of angles that we
can go at this from which I'm going to cover
so firstly if you just look at your own life
and you look at your own history up from birth
until today and you take a look at all the
tough times you've had all the really big struggles all
those moments where you felt like it was a life
or death situation where it was do or die and
maybe it literally was that dramatic for you maybe it
literally was life and death situation or maybe it was
just something that you felt was a life and death
situation at the time but then you realize that it
wasn't that important after all but just think about all
those moments maybe pick one or two that were like
your most difficult moments in life and if you think
about that and you think about where you are today
and where those moments were and how they shaped you
what you eventually realize if you're honest with yourself is
that those moments first of all they got you a
lot of emotional growth they got you a lot of
maybe even success as a result of that growth that's
the success you have right now but also you just
see that you were able to handle it sure it
might have been tough it might have been very emotionally
trying and taxing but in the end that statement that
whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger there's a lot
of truth in that and that's what tends to happen
is that you experience these traumatic events but in the
end you're able to handle them and it's not even
because you are so great it's just because you are
a living organism and it's in your genes to be
a survivor so you're a survivor no matter what situation
you're faced the most drastic dramatic horrible situation you can
put yourself in you could handle that your body and
your psychology is designed to cope with it that's actually
a really a thought that we don't usually have and
when I think about that and I really meditate on
it and I do this affirmation then it really grounds
me makes me very confident in my ability to go
forward and I suddenly see that those challenges that I
have before me are not really as big as I
thought they were they aren't as important as I thought
they were they aren't as catastrophic catastrophic even very serious
challenges I'm talking about the death of people you like
I'm talking about even your own death you're able to
deal with that you're biologically just wired to deal with
it you can deal with it you can deal with
anything you don't even really have a choice in the
matter you're just going to survive through it you're going
to survive through it you're going to come out the
other end or maybe you even don't come out the
other end but you still handle it what I mean
by handle is not that you're going to go through
and never give up it's not that you're not going
to have any emotional labor or pain to the situation
it doesn't mean you're always going to succeed definitely not
the case there were many times in my life where
I've tried things and worked really hard towards them but
then still quote unquote failed because I didn't get the
result that the external result that I was ultimately after
right and in that situation you could say that I
I failed in some sense I didn't rise to the
challenge or maybe there have been times in your life
when you haven't risen to the challenge maybe it was
in college maybe was it your job maybe the presentation
you're supposed to give maybe in a relationship and you
really bungled it you really screwed it up and I'm
not saying that you won't have those kinds of moments
you will but notice that even in those cases first
of all a lot of those situations even though you
totally screwed it up does it really matter now where
you are right now did it really make that big
of a difference I think in 95% of cases it
really has no long-term effect no long-term effect of course
there are those cases that are extremely traumatic like extremely
vivid events traumatic experience in your life that could have
a very lasting repercussion on on your psychology on your
psyche and on your reality and on your model of
how the world works so there's certainly those as well
and we've got all got a couple of those in
our closets but even with those think about it you
survived through that you made it through and right now
in the moment that you're sitting in here things aren't
so bad you're pretty comfortable the present moment is all
right nothing too terrible is going on right now right
and that's kind of how it is is that you
are a survivor in that even the worst times even
those things that you think are just going to be
horrible you can still survive there's a deeper perspective on
this which I was just contemplating this evening and that
is that if you really think about human history and
you think about where we came from where are we
evolved from then you get a deeper appreciation of our
our natural ability to survive and what I mean by
that is think about where human society was where Humanity
was a hundred thousand years ago so a hundred thousand
years ago as far as we can tell we were
living in hunter-gatherer tribes and in those societies these were
small little cliques of humans maybe fifty to a tribe
a hundred to a tribe 150 to a tribe and
they lived together and they fought with each other and
they had no permanent shelter they had no heating or
electricity they had no internet or computers or cell phones
they had no access to supermarkets that would provide them
with reliable sources of food they had no income there
was no money transactions had to be had to be
based on bartering system and think about the dangers involved
with barter with someone from a neighboring tribe that you
might not really know think about the the rape and
pillage that went on in in those in that kind
of environment when you had two tribes that clashed with
each other think about the social hierarchies and people vying
for power and dominating each other think about the struggle
for food when you couldn't find a herd of deer
to daunt or when there was a drought and you
couldn't plant anything think about how challenging that was think
about not having clothing think about running around naked in
the cold and the heat think about not even knowing
which which pool of water you can drink from because
some of the water could be contaminated think about all
the diseases you could get that there were no cures
for think about not even understanding what the hell is
going on in life think about not even understanding how
long you're going to live not understanding basic medicine not
understanding biology not understanding any kind of philosophical concepts that
we have now about human development not understanding anything about
psychology being totally immersed in in mythology and superstition just
think about that think about if you were living in
that kind of environment well that's what your biology and
your psychology is actually designed to handle because we haven't
evolved too much genetically from from that phase that we
were at about a hundred thousand years ago and so
when you think about that it's kind of sobering because
it's like damn those people could really survive they could
really tough it out and in some sense that really
puts our problems into perspective I think it's really important
to put your problems into perspective once in a while
because sometimes you might be so immersed in getting your
business up and running or you might be so immersed
in in a relationship problem that you have or you
might be so immersed because your children aren't behaving the
way you want them to or because some piece of
technology is not doing what you wanted to or maybe
you get held up at the airport on a layover
and the weather is bad or maybe you're having car
trouble and you make it to work an hour late
and you get so caught up in those problems but
think about it think about the real problems those those
aren't real problems think about the real problems that people
face the life-and-death problems that people faced 100,000 years ago
every single day and how challenging that must have been
so the point here is that you are actually much
more resilient than you give yourself credit for and I
think that this is a concept that I'm borrowing for
Don Miguel Ruiz from his nice little book The Four
Agreements he said he really makes the case so that
again you the book that man is a domesticated animal
and that we have domesticated ourselves and that's exactly what
has happened is not only did we domesticate the dog
the wolf turned it into a dog and we domesticated
feral cats and turned them into little kitty cats and
we domesticated bison and turn them into cattle basically and
we domesticated all these animals but the greatest thing we
did is we domesticated ourselves fact is now we live
in cages these are homes we're very immersed in all
the technology we've got around us we're very reliant on
it it's making a lives very nice and comfortable and
easy but it all is also kind of making us
lose touch with that resilience that we have that natural
resilience and the fact is that you have that resilience
right now so even though you are domesticated and I
am domesticated we're all we can't really help being domesticated
in this society that we grow up in but just
realize that you've got a lot of resilience which means
that you can handle any challenge in any situation that's
thrown at you this is not just some wishful thinking
this is actually a matter of fact this is a
matter of your psychology this is a matter of your
biology there's no situation that you can't handle you might
have an emotional breakdown but you're still going to go
through nothing really that bad is going to happen and
I'm talking about real horrible situations I'm talking about like
someone goes and kidnaps you and tortures you for a
month like you'll be able to survive that it's kind
of a sobering thought or if you get afternoon to
the military and you have to go and you have
to fight you have to kill other people you'll survive
that you get wounded you might get a leg amputated
you might get paralyzed you might get diagnosed with cancer
you might lose your life savings in a in the
stock market or in a Ponzi scheme someone might scan
you and rip you off your spouse might totally desert
you might cheat on you you can survive all that
you're designed to survive all that in fact you have
no other option really you have no other option it's
either you're going to die or you're going to survive
and that's really the only choice that's it you're designed
to handle any situation any challenge that comes up in
life and these I'm talking about like grave grave grave
challenges most of us are not facing these kind of
challenges our lives most of us behave as though we
are oh sure our mind likes to catastrophize that meeting
at work that presentation that we've got or some little
fit that we have with our girl or boyfriend we
tend to say that oh this is the end of
the world we're going to break up or they're going
to fire me I'm going to lose my money something's
going to go wrong and we were catastrophizing but this
is our mind really playing tricks on us because it
did evolve our mind our mind it evolved to handle
serious survival challenges which we really rarely face nowadays it's
rare that you're facing a life-or-death challenge for real in
most cases is your mind playing tricks on you and
projecting and catastrophizing everything into a life in that situation
and we got to get a lot better with ourselves
at telling ourselves when a life in that situation is
really a life in that situation and when it's not
and so I really want to get you a little
bit more aware about the fact that you can handle
any challenge because sometimes it does feel like you can't
so I'm not saying that it doesn't feel that way
at times and I've I've had this I've had this
just recently I've had real challenges where I feel like
this is not something I can do this business is
not something I can lift off the ground you know
I can't really handle if I lose my savings really
handle this I can't handle that what if this happens
just like catastrophes and it feels sometimes when you're in
that pit of despair and you're really at the bottom
you really feel like you're at the bottom and you
feel like you're so down that you can't make it
through and that's exactly why I had this affirmation for
myself and I'm drilling it to my mom my into
my mind and I've committed to drilling it into my
mind for the next 60 days because I literally want
to reprogram my subconscious so that I totally believe with
every fiber of my being I believe that I can
handle any situation that comes to me in the future
because I've gone through those downs and I don't really
want to go through those Downs anymore and I felt
like creating this affirmation was a good way to stem
that off in the future because I know I'm going
to have those challenging moments but I want to also
be able to get back in touch with myself when
I'm starting to go into that dip I want to
be able to tell myself and I want to have
my subconscious mind be imprinted with the belief that I
can handle any challenge I can handle any situation and
that it's never as bad as it seems even the
worst things are never as bad as they seem and
I want you to take that to heart so if
you're going through a really tough time right now that's
just the fact you're going through it but number one
you're going to learn some good lessons from that and
you're going to actually get a lot of success in
your life from those situations so that is the silver
lining and it's not a wishy washy New Age thinking
type of lining it's a real silver lining that's a
fact is that you grow with those experiences but then
just realize that you are designed to survive and that
your ancestors have survived through situations that were much much
worse in fact you yourself have survived through situations that
were probably much much worse than the one that you're
worrying about right now and you do not want to
sell yourself short realize that your your resiliency is nearly
infinite no matter how much pain you experience you Raziel
nc is nearly infinite and it's amazing and one book
that I recommend reading on this to get your mind
around this idea to really buy into it is read
Victor Frankel's man's search for meaning Victor Frankl was a
Holocaust survivor and he talks about in very vivid detail
about his experiences in concentration camps in Germany through the
the middle and the end of World War two and
he really talks about in graphic detail about the horrors
of the concentration camp and the stuff that was going
on there was so horrific and yet the people that
were there they were able to deal with it they
were able to cope with it somehow and he talks
about how he was able to cope with it and
he was actually a psychologist and he started he created
a whole philosophy and a whole model based on his
experiences there and these concentration camps and so really read
that book and just take a look because what it'll
do when you're reading some of those incidents it's like
you're say you said damn like how can that how
can that possibly be how could you possibly survive that
I couldn't survive that that's what you start to think
but then you realize you know what it's not that
Viktor Frankl was really special and it's not like any
of his friends or any of any of his cellmates
in the concentration camp like there were any any different
they were there were all basically human beings the fact
is that even though we can experience a lot of
pain and sometimes you can't you can't avoid that pain
we can all survive it we can all live through
it and come out better on the other end and
you can even survive very horrific things like torture and
starvation and humiliation and rape and death all of these
things are not nearly as bad as we make them
out to be and our ability to live through them
and to survive them is there in every one and
it doesn't take a special character it's there whether you
want it or not because you are a survival machine
you have gone through millennia and hundreds of generations of
survival of the fittest and you are the fittest of
the current generation you are the fittest of all our
ancestors and so you couldn't get here you couldn't be
here if you couldn't survive that challenge that you're facing
in your life right now all right this is Leo
signing off I hope you got a little bit of
encouragement from this if you're going through a tough time
go ahead and I encourage you to actually practice this
affirmation I can handle any challenge any situation that life
throws at me practice it consistently and grain it into
your subconscious mind and you'll find yourself empowered and you'll
find those dips much lower than they have to be
all right I'm signing off go ahead leave me your
