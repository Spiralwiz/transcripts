hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to be talking about understanding happiness and
I'm going to share with you my happiness spectrum happiness
is a topic that we need a better and deeper
understanding of as we're going through the self-actualization process and
as we're doing personal development we need to know better
what kinds of happiness are good for us and then
what kinds are bad for us and so in this
video what are we talking about is I'm making a
distinction between two fundamental types of happiness this distinction will
help you in your personal development journey to go through
and identify which happiness is the one that's the most
right for you and then also I'm going to share
with you my happiness spectrum which is this large list
that I created which takes you through all the fundamental
categories of happiness that you can have in your life
and then we kind of rank them and we're going
to show you which ones are the lowest quality happiness's
and which ones are the highest quality happiness's and I'm
going to tell you the most high quality happiness the
number one activity that you can do to attain the
highest quality happiness so stick with me the basic distinction
that we need to make here is between what's called
pleasure on the one hand and then gratification on the
other pleasure versus gratification and now if we go back
2000 years into antiquity and we take a look at
what the Greeks and Romans were talking about when they
were talking about happiness because that was a favorite topic
of theirs Aristotle we could take a look at him
and he makes this distinction as well he calls it
had donek happiness versus eudaimonic happiness so what does this
actually mean hedonic happiness or pleasure this is the most
obvious and typical form of happiness so this is the
stuff that titillates your senses or raises your emotions it's
sort of pleasurable way so drugs food sex excitement of
any kind so basically thrill-seeking this is what we call
hedonism and then this was contrasted with the eudaimonic happiness
and that's what we're calling here gratification gratification versus pleasure
what is eudaimonic happiness this is a little bit more
difficult to capture and it's not immediately obvious why you
would want to pursue eudaimonic happiness but I'll talk about
that and I'll make a case for it as we
go forward so you don't want of happiness this is
all about living a virtuous life the Greeks and Romans
were really big into this thing called verbs you living
a virtuous life and what that really meant for them
is the same thing that's going to mean for us
now which is embodying your greatest strengths living up to
them living a life of integrity and noble purpose and
living with higher consciousness and wisdom that's basically what you
demonic happiness is the Greeks and the Romans they have
this um term called r8a an arte basically translated as
living excellently and that's the same thing as living virtuously
so you see we're kind of contrasting we've got the
pleasures of the body and the senses and the emotions
on one hand and then this kind of wisdom virtuous
noble living on the other hand this is this is
the fundamental distinction were making so now I want you
to already start asking yourself how much of my happiness
currently if I graphed it out if I took all
the stuff that I do in my life and I
graphed it all out in a given week all my
activities how much of them would be about hedonism and
how much of them would be about eudaimonia the degree
to which you've got this ratio is it 50/50 what
is it for you 50/50 is it 90 percent here
and only 10% here or maybe you're doing good and
you've got 90 percent here and only 10% there basically
in all of personal development what you're going to be
doing is you're going to be increasing the ratio of
eudaimonic and decreasing the ratio of hedonic that's what you
should be doing with all your personal development goals and
everything that you trying to achieve and I'll talk more
about that as we go forward so this ratio is
important to ask yourself where you lie and then also
you're gonna start asking yourself how can I move the
ratio more towards the UNAM they've actually done a lot
of research on this now with positive psychology and they're
finding more and more and more that the stuff that
we think will make us happy which is all the
hedonic stuff the hedonic stuff seems like it's going to
make us the most happy because it's the most thrilling
and exciting in the moment it's the most thrilling and
exciting if you don't really think long term too much
so this is stuff like you know awesome food and
taking great vacations and getting a huge bonus at your
job and having a cushy career and having fame and
acclaim and prestige in your career ah sex and any
kind of chemical drugs that you take that make you
happier so all this easy stuff this stuff is easy
the problem is that the you time on extorter and
it's not immediately obvious that it's going to produce the
same levels of satisfaction as this stuff here the hedonic
stuff but actually with all the research that they've done
and I'll talk a little bit about this as we
talk about my spectrum is that the hedonic happiness is
like a hollow shallow happiness you think that it's going
to make you happy and you chase it and you
chase it in your chase and you're probably going to
spend a good ten to twenty years of your life
if not more caught in the trap of chasing hedonic
happiness but we're going to find is after all that
chasing and all that hard work that is going to
make you unfulfilled and unsatisfied on the inside and so
when that starts happening then you start scratching your head
and your start wondering hmm what's going on here why
is my not my life not really improving even though
I'm doing all this stuff in my life and I'm
accomplishing all these big goals well that's what is going
to hit you that you need to turn from the
outside more on the inside and start to live this
more knowable more virtuous type of life and when you
start doing that that's when you're going to start to
the fulfillment come into your life for real rather than
this hollow happiness that you were getting over here it's
an interesting point that you demonic habit is gratification it
cannot be chemically induced and there's really no shortcut for
it and it also takes hard work it doesn't come
naturally and it doesn't come easily to most people if
you just do the average thing that most people do
then what happens is that you always drift towards heavy
hedonism and if you want to move towards eudaimonia then
you have to work a lot and that's where a
personal element comes in it but it's also curious to
me that you can't chemically induce you don't want of
happiness because what is you know monic happiness ultimately it's
this feeling of strength and inner integrity and nobility that
you have well how are you going to buy that
you can't buy that with money and you can't create
a magic pill that will do it for you so
all the shortcuts towards happiness they end up being hedonic
happiness which is why you really can't buy yourself happiness
because I mean you try you go out there and
try to spend your money doing it but you realize
after a while of trying that that you're just kind
of spinning your wheels and you're not getting that more
deeper fulfillment that you can get in life which can
only happen through the hard inner development that you do
to move yourself more towards eudaimonia and that's basically what
the ancient philosophers were about the ancient philosophers weren't just
disputing abstract theoretical ideas about metaphysics and stuff I mean
they were doing that but mostly they were actually interested
in how do you live the highest-quality life and what
they ultimately discovered is that it's through excellence it's through
wisdom it's through embodying a lot of these self-help principles
that you see my videos and basically it is self
actualization it's the process of self actualization they just had
different labels for it so what I want to do
now is I want to get into my spectrum and
I want to tell you a lot of details about
the different types of happiness that we could M that
we can be engaged and how good or bad they
are but before I do that there's three factors that
I want you to look out for when you're thinking
about an activity that provides you with happiness number one
is how long does the happiness last in duration does
it last for five seconds for five minutes for an
hour for a day how long does it last that's
an important consideration as you're strategizing the second important consideration
is what does this cost to produce so how much
does it cost you to create this form of happiness
does it cost you a lot does it cost you
a little and then the third thing is what are
the consequences of engaging in this form of happiness what
does it cost me long-term if I keep doing it
again and again and again and again does it make
my psychology weaker or does it make my psychology stronger
and this turns out to be a really key consideration
so let's talk about the spectrum the spectrum is going
to go from this side here which is going to
be pure hedonic happiness to this extreme side over here
which is going to be pure eudaimonic happiness and it's
going to gradually just kind of move in this direction
and I'm splitting the spectrum up into three chunks the
first third the second third and the last third the
first third is going to be the stuff that you
really want to avoid this is pure hedonic stuff the
stuff in the middle is going to be moderately okay
types of happiness and then the stuff on this last
third is going to be the best so as I'm
telling you this stuff I want you to start thinking
already about how you can be moving away from these
and moving towards these alright so as you can probably
guess what's the most obvious hedonic happiness it's drugs right
so you've got drugs after drugs you've got food partying
and drinking after that you've got beauty now beauty is
an interesting one beauty what what that means is trying
to make yourself physically look better more attractive a lot
of us get hung up on this how we look
and so we try to look better and this is
both for men and for women it's probably worse of
a situation for women because women are judged more on
their appearance but men get caught up with beauty too
so this is worrying about your hair worrying about how
you look worrying about how you dress trying to impress
people with your beauty getting plastic surgery obsessing about makeup
all this kind of stuff you might think that doing
beauty and improving your your appearance is going to make
you a lot happier but actually they've done Studies on
this and what they find is that people who obsess
about beauty are not happy they're more miserable and they've
also done studies and they found that people who are
more physically attractive objectively speaking are no happier than the
average or even below average attractiveness levels of other people
so beauty is really a trap you're not going to
make yourself more fulfilled just by working on your beauty
the next thing is money money is huge and money
becomes a trap for many many many people many intelligent
people get trapped by money many business people many entrepreneurs
many CEOs fall into this money trap chasing money thinking
that money is going to do it for them but
it doesn't do it and in fact they've done research
on this as well and they found that people who
have primarily money based goals in their career and in
their life that these are the most frustrated people they're
not happy even if they achieve their money goals they're
still not happy so hopefully you're wise enough to already
see that money doesn't directly buy you happiness in any
meaningful way because all money can do is it can
buy you more of this hedonic happiness it can buy
you drugs and it can buy you food and drinking
and partying and beauty and some other kind of stuff
that we're going to get into here but all that
stuff is ultimately very shallow and on fulfilling by itself
so money is not going to do it for you
and in addition to money also shopping shopping can be
basically a form of addiction but most of us are
addicted to it but we tend to think that shopping
or buying something whatever it is whether it's a a
new TV a new house a new car or anything
else for your house you know that you however you
want to lavishly set up your your place that somehow
this is going to do it for you or if
you're shopping for for clothing and of course it's very
hollow the I'm not a happiness you get is very
short and it doesn't produce that kind of higher level
of fulfillment that you want in your life the next
thing is media and entertainment so this includes television internet
social media video games all this entertainment now is so
cheap a lot of it is totally free that you
can get with the internet now and the the really
dangerous thing about is that it can consume so much
of your time it can literally consume hundreds if not
thousands of hours of your time every single year and
this what I find is the biggest problem here is
that it creates a opportunity cost which means that if
you're heavily engaged in entertainment like video games and internet
and television then you're missing out on so much more
that you could be doing with your life because you
are wasting that time and then that time is not
available for you to do the more you demonic types
of happiness so here you could potentially make your biggest
gains right here is by limiting some of this stuff
they've done again Studies on this and basically what they
find is that people who watch lots of TV in
fact if you take a person watching TV for prolonged
period of time and you measure his mood what they
discover is that the average mood of someone watching several
hours of television is mild depression not happiness so it
might seem like you're getting lots of pleasure from this
stuff but actually it's kind of like rotting your soul
from the inside out that's the problem the next thing
is gossip and also idle socialization so when you kind
of mindless mindlessly hang out with your friends or if
you have a social circle to gossip about stuff and
talk about politics and all those kind of nonsense it
can seem like that's rewarding but really it's not it's
very hollow the next thing is pursuing Fame public image
and success quote-unquote success so these are like external signs
of accomplishment do you pursue these if you're really busy
chasing Fame and status it's basically equivalent to chasing money
if you've ever gotten any fame or status it's hard
to believe initially before you have it that it wouldn't
make your life better but once you get it you
realize like well people know me now but what does
that really do for me really on the inside it
doesn't do much for you at all it's just exciting
when you get it and then after you get acclimated
to it your fame and your prestige and all this
stuff and all your public image and all your public
status and all your ability to impress people with your
accomplishments that this really doesn't mean much for your internal
levels of fulfillment so this can be a huge trap
and you can waste a lot of time chasing this
stuff the next thing is validation from other people how
much of your time and how many of your goals
are centered around getting people to like you to approve
of you to give you compliments this is a huge
pointless activity to be doing this the next thing is
porn and sex how much time and how many goals
do you have on your to-do list that are about
getting more sex chasing after sex porn you don't need
to chase after it's so easy to get but it
can be also you know a big diversion from the
things that you should be doing in your life and
then the last piece on this first third of the
spectrum is going to be romantic infatuation this is the
first six months or so of a new relationship new
intimate relationship where you are all excited and it feels
great and you're like falling in love that feeling but
really what this is this is a romantic chemical infatuation
and it's not sustainable it always dies off and so
it feels great but then the fulfillment that it brings
you in the long run isn't really high so that's
going to be the first third now if you're engaged
in any of this stuff first of all realize that
anything in this first third can become an addiction you
can develop an addiction to anything here chasing money or
drugs or to food or to validation or to Fame
or sex or even romantic infatuation so watch out with
that because all these things are very addictive also notice
though that all of these things they give you a
big spike in excitement in your life but then that
spike quickly comes down and in fact when it goes
up it always comes down lower and so you kind
of get left with this feeling of emptiness after you
engage in some of these behaviors and activities so you
should start thinking about how you can get the goals
that you have that are centered around all this over
- what we're gonna be talking about next so the
next thing is going to be the middle third you're
going to have hobbies any kind of hobbies that you
have and those are mostly alright no problem they're also
pretty good to have physical exercise and physical growth as
part of your routine so that's a healthy type of
thing don't confuse that deal with beauty because some people
they do physical exercise especially guys the gym I see
them doing this they're into physical exercise and they tell
him they're doing physical exercise but actually what they're doing
is they're obsessing over beauty so don't think that if
you're a guy you're immune to this beauty thing you're
not immune to it at all the next thing is
friendships and strong relationships so you can have shallow friendships
and gossipy type friendships or you can have deeper stronger
more intimate friendships those are the ones you want to
be going after that can be a good source of
fulfilment in your life if you can develop a couple
of really really solid friends and we're not talking about
Facebook friends but like face to face real friends so
family is good relationships that you build with your family
and you strengthen with your family that's going to give
you higher qualities of happiness and lastly in this middle
third is going to be companionate love companionate love is
the love that you have in a relationship after those
first six months pass and some of the chemicals and
excitement wears off and then you develop this kind of
deeper bond and rapport with the other person so that
can be a quite good that's the middle third the
middle third is quite healthy so if you can just
move yourself from the bottom third to the middle third
that already is going to be huge improvement in your
fulfillment levels in life but I think that it's really
the last third which I'm going to talk about right
now that's the most exciting for me this is what
actualize our org is talking about is all the stuff
that you could do with your life if you move
yourself to this third right here and that starts off
with learning and education how much of your time are
you spending on learning and educating yourself especially after you
get a college are you still keeping up with your
education are you not only just educating yourself but you're
actually savoring it and taking pleasure and joy from it
well if you're not you're missing out on some really
good eudaimonic happiness right there then after that comes excellent
work and flow States do you really value your work
do you do your work excellently do you pride yourself
on your work and does your work produce flow for
you flow meaning these periods when you lose self-consciousness and
you're in that zone where everything is flowing and everything
is effortless and you're you're totally engaged and absorbed in
the activity does your work do that for you if
not you need to create that the next thing is
inner development and self-acceptance so by inner development we mean
any kind of personal growth activities that you do whether
it's therapy or coaching or exercises or journaling or meditating
or um seminars and workshops you know there's a million
different ways that you can do personal development and also
any work that you do to accept yourself exactly as
you are not worrying about your beauty and trying to
be different and not worrying about who you should be
as an ideal but instead just accepting yourself exactly as
you are and there's work you can do I have
videos on self-esteem and how to build your confidence so
anything you can do to build your self-esteem and your
confidence levels and just be happy with who you are
right now how you look how much money you have
and what kind of friends you have the more you
can accept all that stuff then the more true fulfillment
you'll have in your life you can't really be fulfilled
in life if you're not accepting of yourself you understand
this you're always going to be frustrated inside no matter
what kind of external circumstances you can create for yourself
next is kindness they've done research on this and they
found that in laboratory one of the greatest chemical pleasures
that you can have is by doing kind things for
other people they've actually done experiments on this and they
found that if they give people money like five or
ten dollars that they could use to spend on themselves
to buy themselves something nice what they found is that
the person is happier if they use that money to
do something kind for somebody else rather than spending that
money on themselves our brain is literally wired for doing
kindness towards others the problem is though that we've never
really most of us haven't figured out how to integrate
this Highness into a consistent systematic way into our own
lives and it's really not a part of our daily
routine is doing kind things and it's also not really
natural to some of our work to be doing kind
things so that's an alignment that you could create for
yourself though to be doing more kind action actions next
is gratitude gratitude is huge they've done lots of research
on this too and they found that basically if you're
not grateful for what you've already got then you're not
going to be satisfied because you tell yourself well I'll
be grateful when I get that cool thing that I
want that money me or that trophy wife or whatever
but if you can't be grateful now then the fact
is that when you do get that thing that you
really want that you think is going to make you
happy when you get that you're not going to be
grateful for that either because your brain will just Ratchet
it up hedonic adaptation will happen and then you're going
to be after chasing the next greatest flashiest thing and
so gratitude will never happen and gratitude doesn't happen then
you're not going to be fulfilled and gratitude is again
one of those things you can practice and you can
develop as a ritual for yourself so this is something
that needs active development next is integrity integrity is really
huge and it goes to the core of what the
Greeks and Romans were after is living a life of
integrity and this is kind of an old-school value my
own durable integrity this is something like maybe my parents
or maybe my grandparents with value yeah and that's for
a good reason because even though integrity is not flashy
it's important you can't really be fulfilled in life if
you're living a life that's disintegrated and by integrity what
we mean is are you living up to your greatest
values are you doing the things that are actually meaningful
to you in life are you honoring commitments to others
and to yourself and of course this means not lying
not cheating not stealing and not harming others but even
more subtly it means how good are you at keeping
your own commitments to yourself do you tell yourself you're
gonna do something then you don't do it you set
a goal for yourself but then you quit if you
keep doing that again and again and again and you
preach at people but then you don't walk your talk
then you're not in integrity and you're going to be
miserable no matter who you are human beings need that
integrity in order to feel fulfilled so working on integrity
is really huge and that's actually something that I identified
with myself just recently is that I can make some
big gains in my fulfillment levels if I just buckle
down and fix a couple areas in my life where
a little bit out of integrity so that's something I
want to be working on in the near future the
next thing on this list is contribution I think contribution
is one of the biggest biggest biggest things that people
I see in American society are just totally missing out
on contribution is what your work does for the betterment
of humanity in the world what kind of impact does
your work have is it contributing in a meaningful way
that you believe is meaningful not other people believe is
meaningful but you you have to believe it this one
I think I'm pretty good on because I've spent the
last few years of my life really working hard to
position myself I - lies out or because this is
my business right and I knew that to be really
fulfilled in life I needed to have this contribution component
so I worked really hard to put it into place
and that means that when I release a new video
I know that it's having the impact that I want
in the world and to me that's a really huge
source of satisfaction but I see that most people don't
have this because they haven't taken the time to make
the alignment and I'm actually right now starting to work
on a life purpose course it's going to be a
video course for you guys if you really care about
contribution and you really want to have a big impact
in the world and you want to have that fulfillment
in your life every single day of knowing that you're
doing great for Humanity or Society in some way some
way that's unique to you not just leave labeling soup
in a soup kitchen somewhere but actually producing great work
and great art that moves people that changes the world
then I'm going to have that ready pretty soon here
and then we got to the last piece on this
spectrum and this is the one activity that is going
to produce the highest source of happiness in your entire
life can you guess what it is it is being
to be simply being existing that's it the best way
to practice this is through meditation now the teachers meditation
teaches you how to be and how to enjoy the
moment of being and now this one's tricky because someone
listening to this might say well being that sounds like
it's kind of boring you're basically saying I should just
sit there and exist and just enjoy life and be
happy and be maximally happy just doing that without anything
else and that's exactly what I'm telling you is yeah
you should be able to do that and that should
be your greatest source of satisfaction in life which means
that you should not need any stimulation of any sort
not even the stimulation of reading a book or the
stimulation of doing personal development or the stimulation of doing
something kind for somebody because all those things are still
fundamentally activities and you're still doing all those things to
get like a kick but if you're just able to
be in the moment just in the moment right now
just focused in the moment totally enjoying yourself that's what
ultimate peace of mind means and all the greatest most
wisest sages throughout the last three thousand years of human
history have recognized this which is why meditation is such
a fundamental aspect of practice for all these sages they
meditate a lot because they know that that's the most
important thing for them to be doing and that's the
greatest source of satisfaction and if you think back into
your past about some of the most satisfying moments in
your life you're going to notice that they were just
moments of being and not necessarily moments of doing you
weren't meditating but maybe you were sitting around the Christmas
tree and it wasn't even that the Christmas the day
of Christmas was exciting for you or the gifts were
exciting for you but let's say everybody opened all the
gifts and you've already partied out and like the day
is winding down you're sitting there with with a few
folks around the Christmas tree and you noticed a sense
of fulfillment inside you and this fulfillment is just a
moment of being you're just enjoying it you're looking at
the tree you're looking at the fireplace or whatever you're
looking into someone's face and you're just being and you
feel complete you feel like you don't need anything at
that moment and it's not because there's a loved one
near you and it's not because there's Christmas tree but
it's simply because in that moment you were able to
just be very present the problem is that most of
us are not really good at making to ourselves present
and fulfilled in the moment just by ourselves and so
what we need is we need all this external nonsense
just to put us in the right circumstance so that
we can get this sense of just peace and being
but then as soon as those circumstances change we drop
out of this being and we're not able to be
this is also why when you go and you go
hiking and you watch some beautiful sunset and you're just
watching that beautiful sunset and it's winding down it's just
about to set and you've got this sense of peace
washing over you because that sunset provided an excuse for
you just to be and you tell yourself well it's
the sunset that's so beautiful that's putting this me in
this mood but actually you can create that mood for
yourself without the sunset but the problem is that it
takes work and that's the fundamental problem with everything in
this top third on the spectrum is that it all
takes work it's not easy and so there's a real
cost to it and so when you try to position
yourself and you try to move yourself from all the
stuff in this hedonic zone into the eudaimonic zone you
notice that there's a lot of resistance in you it
doesn't feel very good and that's mostly because you're addicted
to this stuff over here and also because you haven't
trained your mind you haven't developed your taste for the
stuff that's over here this stuff divided the this requires
an acquired taste because it's not that learning and education
are always easy and simple and produce immediate gratification they
don't nor does work doing excellent work that can be
difficult nor does doing personal development that can be strenuous
nor does living with integrity that can be challenging -
or contributing to the world that can be challenging -
and meditation if you've ever sat down and done a
full hour of meditation that can be one of the
most difficult things that you can do in your entire
life is just sit there and do nothing for a
whole hour but since this is a personal development and
since we are here to work on ourselves and develop
ourselves then we kind of already have taken on the
mission to work towards improving our conditions in life and
so therefore as part of the mission of self-actualization what
I want you to do at the end of this
video which is right now I want you to identify
what are your goals your top goals for the next
year and I want you to ask yourself are they
hedonic goals or are they eudaimonic goals are they mostly
about money and fame and success or are they more
about gratitude and contribution and being and learning and self-acceptance
and all the goals you have that are hedonic I
want you to ask yourself how can I change them
into goals that are you demonic and then go ahead
and re-injure your goals because this is where the real
personal development appens is when you can actually say to
yourself hmm how can I be more wise about the
things I'm pursuing in my life and then you actually
change your objectives based on the wisdom that you get
from a video from a book or from anywhere else
