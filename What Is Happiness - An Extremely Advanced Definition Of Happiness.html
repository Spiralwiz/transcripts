hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about what is happiness hey
welcome back and let's crack into this topic what is
happiness happiness is something that I've covered in other videos
in fact I've got a great video up there how
to feel happy where you can take a look at
the specific things that you can do in your life
like changes that you can enact put into place that
will actually generate real happiness for you versus the kind
of happiness that you thought you would get or the
things that you thought would make you happy but won't
so that one's more of a practical video this video
I'm going to give you some really deep understanding of
what happiness is so this one goes deeper we're going
at the core and in fact what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say some things that are gonna undermine
and undercut and really contradict some of the stuff that
we talked about in the previous video and this is
gonna take a little bit of of intellect on your
part to work through some of these concepts because there
are many layers to understanding happiness and actually getting it
working in your life so let's crack into this alright
what I really want to talk about here is I
want to get some definitions straight because when we say
happiness that can be such a generic term it loses
it loses sight of anything real and it's kind of
like the word love it tends to be so overused
we say happiness we say love who the hell knows
what these words mean anymore because of the willy-nilly way
in which we use them well I've been studying the
stuff a lot and I've been clarifying definitions in my
own mind and I'm not saying that my definitions are
the right ones but I'm saying that there are these
concepts out there and whatever you choose to label them
these are the concepts so I'm gonna go through them
to get you a really good sense of what happiness
really means because I'm sure that right now your understanding
of what happiness is is drastically different from what it
really should be and that is why you don't have
happiness that is why you don't have fulfillment all right
and this is why you're out there and you're looking
for something more and you're wondering what more is there
something must be missing what is missing and you're looking
for that missing piece here is the missing piece and
this is deep and this is not something that you
will be told almost anywhere else so listen up and
have an open mind about this because some of these
ideas are very likely to shatter your ego and to
really bruised up your ego because some of these things
are not comfortable some of these truths are just not
comfortable to come to adopt and understand so happiness let's
make a distinction right now between happiness excitement all right
happiness and excitement two very different things what you call
happiness when we just say happiness in our common parlance
what we're really talking about there is a form of
excitement and we're gonna make this distinction between being happy
as in just fulfilled and calm and peaceful and just
having a very kind of a you might describe it
as a very mellow very even-keeled state of mind and
state of being just like calm peaceful imperturbable like you
feel like everything is right you're in the moment that
is more of the true definition of happiness that is
not what we say when we talk in everyday terms
in everyday terms when we talk about happiness usually what
people mean is excitement so let me give you some
examples here to make this concrete you're happy when you
go have a nice meal at some expensive restaurant right
you have that seafood or that lobster that steak makes
you happy what is that that is that is stimulation
that's titillation that you're getting that's a form of excitement
there's nothing crazy I mean eating a nice steak is
not some crazy form of excitement it's not like going
on a roller coaster not you don't really get an
adrenaline rushing through your veins but it's still a form
of excitement and it makes you happy we would say
right eating a nice steak makes you happy or whatever
your favorite food is then having some nice sex right
some amazing mind-blowing sex that tends to be a little
bit more towards what we would consider excitement right really
if it's mind-blowing sex and it's like orgasm is excitement
it's crazy a lot of emotions you're filled with chemicals
and hormones that is a form of excitement but you
also say that that makes you happy right having great
sex makes me happy how about going on that roller
coaster you know obviously a form of excitement makes you
happy if you like those kind of things going to
amusement park ride makes you happy so this is what
we generally would say happiness is and we tend to
look for happiness in that way is we look for
stuff that will stimulate and excite us right we want
to get into a stimulating relationship we want to do
stimulating things we want to be doing stimulating hobbies we
want to be entertained in ever more stimulating ways we
want more stimulating movies we want a more stimulating book
exciting book something that's got drama to it right we
we want stimulation at work we want to be working
working on some exciting project we want stimulation with our
friends we want to go out and do something fun
maybe get drunk do little crazy some adventure we want
stimulation and excitement in in our travel even when we
go traveling we want to do something exotic right someone
we want to go do something exotic we want to
do something new unique something adventurous and exciting there and
we tend to think that all of those things make
us happy and we tend to think that well if
we had just more of those and we had those
things more consistently then we would be at a more
consistent level of excitement and then we could just kind
of instead of the mundane life that we're living we're
gonna have this these peeks of excitement and we're gonna
we're gonna kind of somehow lock those peaks in like
if we had more money we would be able to
lock that peak in and continue that excitement or if
we were able to marry our dream partner then we
would take that amazing sex and we would take that
amazing spark that we have the beginning relationship we just
like lock it in and then keep that going with
the marriage so this is kind of the common sense
intuitive notion of of happiness and the problem is that
it just it doesn't work it's not real what is
not happiness let's classify that and label it as excitement
and excitement is there and it's definitely the case that
our brain loves excitement it love variety likes to go
out there and look for these sources of stimulation it's
very convenient because it's an unconscious form of living so
when you're engaged in all these things really you're behaving
on in unconscious ways because you're just getting pleasure you're
feeding off the pleasure it makes you feel so good
that it basically acts like an addiction so you might
think of doing drugs for example as a huge form
of excitement right and if you do a hardcore drug
like heroin that gives you a big rush of excitement
but then also what you get when you do that
is you get you get the highs but then with
the highs come the inevitable lows and that's basically what's
happening with your life is that you are going out
there and you're seeking stimulation and not as destructive ways
as heroin junkie but actually we might say in equally
destructive ways because what you're doing is you might not
be destroying your body in your brain quite as badly
although many of you are with the food that you're
eating but you are destroying the potential in the arc
of your life the growth of your life you're destroying
that by all this stimulation that you're plugged into from
TV news to internet to movies to hang out with
your friends - partying - drinking - even that job
that you're really excited about all that stuff in a
sense is is limiting you and the reason that is
is because you're trying to get stimulation from it and
that is different than real genuine happiness let me now
talk about what genuine happiness is and now this is
not something that I would talk about with a newbie
who's just being introduced in personal development because I would
say that if you're just getting started and right now
your life feels pretty miserable and you having trouble paying
the bills you have a trouble at work trouble in
relationships you've got emotional wounds that need work if if
you've got these problems you know work on those first
rather than going after genuine happiness because genuine happiness is
it's going to take you some time to really wrap
your brain around get it working in your life genuine
happiness is this it's a feeling of peace and calm
and contentment so that means that you are content with
whatever is happening in the moment you're not thinking about
the future you're not thinking about the past you're not
plugged in to any particular source of stimulation you're not
watching the TV you're not doing this you're not doing
that it's just you are happy right now just as
you are you're just you're just content you're content your
peaceful and nothing really is disturbing you and more so
you're so at peace that you don't even imagine that
anything could disturb you basically it's the elimination of any
forms of suffering and you might say okay I mean
that sounds that sounds nice I've had moments in my
life where I just kind of felt you know just
kind of nice but how can that compare with the
excitement that I get when I go watch a blockbuster
movie and it like blows my mind or when I
read some amazing thrilling book or when I go and
I go drinking with my friends we have a crazy
kind of night night out on the town or we
go shopping and it's so fun to go buy stuff
and you know I get that new gadget I open
it up it's like Christmas morning isn't that what we
want that excitement rather than fulfillment here's the problem with
that excitement paradigm really what's happening there is it's an
egoic paradigm you're operating from your ego and what your
ego is doing is that it is and this is
a very apt metaphor that I'm going to use is
that it's keeping you trapped like a mouse in a
hamster wheel right going after a piece of cheese and
so what you've got here is you've got the situation
where you're going through life chasing after things thinking that
external things will make you happy and they don't and
you keep failing to find that and so you go
and you find and you look for another source of
stimulation thinking that that will be the answer and you
go and you bounce from source of stimulation to source
of stimulation hopefully improving the quality of the source of
the stimulation so you might start off with hardcore drugs
eventually realize that that's not doing it for you so
you wean yourself off those you might just go to
drinking and smoking then you might wean yourself off those
because you see that that's not healthy then it's like
you're watching TV and you're screwing around on the internet
eventually maybe you'll realize that those aren't doing too much
for you either and maybe you go and you find
a good relationship you know what can be what can
be wrong about a good relationship nothing really except that
again you're looking for that relationship you're looking for stimulation
from it and it's gonna fail to do that for
you because let me tell you what you're really after
see right now you're probably sitting there you're thinking well
what you're talking about leo you're talking about this kind
of a Buddhist Zen idea of happiness where you just
kind of like calm content in the moment not really
seeking anything not striving for anything first of all that's
going to lead to a boring kind of life that's
not exciting I don't want that kind of life but
then you're also probably thinking that that's just that's not
that's not what happiness really is here's what you got
to understand and really ask yourself this the whole life
that you've been living so far what has it been
20 years 30 years 40 50 60 years have you
actually gotten what you wanted out of life have you
actually gotten it you have it right now I mean
you've chased many things you've been hamster in that wheel
for your whole life have you gotten it have you
gotten that cheese have you gotten what you were really
after let me tell you what you were really after
what you were really after is you were after that
moment of peace that happens after the stimulation ends that's
why you're pursuing that stimulation so let's say for example
that a new movie comes out and you're really excited
to go see that new movie what you're really gonna
that moment in that whole arc of going to see
the movie watching the movie coming out of the movie
and then going back home the point where you're really
happy and fulfilled he's at the end of it if
you were so excited for something that you get it
it's at the end of it that you get a
little bit of it like a release like that was
nice right like that was nice I've been waiting for
that movie for months I saw it it was nice
and now it's kind of like a little bit of
a release and then notice yourself what's gonna happen is
that maybe within a few minutes an hour maybe the
next day it will vary what the period is gonna
be but within a relatively short amount of time your
brain is gonna say okay what's next what is next
and it's going to look for the next source of
stimulation because it's gonna happen so you're gonna start to
feel empty inside it's gonna feel like okay I was
stimulated by that movie and that was a nice nice
experience nice two hours in the theater eating my popcorn
sitting there with my with my friends laughing or or
or crying or just enjoying it whatever like I want
more of that so what you do is now when
you're alone and by yourself and just kind of quiet
you don't feel happy because you're you're kind of addicted
to that original source of stimulation and so your brain
says what's next what's next you're only gonna be happy
for a short period of time until that your brain
says next more stimulation more stimulation more stimulation another hit
of heroin another hit of heroin another hit of heroin
right that is exactly what is happening and what this
does to your life is it creates this roller coaster
this roller coaster that you have in life you right
now think that well leo Roland I mean you can't
be happy all the time I mean this is life
in life you've got happy times you've got sad times
and life is supposed to be like this their ups
their downs everyone says their ups and downs okay this
is the point where I come in and tell you
that remember this was supposed to be an advanced video
advanced ideas so this is not for the newbie for
the newbie this is way in over your head you
go watch the other videos where I tell you how
to be happy right now by tweaking a couple of
variables in your life this is for the advanced student
a personal development okay here's what I'm gonna tell you
is that that's actually not true that that roller coaster
ride it's created by you and all the suffering in
your life is created by you this is a this
is a hard idea to get your head around and
actually what you do is you do not ever get
your head around it because your ego prevents you from
doing that your ego will not allow you to understand
this idea so really this is where enlightenment work comes
in this is when you start to really research enlightenment
and you start to experience it for yourself and you
start to do the meditation the contemplation work that really
takes to start to dissolve your ego what you do
is you undertake this journey of working on yourself on
very deep levels where you start dissolving your ego to
the point where eventually your ego fades away and this
excitement that you were after you no longer seek because
you see that it doesn't make you truly fulfilled and
you become as happy as humanly possible by yourself without
needing any stimulation just because that is your natural state
your natural state is a hundred percent peace and calm
and fulfilment that is your natural state but you are
so far removed from that because you've been so addicted
to stimulation and your ego cannot even fathom anything else
and it's so set on your survival and your reproduction
that it's not going to allow you to do this
it's not going to allow you to actually experience this
in your life until you go through a rigorous process
of dismantling your ego so that is real happiness it's
happiness in the moment it's happiness by yourself and it's
getting rid of that roller-coaster ride because every excitement that
you're after that's the peak and that peak is necessitating
a down sometimes you can mitigate those and sometimes you
can get away with the peak and the down you
can kind of minimize so the Downs not quite so
much but still that roller coaster ride that is your
life has been your life up to this point you've
been creating that because you have an ego that is
out there looking for sources of stimulation which Italy doesn't
need and which ultimately never will fulfill you you're looking
for a psychological fulfillment in the external world and it
simply does not exist and what you are is you
are literally a hamster in a wheel chasing after a
piece of cheese and that piece of cheese is an
illusion it does not exist therefore you will never be
fulfilled he will never be truly happy you can be
stimulated but you will never be truly happy in your
life if you operate from this ago akka paradigm I'm
calling this the yoke paradigm and this is a paradigm
that you are operating on it's the paradigm that 99.999%
of every human on this planet is operating on I'm
still operating on it but I'm making roadway I'm making
some changes right now to to start getting rid of
that so this is a advanced advanced stuff and I'm
gonna bring you more videos on enlightenment and how you
can go about doing that process but to end on
something that's very practical if you want to start experiencing
this then here's how you can do it just a
little idea for how you can do it first of
all unplug yourself from as much stimulation as possible and
start to meditate and I would even encourage you beyond
just doing meditation I have videos on that do 20
minutes of meditation every day for the rest of your
life I recommend you commit to that the second thing
I recommend is that you do this exercise which is
I want you to lock yourself in a room your
bedroom your living room wherever where nobody can disturb you
where there is no stimulation and I want you to
set a timer an alarm clock whatever for two hours
and I want you to sit in a chair comfortably
for two hours without doing absolutely anything and I want
you to watch what your mind does and I want
you to watch what your body does you would literally
start to have withdrawal symptoms so the same symptoms that
a heroin addict will have when you take the heroin
out right he doesn't get his heroin in for a
few days for a week he starts getting sweats and
chills and his body starts shaking his mind's going nuts
that is what's gonna start to happen to you if
you do this exercise and this is gonna be the
first taste the first taste for you of starting to
realize that there's something here because right now you you're
of two minds you're like you're probably either thinking this
is crazy this guy is wrong I'm already happy in
my life I'm already fulfilled and I know that if
I just get that one last missing piece that boyfriend
or girlfriend that hit that that weight that I want
at the gym or if I get that career or
that car that I want that I'm gonna be fulfilled
I just know I will be that might be you
the other alternative here is that you're sitting there you're
thinking you know what there's there's something here that is
true I don't know if I totally buy into what
he's talking about here it sounds a little bit far
out but something here is true because what he's describing
is describing the psychology of my entire life right this
idea that I've been running around in a hamster wheel
that's actually what I've been doing if I'm honest with
myself I don't really want to admit it and I'm
afraid of what that means for the direction of my
life to admit that but if I'm really honest with
myself I have to say you know that last boyfriend
he didn't do it for me that car I got
I mean it was it was nice but it kind
of worked out the way that leo was talking about
here like I got that car I had it for
a few weeks and I feeling great and I felt
really nice I felt like calm and at peace and
then that piece went away and I totally forgot that
I even had this car now I take it for
granted and now I'm chasing after something else or the
same thing with that promotion at work that I got
last year I don't even I don't even feel it
anymore I'm just at this new level and now I
want something more and I'm still not fulfilled so if
you do that exercise where you sit for two hours
by yourself in that room that will further give you
more evidence to start building this case and that's really
what has to happen here is for you to actually
start to even even get on the path towards true
fulfillment in life is you have to start building a
case because your ego does not want to accept this
your ego wants you to keep doing what you've been
doing and your ego wants to preserve itself it doesn't
want to die and really you're putting it on a
path towards killing that ego and your ego does not
want to die your ego is you your ego thinks
that you are important you are precious and that if
if it were to die then your whole life would
collapse that's what it wants you to think and it's
really hard to get your around that and one of
the ways to do it is to actually start to
gather more evidence to build the case here and one
of those is to actually just wash your mind do
what it does watch your body do what it does
when it's just by itself just watch it notice that
isn't that that wrong isn't there something wrong there is
there something wrong about how you've been living your life
your whole life up to this point in time by
being that hamster in the wheel it was okay but
now you know better now you know that there's something
more out there the question is are you gonna be
bold enough to inquire into it any further all right
