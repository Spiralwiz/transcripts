[Music] welcome to conscious politics part three the principles of
conscious politics so in part one in part two we
spent a lot of time talking about the fundamentals of
why government exists and how it works and the various
benefits that it offers so you can start to appreciate
it and now we're gonna talk about what does conscious
politics mean and how do we distinguish it from unconscious
politics I mean we've already addressed some of these points
but I want to condense it down into a list
of of bullet points and I'm gonna give you 50
or so different bullet points here in no particular order
except for the first one which is the most important
and so the number-one principle of conscious politics is that
all of politics and all of government is about maximization
of consciousness love and truth and that that is the
ultimate aim and we need to be very clear about
that as we're designing our policies and as we're engaging
in politics if our policies and our politics ends up
not doing that but the opposite then that's how we
know we've gone astray and also this distinguishes from just
pure selfishness politics done purely for the benefit of me
and my people really this is an expanded view of
politics politics done for the betterment of all not even
just people but the entire planet and really beyond that
the entire universe when we get to that point we're
not at that point yet simply because we're just locked
on this planet but eventually we will be there and
by that point we better have an expanded sense of
of what we're what what our aims are so I
want to take a point here too to explain what
I mean by love in politics because a lot of
people can misunderstand this and this can come off as
a very woowoo hippie type of ideal that's impractical in
the real world it's likely oh love doesn't actually do
anything in the real world you can't actually solve real
problems with with this love stuff it's just abstraction that's
not true at all love is the most powerful force
the problem is that most people who are engaged in
politics have no idea what love is they haven't had
deep mystical experiences of universal cosmic love and so most
people treat love as some romantic things some sentimental sappy
thing that's not at all what I'm talking about so
what does love mean in the context of politics it
means that you have a wide concern for all living
beings it means that you appreciate the value and worth
of all living beings not as just some sort of
instrumental value or utilitarian value to you like well how
can I manipulate that person to get what I want
not in this way in fact that's the whole problem
with politics is that is so manipulative but rather you
understand that there's some deeper force within the universe which
is guiding evolution and which is guiding all human action
and the unfoldment of physical reality now the problem with
this is that when I say this to people who
have not accessed mystical states of consciousness where you do
tap into infinite love to these people this is such
a foreign notion all they understand as far as love
is you know they get horny and they want to
have sex and that's their notion of love or maybe
they their notion of love includes their their children or
their spouse or something like that or their parents that's
good but now imagine that we expand your sense of
love that you have for your family to the entire
universe that's what I'm talking about and you really do
need to have these mystical experiences of universal love because
otherwise it doesn't work just as an idea it needs
to move you we need to transform you when you
have these experiences these are transformative experiences which change your
whole relationship to reality so it's important if you want
to do conscious politics that you actually access those higher
realms of love and that they transform you so that
then you understand right now you don't really understand well
at least start by understanding that you don't understand it
they you have more to discover mystics throughout human history
the Buddha Christ Mahavira and and many others sages and
mystics have talked about these these higher realms of mystical
cosmic love the Sufi poet Rumi mystic and poet his
whole teaching was about this love the whole Sufi Way
is about this love Christ is about this love the
problem is that we have a bunch of Christians these
days especially in America here evangelicals and Catholics and so
forth but their politics is very unconscious because even though
they might go to church and listen to some sermon
about Jesus's love they don't actually embody that in their
own life because their love is only confined to their
personal family and to their tribe may be at best
to some patriotic ideal of America but even that patriotic
ideal excludes black people excludes gay people excludes you know
a bunch of other things doesn't include Middle Eastern people
does it include Muslim people this is not true love
I mean it is love but it's it's a very
limited form of love and also it's important here to
say that conscious politics is about maximizing love and consciousness
as opposed to for example creating a better economy a
lot of politicians these days they act as though all
that government is for is to maximize the economy that
is not what government is really about as to put
the cart before the horse sure of course we need
government to improve the economy but why why you might
say well to feed my children yes but but why
why feed your children you have to understand that all
of it ultimately comes back to love it's because you
love your that you need to feed them and it's
because you love your company that you want to skew
the policy to favor your company that you want subsidies
for your company or some sort of favors for your
company see it's all up and in fact conscious politics
means understanding that all political action is done out of
love and this is something that people have a really
hard time understanding because it's it's quite twisted so what
I'm saying is that literally all political action that has
ever happened in the history of mankind has been out
of love including the Holocaust including the dropping of nuclear
weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki including World War two and
World War one and all the way back all the
war all the slavery all the violence all of it
all the oppression was all done out of love it's
just a question of how expansive is the love or
how contracted and dense is the love and if you're
practicing conscious politics you have to see this because otherwise
what's gonna happen is that you're gonna demonize all those
other people out there who are doing things you're gonna
demonize your opponents you're not actually gonna be able to
love them to luck to be able to love your
opponents and love all people to have this universal sense
of love that I'm talking about what needs to happen
is that you need to literally see the entire universe
as this giant love fractal which is unfolding itself in
a multitude of different different ways sometimes in very twisted
ways including war and ethnic cleansing and all the sorts
of stuff and all of it is ultimately happening due
to love but because people are ignorant and their love
is so contracted and so limited that oftentimes what they
do for example terrorists they will commit terrorist act acts
but they're doing it why because of love because they
love their their family they love their their country they
love Islam whatever and they want to defend it you
see when you're defending something when you're clinging to something
that is of its just a limited form of love
a contracted form of love and someone who's practicing conscious
politics understands this and this is what allows him or
her to overcome hatred and demonization of others there is
an understanding a very deep understanding of the ignorance of
other people where you actually empathize with it because you
realize that hey I to act ignorant sometimes and in
the past I too have been extremely ignorant and I
understand how difficult it is to overcome ignorance and I
understand how difficult it is to have universal love and
to embody use Universal love you know this is not
easy to do at all times maybe it's easy when
you're on some psychedelic trip but it's not easy in
the real world when you have to deal with especially
people with in political situations where there are tough choices
and decisions to make it's not easy at all and
often times love is very twisted and it can actually
hurt us and we're afraid to fully love and so
it's important to appreciate that and that even if you
have conquered all these obstacles and you've become some Buddha
that doesn't mean that the rest of your neighbors have
so you need to appreciate their ignorance their fears about
being loving their inability to see love in the way
that you are able to and so therefore that makes
you what to help them to understand and then ask
what politics becomes about conscious politics is love based as
opposed to fear based if you're not coming from a
place of love you're coming from a place of fear
and lack and that's mostly what our politics is right
now it's fear-based lack based politics we fear immigrants we
fear taking on difficult political situations like climate change we
fear what's gonna happen with the economy we fear that
our state or our local region won't get the money
that it needs we fear other races we fear other
ethnicities we fear the Middle East or we feel Russia
or we fear some other part of the world fear
fear and we we have a sense of scarcity it's
not an abundance mentality we don't fundamentally believe that we
can help to elevate everyone on the planet usually it's
like well I'll try to get mine and deny you
yours this this win-lose mentality conscious politics is love based
fundamentally it believes that we're not lacking in anything what
we're really just lacking in is consciousness love and truth
and inner development which is an infinite resource and that
of course is the beautiful thing about love is that
it's an infinite resource it's not scarce don't underestimate how
powerful this force is love is what allows you to
move millions of people to rally them to inspire them
to give them a vision to do something love is
what allows you to land someone on the moon love
is what allows you to tackle slavery or oppression of
other sorts the love is what allows you to care
about the environment clean up the environment to create better
schools and that's ultimately all that people want what do
people want in the world they want to be able
to love to love their family to love their children
to love their nation and then to go beyond that
the problem is they get so wrapped up in a
limited form of love that they are unable to expand
their love to the whole world because they think that
well I can't love my family properly unless I steal
from those people over there unless I'm extremely selfish and
I exploit people so love based politics does not exploit
people's fears that's also an important thing watch political ads
watch how politicians try to motivate you to get out
to vote most of them do it using fear and
it's not just the right wing of course the right
wing is is a master at manipulating people's fears whether
it's fear of immigrants or fear of social justice warriors
or fear of gays or whatever but it's not just
that left wingers also use fear fear of global warming
fear of the conservatives fear of racism coming back this
is also fear be careful the problem with fear as
a motivation is that it tends to make one paranoid
and unrest or SFIL and when you come up with
solutions your solutions are not as good as they would
be if they were love based fear tends to be
a self-fulfilling prophecy that manifests itself the old law of
attraction idea another principle of conscious politics is one circle
of concern is global and universal not personal not tribal
not ethnic and not corporate of course Universal includes personal
tribal ethnic and corporate but it includes all of it
not just your corporation but all corporations not just your
ethnicity all ethnicities not just your religion all religions not
just your tribe all tribes that's the key difference so
it's not that you're betraying your tribe or betraying your
corporation or betraying your family by having a universal expanded
circle of concern no it's just that you're again stop
thinking with that scarcity mindset of like well I can
only love my family or my corporation no the whole
point of love is that you realize that you can
love it all you can be generous this watt in
this wider circle of concern allows you to care about
all living beings and to care about the oppression of
all beings that's very important you can't just care about
the oppression of your personal tribe you have to care
about the oppression of all tribes on the planet of
all beings on the planet and you care about it
because you have a sense that those beings are a
part of your universal self and that really the only
reason that you're not part of that tribe that's getting
oppressed is simply because of circumstance you weren't born into
it but you easily could have the next principle of
conscious politics is awareness of developmental psychology and Spile dynamics
the recognition that people are at different levels of development
and that they have different needs and that really one
set of policies cannot work for all people because people
are very different conscious politics doesn't try to make everyone
the same notice this most people their political worldview is
such that they believe that hey if everyone just believed
like me and adopted my ideology the world would be
perfect capitalists tend to think this way socialists tend to
think this way liberals and conservatives tend to think this
way if only we could squash the other side everything
would be fine this is foolishness reality can't work this
way because people are at different levels of development and
you learn that by learning developmental psychology and spiral dynamics
then what you realize is that we need to build
bridges to help people to understand each other and we
also need to be tolerant of those who are at
lower levels lower levels doesn't mean that they're bad or
evil people just lower levels like different grades in school
higher grades lower grades all of us have to pass
through different levels some of us pass through these levels
faster than others but that doesn't matter that doesn't mean
that we can be arrogant about it and now deny
or ignore or demonize those who are slower some people
are just slower not everyone is born with the same
capacities as you might have conscious politics aims to try
to meet everyone's basic needs in order to help them
to move up the spiral so conscious politics understands that
people most people in the world are in such desperate
situations that they can't care about love or consciousness or
truth or have a universal circle of concern because they
can barely feed and clothe themselves and take care of
their children and so then our first job is about
just mating to meet basic needs that people have by
distributing resources in our society more justly and then what
we're doing really is we're we're moving people up Maslow's
hierarchy of needs as we meet there are more basic
needs then we're gonna get them to the point where
they start to care about self-actualization where they start to
care about personal improvement where they where they can read
books about history in politics and they can become better
citizens and then they can raise their consciousness and they
can care about meditation and then ultimately they can awaken
and they can experience this Universal love which is the
whole point of all of existence is to help ourselves
to do that both individually and collectively so what's spiral
dynamics teaches us is that you can't just go to
a poor person on the street who is hungry and
start preaching to him about universal love he's not gonna
understand it he's not gonna care about it he can't
at his level so we gotta be able to boil
that down meet the person where he's at and help
him with the needs that he has and so that's
really what government becomes about but of course government shouldn't
just be limited to be meeting basic needs it needs
to be able to meet the needs of various people
all along the spectrum of development so that means government
does need to care about self-actualization and to help people
with self-actualization because by helping people self actualize and transcend
themselves that feeds back around and helps government because then
those people what are they gonna do they're gonna go
back into government or they're gonna do charity work or
whatever they're gonna have a life purpose I'm gonna help
society to evolve which helps government which helps people make
meet their basic needs see that's what's happening in life
is as you're meeting your own basic needs you're not
so needy anymore you can go out and help others
who are needy to meet their basic needs and then
those who used to be needy who you have helped
to not be needy anymore now they're not needy and
they are inspired to do the same thing that you
help them to do because they see the value you
add it to their life and you show them a
way out of their neediness so now they're inspired to
go do the same thing and it becomes this virtuous
cycle conscious politics is ecological holistic systemic big-picture and meta
conscious Paul politics is about systems thinking not manipulating systems
not finding a way to exploit a system for your
personal benefit no it's about learning how the entire systems
work works in all its nuance and complexity and then
it's about figuring out a way to improve the entire
system for the benefit of the whole system and all
of its members not necessarily for me personally and of
course I'm redefining what's good for me personally see as
your circle of concern expands and as you experience universal
love what's good for you becomes what's good for everybody
else so it's not that I have to sacrifice myself
per se no I get joy out of seeing everybody's
boat rise not just my own and in fact I
get more joy out of seeing other people's boat rise
than just my own conscious politics is about understanding relativity
which means that you can't have moral absolutes anymore you
understand that morals are relative to various cultures and eras
this opens up your mind to be flexible and not
to get hung up on things not to get to
moralizing of others conscious politics is about inner work and
outer work it starts with deep inner work personal development
consciousness work to expand one sense of self and then
as one sense of self is expanded then once divet
one develops a deeper sense of life purpose which is
grounded in psychological maturity not just exploitation of the world
but psychological maturity and genuine mystical insight and then from
there we do the outer work of helping society so
really in or work in outer work they go hand
in hand because by doing inner work I can do
better outer work and then my outer work becomes helping
other people do their inner work and then they do
their inner work allows them to then go and do
better outer work and so on conscious politics is self-aware
it's aware of things that we've discussed on this channel
for for a long time now it's aware of self
bias it's aware of self-deception and so we're of survival
it's aware of identity issues or ego it's aware of
collective ego it's aware of how projection works of how
demonization works of duality of ego backlash all of these
concepts we've talked about and we'll continue to talk about
it's aware of all of these this part of what
I mean by saying it's meta it's able to stand
outside of its own perspective to analyze its own filters
the problem generally speaking with conservatives and with liberals is
that they're able to analyze and critique the various problems
with the opposite perspective and they they can clearly see
that the other side is a perspective with flaws and
that it's is very limited and it's pathological in many
ways and they can clearly see that it's a filter
that those other people are looking through so liberals see
that of conservatives but what liberals can't see is that
their own liberalism is also a filter with limitations and
flaws and pathologies and vice versa with conservatives and one
needs to be able to stand outside and to analyze
both filters that's really our work here that's the key
that distinguishes conscious politics from unconscious politics unconscious politics isn't
conscious of the filter that it's looking at the world
through very importantly conscious politics is aware of how devilry
works go check out my video what is the devil
because there's so much devilry going around in the world
but at the same time as it's aware that how
devilry works it's also loving of devilry it doesn't demonize
devilry it understands the devilry is a necessary part of
life this is how survival happens through devilry and that
the only reason you're here to begin with to be
alive is through generations and generations of devilry of your
ancestors that has gotten you here that's survival and so
now our job is to clean up the corruption and
the devilry which has gotten us this far but it
only always takes you so far and then it starts
to break down that's the problem of devilry so the
work of every generation of humans is to clean up
our survival strategies and our selfishness because we realize that
it's better to live in a less devilish world then
our ancestors lived in and so that's what we're doing
that's what evolution is and to to eliminate all devil
aureus is simply the same thing as to be totally
loving and so that's what we're working towards we're trying
to get every human on the planet to be totally
loving and conscious totally free of self biases and clinging
to their survival agendas and fear how do we do
that well of course through self-improvement and self actualization work
but also collectively we do it through building roads and
bridges and electric grids and giving everyone internet access and
helping to feed the poor so they can help themselves
to to self-actualize at some point and helping people with
mental illnesses helping people with health care helping people have
decent jobs where they get paid decent living wages this
is how it has to start the foundation is material
once the material needs are met then there become higher
immaterial needs and that's where life really gets juicy and
beautiful conscious politics is non reactive non-judgmental non demonizing non
moralizing non shaming and non blaming it takes radical responsibility
for oneself and for one's society conscious politics does not
turn politics into an identity battle you don't create this
identity of being a conservative or a liberal because conscious
politics is too conscious for that it sees that all
identities are limited and that your true identity is totally
Universal and all-inclusive it's about not self-dealing a lot of
people go into politics to self deal that's unconscious politics
conscious politics is also to willing to make some personal
compromises or sacrifices so for example if you're wealthy and
rich conscious politics means that you recognize that you know
I have it really good I've benefited from the system
that doesn't mean that I now squeeze the system for
even a little bit more to get all the tax
breaks I can it means that no actually I have
to be honest and I have to say that you
know what I've had some unfair advantages in this economy
and that really I should be paying more taxes not
less and I'm willing to make that sacrifice because for
me really what's more important in getting a little bit
more money five or ten percent more of my my
money is for all of society to prosper and for
all other human beings to be able to have all
the luxury and opportunities and freedoms that I have with
my millions of dollars that's what it means not to
self deal and what it means to make sacrifices it's
not just about your personal bottom-line or what you personally
need oftentimes you have to vote for a politician who
may not offer all the juicy stuff that you want
but which is gonna make society more just and equal
for other people and that's especially true if you've reached
a high point in your own personal life you know
at a certain point in your life you you have
so much of everything that you've ever wanted that you
don't need anymore and you have to know what to
say okay enough is enough I've gotten everything I want
at this point if I keep trying to get more
for myself this is this is this is actually going
to become pathological now my life needs to be about
helping others to experience the success that I've been able
to experience conscious politics appreciates the positive functions of government
this is very important if you can't appreciate all the
good stuff that government does for you and all you
think of is how evil and wrong government is and
how government enslaves you and steals your money you can't
possibly have a healthy attitude towards government or towards society
because under such a belief are you gonna educate yourself
about government are you gonna look at policy proposals that
could possibly improve things and don't know all you want
to do is just tear it down and this doesn't
work and you're not gonna win that battle you're not
gonna tear a government down because government does too many
useful functions so you're gonna be wasting your time if
you're gonna go down that route down that road we've
got to keep adding towards what we've already built you
have to appreciate it it's taken many thousands of years
to build up this technology of government that we have
today be careful about trying to rip it all down
thinking that you're gonna get something better chances are you
gonna get something worse it's almost like an ignorant person
goes inside their body who doesn't know what the organs
do like the appendix or the liver or the the
the pancreas or something and then he you know he's
just like mucking around in there some ignorant surgeon and
just like cut stuff out like well I don't think
you need the appendix let's just cut that up I
don't think you need one of your kidneys let's just
throw it out it's like you have to appreciate that
mother nature has a deep wisdom to it the same
wisdom that went into evolving all of the organs in
your body also went into evolving the organs of your
society as well now of course granted there are a
lot of foolish politicians who were getting in the way
of that wisdom but overall there is a collective wisdom
that is baked into government a collective wisdom in the
court system a collective wisdom in in taxation a collective
wisdom in the military a collective wisdom in welfare programs
they exist for a reason because they solve serious problems
that our previous generations had that you don't even know
exists as problems because they've already been solved for you
by these systems but if you remove one of these
systems it's as foolish as removing your kidneys thinking you
know better you have to really study carefully before you
go removing something because there will be unforeseen consequences you
know for example in America when FDR came into office
during the the Great Depression and there was the New
Deal and they instituted Social Security before Social Security was
instituted a large percentage of the elderly population some ridiculous
number like 25% or 30% were homeless living on the
streets why is that because when you turn 60 or
70 and you haven't done proper retirement planning and you
haven't been saving up you literally have no more retirement
but also your health goes out you're not able to
work the way you used to when you were young
and then you have no choice but to live on
the street so millions of people were living on the
streets sometimes libertarians say well but Leo that's their responsibility
too bad for them you know because if if if
they didn't plan their a time I well look that's
they deserve it they deserve to live on the streets
but look at what you're saying look at what you're
saying see the only way you can hold such a
position is when you actually don't care about those people
if that that person let me on the street was
your mother or your child you wouldn't take that attitude
you try to help them and you would be understanding
that you know it's not easy to plan 30 years
ahead and to save for your retirement that's not something
that people naturally want to do people are poor long-term
thinkers and planners so one of the functions of government
is to help people to have pensions and something saved
up they they did they would they do that for
you for your own benefit now of course ideally everyone
be responsible enough to be able to do it themselves
but that's a fantasy in reality what happens is that
if there's no government program to help you do it
millions of people are living on the streets and then
you have to deal with those homeless people on the
streets they're gonna be begging you for quarters how does
that make you feel probably not very good especially if
there were ten times more homeless people than there already
are conscious politics is not neutral it is aware of
false equivalency it does not just take the middle point
of all positions sometimes it's bold and it's assertive and
it's ready to fight for what is right ready to
fight for consciousness sometimes you have to fight unconsciousness with
consciousness the way that Gandhi did for example or the
way that Martin Luther King did or the way that
the abolition abolitionists did against slavery or the women's rights
movement or the gay rights movement sometimes you have to
fight now of course ideally you're not doing it with
violence peacefully ideally but even sometimes violence is necessary because
sometimes the unconsciousness and the devilry can just get so
out of hand a good example would be World War
two that would be an example of a of a
justifiable use of violence because that was a cancer of
devilry that was spreading across Europe and even in in
Asia and really throughout the whole world it would have
spread if it wasn't put in check so don't get
this idea that all love and consciousness just means that
we just we just be nice we don't ruffle any
feathers we don't rattle any cages no sometimes you have
to be bold about it for example Gandhi was very
bold but in a peaceful way Martin Luther King was
very bold and assertive but in a peaceful way and
that's power that's love if you want to see what
love can do study the example of Gandhi study the
example of Martin Luther King these were two of the
best leaders in the last century which demonstrated the power
of love moved millions of people in the case of
Gandhi in India tens and even hundreds of millions of
people that's powerful conscious politics is radical it can look
very liberal and progressive this is not a mistake this
is correct because when we're living in a devilish society
which is selfish and oppressive that is the status quo
ego and unconsciousness is the status quo so of course
when the status quo is ego and devilry and unconsciousness
when you propose conscious solutions loving solutions in a society
which is crippled by fear and neediness and lack and
scarcity mindset of course you're gonna be called a liberal
of course that's one of the ironies of the teachings
of Jesus his teachings the spirit of his teachings if
it was embody today would be so radical and so
liberal and so progressive that American conservatives and evangelicals would
be disgusted with Jesus they would call him a social
justice warrior a radical communist that's the irony of the
whole thing because Jesus wasn't for the status quo Jesus
in his time was a radical extreme radical he challenged
all the all the dogmas and orthodoxies of his religion
he was a Jew he created a whole new religion
how do you think modern evangelicals would react if some
prophet came along and said ok I'm starting a new
religion because evangelicals are so corrupt they would call him
a devil they wouldn't worship him and that's exactly what
happened in jesus's time that's the irony of it all
don't be afraid to be radical it's not about whether
you're radical or moderate the true question is what leads
to the most love to the most consciousness and the
most truth and if that means you need radical proposals
to get there that's what it takes too many people
are attached to being moderate or to just be neutral
to giving equal weight to both sides of an issue
without thinking for themselves this is just reinforcing the status
quo which is just reinforcing evil conscious politics is scientific
and empirical rather than ideological this is very important we
need to be open to split testing various solutions in
a scientific empirical manner within the realm of politics and
government the problem right now is that people have preconceived
ideas about what some change in policy will do like
people will think well cutting taxes as always it's always
just good for the economy but is that true have
you actually empirically tested it have you verified it by
putting it into place and tracking all the indicators scientifically
that's the proper way to verify that but see for
most people they don't care about validating whether tax cuts
will actually help the economy they just believe tax cuts
will and then they don't even care about what happens
after we do the tax cuts and if the tax
cuts end up crashing the economy well they don't care
about that because in their mind tax cuts are always
an absolute good this this doesn't work and the same
doesn't just apply to conservative ideas but also to liberal
ideas for example liberals have the idea that that banning
banning guns and especially assault weapons in America will help
to stop school shootings now that's a that's an interesting
and plausible hypothesis but it's just a hypothesis we don't
know if it's actually true so if we were really
smart we could be scientific about it and we can
for example do the following thing we could we could
pass an assault weapons ban banning all military-style weapons and
maybe high-capacity magazines we could pass such a ban for
10 years but we agree at the get-go that it's
only going to be for 10 years then after the
10 years rolls around you know we're gonna have scientists
we're gonna have a jecht 'iv independent panel of Sciences
we're gonna track all the indicators track all the school
shootings and we're gonna see what happens does the violence
reduce do things get better and how much better and
then after those 10 years pass if we don't see
a significant improvement then we lift the ban see this
would be a scientific and empirical approach and we could
do this and in fact by doing it in this
empirical way this will help to bring both sides together
because you know the Conservatives would be open to such
an idea perhaps because if they truly believe that banning
assault weapons will will not reduce any violence issues the
way that many of them do then if the science
actually validates that then we could settle this issue once
and for all and we don't need to be bickering
about anymore and then there won't be a ban and
then you can have all the assault weapons you want
if the science says that it doesn't harm society but
if the sign says it does harm society you got
to be open to the fact that hey you know
what maybe I shouldn't be so selfish and I should
be willing to give up my assault weapons otherwise thousands
of children die every year from from shootings and so
forth see this would be a scientific approach this is
not what we have right now it's the opposite of
what we have right now conscious policy is also educational
which means that it actually helps to educate the populace
about all of these different principles and ideas about the
history of government the history of politics how things really
work still about psychology all of this right so a
lot of what we're missing is just education the government
can have all sorts of education programs that help to
spread this information for free through the internet through websites
through YouTube channels for example government have a youtube channel
which helps you to find your life purpose which helps
you to understand spirituality which helps you to to take
responsible well it would have safety protocols for responsible use
of psychedelics and other other drugs this is one of
the key functions of the government it can help to
educate people on how to build high quality lives for
themselves a government could have an entire free course on
how to be an entrepreneur for example that would be
really valuable and very easy to do it wouldn't cost
a lot of money either it would scale really nicely
there would be almost no downside to it another principle
of conscious politics is that it's grounded in historical study
reading of books about history psychology sociology political theory feminism
about abolition about mmm ancient Greece and Rome and democracy
in China and how government worked in China and all
around the world multiculturalism spirituality ecology all of this reading
studying this stuff and creating a culture where people are
reading about these things conscious politics is about understanding the
complexity of social problems it's recognized that there are no
simplistic solutions building a wall for example to keep out
immigrants is not going to solve the issue of immigration
in America so if you really want to solve that
problem that's fine it's a legitimate problem that we might
want to solve but we need to go about it
not in some stupid simplistic way but in a way
that actually can address some of the root causes and
issues you're never gonna be able to build a wall
to keep people out people will tunnel under it people
will throw ladders over it people will fly planes around
it drones around it people will just come here for
tourism then overstay their visa which is how most elite
illegal immigrants come to America anyways not through the border
by physically walking over it alright so this needs to
be appreciated and then once that's appreciated then these complex
social problems they can be solved by actually going to
the root of the issue the root of the issue
is the poverty and political instability in the countries that
the people are coming from so if you really wanted
to solve the immigration problem you would be for solutions
to strengthen and improve the democracies of those Latin American
governments which are the cause of why people are fleeing
those countries and coming to America that would be the
root solution conscious politics is aware of backfiring mechanisms and
the counter intuitive nature of policy and regulation a lot
of times putting in place and regulation has the opposite
effect of what you think one of the best examples
of this was prohibition in America prohibition of alcohol ended
up just making things worse because it turned to crime
and mafia and corruption and nobody really observed it anyways
and we have the same problem right now today with
the drug war it's been going on for like forty
years now fifty years it's extremely ineffective harms many people
we need to be able to see how even though
our intentions are good like yes our intention is to
stop children from doing heroin but by putting in place
this drug war it ends up backfiring a lot of
policies and regulations and a backfiring so you have to
be very careful about when you're thinking through them we
could have entire panels objective scientific panels of experts on
various topics and whenever some politician or person proposes a
regulation or a policy this panel sits down and analyzes
it and outlines all of the possible backfiring mechanisms how
can it backfire and do the opposite of what it
wasn't intended to do this would be good for making
us more aware of what we're really proposing and then
we can actually test and see if those panels are
right so it's not ideological but it's actually a scientific
and empirical conscious politics recognizes the validity of both left
and right perspectives without a false equivalency that doesn't mean
that left and right are always equal or equally right
but you can't just say that only the left is
correct and you can't just say that only the right
is correct both of those are just silly there's legitimate
concerns on both sides conscious politics recognizes that both the
left and the right can go too far but at
the same time again it doesn't mean that we're just
moderates all the time conscious politics recognizes the importance of
an exquisite balance that exists within government if it is
to be healthy and functional a balance between freedom and
limitation between individual and collective between masculine and feminine between
peace and use of force between capitalism between socialism all
those things need to be delicately balanced and how do
we find where the balances should lay through testing through
empirical testing you can't do it through ideology the truth
is that no human being knows what the proper balance
is between capitalism and socialism or between masculine and feminine
or between individual versus collective and also because it changes
over time there's not just one static point that we
find between capitalism socialism and if we find that point
that's it we're done we've solved the problem for the
rest of society forever no it might work out for
the next hundred years but then as we get new
technology as the population increases as consciousness rises as you
know the environment changes the climate changes that balance will
need to be changed again to accommodate for that that's
what survival is survival is about balancing to fit in
with one's environment but our environment as human beings were
changing our environment all the time by creating new technology
our environment changes so radically that we need new systems
of government and we need to constantly rebalance various of
these various equilibriums that go out of balance over time
conscious politics is focused on root issues and systemic change
sustainable solutions it cares about good government and it cares
about policy rather than culture war issues what is the
policy proposals it's not just about which politician looks like
me or which politician comes from my region of the
world or the state of my state it's not what
the politician can do for me personally it's about policy
proposals policy proposals these days aren't aren't taken too seriously
when analyzing politicians on the evening news very rarely do
they actually talk about the policy proposals it turns into
a debate about personality and about identity and other things
like this conscious politic is multicultural tolerant and open-minded it's
multi perspectival it's curious about alternative points of view genuinely
curious if you're practicing conscious politics you need to be
willing to listen and to study other points of view
not just have them debated to you against your will
but you have to be proactive go out there to
actually study different perspectives to see what you're missing conscious
politics is non conformist it discourages ideology and cults it
emphasizes critical thinking conscious politics emphasizes happiness development and health
rather than economic growth right now the way that we
measure the success of politicians and government a lot of
times is with very simplistic and crude mathematical metrics like
the GDP or unemployment rate but this doesn't accurately reflect
what we're really trying to do with society we're not
trying to lower the unemployment rate we're not trying to
increase GDP what we're really trying to do is to
increase happiness development consciousness love and health so we need
new metrics to track these things and you can track
these things there just needs to be a will to
do it conscious politics is also economically responsible this is
something that you conservatives will like balancing budgets not overspending
these are important concerns and these are well one of
the areas where conservatives are more right than liberals you
can't just keep spending and spending and spending we have
to find ways to actually pay for the or the
welfare state that is important otherwise it'll come back to
bite us rubber sustainable solutions over spending is not a
sustainable solution conscious politics is about creative and innovative solutions
it's not about doing business as usual the way we've
done it for thousands of years or hundreds of years
it's about innovating the same way that Silicon Valley innovates
every year with new smart phones and new TVs and
new technologies government needs to be as innovative to keep
up with that right now government acts like a dinosaur
and mostly it's just like legacy issues from a hundred
years ago legacy laws that are that are very ancient
and outdated this can't possibly work when our technology is
advancing so quickly conscious politics takes wealth inequality seriously a
healthy strong robust middle class is absolutely essential to democracy
and conscious politics we can't have a large chunk of
the population in poverty or barely struggling to get by
while some top 1% is living on luxury yachts eating
caviar this this is not a proper society this means
the structure of our society is is out of balance
if this is happening and that's exactly what's happening in
America today conscious politics takes environmental issues very seriously conscious
politics creates transparency and accountability within government the issue isn't
big government or small government the issue is what is
the proper size of size of government for the number
of people that we have and also what's the quality
of the government it's not about reducing government it's about
improving the quality of the government and one of the
ways you do that is by increasing transparency and accountability
so that various kinds of agencies like the CIA for
example they're not allowed to do various kinds of dark
projects where they can go and manipulate other governments and
spend billions of dollars interfering and in elections around the
world and scheming and manipulating right without any kind of
accountability same thing with NSA wiretapping and surveillance you know
all of this needs to be made transparent and accountable
to the people conscious politics is about building infrastructure starting
with the very basic infrastructure of Bill of building roads
bridges electric grid internet grid things of this nature because
that basic material infrastructure is what is necessary to then
build the more soft and Appstore spiritual infrastructure which we
will need in the future right like you can't have
free videos that educate people about spirituality and love and
consciousness unless you first have an internet and a lot
of rules parts of America don't have high-speed Internet to
watch those videos if such videos were to exist they
couldn't download some course about how to build a business
or how to awaken themselves if there isn't first the
right infrastructure in place so that's important conscious politics understands
that altruism morality and good intentions can easily be turned
into identity and ego so just because someone's acting moralistic
or altruistic doesn't actually mean that they are that way
it doesn't actually mean they're loving it could just be
a sort of a cloak that they're wearing a wolf
in sheep's clothing so conscious politics is very aware of
that doesn't get tricked by those kinds of ploys that
of course will be played by various selfish Devils conscious
politics is intellectually honest which means that it's willing to
admit mistakes you have to be able to admit that's
some policy proposal that you thought would be good for
society actually turns out not to be so good maybe
you truly believe that universal health care is going to
be good but then when it's implemented and it doesn't
work properly you have to be able to admit that
you know what I was wrong about that maybe we
should change it back that's what we need intellectual honesty
conscious politics is non militaristic that means one of its
highest priorities is to avoid war at all costs unnecessary
war aggressive war conscious politics is non exploitative non parasitic
we don't wage wars in order to help ourselves economically
we don't wage wars to get access to resources like
oil we don't wage wars to get better trade deals
on goods we don't manipulate other governments we don't try
to control other governments or strong-armed other governments to meet
our own survival needs all of this is unconscious politics
but at the same time even though it's non militaristic
conscious politics is not pacifist it understands that sometimes a
defensive war is necessary to stand up against devilry fascism
or corruption and so a military is still maintained but
it's used very rarely and very carefully and strategically for
defensive purposes and I don't mean justifying offense as defense
the way that America did with with the Iraq war
saying that oh well we're going in there to stop
terrorism that that's not what I'm saying that's that's devilry
that's unconscious politics truly defensive purposes that means you must
be attacked first and of course attacked by the right
people you can't be attacked by by the 9/11 hijackers
and then the blame that on Iraq and say well
Iraq caused it Iraq had nothing to do with it
and of course you have to recognize that you weren't
attacked by a state you were attacked by rogue individuals
so you can't go attacking a country because some rogue
individuals attacked you that's one of the difficulties about terrorism
you don't want to conflate those two conscious politics is
spiritual yet at the same time it's realistic and pragmatic
that's very important people sometimes think that Oh Leo if
your spiritual then you're so impractical no you can be
very practical you can pass policies which are helping people
with substantial real-world problems in fact that's what spiritual really
means when you're really spiritual you understand that a person
cannot rise to your level of virtual development unless they
first meet their basic needs for food and shelter and
basic education and so forth conscious politics is unitive rather
than divisive tries to bring people together rather than pit
them against each other because conscious politics recognizes the the
common element amongst all people we don't try to divide
people by race or by IQ or by gender or
by geography or by religion because in the end all
people really want is they just want to be loving
and they want to be able to take care of
themselves and their family they want to survive that's what
anybody wants that's what's so crazy about war and violence
and all this geopolitical struggle he said in the end
everybody wants the same thing and that's precisely why we
have all this war and geopolitical struggle it's because everyone's
so so worried about just basic survival that all these
survival agendas they they clash with each other but there's
a way to handle your survival without having it clash
the clashing is it quite necessary there are better ways
to go about it conscious politics values expertise and experience
conscious politics has a long time horizon it's looking very
far back into the past studying history but it's also
looking far forward into the future generations into the future
so that we don't do silly things for example like
ruin the planets environment for the next generation because we
were so careless as to just exploit it for our
own generation or to run up the debt to saddle
our children and future generations with debt you know this
this has only happens when you have a short time
horizon conscious politics is the visionary selfless leadership leading by
example the best examples of this would be Martin Luther
King and Gandhi visionary selfless leadership that's what Gandhi was
doing conscious politics is bold fearless and proactive it doesn't
just sit around and wait for things to to solve
themselves it's ease forward into the future it anticipates problems
and tackles them head-on so that's the list of all
the principles of conscious politics as you can see a
lot of this goes against everything that's happening in government
today in fact if you want to put it in
a nice little nutshell conscious politics is the polar opposite
of Donald Trump everything that Donald Trump is doing from
the way that he's running his campaign to the people
that he's appointing to government positions to the way that
he speaks to the way that he tweets all of
that is unconscious politics the problem with Trump is not
that he's right-wing he's not even truly that right-wing the
problem is that he's an obsessed narcissist operating from low
consciousness low emotional development low moral development and low cognitive
development he's practicing chakra wanna chakra to politics and what
we need are chakra 6 and chakra 7 politics if
you don't know what chakras are what those numbers means
don't worry about it now some objections but Leo isn't
this left-wing aren't you biased here you're just like creating
a new left-wing ideology that's not actually what I'm doing
what I'm doing is going meta I am biased but
I'm biased towards consciousness and towards love so yeah in
that sense I'm biased I'm not neutral in the sense
that I treat every position indifferently because consciousness is not
neutral when you become highly conscious when you start to
awaken you're gonna realize that the point of life is
to help everybody to evolve towards consciousness and love and
truth you know Jesus Christ wasn't neutral Martin Luther King
wasn't neutral Gandhi wasn't neutral they had some strong opinions
about the problems of society in their time and they
had some radical solutions that they proposed and all three
of them were killed for it isn't that interesting all
three of them were called radicals all three of them
were opposed by the status quo and many conservatives of
their time because what conservativism is really about is about
maintaining the status quo so be careful about your own
biases here the trick when you're trying to be objective
with a biased person is that the biased person will
call your objectivity bias because he doesn't want to admit
that he's trying to defend the status quo he thinks
the status quo was totally normal and unbiased but that's
not true it's biased towards unconsciousness and devilry so be
careful with that another objection is but Leo isn't all
this very idealistic and utopian actually it's not utopian it's
just advanced it's visionary is forward-thinking it's not just about
the next election cycle so if all you care about
is winning the next election cycle then yeah everything I
say here is irrelevant it's it's not gonna happen within
the next five years but also don't forget that society
does change rather quickly and you can't stop it from
evolving and changing so the things that I'm talking about
will happen in the next ten fifty to a hundred
years that's our time horizon here on the one hand
it's very long compared to conventional political wisdom on the
other hand you know a hundred years is nothing societies
can be so radically different in the next hundred years
you're gonna be hardly be able to recognize it historically
government evolves through intellectual advancements and that's what we're doing
here first we have to figure out what the right
theoretical foundation is for government our culture desperately needs to
go meta to be able to look at its own
filters so yeah right now conscious politics can seem far-fetched
but we need a vision for the future we to
understand our root problems and the root solutions which is
what this whole multi-part series is trying to get you
to see because most people right now do not understand
the root problems or the root solutions or really what
government is even about and also remember that conscious politics
is not an all-or-nothing affair it's not that either we
implement everything I say here tomorrow or I failed and
it's all pointless and hopeless it's always an incremental process
consciousness comes in many degrees there are many stages of
development for individuals and for societies so all that we're
talking about here is making incremental 5% improvements in raising
our consciousness and level of development we don't need to
worry about perfection we don't need to worry about being
perfectly loving and having a perfectly just society this is
actually a very big problem that many unconscious people fall
into is they say olio society is just so screwed
up it's so corrupt it's so bad that it's just
a hopeless and therefore I'm not even gonna vote I'm
not even gonna study this stuff it's not it's it's
just pointless this is the worst possible attitude that you
can have this is sort of the problem of perfectionism
Society actually is pretty great these days if you live
in a first world developed country Society for the most
part is pretty great we just need to keep making
incremental improvements and you'll be amazed at how quickly we
make progress we've already made enormous progress in America for
example in the last 30 years you might think that
all what what progress leo it seems like we're think
backwards with Trump and it seems like everything's going to
hell and it seems like we haven't made any progress
at all but but actually we're always making progress we've
made enormous progress with gay-rights there's been enormous progress with
with race inequality of course there's still problems but there's
a lot better than it was 30 years ago even
with policing all the problems with policing that exist today
it's still way better than it was 30 years ago
you have to admit so things are always improving and
don't forget improvement is not a consistent linear upward trajectory
it always ABB's and flows with ups and downs so
never get discouraged by losing one election to some to
some devil you know yeah it's gonna happen it's gonna
keep happening Devils will get elected once in a while
stuff will regress once in a while but in the
grand scheme of things we're moving upwards and in fact
those regressions are necessary the whole function of Trump is
to highlight the unsustainable nature of that type of governance
it doesn't work what Trump is doing is unsustainable it
doesn't work and the more he does it the more
obvious it becomes for our culture that it doesn't work
and that's exactly how progress has always happened you know
for example with slavery the reason that slavery was ultimately
abolished was become was because the evils of it became
so apparent to people that they could no longer ignore
it or deny it to the point where people just
said okay enough is enough it has to stop and
then there was a war and you know during that
war things looked very bleak the civil war was you
know killed like over a million people I think in
that were killed and that seemed like a very negative
kind of step backwards but ultimately and led to the
next generation being a step forwards and that's exactly how
progress works of course it works this way collectively but
it also works this way in your own personal life
you notice that your life isn't just a straight linear
trajectory upwards towards an enlightenment if only it was that
easy there's backsliding there's regressions there's times where you pig
out on a on a gallon of ice cream or
you you you go back and get addicted to porn
again or whatever but all of those are necessary for
you to learn your lessons the way that human beings
learn lessons is by screwing up and making mistakes so
the mistakes are not really mistakes they're all part of
the drawing process towards higher consciousness and love those mistakes
then lead to better infrastructure so all the mistakes that
our ancestors made for thousands of years are baked into
the wisdom of our government never forget how many millions
of people tens of millions maybe even hundreds of millions
of people died in order us for us to learn
the lessons and to create the various kinds of governmental
institutions that we now have today that prevent those same
mistakes from happening you know you might say well Leo
what was the point of the Holocaust it was just
pure evil no it wasn't pure evil the point of
the Holocaust was to show the world what that looks
like what pure selfishness looks like and how self-defeating it
is see so that then it doesn't happen again that's
a very valuable lesson that people had to pay with
their lives for appreciate that lesson and that's just one
lesson out of thousands of lessons that were learned by
our ancestors you can improve your politics significantly right now
by adopting the principles I've outlined above but be careful
not to turn these principles into an ideology if you
do then you have turned conscious politics into unconscious politics
remember that conscious politics is about the structure not the
content so just changing the content of your beliefs and
adopting all these principles as a new dogma structurally what
you're still doing is you're acting out the dogma it
doesn't matter what kind of dog while you're acting out
as long as you're acting it out and you're clinging
to it it's a dogma and the problem is the
dogma not the content per se see so be very
careful about this ideology business the whole point of conscious
politics that you're able to to appreciate structure over content
also understand that conscious politics is not optional it's going
to happen regardless so if you say all the all
this is stupid I don't care about it I don't
like any of this I'm ignore all this it's still
going to happen mankind is still going to evolve government
is not going away it's going to get more complex
it's going to keep evolving more conscious policies will be
proposed various forms of corruption and oppression will be eradicated
and expunged society will become more equal because that's evolution
so what I suggest is that you align yourself on
the right side of history on the right side of
evolution rather than resisting it or ignoring it or denying
it or sweeping it under the rug or saying that
it's idealistic and impossible remember that if we travel back
in time a thousand years or 2,000 years ago and
we tell them about what society is like in the
year 2000 they're gonna call you a crazy utopian hippie
and they're gonna think it's impossible and I don't think
it's totally idealistic and impractical from their point of view
they're right because they're are so myopic they don't have
a large enough vision and a far enough time horizon
so make sure you don't fall into that same mistake
today conscious politics cannot happen without you it all starts
with you deepening your own understanding of all these principles
and issues and starting to embody them in your own
life there cannot be conscious politics without conscious and emotionally
mature people like you so begin today begin with yourself
if everything I say in this series would be understood
by mankind at large we would experience a new golden
age and of course I'm no fool nothing I said
here will be understood by mankind of a high Lama
at large so there will not be a new golden
age precisely because everything I said here is gonna be
deeply denied and resisted that's just the nature of our
predicament that's what ignorant does is ignorance denies projects resists
distracts creates excuses and rationalizations attacks lashes out and tries
to bite the hand that feeds it which is why
we can't have nice things that's it for this episode
stay tuned for part 4 part 4 is gonna be
the culmination of all this where I give you a
giant list of specific policy proposals that's where we get
really nitty-gritty and practical this is where you see all
these lofty principles and you see just how practical they
can be when they are implemented in the real world
right now in our current time so not just policies
that are gonna be in place 100 years from now
but today you can certainly take all these principles and
develop policies for today that can improve the lives and
the consciousness and the love of the majority of people
so you'll see that in part four you
