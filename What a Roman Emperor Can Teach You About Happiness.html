hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org and
today I wanted to cover the meditations which were written
by Marcus Aurelius he was a Roman Emperor and really
about the lessons that can be drawn from the meditations
and applied to your life in order to get more
peace and contentment with the way your life is right
now so what are the meditations just to give a
little bit of a history of where this work comes
from really it's a diary written by Marcus Aurelius Antonius
who was a Roman Emperor back in 200 AD there
abouts and he was really considered one of the one
of the quote unquote good emperors who ran the Roman
Empire before it ultimately collapsed 200 years later and what's
really interesting about Marcus is his worldview and how he
viewed life and how he applied that to running the
Roman Empire and and the kind of peace that this
man has and just the kind of the kind of
brilliance in in his way of thinking because what's unique
about the meditations which is actually the only I believe
this is correct the only surviving work of a Roman
Emperor written work is is that you really get a
picture into how he thought and I think it's very
instructive because if I could if I could sum up
the gist of it the gist of his philosophy which
was by the way stoicism was that everything that people
usually tend to associate with the problems in their life
is external and there's this dichotomy between the external things
that are bothering us and also our internal state of
mind and how we're feeling and how we're thinking and
what stoicism does it really flips that coin on the
other side so usually what we're doing is we're always
concerned about how are people thinking about us what are
we accomplishing why is that person making me feel bad
how can I make my save myself feel better by
stimulating myself with food drugs or some other sort of
addiction or just stimulation being entertainment so all of that
is external and then you have the internal and the
internal is how you're feeling how you're thinking and how
you're composing your thoughts and what was really amazing about
the meditations and instructive for me was the purpose that
it served so for Marcus the way that he used
the meditations because they were written to himself he basically
wrote this personal diary to himself he didn't intend anybody
else to read it and he himself would read it
on a daily basis and it would serve as a
refresher for him as to his higher ideals in the
way that he wanted to live so it was a
way for him to get back in touch with his
higher self with his values with his with the principles
by which he wanted to live his life and with
larger perspective I think the problem is that when you're
living in life and you're you're completely in meshed in
it and you're identified with all the problems that you're
having on a day to day basis you're so identified
with that that you lose sight of the bigger picture
of life like what is actually happening here you know
you lose sight of kind of the majesty of life
and also the shortness of life which is a which
is covered in depth it's like a recurring theme throughout
the meditations which is Marcus's attempt to really grapple with
death and to come to grips with it and to
not fear it I think that's a natural fear for
everybody so how how did the meditations work well really
there were there were two I think strands to it
two functions that it served one was to to put
it back in touch with this higher self like we
already said and the second was a consolation function so
it served as a way to console him when he
was feeling down or Unruh source phille or basically when
he had that tendency to go into his lower self
reading the meditations would prop him back up into the
higher so so if he was if he was struggling
because he got mad at somebody in lost his temper
because somebody was uh was not respecting him or was
trying to undermine him then that would that would throw
him off his track and he would use meditations to
put him back on that track or if something was
happening with politics that that he was having trouble handling
or in court life or you know he was an
emperor so he was also leader of the army so
military campaigns that were being waged that were causing problems
and there were some particular campaigns and we're really causing
Marcus or a lot of problems during that time with
rebellions up in up in the north in the Germanic
provinces and so whenever he was getting getting flustered by
all that stuff that was happening all that external stuff
the meditations would would bring him back to Center and
get him back in touch with the internal I think
it's a really valuable lesson because a lot of times
we tend to think that our problems are external and
that the solutions to our problems are external whereas in
fact a lot of that can be solved internally and
in fact it should be because it's very hard to
attain peace if that's something that you're looking for in
your life it's very hard to get that by always
looking for it out there what happens is you look
at it for out there and then eventually you realize
that you have to go inside to find it you
have to stabilize yourself I think what was most admirable
about Marcus was the kind of equanimity that he had
the kind of stability and just conscious self restraint and
if I was to sum up stoicism in in one
word I think it would be self restraint and I
don't mean that in a negative sense I mean in
a positive sense there's there's a sense in which when
you tell someone about stoicism and they hear that they
say well stoicism that isn't that's not something that we
should aspire to that's not something that's positive because it
in some way implies a lack of emotion and it
implies the person is rigid and stilted in robotic and
it also implies that if you're turning in within yourself
and your you're grounded and your your your internally focused
then how are you supposed to go out there and
achieve the big things you want to achieve how are
you supposed to be accomplished how are you supposed to
go and hold down a career how are you supposed
to manage raising a family and and all these other
goals that you might have that are practical and that
are out there in the real world they're not just
in your head well I think that is a simplistic
way to look at stoicism I think there's a lot
of depth there and there's definitely some stuff you can
draw from stoicism without going into it full bore so
one thing that you'll you'll notice right off the bat
the reason that Marcus is such a good example here
to use is that he wasn't just a some sort
of hermit philosopher living high in the mountains and and
and studying textbooks and then just spouting the stuff off
this guy is what you would consider in modern times
probably what up the president the United States would be
an equivalent position in modern times or the CEO of
some fortune 500 company this guy was responsible for a
lot he had a lot of mundane things happening in
his life that were that was drawing on his attention
so he had military campaigns to worry about he had
internal politics he had revolts and saboteurs to worry about
he also had his reputation to consider and the reputation
of his family he also had his own family he
had he was married he had children and all of
that was important to him and he was just a
normal guy like you or me but he was trying
to figure out how to make sense of all that
but also stay calm and grounded and peaceful in it
and also really stay true to his higher self so
here's the interesting thing is that if you're living your
life and you're happy the way you are right now
and you're happy chasing after the externals in life then
really there's no problem with that you can you can
keep doing that and Who am I to judge you
for doing that but I think there's something to be
said about always thirsting for the externals and chasing after
it because eventually what it does is it starts to
undermine you and your higher-self starts to feel neglected for
example you might have certain values that like you like
to live up to like honesty and positivity and contribution
to others things of that nature and maybe you're not
living up to those because what's happening is that your
lower self is dragging you down so it tends to
be that the case that the default position in life
is if you're just kind of going along with the
flow of life and you're living in modern society and
you're watching modern entertainment and you're listening to your friends
into your family what tends to happen is that you
kind of go with the flow and they'll go and
the go with the flow is that you're chasing after
externals you're you're valuing things that society values and a
lot of those things are pretty shallow so a lot
of those things are just entertainment or money or fame
or external success whether it's a shiny shiny new car
or house or whatever that might be and I'm not
discounting any of those things those things can be great
if that's what you're into but recognize that if some
part of you says that there's more to life that
you're not partaking in and you want more of that
and you also may be suffering a little bit because
you don't have enough of that that those higher ideals
that you're actually living up to then there's some lessons
to really be drawn from the meditations now what's really
cool is the meditations really need to be read so
I first of all I highly encourage you to read
them because of the mood of the words that Marcus
has I can't really do them justice by talking about
them this is just a little bit of analysis and
so my thoughts on it really go down further into
the article and read some of the excerpts I think
I did a pretty good job of summarizing the general
themes and I took a lot of excerpts out of
the book too to mention in the article so you
get a taste for it if you don't have time
to read the whole thing but I also encourage you
to actually buy the meditations and read it maybe even
a couple of times because as you do you really
get a sense of what the man's thinking was like
and what a stoic mindset is and also how different
probably from the way that you're thinking and it'll give
you some ideas about how to think differently about various
various things well let's let's talk about what the meditations
really covers there's a big focus on death and coping
with death and the prospect of death and how to
be calm and at ease with that I think that
a case can be made that a lot of stuff
that we do in life a lot of stuff that
we distract ourselves with like entertainment and fame and success
in some ways can be boiled down to to a
fear of death and not really wanting to face it
because even though it can be gloomy to think about
death like this the way that Marcus thinks about in
the meditations it's also a realistic way to think about
it because the way that Marcus thinks about is like
this ultimately your life is very short in the life
span of the whole universe your time on this earth
is just like a millisecond there it went it's gone
and everybody that you know all your friends all your
family your kids your kids kids one two three three
generations gone just like that in the life span of
the universe so really it's like dust it's like ash
it just blows away with the wind it doesn't matter
it's insignificant and your time you're so short but do
we really think about that do you think about that
everything every morning you wake up probably not right maybe
you think about it like once a year when when
you get in that kind of a pensive mood but
usually we don't think about that but the fact is
that this is this is reality right your life is
short this is this is just scientific fact and it
was apparent 2000's - as a parent 2000 years ago
as it is today maybe even more so because today
we're just distracted by a by all the titillation that
modern society offers and so we kind of lose track
of the the brevity of life and also as a
result we kind of lose track of our priorities too
because we kind of think that we have all this
time to do anything we want and that we can
just kind of wander around aimlessly and you know if
that's if you're happy with that if you want to
live that kind of life more power to you but
also I some of us most of us will sense
that if we live a life like that then on
your deathbed you're going to kind of regret it you're
going to regret not having lived up to those higher
ideals that the higher self has you're going to have
probably regret not being as honest as you were you're
probably going to regret not not living the virtues that
you want to live to you're probably going to regret
not having contributed more to society you're probably going to
regret for not having deeper relationships or not um or
just getting distracted by all the pettiness in life right
just on a day-to-day basis for Marcus it was no
different than it is for us like he would in
the missions he talks about how how he has to
restrain himself from getting sucked in to negative thinking or
from getting sucked in to thinking about how somebody said
something bad about him and how that's going to reflect
on his on his legacy or on his fame or
on his prestige or how people think about him but
ultimately what happens is that when he really thinks about
we digs into it he meditates on this stuff he
comes to find that none of that matters because how
important is the opinion of somebody else when that person
is gonna be dead in just the snap of a
finger you know Marcus is going to be dead and
then everybody that thought something bad about him is going
to be dead and all their children who they taught
bad things about Marcus too will be dead and soon
all that will be forgotten and all that will be
insignificant so worrying about it on some level is entirely
entirely trivial and all it does is it just a
jeté to so that is one topic death big topic
I think it's like an underpinner of everything else but
other topics that he talks about we already cover a
little bit of the this notion of the pettiness thinking
having petty thoughts and picking and concerning yourself with petty
things throughout the day that really distract you from your
core values so that one he also talks about how
to restrain yourself from desires certain desires that draw you
in but that might be unhealthy for you or bad
for you in the long run how to abstain from
those he also talks about topics like self-restraint and how
to how to cultivate self-restraint in oneself how to be
grateful about the things that you have in life how
to bring yourself to peace when you're agitated by things
and more topics basically along all of those lines how
to be calm when you're in pain so when you
have illness or how to cope with the death of
other people so Marcus was a family man he had
a family and wife he had children so how to
deal with that in in a composed kind of way
not to say that you just totally detach in your
robotic but that you deal it with with a certain
calmness and a certain empowerment rather than pulling your hair
out and throwing temper tantrums or getting mad at people
when they say things about you that you don't particularly
like so basically how to come out of how to
live up to virtues in life now what's interesting to
me about the meditations is that Marcus wrote them to
himself and he had to read them on a daily
basis to kind of bring himself back to his higher
self because here's the thing and it's interesting how the
human mind works like this is that we tend to
forget usually when we are in touch with our values
with our deepest values and our purpose in life we
get very excited and we see all the possibilities are
all the potential and we get starry-eyed and everything seems
great but then you wake up the next morning and
life has a way of just coming in and washing
over all that because your higher self even though that
voice is very powerful it's also very subtle and faint
and it can be easily overwhelmed by the background noise
and the background noise is all the external stuff right
because there's the internal voice this is the Higher Self
and then to some extent there's also an internal lower
self but then there's also like the back around noise
of society that it's kind of goading the lower self
on because it really feeds into it so this would
be advertising this might be your family and your friends
and what they're doing and what they think of you
this might be your co-workers and your your job this
might be media and what you're watching on television and
those values that are getting reinforced there and through marketing
commercials entertainment all of that good jazz so there's really
something to be said from disengaging yourself from that background
noise as much as possible so you can hear the
faint higher-self beat of your drum and then really march
to that beat rather than the beat of everyone else
or your own lower self beat and that tends to
be difficult to do so you need to keep reminding
yourself but it's really fascinating how your mind easily forgets
this in fact I could make the case that this
idea of forgetting for getting your higher purpose your values
is maybe one of the most challenging aspects of personal
development is why self development is so difficult and why
changing your habits is so difficult because a lot of
times we're just running on autopilot and it takes conscious
effort and awareness to to make changes in yourself because
if you're running on a certain routine all the time
you do that unconsciously and you don't need to engage
that higher self you don't need to listen to that
higher self to do that and really you don't need
to keep anything in in conscious memory up here like
your short to medium term memory you can call it
your ram so to speak if your ram gets filled
up then there's only so much of it so let's
say that you decide to start going to the gym
next week and you've never gone before all the sudden
that's a new thing that has to be sitting at
the forefront of your mind for you to do it
because if you don't put it in the forefront of
your mind you're gonna forget you're quite simply just gonna
forget you know it might be the case that you
make a resolution right now and the next Monday when
it comes time to go to that gym you're just
gonna you're just gonna sleep in or you're gonna you're
gonna you're going to go out and party with friends
or going to watch a movie in of going to
that gym not because you were lazy that certainly happens
a lot but simply because you forgot that it's even
on your agenda anymore how often has that happened to
you where you just forget to make the change that
you want to make with the gym maybe that's a
little bit less plausible because it's a pretty big kind
of commitment that you're making it's also quite noticeable but
if you're trying to make very subtle changes in your
behavior or in the way that you run your life
it can be a very pernicious problem because you simply
forget like one example that I had was that I
was working on eye contact and I was for a
long time had a problem with making eye contact with
people simply because when I was growing up I wasn't
very social I was a little bit shy lacked self-confidence
and so I didn't have good eye contact for example
just a simple thing when I'm you know when I'm
talking to a clerk at the store or a waitress
or or a friend I don't look them straight in
the eyes the way I want them to and that
that's not the kind of communication that I was happy
with so what i'd resolved to do is i really
wanted to build that stronger eye contact what I found
was that it's just such a subtle change because eye
contact is usually an unconscious thing if you're doing it
it's probably unconscious if you're not doing it it's also
probably unconscious and what I found was that I just
kept forgetting like it didn't it doesn't take that much
actual practice to develop solid eye contact that's not the
problem the problem where you slip up if you're trying
to do that is that you simply forget to be
doing it so maybe that first day or two you're
really going to make a conscious effort and every store
that you go to the every clerk you talk to
everyone you shake hands with you're going to really look
them straight in the eyes and you're gonna you're gonna
say yeah I'm going to do that and you can
remember to do that and while you're doing it you're
getting a little bit of you can kind of feel
that you're getting stronger with your eye contact becoming more
natural for you but you need to keep doing this
for weeks maybe even months to really to really lock
it in as a habit and make it something that's
that's again part of your your natural way of being
and but what happens is that after just a few
days of that conscious effort you know something else comes
and something else comes in and fills that RAM that
you have and all of a sudden this this notion
or this this idea that you had your higher-self idea
of developing better eye contact just gets just gets thrown
out and something else gets lodged in so maybe your
friends tell you about the new movie that's coming out
on Saturday and so now you're you're thrilled to go
to the new movie on Saturday and you forget to
do your eye contact practice that's Saturday and then the
next the next day you have something else come up
and you're too busy so you don't do it then
and then you just forget and then all of a
sudden two weeks pass and all of a sudden after
two weeks only then do you go oh what happened
to that eye contact thing I was working on I
totally forgot about that and all of a sudden you're
back at square one because you really haven't ingrained that
new behavior of yourself and that's just one example I
think that's kind of illustrative of how this works but
I see this I see this in my own life
in in so many other facets whether it's nutrition or
stuff I want to be doing in my career or
if I want to be reading more books and I'm
not doing that so any of this stuff that I
want to work on myself at if I don't if
I don't make the space for it in in the
forefront of my mind if my ram so to speak
then I'm not going to really get it done and
I think Marcus realized that on some level because for
him the meditations were in place as a tool to
counteract that right and it's interesting that the human mind
requires this it's not enough to just sit there come
up with a list of values come up with your
goals come up with a vision and then all the
sudden your life is on track no you have to
keep it on track every day right if you want
to be good at your career you have to be
practicing it every day if you want to be good
at speaking and eye contact you need be practicing that
all the time or whatever else and especially during those
critical phases where you're making the transition from not doing
it to doing it that's where even more effort is
required and so there's this theme with the meditations that
I think we can take away which is if you
want to really encourage your higher-self and you want to
be living up to it then find ways of reconnecting
to your values again and again and again and the
more you can do that the more you're going to
be living by them because otherwise it happens you're simply
going to forget let's say you value honesty if you
don't remind yourself every morning that honesty is something that
you want to live by well you might have some
situation that will come up throughout the day that means
that you can be dishonest and still get the short-term
a short-term benefit from that and what's gonna happen is
you can just you're going to choose the easy route
and you're going to choose that short term benefit because
you're not noting the values that you have there they're
very deep somewhere and you're in your brain and they're
not at the forefront of it so when you're doing
the meditations every morning as Marcus did you're bringing it
up and up and up and you're going to tend
to to see those things throughout your day so if
if you have a vision for yourself maybe there's a
new career that you want to move into or you
want to hit a certain way to the gym or
you want to be eating cleaner or you want to
have a better you want to you want to change
up your relationship so it's working more smoothly well you
need to focus your attention on that as consistently as
you can in order to get the the results that
you want otherwise what's going to happen is you're going
to go with the status quo and that's what you've
got right now so if you're happy with it great
but if you're not then there's probably some changes that
you got to put in place so besides besides this
idea that you really need to be bringing ideas to
the forefront of your mind I think what's really cool
about the meditations is that that second element that consolation
element that that I mentioned is that Marcus really takes
a lot of time to strengthen his inner self so
he really reminds himself of first of all all the
great things that he already has in life and how
blessed he is with everything that he has how happy
he is with the parents that he's had with upbringing
that he's had with the parents I mean uh with
the with with just all the opportunities they he's been
given in life and how that has shaped him and
so he takes to effort to to really bring that
back up into his attention because again if you're not
bringing what you already got and what you've already achieved
in your accomplishments back up into the forefront of your
mind at least once in a while what's gonna happen
is you're gonna take that stuff for granted and you
can be the most successful person on earth you can
be making millions of dollars and if right now it
might seem like well if I was making five million
dollars a year I would just be so ecstatic I'd
be so happy and if I had all the fame
that that some actors have I would be so happy
and my life would just be perfect but the fact
is that once you start getting a taste of that
maybe maybe there's something you do and you get a
little bit of Fame maybe there's something you do any
little bit of money maybe that's a five million maybe
you get a good you get a good job you
get a good raise whatever you start to see that
you know what where I am now is so much
better objectively speaking than where I was five years ago
but I don't actually feel much happier and what you'll
realize is you don't feel happier because you don't remind
yourself of that difference right now you might be sitting
in your you know in your in your two-bedroom apartment
in a relatively nice city in America and you might
be struggling with your job and you might be complaining
and whining that certain things in your life aren't right
and I encourage you to fix all that stuff but
on the other hand what happens when you zoom out
and you take the larger perspective on all that I
mean if you're living in America honestly you should be
your life should be already awesome and you should be
feeling very very grateful because think about the people that
are living in Africa they don't have anything even close
to what you have they don't have any of the
many's that we have any of the freedoms that we
have people living in countries and villages and tribes where
they have barely any access to clean water any shelter
just the basics of food and even stuff like protection
from government where chaos is is running rampant and you
are you actually have pretty high probability of getting shot
or stabbed or machete to death when you walk down
the street you know compare where you are right now
with that kind of scenario and all the sudden you
start to feel pretty good about your life right you're
suddenly all that that little problem that you have at
work with with your boss all of a sudden somewhat
insignificant almost makes you kind of feel bad about even
whining about it but I think this is important putting
stuff in perspective because if you think that you're just
gonna amass a bunch of things in your life houses
cars and money and jobs and even more if serial
things like Fame like you're going to become famous and
all that's gonna make you happy well I think there
are many many cases where were you that you can
read about in biographies and you know newspaper articles magazines
etc or just talking to people that will tell you
and confirm this this has been very well confirmed that's
not at all the case there's not a direct link
between just how much money and fame you have and
how happy you are and that in fact a lot
of times people that are mega successful in this in
the sort of cultural external sense like many musicians and
rock stars and actors are actually quite miserable because they
they are hooked on drugs and they use food and
other stimulation to to try to get happiness for themselves
because the money and the fame wasn't enough and so
Marcus I think has some good antidotes to this and
the antidote to that it really is is gratitude and
doing that consistently you can't just be grateful once this
is something you have to cultivate as a habit for
yourself in fact Marcus is a really negative view on
Fame he really he really kind of ridiculed it rather
meditations and in fact there's a little antidote about him
told about him that he hired a servant or a
slave at that time to basically follow him around throughout
the courtroom where he lived and the servant his only
job was to follow Marcus around and periodically he would
whisper in his ear you are only a man and
you will soon be dead too and so the reason
for this it's kind of striking ila I love that
that antidote is because it would it would get Marcus
to remember that he's no better even though he's an
emperor he's really no better than that his subjects right
and that more mortality is is a gift that he
has been given just like everyone else and that he
will be dead and soon all of all the things
he's done and everything he's written and all the good
deeds he's done in all the wars he's won all
that will be forgotten all that will be ash and
all the people that have that I've known about it
will be dead too and so ultimately what's what's the
point in chasing after that if it if it means
that you're going to sacrifice your higher ideals so what
else did I want to really say about the meditations
I think the ultimate lessons is that you can can
start changing your life by putting focus on your higher
self and the way to do that is well one
way to do it is to actually make your own
meditations don't do it with Markus's do it with your
own so maybe make a list of the things that
are really important to you what kind of goals do
you want to accomplish let's say over the next few
years what kind of values do you want to live
your life by and what kind of values make you
feel good is it helping other people is it being
honest is it having a lot of success in achievement
is it doing something that you're really passionate about you
know whatever those things are it can be anything write
those things down and come back to them very very
often so that you are seeing it in front of
your eyes and you're not forgetting about it also trying
to console yourself when you're feeling bad so if you're
feeling bad because someone said something bad about you having
some sort of principles written down a paper that you
can turn to is very effective strategy so if someone
said something nasty D at work and you come home
and you're all upset about it and you're thinking about
it you're ruminating about it and it's spoiling the rest
of your evening if you were to look at a
little piece of paper that told you all the important
things that were important to you in your life and
one thing on there would be would be that life
is short and that you really don't have time to
waste on pettiness and that well the time that you're
wasting right now ruminating about this argument that you had
at work or someone says something nasty about you maybe
that's the time you could go spend watching the sunset
or spending it with your loved ones or working on
something important maybe like helping people or working on that
business idea that you have or doing something just positive
overall maybe reading a book instead of ruminating on this
petty petty nonsense and so having those kinds of principles
that are guiding your life is is very powerful I've
actually tried this I went about 30 or 40 days
where I wrote out a list of things that were
important to me and every day in the morning I
would read through it you know it only takes about
five minutes and maybe pick one or two of those
points that you really want to focus on that day
so maybe that day you want to focus on being
nice to people and just you know tolerating all the
that they throw at you without getting upset so pick
that one and go through your day and see how
that feels or maybe it's going to be something something
else you know maybe there's going to be some other
principle like the fact that your life is short and
you're just going to focus on that for the day
and how is that going to change your life what
kind of things are you doing right now that you're
kind of tolerating you're telling yourself oh you know this
is fine I'm comfortable where I'm at right now whereas
in fact when I when you really have this idea
the forefront of your mind that your life is very
short and you don't have a lot of time to
get the stuff you want to get done then maybe
we're going to do is you're going to start thinking
your brain is going to start thinking of ways to
get the stuff that you want done so if you
have that business idea maybe your brain will start getting
jogged up and start actually contemplating ways to make it
happen rather than just dream about it right or maybe
if if you wanted to start that diet that you've
been putting off maybe now you'll start to realize that
well I got to start it now or never so
think about that think about what your values are think
about what kind of meditations you could be doing and
go ahead and read through the rest of the article
here and just get a sense just kind of get
a sense of what stoic philosophy is like and what
a amazing individual a Roman Emperor from 2,000 years ago
the way he thought and the way that he managed
his life and also ran the Roman Empire alright that's
it for today peace out you
