hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to use
psychedelics for personal development warning the information provided here is
strictly for educational and harm reduction purposes only I am
NOT responsible or liable for any damage that you caused
yourself while using psychedelics these substances can potentially be very
dangerous and even lethal so make sure that if you
do decide to experiment with them that you do so
very carefully and very responsibly there are two main aims
that I have for this episode which is to talk
about how to use psychedelics safely I'm going to give
you lots of tips for safe use of psychedelics and
also how do you use them not just for fun
or for exploration but for actual self actualization work so
we're going to cover both these topics in a lot
of depth let me be clear before we even get
into that what I mean by psychedelics and what I
don't mean by psychedelics when I say psychedelics I don't
mean any of the following I don't mean weed I
don't mean crack I don't mean mess I don't mean
coke and I don't mean even MDMA or ecstasy or
Molly I do not consider these true psychedelics so when
you're hearing me use that word make sure you don't
misunderstand me and take it as license to go do
[ __ ] crack or meth that is not what
I'm telling you to do so then what do I
mean by psychedelics I mean things like psilocybin which is
magic mushrooms I mean LSD I mean DMT I mean
mescaline or peyote I mean ayahuasca which is basically also
DMT I mean I boga or ibogaine I mean the
class of chemicals called to see - X there's like
to see B to see P and other variations of
the to see class chemicals that's basically what I mean
by psychedelics there's not that many of them just a
handful of them these are the ones that are very
useful for you in the realm of exploring your consciousness
the other stuff is more recreational and is more for
fun and that's not really what I'm interested in talking
to you about so speaking of that let's talk about
some distinctions we want to make of the different ways
in which psychedelics can be used so this is very
helpful for you to make this distinction it's a four
part distinction so the first part is using psychedelics for
fun or for escape that's one way that psychedelics can
be used and in fact this is probably the most
common way that psychedelics are used I'd probably estimate off
the top my head that probably 90% of all psychedelics
are used for this purpose to have fun to see
some nifty experiences to escape from the problems of your
life this is when you go to a rave or
a party with your friends and people they're just passing
around stuff and you try some of that or you
go to a music festival and you get some substance
you're not even sure what it is but you take
it anyways to have fun and to listen to music
and to feel love for people and and all this
kind of stuff that is not what I'm talking about
here that is not going to produce meaningful growth for
you alright so be very careful there that's the first
distinction the second distinction is people like to use these
psychedelic substances for what I would call naive spirituality what
is this what it is is people have many ideological
and dogmatic beliefs about what reality is and what spirituality
is and what God is and all these kinds of
things they like to think of themselves as quote unquote
spiritual people and so what they do is they take
these substances these substances produced in them all sorts of
very powerful visions these visions are in a sense a
reflection of your own sub just mind so if you
have beliefs about Jesus or Muhammad or the Buddha or
you know whatever beliefs you have maybe you've got shamanic
beliefs maybe you've got beliefs about spirits and ghosts and
stuff or your ancestors and then you take one of
these substances and then all the sudden you come face-to-face
with Jesus and then you come out of that trip
and then you actually believe I met Jesus and that
this proves that Jesus is real and then everything that
Jesus taught was correct and so what it does is
that the experience the very powerful experience you have on
this substance it reinforces all your existing models of reality
and that can be a very very dangerous trap because
basically you're deluding yourself right you're feeding that kind of
naive spiritualism that you've got going that's not what I'm
advocating with these substances in fact that's a very dangerous
trap that I want to point out to you the
third way that psychedelics can be used is for therapy
or for addiction recovery now this is quite a legitimate
Avenue to go down in fact there's a lot of
research being done right now in universities in various countries
from the US to Canada to Mexico where people and
institutions are using psychedelics very effectively for addiction recovery hardcore
addiction recovery like lifelong alcoholism or heroin addictions treating those
very effectively with psychedelics also they can be used for
therapy of various kinds for example if you have a
depression if you have anxiety if you have phobias if
you have childhood traumas that are plaguing you from your
past then psychedelics in a therapeutic setting used with a
professional who knows what he's doing that's helping you out
that can be very effective but I'm not going to
cover that angle here I might talk about that in
the future in other episodes simply because that's not really
what we're doing here with actualized org what we're interested
in is the fourth way of using psychedelics which is
for personal development for expanding your awareness and your consciousness
and as an aid to doing non-duality work non-duality is
basically working towards enlightenment so if you're following me on
that and you're working everyday you're doing self inquiry and
so forth you're meditating you're investigating aspects of yourself and
your ego and how those are functioning in your life
but you know that's a very tough road to go
down that's not an easy thing to do you could
spend years doing that stuff and get very little progress
because it can be very challenging especially if your mind
is closed to some of the very radical possibilities that
you need to be open to experiencing so this is
where the psychedelics can come in and be very powerful
because they can open your eyes to new possibilities not
that you buy a vision of Jesus but that your
eyes are now open and you can see oh my
present everyday beliefs and worldview is so limited until I
took this substance and also you don't have to use
it just for non-duality you can also use it to
gain insights in your life like insights about a relationship
you have or insights about the direction you want to
take your business in or insights about some challenging problem
you're working on at work like maybe you've got a
creative challenge a technical challenge a business challenge whatever that
is these substances could open your mind so much that
you know you get these very powerful insights coming in
and those can be very helpful also you can do
personal develop in very small ways like they can help
you to get rid of certain bad habits that you
have or to install good habits they can get you
to see the power of meditation so maybe if you've
been struggling with establishing a meditation habit maybe you take
some mushrooms and then all the sudden you see like
wow this is amazing how can i attain this without
the mushrooms and then it's like oh well yeah of
course a meditation habit would be a good idea and
now all the sudden you're motivated to go do that
so that's what I want to talk about now what
are the keys to using psychedelics and to actually get
growth out of them not just for fun here are
my tips for that firstly you want to under take
this with a methodical approach it's not that you're just
gonna go take a random mushroom at a friend's party
because he hasn't happened he happens to have one and
you just take it pop it and then whatever comes
comes and then you're done and then you're like well
I know what mushrooms are no you want to take
a very methodical approach what you're really aiming towards with
psychedelic substances is to get a breakthrough dose which enables
a breakthrough experience when you first start taking psychedelics you
should start with small doses and build your way up
methodically until you get to the breakthrough dose for that
particular substance and then you can try that with various
substances but that should be your approach your approach should
not be to try one substance one time it should
be to try these substances to really see where these
substances can take you a lot of times people say
well leo you know I've tried I tried some mushrooms
one time or I tried some LSD one time when
I was a teenager at a party and you know
it was a terrible experience and so now I would
never touch that stuff again but see that's very different
than what I'm talking about you tried it in the
wrong setting at the wrong age when you were not
emotionally or cognitively mature and you don't even know what
you took exactly you don't know how much of it
you took you had some sort of bad experience you
don't know how you interpreted it you had no education
you have no foundation you had no research done you
didn't understand psychology or non-duality or any of these things
and so yeah you had a bad experience but that
tells you nothing about the power of mushrooms if you
were really to take a methodical approach to start with
small doses and carefully work your way up to the
large doses and to actually have a breakthrough mystical experience
that would be something very very different than what you
experienced in high school when you were playing around with
mushrooms education and research is the next tip people when
they try this stuff they don't do nearly enough education
and nearly enough research into the entire field of psychedelics
there's so much to research there there's interesting medical studies
to research there's reports from people to read both the
good ones and the bad ones you've got to research
what the substance is every substance you want to take
you how to research it understand what it is understand
the problems the side effects the complications it can have
to know how often you can take it to know
the kind of experiences you can expect from it see
this requires weeks and months of research but most people
who do psychedelics sometimes they just take a second or
even know what this thing is they just take LSD
and in their trip report I'm reading their trip report
and it just says I don't even know what else
do you want I just took a five tabs and
there it is that's preposterous that's that's that's a recipe
for having terrible experiences and for not getting out of
grow any growth out of this process so you need
to do lots of research also the next tip is
you got to set a serious intention what do you
want out of your trip every trip you have to
want something out of it not that your neurotically controlling
the trip which would also be bad you want to
surrender to the experience but also you want to set
a serious intention so maybe you're after truth maybe you
want to know what reality is maybe you're interested in
what consciousness is maybe you're interested in enlightenment maybe you're
interested in figuring out some sort of psychological problem in
your life like maybe you have social anxiety and you
want to fix that or maybe you have fear around
money and you want to fix that or maybe you've
got a problem in your marriage and you want to
fix that so you set that intention when you're going
into the trip and then that helps to get you
the insights that you're looking for that will actually be
useful in your everyday life see then it goes beyond
just being an interesting psychedelic experience all these psychedelic experiences
they're all temporary they all pass but what can last
is the the insights that you gained during that experience
those can stay with you forever also what's necessary is
to study and to practice psychological principles the ones that
I teach you with all my content from actualise org
the big problem with psychedelic users in general that I
see from reading a lot of their trip reports is
that they have no understanding of the principles of human
psychology they don't know how the mind works they have
a lot of inner demons they're using these substances to
escape from their inner demons to find relief and these
substances you know what they do is they open your
mind they open up your subconscious mind to the depths
of what's in there and a lot of people have
a lot of inner demons in there which all come
pouring forth and then of course that produces bad trips
so you have to start to study the stuff that
I'm teaching you with actualized Org like study what happiness
is study what anger is study what depression is study
and understand what addiction is studied understand the ego in
the self and how that works study self-deception study and
research what thoughts are there's a lot to learn here
once you do this kind of study and you also
start to practice it in your daily life what happens
is that then you develop this foundation which grounds you
when you go on your trip then it's hard for
you to freak out because you understand like oh yeah
this is just something that's happening in my brain you
know I'm having these kinds of thoughts I understand the
thoughts aren't actually real I understand that even visual phenomenon
aren't ultimately real and so this lets you kind of
calm down and enjoy the trip rather than be freaking
out also you need to study non-duality this is very
critical if you don't make a study of non-duality or
enlightenment what's going to happen is you're going to see
very powerful visions like I said before these these visions
could seem religious in nature to you or very spiritual
in nature to you and you're going to get lost
in the phenomena of the vision you're not going to
understand how your own mind is constructing this and you're
not going to be able to deconstruct what the psychedelics
construct for you and you're not going to be able
to to really pierce through all that and to see
what's really important during these trips which is the way
that your awareness and consciousness works if you understand if
you truly understand conceptually what enlightenment is you're going to
have a much much better time during your trips because
you're going to be very very grounded and you're not
going to get lost in a illusory phenomenon also very
important that you set up a daily meditation practice that's
going to be huge for grounding you in these experiences
and also a self inquiry practice I have episodes that
show you how to do both of these self inquiry
is what you're doing to reach enlightenment it's questioning what
you are as a existential being if you set up
these practices then the psychedelics you take will Wow they'll
supercharge your meditation and they'll supercharge your self inquiry and
they'll motivate you even more to meditate even harder and
they'll motivate you even more to self-inquiry even deeper and
that's going to be a huge benefit you get which
most like Edel users completely miss out on because of
course they don't meditate and they don't do self inquiry
they don't even know what these things are the next
tip I have for you is you need a quiet
and safe setting if you want to get growth out
of your trips don't do it at a party don't
do at a festival don't do it with a bunch
of friends who are noisy and loud and who are
distracting you I'm talking about doing this mostly solo work
you're sitting alone late at night in your house or
in the morning or whatever and you take this substance
and you're going deep inside yourself to explore your own
subconscious mind to explore consciousness and to explore the ego
the self and how all that works and you're doing
it in a very palpable way because these experiences are
so powerful right but you need to have a clear
mind as you're going in there you need to be
undistracted by things so very quiet very comfortable setting is
required and a lot of bad trips occur mostly because
the setting is completely inappropriate to what these substances are
are supposed to be used for if you're in a
noisy festival setting what can you expect it's very easy
to get a terrible trip because there's all these random
factors that are add your control there loud noises there
are people distractions god knows what could happen also it's
very important that you don't get seduced by the phenomena
and the emotions of these trips these trips can really
open you up emotionally you can feel loved like you've
never felt before you can feel joy and bliss that
you've never even imagined you can see things that you
couldn't imagine your wildest dream you could see aliens you
could see other beings you could see uh you know
creatures from fairytales you could see God you can see
Jesus you can see Buddha and all this kind of
stuff but wow there's such huge potential for self-deception there
it's so easy to delude yourself so if you want
to actually get growth rather than delusion and regression you
have to be able to see through these phenomena as
reflections of your own unconscious mind and to not take
them too seriously and lastly I would say that my
biggest tip for you to get growth out of your
trips is to leave time after the trip plenty of
time to integrate what you experienced sometimes a trip can
be so powerful that you will need an entire day
the following day after your trip to just sit and
not do anything but just to reflect and to think
about it because it was so deep and you need
to think about what does this mean for my life
what does this mean for my career what does it
mean for my family what does it mean for my
finances and all this kind of stuff that's super valuable
if you just take some LSD you have a raising
experience but then the next day at 6 a.m. you
have to wake up and go to work you're going
to lose a lot of this these insights that you
should be integrating that integration is actually where your mind
is changing permanently you see that's super powerful so make
sure that you're leaving the time to integrate what I
recommend is that actually if you're going to do psychedelics
do them on Saturdays if you have a standard nine-to-five
job and you're working Monday through Friday the best time
to do a psychedelic I think is on Saturday logistically
because you can spend all of Saturday doing your trip
and great then you can spend the the end of
Saturday night integrating and then even Sunday morning and Sunday
afternoon you could spend most of that time relaxing and
integrating all the lessons that you've learned you could even
have a journal a diary that you keep where you
write down all your biggest insights and all that stuff
that's super valuable because if you just do it on
Sunday night Monday you got to go back to work
and that's gonna lose you some personal development right there
so those are my keys for the self-actualization now let's
talk about how to do it safely so if you've
never done psychedelics before or even if you have let
me show you how to do it safely because what
I see is that people who are even very experienced
psychedelic users huh make a lot of very very stupid
and obvious mistakes a lot of the stuff that I'm
going to say is just very obvious but still they
don't observe these rules and so of course they create
very bad trips and then they don't get any growth
either to get growth you first need safety you're not
going to get much growth without safety so here are
the safety basics first of all do tons of research
on every chemical that you intend to put in your
body read trip reports read and research the dosages you
should know what is a threshold dose threshold means when
it's just going to start to take effect on you
what's the cut like a light dose what's a normal
dose what's a heavy dose and what's an ultra heavy
dose for every substance that you're going to take you
need to know that so go do the research and
don't look it up in one place cross-reference different places
where people talk about dosages so that you are confident
that the dose that you're going to take is not
going to be some sort of heavy dose when you
first start also research the negative complications and problems that
people experience on these substances you want to make sure
that there's nothing you don't know about these substances also
of course use a reputable source to acquire your substance
whether that means making it yourself which means that you're
you're guaranteed to know what's in there or getting it
from someone that you really know the purity is going
to be high in the item that you're going to
be putting in your body purity is super important don't
be cheap either you don't want to be saving ten
twenty bucks and getting the cheapest thing possible you want
to be getting the most pure form of this stuff
you can take so that you minimize any potential health
problems and any freak out fear experiences you know if
you're consuming a substance that you know is not pure
or you're not sure what the purity is just imagine
psychologically what that does to you once you put it
in your body that could scare the [ __ ]
out of you just that alone could cause a bad
trip I would caution you to avoid taking pills of
any kind of psychedelic take the psychedelic in pure powdered
form because pills could be mixed with all sorts of
fillers you don't know what's in there they're notoriously impure
also I would caution you against using research chemicals too
much and experimenting with the whole field of various research
chemicals available out there because these chemicals they could not
be designed for human consumption and you can get yourself
into some some real trouble with taking these research chemicals
so be very careful you don't really need them stick
with the classic proven psychedelics that work like LSD psilocybin
mescaline so forth right you don't need to go try
weird untested chemicals that's just asking for trouble also avoid
substances called n-bombs they can cause death and all sorts
of health problems if taken too often use drug testing
kits on every batch of new substance that you have
drug testing kits are available online they're relatively inexpensive you
can buy them legally and what they allow you to
do is they allow you to to test a little
quantity of the substance that you have they allow you
to test it for whether it really is the thing
that you think it is you can even test certain
substances for purity for example you're gonna be taking MDMA
you definitely want to test it for purity because MDMA
is notoriously impure notoriously if you think you've taken MDMA
before chances are you haven't you probably have taken a
substance that isn't even MDMA so test kits are very
important and make sure you test every new batch of
substance don't just assume that if you got one batch
and it was pure that now you're going to be
getting each batch this can be just as pure that
would be a bad assumption start with small doses so
here is where probably most of the bad trips happen
is because people take a substance that they've never tried
before but they take it in way too large of
a dose because they haven't researched proper dosages and or
because they've already done other substances and they assume that
like well you know I've done mushrooms so I can
just handle LSD I'll just take a huge dose of
LSD because I already know how to handle mushrooms and
then from that can happen a very bad trip so
you want to make sure you've started to small dosages
because you're putting a foreign substance into your body if
you've never done this substance before and you put a
large dose in there think about how freaked out you're
going to be when this substance starts to take effect
that alone will potentiate terrible trips because it's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy you take a substance you don't know what
it really is you've never done it before you've taken
a relatively large dose you know all this and now
you're sitting there and this substance is starting to take
effect on you and you don't know where this is
going to take you and now you're starting to freak
out and to have all this panic and fear but
because I mean because you weren't intelligent in the way
that you you did this right if you started with
a small dose then you wouldn't have that kind of
panic and fear and then you wouldn't have the terrible
trips of course to have the right dosages you need
to have an accurate scale by yourself a very accurate
milligram scale thousandth of a gram down to a thousand
to the gram this is a high precision scale they're
relatively expensive you can buy one for $30 on Amazon
but it's it blows my mind that when I read
trip reports from people that they don't even use a
scale I'm not even talking about a milligram scale they
don't use a scale at all sometimes to measure out
their substance this is the stupidest thing you can do
invest in a $30 scale take only this substance buy
yourself at home when you're starting off I do not
recommend you invite friends over and have a party that's
not what this is about take it by yourself if
you want and you need security then invite one other
person as a trip sitter who will be there with
you but when you're taking a new substance by yourself
don't also be taking it somewhere like in a park
or in the middle of a city or at a
restaurant or at a party or at a club or
at a festival or even in the forest because you
don't know what's going to happen on this substance you
know you might need to throw up you might need
to make an emergency call you might get hungry the
trip might last for 12 hours if you're in the
woods for 12 hours late into the night you know
that's going to create problems for it so start doing
it at home always start at home where you're the
most safe and the most secure where there's least variables
involved where everything is very constant and stable test it
out there and once you can handle that and you
really get familiar with the substance and then if you
want you can go do it in the forest or
something fine doing it by yourself I think is the
best because it really allows you to focus there's no
distractions of course there's risk with that but hey you
know this whole process has risk in it clean your
house as well before you consume the substance make sure
that your life is put together make sure that you're
not taking this substance and as you're taking it you
have all these nagging problems like you didn't do your
laundry your dishes are dirty your toilet is dirty uh
you got work tomorrow you got a huge project at
work tomorrow the kids are nagging you you know you
got some important appointment to go to in five hours
all this kind of stuff all this kind of pressure
on you get your life in order in fact set
aside the entire day for this experience so that you
can prepare for it you can experience it fully without
being rushed and then you can integrate everything that happens
a clean house is a is just a very good
like basic foundation hi dangerous objects in your house so
if you have handguns weapons ninja swords kitchen knives this
kind of stuff what I do just in case is
I take all that stuff and I I just kind
of tuck it deep into my closet so that I
wouldn't be tempted to ever go in there and reach
for it and play around there any of that kind
of stuff so hide the dangerous objects you don't want
to have a handgun lying around while you're doing one
of these trips also stock your refrigerator with food and
drinks because on these trips these true can last for
six hours even 12 hours you know I think a
long hard LSD trip will last you 12 hours so
during this time you're probably gonna get hungry you're gonna
get thirsty and what you don't want to do is
you don't want to be like oh I'm hungry let
me just get in my car and drive to the
grocery store while I'm trippin you don't want that so
have all that stuff prepared already in your fridge have
all the food already prepared so you're not preparing food
you're not cooking you're not using sharp knives and pots
and pans and frying oil while you're tripping you see
just like from very basic safety precautions have like sandwiches
prepared or whatever you want have a fruit salad or
something have a vomit bucket nearby too when you're tripping
because some of these substances will make you vomit and
you don't wanna be vomiting on your couch and sometimes
you might be tripping so hard you can't even make
it to the bathroom so have a plastic bucket there
near you for vomiting also I recommend that you meditate
prior to doing the trip immediately prior so spend half
an hour to an hour meditating right before you're about
to take the substance this will put you in a
nice calm state of mind it'll slow your breathing slow
your heart rate it allow you to focus on your
intention the thing that you want to accomplish with this
trip and it'll turn it almost into like a ritual
so that you know that you're not doing this just
for fun and you're not just taking it on the
on a whim like oh yeah I think I'll just
do some mushrooms boom it's like no I've thought about
this I've planned it all out my whole day is
planned out I've meditated I know what I'm doing I'm
conscious I'm not using this as some escape or to
like run away from a relationship that I don't want
to be involved in right now you know so meditate
and then consume the substance on an empty stomach not
ravenous hungry but on an empty stomach because that will
minimize your chances of nausea and vomiting but you also
don't want to be ravenous because if you're so ravenous
that you take the substance but then you're still hungry
then that's going to take your attention off from the
work you need to be doing when you're in the
trip so maybe eat a little bit of food one
or two hours before the trip like a little piece
of fruit or something something very very light so that
you're not hungry but your stomach is still empty I
think it's very important you don't rush yourself in this
process like I said set aside a whole day and
I think that the best time to do the psychedelics
is around noontime not in the evening because a lot
of these psychedelics can give you a six to twelve
hour trip think about it if it's 8 p.m. and
you take some LSD and that's going to last you
for 12 hours and you took it at 8 p.m.
when are you going to sleep probably like by 6:00
the next morning because you're going to have the trip
and then you're gonna have to come down from the
trip you're gonna have all the excitement and all the
insights from the trip you're not going to be able
to sleep so if you take it at noontime though
that will give you plenty of time for the whole
day to experience everything you've got experience and then you'll
go to bed at your normal time you won't screw
up with your sleep schedule you won't be tired and
hungover the next day right so plan this out set
aside the whole day turn it into a ritual and
I also recommend that the week before you do any
psychedelics that you uh Nick yourself from stimulation so try
not watching TV that week try not watching a lot
of movies or doing a lot of web browsing and
surfing because all that stuff fills your mind right if
you watch a lot of TV news and you spend
a whole week watching TV news of terrorism and and
rapists and pedophiles and Wars and all this kind of
stuff and politics and then on Saturday you pop some
LSD or whatever don't be surprised if some of those
some of those themes recur in your trips because after
all it's a reflection of the stuff that's bubbling in
your um conscious mind and also by addicting yourself una'
dicta your self from the stimulation this lets you really
be honest with yourself about how you're using these substances
are you using this substance as a form of stimulation
is it becoming a new addiction for you are you
taking mushrooms just because you're bored and you got nothing
else to do because that's not what I'm telling you
to do here fact I'm telling you to do the
opposite use your psychedelic trip experiences as actually part of
your entire personal development journey where you're gonna dick ting
yourself from bad food and from bad entertainment and from
bad stimulation from bad information that end of itself will
be huge growth for you if you can just clean
your whole week up and then do your trip and
you're doing that as preparation for your trip and you
keep doing that week after week after week that alone
will now produce a much better life for you even
after you stop all the psychedelics you'll be like oh
look it's so nice to be clean of bad food
and bad TV and bad other stuff see also make
sure that if you're going to do psychedelic that day
that you're in a good mood that day if you've
been planning your trip and then that date rolls around
and say Saturday rolls around and for some reason you
got some bad news let's say someone called you and
said your friend died or something and now you're feeling
terrible and now you tell yourself well you know what
I'm gonna just do some mushrooms anyways cuz I was
already planning to do it that would be a bad
idea being a good positive cheery mood if you're in
a depressive mood don't do it that day wait a
few days wait a week let it pass also if
you've got some very important kind of like nerve-wracking stuff
that you're working on that week let's say you have
a huge project at work that's due two weeks from
now and you know you're crunching on it you're working
really hard on it there's problems there are creative challenges
all this kind of stuff you're stressed about it and
then you decide to just say oh you know I'm
just gonna do some mushrooms this Saturday that's probably not
a good idea right wait till your project is Oh
ever do it when you're calm do it when you're
peaceful and you're happy don't make it harder on yourself
if you do that if you do it while you're
happy and your are in great mood it should take
you the mushrooms whoever you're taking should take you just
like to a stratospheric level of good mood don't invite
friends over I highly discourage this because you're just going
to be chatting [ __ ] with your friends or
going to be gossiping you're going to be distracting yourself
with all sorts of stuff also don't be playing the
television while you're tripping and I even recommend not to
play music experience the substance naturally without any other additives
even music now some people disagree with me because they'll
say but Leo you know music I love music I
love tripping on music it's so important to my trip
you can do that later after you become experienced you've
really tried it out you've had a breakthrough experience on
this particular substance and then you want to incorporate some
music in there fine but if you're trying your first
time you don't need music blaring in your ears because
you don't know what kind of effect it could have
it's very important you don't mix drugs and you don't
mix up your psychedelics with other stuff such as alcohol
or weed the combination of a psychedelic plus alcohol or
weed could be a disastrous trip it's hard to predict
exactly what results will happen from the combination if you're
doing mushrooms for example do not do we eat and
do not do alcohol at the same time because this
is what creates most of the bad trips on mushrooms
if you're tempted to mix and combine substances together that
is telling you that you're not probably doing it for
personal development you're doing it for recreation and you're doing
it for escape because if you just take one substance
that should be plenty enough for you know just LSD
is plenty enough to have incredible experiences and just mushrooms
is plenty enough you don't need anything for it if
you're trying to mix [ __ ] together then what
are you doing that for probably to get some sort
of new kick new high but that's not why you
should be doing this in the first place also be
careful with cross tolerance these substances psychedelics are generally not
addictive but they do lose their potency with time if
you use them too often uh stuff like mushrooms mescaline
LSD these all have cross tolerance which means that if
you take mushrooms this week and then the next day
you want to take some LSD and the next day
you want to take some mescaline each trip after the
first is going to be weaker and weaker and weaker
given the same dosage and your body's going to build
up tolerance and your trips are going to be weaker
and and worse so you don't want that what I
recommend is a good rule of thumb to avoid cross
tolerance is to wait two weeks in between trips this
is about what it takes to remove all the tolerance
you build up after mushrooms or mescaline or something like
LSD right just to be on the safe side also
it's nice to have this kind of rule in place
so that you are kidding yourself about the fact that
your may be developing a psychological addiction even though these
substance are not physically addictive of course anything in the
world not just these substances can be psychologically addictive most
likely that would happen because your normal life sucks and
you love these amazing higher consciousness experiences that you experience
on psychedelics and so you want to escape from your
shitty life into these amazing experiences and if you're going
to do that on a daily or even on a
weekly basis that's not going to be growing you that's
actually going to be regressing you you don't want to
be escaping from your everyday life in fact you want
to be having the trip coming back to everyday life
and then being more in love with your everyday life
if that's not happening for you then you're doing something
wrong I would say that at the most once a
week no more than once a week don't do psychedelics
more than once a week if you're doing it more
than once a week you've probably developed an addiction when
you're actually in the trip how do you make sure
it's a good trip it's actually very simple the number-one
rule is to surrender fully to the experience and if
you're doing all this proper like I said then you
can also remind yourself that you're not going to die
because if you did all the stuff that I said
you followed every one of these guidelines then there is
virtually no chance that you will die during your trip
and that's a good thing to know because then that
can calm you down nothing freaks you out more than
the thought oh [ __ ] what did I just
take I'm going to die I killed myself i poisoned
myself nothing will freak you out more than that right
that's why you want to observe all the safety guidelines
so you remind yourself that you're not going to die
remind yourself that the trip is going to pass that
all this stuff is just temporary and remind yourself to
relax your body open your whole body up especially when
you're starting to fear any feel any kind of fear
or panic setting in because you may be you're you
feel like you're going down some negative flop spiral right
and you think they call me and my trip is
going to get so bad because I'm just I'm thinking
about this bad relationships and I'm thinking about my money
problems or whatever and you're just you kind of you're
starting to spiral downward if that's happening to you just
remember that your body can control what your thoughts are
doing and the emotions you're feeling start breathing nice and
slow and steady and calm and just open up pull
your hands out spread your legs uncross your legs and
uncross your arms and just lay there and surrender your
whole body and your mind as much as you can
to the experience no matter what happens if you do
that that should stop any kind of negative spirals that
you're done going to go down and also remind yourself
that no phenomena are real if you're seeing some kind
of aliens if you're seeing some kind of like nightmare
scenario during your trip just yeah keep reminding yourself that
these are just phenomena their visual or their auditory sensations
or their thoughts in your mind this is why it's
really good to be an experienced meditator and to study
non-duality because then you you've already started to deconstruct these
things in your everyday experience and so you will be
able to keep deconstructing them when you're going into your
trip and lastly what I'll tell you as a as
a huge warning as a huge warning and a huge
tip is do not mistake psychedelics as a shortcut for
self-actualization and do not mistake psychedelics is a shortcut to
enlightenment from everything I've researched and all the people I've
talked to and I've talked to some very enlightened people
about this issue my understanding is that you will never
reach enlightenment through psychedelics never never ever ever ever the
problem though is that when people know about enlightenment and
then they do a psychedelic and they have some kind
of powerful experience on the psychedelic it's extremely tempting to
say oh that's enlightenment now I'm enlightened but that's not
enlightenment you can't even fathom what enlightenment is enlightenment is
so radical uh your mind can't even imagine it it's
more radical than seeing aliens all right if aliens came
and abducted you and flew you to another galaxy to
their home planet and showed you their city and showed
you everything that's going on there that experience would be
less radical than enlightenment because you can at least imagine
what aliens are like you see them in the movies
you can imagine what a new galaxy looks like you
know what a galaxy is you can imagine new planet
because you know this planet and you can imagine an
alien city because you've probably seen some in the movies
right I know enlightenment you can't imagine it's such a
radical thing that there's like there's no words that describe
it and the only way you're going to reach it
is by doing the really truly hard self inquiry in
regular everyday life boring old life not in some sort
of fantasy realm with elves and goblins and and Jesus
right that is not enlightenment those can be very powerful
experiences they can really open your eyes but remember to
come on back to the everyday world where in the
everyday world you will continue to do the work use
these mystical experiences you have during your trips as fuel
as motivation to do the hard work in everyday life
that you otherwise probably wouldn't have done because these trips
can open your eyes and open your mind to possibilities
that you would have never been open to in a
million years if you were just living your everyday life
I recognize that psychedelics have a huge potential for delusion
and what I'm talking about here is I am NOT
giving you license to use these experiences to fuel your
delusions or to fuel your existing webs of beliefs whatever
religion you hold do not use these experiences to justify
your religion do not use it to justify your ideologies
do not use it to justify your notions of being
enlightened already that's a very very dangerous trap make sure
you remember not to do this because these experience are
so powerful that they will just sweep you off your
feet cognitively emotionally physically all of that and I don't
want you coming back to me and writing me comments
like Leo I saw Jesus and now I know everything
no actually you're probably just deluded so be very careful
