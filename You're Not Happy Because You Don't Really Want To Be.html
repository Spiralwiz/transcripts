hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I want to explore the question with you of
whether you really want to be happy why aren't you
happy in your life it's an interesting question do you
realize yet that you are not happy in your life
have you acknowledged that to yourself some people even hide
that fact from them but hopefully you're aware enough to
realize that you're not happy in your life otherwise we
wouldn't be here having this discussion so the question is
why are you not happy and I want to submit
a pretty crazy possibility to you which is that you
simply don't want to be happy you actually do not
want to be happy and that sounds quite twisted and
it would sound like well Leo why would I do
that to myself why would I purposefully torture myself like
that and and yes you're interesting let's take a look
at that why do you do that to yourself well
let me put it to you this way if I
ask you the question do you really want to be
unconditionally happy can you honestly say yes to that take
this question seriously don't just kind of like say oh
yeah of course of course leo it's obvious I do
everyone does doesn't everyone no that's not obvious do you
really want to be unconditionally happy let's explore what that
really means if you say yes because most people what
they want and what they're pursuing in life is they're
pursuing conditional happiness so everyone almost everyone says yes to
conditional happiness but I'm asking you unconditional happiness conditional happiness
let's contrast and compare these two so conditional happiness this
means that everything goes your way and then you're happy
so that's easy everybody tries to do it that way
that's what you've been doing your whole life the problem
is it doesn't really work why doesn't it work well
think about it it's actually very very logical on practical
everyday terms right easy to understand why not what do
you need to be conditionally happy means you need oxygen
you need clean water you need good food you need
sex you need shelter you need husband or a wife
you need a good family you need to have fun
you need entertainment you need a cell phone you need
this you need that you need all these things hundreds
maybe even thousands of things need to be happening in
your life every single second and every single minute and
every single hour and every single day of your entire
life and as soon as it's not happening at any
one point there then what happens you are no longer
happy why not well because you selected conditional happiness that's
what conditional happiness is is happiness when everything goes perfectly
your way and it's unhappiness when something doesn't go your
way and of course you know to get a thousand
things perfectly aligned every single second of every single day
well what are the odds of that happening pretty low
right because the universe is a chaotic place and stuff
happens that you don't want to happen so that's conditional
happiness that's easy enough what happened conditional happiness unconditional happiness
you might say well I want that Tullio well let's
take a look at that do you really want unconditional
happiness because to say yes to unconditional happiness would mean
that you will be happy no matter what can you
tolerate that think about that it's not as easy as
it seems that means if you select to be unconditionally
happy what that means is you you will be happy
even if you don't get the food you like you
will be happy even if your country has laws that
aren't favorable to you you will be happy even if
someone cuts you off in traffic you will be happy
even if someone slaps you in the face for absolutely
no reason you will be happy even if someone comes
into your house at night and steals all your money
you will be happy even if your business fails you
will be happy even if your child gets kidnapped and
raped you will still be happy you will be happy
if your family gets murdered you will still be happy
can you handle that a lot of people can't handle
that because it's really funny what you've been doing your
whole life is you've been setting up rules and conditions
for happiness you've been telling yourself such it's like well
I'll be happy when you know my family is doing
great and I got enough money my bank account and
I got a good job and my kids are going
a good school and all this kind of stuff right
so when I propose to you that you can be
happy independent of all those things that presents a problem
for you because your entire motivational system in life has
been predicated upon achievement achievement of certain things and now
I'm sort of robbing you of all your motivation because
now for example if you can be happy without going
to work then you might ask well why should I
go to work and if you can be happy without
going to school you should ask well why am I
going to school then and if you could be happy
without great food then you might want to wonder well
why should I get good food then and if you
can be happy without being successful you might wonder well
why should I work so hard towards success and those
are all very good questions um a lot of people
would say no Leo I want to be working on
my business I want my family to do nice right
I want these things I won't be happy until these
things happen I won't allow myself to be happy Leo
I won't allow it because this is what I need
to be happy and here we really get to the
crux of the problem is that you don't know what
to do with yourself when you're actually happy you've created
these dogmatic rules for what you think you need to
be happy but you've forgotten that the thing you're actually
pursuing is happiness and not the the rules themselves right
so if you believe you need to be successful to
be happy for example or you need to have a
lot of money to be happy or you need to
have a thriving family to be happy um actually you've
got it backwards what you need to do is you
need to focus your mind on actual happiness and the
means to the end that you're using should be disposable
to you you see because if you do it the
other way around then that means you can get caught
in a loop of just doing activity for activities sake
even when it no longer contributes to happiness for example
you could get stuck pursuing success for 30 years of
your life because you've disconnected success from happiness you see
really what she want is you want success not happiness
and therefore what she'll get is you'll get success and
not happiness and then you'll say well that's fine but
see it's not fine because what you fail to recognize
is that what you actually want when every human being
really wants is happiness fulfillment you want fulfillment that's what
you really want not success not a great family not
great food or anything else but you have to realize
the ramifications of that if what you want is truly
happiness and fulfilment that means that's like your ultimate goal
that means if you get that that means nothing else
matters to you that's what that means now most people
can't handle this because to them it's like well leo
that means then no I have no more reason to
go to work I have no more reason to run
a business I have no more reason to do all
these things that I do that's right because what this
reveals now is it reveals that all your reasons and
motivations for doing things are improperly grounded and that's an
important insight to have about all your motivations isn't it
and you wonder why you have motivation issues could it
be that the reason you have motivation issues is because
your motivations are improperly grounded see as we grow up
we use motivation kind of like a carrot and stick
model where it's like when we do something wrong we
hit ourselves over the head with a stick and when
we do something right we give us themselves a little
carrot and one of the ways you do this one
of the really deep ways you do this is you
create these kind of rules like well Leo I will
be happy win-win I have $100,000 of cash in my
bank account that's when I'll allow myself to be happy
or you say to self I'll be happy when I
have a thriving business that transforms the world in some
kind of important way that's when I'll allow myself to
feel happy or all feel happy at the end of
the day only if I complete every item on my
to-do list or all be happy only if I go
to the gym and I'm able to benchpress 250 pounds
this week if I can do that I'll be happy
and what I'm telling you is that for you to
honestly answer yes to the question of do you want
to be happy you have to answer yes I want
to be unconditionally happy which means that you have to
accept that you will be happy even if you go
to the gym and you can't lift those 250 pounds
that means you'll be happy even if you are lazy
that week and you don't go to the gym at
all imagine that for some people that's a horrific idea
why because your motivation your entire motivational system is basically
a house of cards that's how you set it up
it only works when you beat yourself and when you
reward yourself but that's a very poor kind of motivation
and I'm not just saying that you should stop guilting
yourself and whipping yourself to get stuff done I'm also
saying you should stop rewarding yourself for getting stuff done
this is a much deeper point so in Prior episodes
maybe you've heard me talk about the difference between positive
and negative motivation and how I say you can't get
really far with negative motivation I talk about this a
lot in my life purpose course you need to have
positive motivation for doing stuff which kind of makes sense
to you pretty obvious idea you know if you're always
whipping yourself to get stuff done that gets tiring and
it's pretty neurotic so instead you want to like give
yourself carrots instead of sticks it feels nicer but uh
we're going even deeper here this is an even more
advanced idea well I'm telling you that even positive motivation
is really not good enough to be happy why not
because by definition in order to give yourself a carrot
and for that carrot to have any meaning in your
life that means there need to be moments in your
life where you don't have the carrot see so there's
a contrast it's like you got to treat yourself right
and you're only then happy when you've treatin to yourself
for something so what this does is this makes you
a dog you've turned yourself into a dog over the
last 10 to 20 years of your life that's what
you've done right you've trained yourself very carefully you've trained
yourself without knowing that you've done this with little rewards
it's like yeah I went to the gym and then
like you get a little reward and that reward could
be you know something like allowing yourself to eat some
nice food or that reward could just be a little
emotional reward like oh yeah I've been a good little
boy or girl today something like that usually the reward
is very subtle it's just like an emotional feeling inside
you but notice the only reason this emotional feeling can
work is because for the rest of the day you
know for the first half of the day before you
did all this stuff you didn't have it so um
that's the problem that's the problem unconditional happiness is that
when you are I mean with conditional happiness right that's
the problem conditional happiness is because when you set up
conditional happiness you guarantee that you will be miserable in
your life it's guaranteed that is the structure you're using
that's how that structure works so um so if you
do that then don't come complaining to me leo I
don't like my life Leo this part of my life
sucks or I'm stun satisfied here for some reason oh
I'm depressed because I'm not fulfilled that's the structure you're
using so that's exactly what you're getting so don't be
surprised it's working perfectly your life is working perfectly given
the structure that you're using so you need to change
the structure if you want something better and changing the
structure can be a scary proposition because it calls into
question your entire structure of motivations and how you view
life in general right most people who tell them hey
I was happy while my child was being tortured and
raped they'll they'll say you're a monster you're not allowed
to be happy while your child is tortured and raped
as though my suffering is in any way really helping
that situation I mean think about it from like a
physical standpoint like how is me sitting there and crying
over what's happening to my child in any way helping
the situation it's a net negative at least if I'm
happy well at least I was happy during that thing
now you see even the fact that I'm using this
example I'm using this example deliberately you know I chose
this example because actually in you it actually triggers a
like a little emotional response you're like Leo what are
you Todd this is this sounds absurd like how could
you even say this and I'm not saying that I
necessarily would be happy if my child was getting tortured
and raped I'm just saying it how weird that sounds
to our ears right it sounds weird to our ears
to say that but that's what I want to question
because if you really think about it logically like it
makes no sense to use this kind of structure um
the reason it feels weird to you is because your
entire motivational system is based upon the premise of carrots
and sticks and so you tell yourself no if I
was happy while my child was getting tortured and raped
that would be terrible because the way my motivation system
is structured that means that I would do nothing about
it see I have to really really worried and freak
the [ __ ] out to take action that's what
you're secretly admitting to there you see it's almost inconceivable
to you that your child could be being tortured and
raped and you're happy as hell but then you go
out and take the right action anyways that's hard for
you to believe why is that because the way that
you use emotions is you use emotions to bully yourself
see and so now when we start [ __ ]
with your emotional um triggers which are so deeply connected
to your motivations when we start to like [ __
] around with the carrot and the stick that's actually
dangerous to you right what you're going to tell you
might you're going to tell me as a as an
objection you can say Leo what you're advocating here is
dangerous yeah it's dangerous because of the [ __ ]
motivational system that you have in your mind so what
needs to happen here as an ultimate solution is to
change your entire foundation for how you're motivated to really
see that right now you're not willing to accept unconditional
happiness because what you've actually done is you've assimilated into
your identity the actions that you take in order to
maintain them because motivation authentic motivation is difficult for you
what you've done is you've basically done this you said
you know what I'm a business person so I'm the
type of person who goes to work every morning on
time and you know what else I'm a family person
so I treat my family well I'm the type of
person who treats my family well and you know what
else you know I'm a I'm a healthy person I'm
the kind of person that goes to the gym consistently
and works out etc etc etc right so you you've
you've done this so that it's easier for you to
motivate yourself because you can tell yourself oh yeah I
am these things these are part of who I naturally
am so that I'm drawn to do them now you
might say well what's wrong with that well oh that's
uh it's very problematic you see because what happens when
the thing you've assimilated into your identity turns out not
to actually produce happiness for you what happens then like
let's say you've assimilated into your identity an idea such
as I'm an ultra-efficient worker I work really really hard
that's who I am see you've done this now and
so now what you've done is you've placed this efficient
hard worker as a higher priority than happiness you see
because it's part of your identity because see now if
I tell you hey you're working so hard you're working
90 hours a week maybe you should stop that because
it's not getting you happiness you're suffering and you'll say
no I can't do that Leo can't do it why
not because that's who I am but it's not getting
you happiness no leo it doesn't matter that's who I
am and there's a problem right because once something becomes
a part of who you are it's so painful for
you to give it up that you will actually sacrifice
lots of happiness to maintain your identity even though it's
making you miserable right uh and don't think this is
so Farfetch'd don't think that you don't do this in
your life what I'm talking about applies right to you
and not just to one facet of your life but
in many many ways big ways and small ways and
you're terrified by the idea of actually letting go of
some of the things that in your identity because it's
like well leo if I'm not a hard worker it's
like I don't even know who I am exactly exactly
there's the rub and it's like leo if I'm not
a hard worker how am I gonna go to work
tomorrow why should I even go to work that means
I'm gonna like stop going to work and I'm gonna
lose my house and my family my wife's gonna leave
me because you know she she she's gonna divorce me
if I don't have enough money to you know to
provide for us and for our kids and all this
stuff you see where your mind goes with this um
yeah and that that's a legitimate threat to you that's
a real threat so you can't let it go you
have to stay being this hard worker and it's all
ultimately because you've lost touch of what's really important happiness
it's really that simple just happiness but see you have
all these rules about how to be happy it sounds
ridiculous to you when I say that the reason you're
not happy right now or ever in your life is
because you don't allow yourself to be you will say
no Leo that's [ __ ] ridiculous that you're smoking
some hippy you know weed telling me these things that's
not what's really keeping me unhappy the reason I'm unhappy
is because here's a list Leo I made a list
of 50 [ __ ] items one through 50 if
I get each one of these then I'll be happy
and what I'm telling you that's a [ __ ]
lie that's the best one of the biggest [ __
] tricks that your mind plays on you is coming
up with this list and then telling yourself oh all
I got to do now is just check every item
off this list that's never going to work it's never
gonna work you don't understand yet how your mind works
that's not possible you see that's not possible because what
you're really shooting for is not happiness it's the [
__ ] that you're marking off the list that's really
what you're attached to you're attached to your list to
your rules and how is the list generated through your
the rules in your head so you have rules like
well I can only be happy if I earn X
amount of money I can only be happy if I'm
X amount of body fat percentage I can only be
happy if I have a certain kind of a spouse
or girlfriend or boyfriend I can only be happy if
I'm driving my kind of car that I like I
can only be happy if I'm eating sushi three times
a week and I can only be happy when there
aren't any noisy neighbors around me creating noise and distracting
me and I can only be happy when I go
to work and I have a nice productive workday and
I can only be happy when my kids are being
good kids and getting at least B pluses you know
they get a B figured it'd be - I'm not
going to be happy and so you know for every
person they have a different set of rules this set
of rules is is basically learned from your childhood and
just kind of pick you kind of just pick it
up and develop it as you're growing up you know
your family values play into it your your religious values
your community values you know the TV shows you've watched
all this stuff they basically create these kind of rules
for you and so there you have it and you
wonder why you're not happy you will never be happy
under this paradigm what's necessary is for you to realize
like ah ah there's a deceptive little game here that
my mind is playing on me what if I like
goes on these rules could it really be so simple
as just letting go of some of these rules there's
an ice cream truck driving by it's kind of distracting
me anyways um yeah so can I really let go
of some of these rules and is it really easy
no it's not easy it's difficult what I'm saying is
actually extremely difficult for you because you have to really
go deep inside your mind in question some of these
very you know deep rules that are probably rooted in
your childhood and in your home system of morality and
in your you know your web of beliefs it's probably
even tied in with like your metaphysics and what you
think is is true about reality like all that stuff
informs then what you want from reality and what you
think is necessary from reality to be happy right you
might have a rule where it's like I can only
be happy if I'm going to church every Sunday and
I can only be happy if I'm doing spiritual things
and I can only be happy if I'm contributing to
mankind in some way what you will eventually discover if
you're sticking with me on this self-actualization journey is that
if you really want happiness and if you're tired of
suffering through your life day after day after day for
decades then you have to bite the bullet and accept
unconditionally happiness at some point your life and you have
to basically allow yourself to be able to be happy
no matter what's going on even if all sorts of
[ __ ] is happening around you even when things
aren't going your way even when your business is failing
even when you're lazy even when you're procrastinating you know
even when you're depressed you can still be happy that
sounds weird and paradoxical but hey that's how the mind
works so how do you question these rules well that's
a deep inner work right you got to go in
there you got to ask yourself why do I feel
like I need this to be happy what's the logical
connection there and usually what it all boils down to
is that somewhere deep in your psyche you feel a
deficiency of some kind it's like a hole that needs
to be filled and so you honestly believe that if
you fill that hole that will complete you but what
you don't understand yet is that these holes in your
psyche they can't be filled with physical things or with
any kind of achievements or successes in the external world
all that you can do is you can look inside
really deeply and you can realize oh this hole is
an illusion in reality there are no holes and me
every single moment of my life I'm complete there's nothing
more that's necessary and everything else that I get sure
it's nice you know I won't reject a nice sushi
dinner and I won't reject some you know nice relationship
if it comes to me and I won't reject uh
you know earning some money but I don't need them
to make me happy now you might say well Leo
if that was true then why would I do these
things at all why would I pursue them at all
like think about this if you were equally happy whether
you got the sushi dinner or not would you take
the sushi dinner that's an interesting thought experiment I encourage
you to ponder that for yourself and to see how
would you really react if you didn't need the sushi
dinner like at all um basically what you would come
to is you realize is that life is just a
collection of experiences right and one experience is not particularly
better or worse than another even though we obviously tell
ourselves that some experiences are so much better than others
but as you mature as you go with me here
on the self-actualization journey one of the biggest things you're
going to learn is that really it doesn't matter what
the experience is whether I'm eating sushi or not or
whether I'm doing this or not what I'm having sex
or not it doesn't matter I can learn to enjoy
any experience I can find the magic in the experience
the fact that there even is an experience at all
even if it's an experience of pain of deep pain
even that experience is still a remarkable thing in and
of itself the problem is that we've really got disconnected
from the magic of experience itself over time and so
really now like our lives as adults have turned into
this obsession of min maxing pleasure it's like well pleasures
great and pain is terrible so I'm going to do
everything to maximize pleasure and everything to minimize pain and
that starts to backfire because it doesn't work too well
what you want to do instead to develop yourself towards
unconditional happiness which is possible it's not a pipe dream
it's possible which takes work ah if you can if
you want to move closer to that then what you
need to do is you need to start to just
see experiences for what they are and appreciate them for
what they are like I was in the dentist's office
getting my teeth cleaned the other day and I generally
don't like going to the dentist it's not a very
pleasant experience you know normally we wouldn't call it a
pleasant experience when someone is picking around in your teeth
with it with a some metal sharp stick but like
the more that I'm meditating the more self-inquiry work that
I do the more I notice consciousness developing in me
the more I can just sit in a dentist's office
in even the dentist kind of picking at my teeth
and even though the sensation of of her like picking
in my teeth is it itself pleasant to me just
the fact that that experience is even happening to me
at all is already something I can be kind of
grateful for and still appreciate on some level now I'm
not perfect at this right so I'm not saying that
put me in any situation and I'll be perfectly happy
I'm not saying that I'm saying that that's kind of
like an ideal that you're working towards in this work
and it's helpful to realize that oh that's kind of
what we're working towards because then it tells you that
some of the stuff you're doing you should drop right
some of your rules and stuff you're looking for happiness
in the wrong spots a really good litmus test that
I like for measuring your self-actualization and your capacity to
be happy is this one and it is if I
lock you in a box like solitary confinement style with
no light no entertainment no stimulation no conversation nothing all
it is is just like a black box it's very
small it's like let's say six feet by six feet
by six feet just like a cube and it's got
some ventilation holes for air so you don't suffocate and
it's got a place for you to go to the
bathroom and you're like given food once a day so
you don't die of hunger and that's your fate for
the rest of your life there is no escape from
that you're going to be living in this box forever
can you still be happy most people would say no
of course not it's ridiculous to even assume that such
a thing as possible because look Leo look at Maslow's
hierarchy of needs look at all the stuff we need
to be happy we need food and air we need
and then we need like self-esteem and we need shelter
we need freedom and we need friends and we need
social contact and love Lea what about love how can
you say people can be happy without love love is
like essential to the universe and to that's just how
human beings are because we're we're wired as social creatures
you know all the scientists say that we're social creatures
uh I got news for you that's all [ __
] the reality is that you don't need any of
that undeveloped people need that highly develop people don't need
that and I don't just mean in the sense that
oh well yeah of course leo yeah once I climb
the pyramid and I'm at the very top and once
I got everything once I got the money and the
sex and the food and all this yeah then I
don't need it no I'm saying you don't need it
right now you don't actually need it the problem is
is for you to realize that is a ginormous ginormous
obstacle it's not enough for you to just hear me
say it and then just to believe it because you
still got all those needs inside of you you need
to actually is called spiritually purify yourself of those needs
that's mostly with spiritual work is about so spiritual work
we can say on the one hand is about becoming
enlightened and realizing the truth of reality and what you
are so that's kind of like the flashy side of
spiritual work then there's the very like laborious on flashing
side of spiritual work which is purifying yourself of every
single need that you have even stuff like the need
for food for for water and for air now don't
get me wrong I'm not saying you're gonna live very
long if you don't get food and water and air
you're gonna die but the fact that you need those
things and you feel like you need those things to
be happy that's the thing we're addressing here so yes
you will die without oxygen but believe it or not
you can actually develop yourself to the point as a
self actualized person that you as you honestly are not
attached to needing oxygen what would that mean well that
means you have to face the fear of death and
you have to overcome your fear of death is that
possible yeah it's possible you can overcome your fear of
death and if you overcome fear of death for real
not as some idea you know sometimes people write me
comments in this Italy oh I'm not afraid of death
ah that's the biggest load of horseshit I've ever heard
um you're totally a friend death totally afraid of death
so yeah if you overcome your fear of death then
not having oxygen won't be so scary for you and
it won't seem that so implausible as a thing to
be detached from right notice that when you're detached from
something doesn't mean that you abstain from it for the
rest of your life it simply means you are not
attached to it which is a different thing so anyways
as I was saying with this little um image of
you living in this box you know if you were
really really self actualized if you were really really aware
you'd have no problem living in a box without contact
from humans without love without business without money without any
of this stuff it would not be a problem to
you why not because you don't realize yet how extraordinary
it feels simply to be conscious see you're totally out
of touch with how good you can feel just by
realizing that you're conscious an ordinary person you put them
in a box like that and we call it torture
it's called solitary confinement uh you know some people say
that we shouldn't even allow this kind of treatment of
our worst criminals the rapists and the murderers we shouldn't
allow them to be put into boxes like this but
it's only torture because the average mind is so underdeveloped
so this is a great lisbon test you know you
can just ask yourself any day of the week just
ask yourself if I was put in a box would
I be happier than I was a week ago and
if you could say yes that means you've grown and
after five years of doing this work that I'm showing
you how to do uh it'll no longer seemed so
implausible to you and after ten years to doing this
work it'll be like oh man I might actually enjoy
living in a box you know if I lived in
a box and people just gave me food that actually
pretty cool that means I could just sit and meditate
24 [ __ ] 7 that sounds awesome that sounds
awesome I want that that might actually be a really
good way to live see but to a person who
hasn't done any consciousness work doesn't understand awareness hasn't done
meditation work you know hasn't had any Samadhi experiences has
done any self inquiry hasn't really investigated enlightenment and non-duality
and who and what they are then to them this
seems like complete hogwash it seems like I'm just you
know I'm talking fantasies here not human psychology none of
this is real human psychologist is some kind of fantasy
you have oh this is real human psychology except that
it's a rather extraordinary form of it because it's quite
rare and because you don't know very many people like
this but believe it or not you can find people
in society who can do this it's pretty cool I
mean they're pretty rare but they're not that rare I've
met dozens of them you can too they're pretty normal
people this is the power of doing real deep inner
work what do you think detachment is like detachment is
not an idea detachments a real thing there are people
alive right now who are so detached from meeting anything
that they don't even really care about getting air of
course they breathe and they live and and they do
normal things they don't live in boxes they're just attached
and now think of how great life feels to those
people because they're not living in a box they're living
in a very rich world with color right with light
with cars and technology and people and love and animals
and nature and all this amazing stuff and they can
really soak that [ __ ] in because they're too
from it all detachment doesn't make you depressed detachment doesn't
make you nihilistic and it doesn't make you demotivated it's
like well I don't need anything so I'm not gonna
do anything no it frees you up to do whatever
the [ __ ] you want it's total freedom with
total freedom you could enjoy anything much more so than
you can when you're attached to something because have you
noticed this that even when you're enjoying something that you
really enjoy but are attached to you actually suffer that's
a pretty remarkable thing to grasp in your direct experience
so a really good example of this you know I
experienced this personally whenever I'm eating ice cream and I
try to stay away from dairy so I don't eat
ice cream very much but you know if I'm eating
some kind of dessert that I really love that I
rarely eat and I decide to just like splurge and
treat myself so I'll get up you know a quart
of ice cream or something and I'll be sitting there
on my couch eating it and as I'm eating it
you know I'm really enjoying it is so good I
wish I could just eat it forever but right there
I'm suffering because already as I'm digging into that ice
cream with my spoon I can see the level of
the ice cream gets lower and lower and lower and
I already know it's going to get to the bottom
and I already know the feeling I'm going to feel
when my spoon hits the bottom you know the empty
bottom of the carton and then it's like [ __
] I'm out of ice cream and I already know
I'm going to be suffering in five minutes when I
hit the bottom I haven't hit the bottom yet I
still have a bunch of ice cream to go but
already I'm suffering I'm suffering even before I'll really be
suffering and that pretty much summarizes what your life is
like so yeah there's a lot to be aware of
here I encourage you to really work towards just accepting
this idea of unconditional happiness rethinking like how would you
have to go deep down inside your mind like into
the real core of your web of beliefs and rethink
some stuff there in order to just be able to
say yes to unconditional happiness stuff left change free right
your your entire worldview will have to change everything in
your life from the past will have to be refactored
you'll have to admit to yourself that for the last
10 or 20 years I've been setting up all these
rules to be happy and they were all unnecessary and
I was just pretending and that can be that can
be difficult to accept it could be difficult to fully
integrate that right you have to go back into your
mind and refactor many experiences and many assumptions you have
very core assumptions about life because right now you probably
have assumptions such as I need money to be happy
and I need a sex to be happy I need
all these other things in specific proportions but I want
you to really look at that with awareness and to
ask yourself wait a minute could these rules for happiness
be backfiring on me and maybe I've forgotten what the
point of life is that the point of life is
not to do [ __ ] it's not to be
busy it's not any specific activity it's not any identity
structure the point is just pure happiness and that might
be quite scary for you to accept because you're going
to be lost for a while for a few days
or for a week or for a whole month maybe
you're going to feel like Manlio you've robbed me of
all my motivation I don't know what to do with
my life anymore because if I can just be happy
with nothing then what the [ __ ] am i
doing stay with that that's a super super healthy very
deep and very valuable realization to have trust that your
motivation will come back to you motivation is one of
those things that it's scary to kind of let go
of because you feel like man if I if I
just undermine my motivation then everything is going to fall
apart but actually what you realize that when you let
go of your neurotic motivations yeah some things might fall
apart but those things that fall apart those are the
inauthentic things that's fine let those things fall apart have
the courage to go through that initial period of fear
and and kind of confusion and loss of direction what
will happen then is it your mind will kick back
in your mind is a machine for generating motivation on
all sorts of levels from the most neurotic to to
kind of everyday motivations to the most divine motivations and
if you want to move to the most divine and
the most beautiful most healthy forms of motivation start to
shed some of the neurotic stuff right now that's fueling
you all right so good luck with that stay with
it and keep the faith I'm signing off go ahead
