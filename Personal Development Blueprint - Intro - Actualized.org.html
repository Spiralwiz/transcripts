hey this is Leo for actualize org and welcome to
the personal development blueprint this is the introduction video I'm
really excited to bring this blueprint for you and so
let me begin by just giving you a summary of
what it is a recap and then a few warning
points about going through and how to use this blueprint
to get the most results in your life because I
want you to be able to go through this list
of concepts and apply it in your life and get
big big big results that's the ultimate point that's our
objective but before we get ahead of ourselves let's begin
with what the hell is the personal development blueprint well
I began my journey in personal development five years ago
when I started my own business and when I did
that I realized and I picked up my first self-help
book I realized that this was going to be a
much longer endeavor than just reading one book and getting
one specific result that I was after at the time
personal development for me then evolved into this journey where
I need to go through and I need to find
principles and best practices and then find ways of applying
in my life and so what I found when I
got on this journey five years ago is that as
I was reading material as I was going to seminars
as I was listening to gurus out there as I
was reading ancient literature and texts everything from classics like
the meditations by Marcus Aurelius to the Bhagavad Gita and
other classics like that getting wisdom from all these different
sources and then of course also interviewing people and getting
we're trying to trying things out and trying to get
results in my own life doing all the different things
that I've done from working on my fitness to my
nutrition to my relationships to my business to my career
to my life purpose so all these different things that
I've been working on as I was doing all those
things I started noticing that there were patterns that were
repeating there were principles and advice that I was getting
that maybe it came off in different words but there
were similarities and ultimately what that led me to is
I started thinking well what if I start taking note
on all this stuff and start creating a list a
list of concepts a list of strategies a list of
tactics a list of principles that someone can use firstly
myself that I can use but other people could use
to improve their life you know what are the principles
the highest leverage principles that are used to create a
successful life a really fulfilling and happy life and exciting
life the kind of big life or you're living your
full potential so the kind of stuff that we're talking
about actualized org and as I was looking at this
stuff and I was doing all this research especially in
the last year I really started fleshing out this list
and this list became pretty big so right now is
we've got over a hundred different concepts hundred different principles
in this list that you can use to both analyze
your life to see where you're doing good and where
you're doing wrong and we could be making improvements but
generally these are things that if you don't have these
in place in your life it's going to be challenging
for you to get the kind of success that you
want and it can be challenging for you to have
the kind of level of fulfillment and happiness that you
want so that's a little bit about the background another
title that I gave I call this my personal develop
Rindt but you can also call it the hundred greatest
personal development concepts of all time because what I was
doing when I was trading this list is I was
looking not only for stuff that is that is timeless
advice that can be carried across the ages so basically
these things that the Romans and the Greeks and the
ancient Egyptians and the ancient Chinese all those principles that
they were espousing a lot of those are part of
this this blueprint because that's classic timeless advice that is
necessary people found out thousands of years ago that that
following that those principles was necessary to get to get
happiness and success in your life and so I've got
those I've also got more modern principles things from that
come to us from neuroscience and things that come to
us from the latest research that was just done decades
ago just years and decades ago on happiness and fulfillment
and strengths and a lot of good stuff coming from
the positive psychology movement nowadays so we've got a collection
of all sorts of these principles that what I was
looking for as I was looking for the highest leverage
point principles so what that means is the things that
you can take action on and those pieces of advice
that get you results and get you a lot of
results for a little bit of effort so the idea
there is that I want things that when you make
a change it's going to make a profound change in
your results in your business a profound change in the
results in your relationship a profound change in the level
of happiness that you're experiencing in your life so that's
what I mean by high leverage and I think that
all of the points on this list are very high
leverage now a couple of warnings and caveats that I
want to throw out there about this list possible misconceptions
number one is that these are all very deep concepts
with a lot of layers to them and really it's
not going to be enough to go through the list
and read it once and it's not even going to
be enough to go through and read it five times
what you got to do is you not only got
to read it and understand it intellectually but you got
to soak it in on an emotional level and that
means going out there and actually working it right you
have to go and implement you have to go and
take action you have to go and experiment and play
around because a lot of these principles when you just
read them at first they seem simple they seem basic
they seem somewhat intuitive and it seems like you read
the principle like oh yeah I know that I should
be doing that oh yeah I know I should be
doing this but when you go out there and actually
try to implement it you get well when you try
to implement some of these principles you're going to get
problems right you're going to see you're getting it frustrations
you're not going to know should i implement it in
this way or in this other way because these principles
are by their nature abstract and they can be a
little bit generic and so part of the challenge is
figuring out how do you actually apply and then of
course building up the habits that you need to make
this stuff into practice because one of the biggest things
that I found after doing five years of personal development
research and study is that to really get the results
that you want to get it's not enough to study
this stuff you have to live it you have to
practice it you have to build it into your system
to make it automatic you have to basically create routines
out of these principles and that's something that takes time
that can take months that can even take years of
work just to integrate one principle into your life but
don't get this heartened by that because these are really
powerful and I do not expect you to just zip
through this list and have all hundred of them done
a month for now this is something that's really a
lifelong project and one of the reasons that I embarked
on this journey of creating this list was because when
I started off I knew immediately being a big picture
kind of guy I needed to know what was the
whole process of personal development was that going to entail
because it's one thing to just go out there and
read one Tony Robbins book and that's kind of how
I got started but then I need lis saw that
just reading one book was not going to do it
because sure you can read one book and maybe get
a piece of advice for how to solve a specific
problem you're having your life right now and that's what
most people do is they go out there they read
a book let's say and right now the thing is
they want to focus on their fitness so they want
to they want some advice about how to exercise better
how to eat better and that's a great place to
start but then you realize that that's just one result
you know after you're done with that there's going to
be something else that you want to work on you're
going to want to work on your relationships and then
maybe you've got your relationships down and you want to
work on something else you want to work on your
financial independence and you want to have more money in
your bank account and so you want to work on
that and you want to get that handled and then
maybe you go and you want to work on your
life purpose and you want to make me change jobs
or thinking of changing careers to get something that's more
aligned with your values something that's more fulfilling for you
and then you're going to go and you're going to
you're going to look for advice on how to handle
that but ultimately what I said is I said you
know what why don't I just commit and I say
that this is something that is important to me and
I can already foresee that this is something I'm going
to be doing over my whole life it's going through
this growth process because I want to be able to
create a nossa life for myself and I saw that
an awesome life is not one piece or two pieces
or three pieces it's like assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle
and for me it was like assembling a jigsaw puzzle
and I didn't have the front cover on the box
it's like I lost the box but I had all
these pieces scattered around and I was starting from scratch
I didn't really know what was even possible you know
how could these pieces fit together will they even fit
together do I even have all the pieces can I
create the kind of life that I want to create
for myself what's possible and so for me became important
to find this big picture and what I started doing
is I started doing a lot of research a lot
of experimentation and starting to put the things together and
eventually I started getting chunks I could see glimpses of
what the picture looked like you know what was possible
how this process was only to unfold and I was
like as I saw those bigger chunks I started getting
more motivated I started getting more buying into the idea
of why I'm even committed to personal development so I
think that's important for your long-term motivation is to see
the big picture and I got quite frankly tired and
frustrated with some of these books and some of the
marketing in the self-help industry where it's like well I'm
going to give you the one secret or I'm going
to give you the three secrets to success in life
or the three secrets to manifesting all the money that
you want or the ten principles that will solve all
your problems if you really think about it there's no
one or three or five or seven or ten things
that are going to get your life to the point
where you are successful and happy and excited and fulfill
the living on your edge to get that kind of
charged life you're going to have to go beyond and
that's why I said you know what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to go out there and
see how many pieces of this puzzle are there because
I sure as hell know that it's not one piece
and it's not three pieces and it's not five and
it's not ten so I just went out there I
said I'm going to I'm going to see how the
puzzle unfolds and what that led me to was this
list right now I'm not a hundred and five principles
and that list keeps growing so this is a big
list I didn't want to say that it was going
to be a hundred I said that it's going to
be as many as it's going to be and right
now actually as I'm working on this and doing more
research and doing more experimentation I'm finding that there's actually
way more than 100 I'm looking at probably right now
at taking this list to 150 or maybe even 200
by by the time I really haven't fleshed out and
for me this is a lifelong project so I'm going
to be working on this list really for the rest
of my life is as I'm researches researching taking more
notes interviewing more people working with more clients I'm seeing
more distinctions I'm seeing more of the things that are
really important more of those leverage points and so that
is kind of the backstory of where I'm coming to
you with this from and I think what's powerful about
this list is that it's hard to go out there
and find something this comprehensive I don't claim that this
is the end-all be-all list but this is a pretty
damn extensive list and I haven't seen one quite this
extensive out there so take advantage of that if you're
a big-picture thinker like me and you get motivated by
knowing exactly what's happening and you don't like just being
like a Ratna neighs taking one turn the next turn
not seeing everything you like the the bird's eye view
then this will help get you motivated it'll help set
expectations for really what you need to be doing to
be getting the kind of results that you want in
your life if you've picked up one book in the
past and you've read it and you were dissatisfied with
the results you've gotten this is probably why it's because
you're not seeing the scope of everything but I don't
want you to get disheartened by the scope because this
is something you're going to be doing for the rest
of your life it's fun it's exciting I want you
to get engaged and body into all the cool stuff
that you could be adding to your life by learning
some of these concepts and then going out there and
applying them so another caveat that I want to make
continuing to go down this list is that not all
of us are equal and what I mean by that
is that there's not going to be one way to
use this list to help yourself in your life for
me personally a lot of the rankings on this list
are biased by my own experiences and also the type
of people that I've been associating with some of my
own interests so as you're going down this list this
is not a list where the top item is the
one that you should be focusing on I really want
you to use this list by going down and reading
through it scanning through it and seeing what resonates with
you right because not everyone is equal you are different
than I am you have different values than I do
you have different values than your parents you have different
values than your children you have different values and your
friends you have different values than your spouse and you
have different values and your coworkers so the principles on
this list are going to have to be tailored to
what you're doing and that's why there's a lot of
them is that it gives you the flexibility to tailor
it to your goals your values your particularly style your
personality type your strengths your weaknesses right but everyone is
at a different point in their life depending on all
those factors plus also your age the place where you're
living at the kind of career you're pursuing you know
your goals everyone has different goals so depending on all
those you're going to have to find the principles that
are most important to you especially at this point your
life the way I intend this list to be used
is go through it and then ask yourself what are
the challenge that you're really facing right now and what
are the what are the biggest changes that you can
make right now that will give you the biggest bang
for your buck so to speak so where can you
invest your energy we can get a lot back from
it and by lockback I mean you're going to get
a lot of success back you're going to get a
lot of fulfillment back or a lot of happiness out
of it so for everyone that's going to be different
for example if you're struggling with your career right now
and you're in a job that you're not really happy
with that's probably going to limit you in numerous ways
with your finances and it's probably going to limit the
amount fulfill you could have in your life if that's
the case then you might want to take the first
principle which i think is maybe one of the most
important is having a life purpose and getting in there
and trying to figure that out and that might take
you months to do it might take you a couple
of years to get that really figured out but just
getting that one principle of life purpose down he's going
to give you a huge huge shift in your fulfillment
and your ultimate success in life that's something that will
then carry through and have a ripple effect through decades
and really to the end of your so that's something
that's really worth putting your time and energy into on
the other hand maybe you've got your career down and
you're happy with your career and you've got other things
and other areas in your life where you're struggling maybe
you're struggling with your relationships maybe you're struggling with your
relationships because of your career because your career is taking
away energy and time from that so maybe you got
to focus on that or maybe you want to focus
on starting a business transitioning from career to business or
maybe you want to get your health of the shape
or maybe there are some other areas where you're struggling
maybe you're a constant warrior or a negative thinker and
so some of these principles are going to the list
you'll see how those can can really help you if
you start implementing them so that's what I mean about
not everyone being equal is that all of us are
going to have different principles are going to appeal to
us at different times and what will appeal to you
is not necessarily what's going to appeal to me right
now or to your friend so take all this with
a grain of salt and make sure that when you're
going through in the way that you're using it is
that you're picking the things that are resonating with you
and are giving you the biggest bang for your buck
right now in your life so that is that's all
I'm going to say on that point the next point
that I'm going to make is that I am not
perfect I'm not the Buddha I'm not Jesus Christ I'm
not some guru here who is preaching to you that
I my life is perfect and that you should do
everything that I'm doing and make your life perfect that's
really not how it works that's too high of a
standard to really put on anybody as much as I
would like to be that figure I'm not for me
I constructed this list not even for you guys but
I started constructing it for myself because I saw that
I was slipping in all these areas I was struggle
with my fitness I was struggling with my nutrition I
was struggling with my life purpose I was struggling with
my business I was struggling with negative thinking I was
struggling with stress and worry and freaking all this stuff
out and so that's why I made this list and
I'm still struggling on many of those points to this
day I've made some dramatic improvements over the last five
years in almost all of those areas but I'm still
struggling in all of them and I anticipate that I
will be or for decades to come so don't put
the expectation on me to be perfect and also by
extension don't put that expectation on yourself there's just too
much there's too many pieces to get into place in
your life so the the point here is to be
enjoying the journey and not to be out independent which
is actually one of the principles that you'll find on
the list but don't be a perfectionist right don't try
to say that wanting to have all the stuff in
place by the end of the year something like ridiculous
like that it's just not going to happen this is
something it's going to take months and years to develop
because each of these principles is deep it has many
layers you can probably go through and spend year a
year on each one of them and not really get
the full deep understanding that that can go into each
one of these and that's why I'm going to have
videos for each one of these principles and I anticipate
that I'll be able to make probably like five or
ten videos just on each principle alone so there can
be literally hundreds maybe even a thousand videos that I
can that I could shoot on all this content because
there's so many nuances to to each one of these
and to figure out how it should be applied in
your life so ease up on yourself don't think that
you need to go through and apply all 100 of
them that's not going to happen in fact the best
approach that I can give you for for actually implementing
this stuff is to focus on one at a time
not even like five just focus on one pick one
that's going to make the biggest difference to you right
now and then go to work on that and give
yourself the time the space that you need to work
on it and to really work it well to get
it integrated not just to understand it logically but to
get it emotionally to build habits around it because you
have to practice this stuff to get the results otherwise
I'm telling you what's gonna happen you're going to read
through this list and you're going to feel good about
yourself because you're going to see the big picture you're
going to understand stuff but then what's going to happen
you're going to have you're going to have that aha
moment like oh I see I understand I understand all
this stuff works and you're going to get some realizations
and some more awareness but then what's going to happen
is you're going to kind of go back and are
going to shift into your old routines and well you
didn't even create a new routines just by reading this
I feel a little bit more awareness there are no
real routines so by definition you're going to be doing
the same stuff that you've been doing and you're going
to be getting the same feelings you've been getting you're
going to be getting the same level of results and
the same level of fulfillment and my guess is that
if you're looking at this list then you want an
improvement you want to change in those results you want
to change in those feelings and to get that change
in feeling and result you have to take some action
right that's also principle one of the top principles in
the blueprint is that you are gonna have to take
a lot of action and you're going to have to
be a good executor because if you're not doing that
then you're not getting results and the whole point is
not to do a mental circle-jerk it's to do a
personal development that means getting real results in your life
all right moving on I think I've beat that point
to death but I actually think that point can never
be beaten to death because people just don't listen you
need to go out there and take action the final
point that I'm going to make is that this is
a live document so like I said I'm constantly doing
research especially now that I'm doing this more full-time than
I ever was before I'm reading more books on doing
more interviews I'm working with more clients I'm more actively
engaged in personal development now than I ever was before
I know now how to get the results that I
didn't know how to get before so as I'm doing
all this stuff I'm getting more refinement in what I
understand these principles to mean and so I'm going to
be out there we're finding this blueprint over the next
year especially and then probably who knows where it will
go from there but I think I'm anticipating doing this
for multiple years really refining it so this is going
to be a live document where I'm constantly shuffling things
around I'm going to be adding more principles I'm probably
going to be splitting certain principles apart as I get
more instinct shion's going maybe I'm going to be merging
certain principles together if I see that they deserve to
be merged together so always check back here and take
note that this is kind of a document under construction
and I'll be adding a lot more videos I'll be
adding a lot more text content in article form and
then I also want to be adding exercise files and
ideas for how you can actually be implementing this stuff
so keep an eye out for that keep an eye
out for the changes that are gonna be coming I'm
really excited about it I'll be shooting videos really for
the next coming year to flush out this blueprint and
to get it to that kind of a vision that
I have for it the next point that I want
to make so that wasn't my last one the next
point that I want to make is that don't take
this for granted because to me if I would have
found a list like this five years ago I would
have killed for it you know I would have paid
a lot of money for it and I actually had
this this question that I had my mind was whether
I should even release this list whether I should release
this blueprint where I should or I should sell it
I should charge money for it because right now what
I'm doing is this all out here is for free
you have access to it this is going to be
amazing content this kind of stuff that people would charge
hundreds if not thousands of dollars for the reason I'm
releasing it for free is because well I want content
out there that helps people right I'm releasing it because
I want you to actually take this stuff and to
go out there and implement it and see how this
stuff works I want to get you engaged and bought
into the idea that you're doing personal development for life
that to me is what's important because I don't want
to just sell you on one little technique it's going
to help you fix one little problem in your life
and then all of a sudden a month later we
have a new problem I want you to get involved
with the whole process and I think that if there's
anything that's lacking in a personal development world a self-help
world it's that we as the people who are the
leaders in the industry we're not doing a good enough
job of getting people engaged and bought into the whole
process we're trying to get you a quick little fix
here and a quick little fix there we're trying to
sell you a magic pill and that's not what I'm
about I think that's the wrong way to go that
just does not get you the kind of results that
you really want that's why if you're frustrated with personal
development or self help and you've done a little bit
of in the past you've picked up a book or
maybe you've bought one of those CD programs and you're
not getting the results that were promised there it's because
you're not coming enough it's because you're not really taking
the big scope into play right you're doing too little
you're not doing enough maybe even more but on the
flip side I don't want to say that this is
going to be some sort of painful torturous process I
think there's a way to make personal element really fun
and exciting and in fact one of the most rewarding
undertakings in your life so this is something that will
piggyback I think on top of everything else that you're
doing you know if you're obviously are going to be
working in handling your career in your business and you're
going to be you're having relationships and going to family
life in our friends you have a social life and
you have a your fitness and your hobbies and all
those things that you're doing and then I think the
there's going to be like a layer running underneath all
of those parts of your life which I call personal
development or self-actualization where you're trying to improve each one
of those and you're analyzing and you're trying to get
more self-awareness about what you're doing and so this blueprint
is trying to show you what that looks like because
I want to sell you on this idea not because
I need to sell you on it but because I
think it's something that's powerful and I think something that
people realize much later into their ears like in their
in her late 30s and 40s and 50s they start
to see like oh yeah I wish I knew this
stuff when I was much younger because then I could
have a you know I could have been more bought
into it I could have been a little bit wiser
I could have prevented myself for making some of these
stupid decisions that I made could have gotten better results
I would have had less regrets I would have lived
a more charged or fulfilling more successful life and that's
what I really want for you so that's going to
do it for my introduction go ahead go down this
list scan it through definitely get that big picture sense
don't just read one principle read them all see how
they fit in how they fit together I think that's
valuable it will get you some good awareness but then
you can also click on each one and you can
go in-depth with videos and the articles that I have
to really a hammer each one home and try implementing
them the other last point that I'm going to make
is because I am releasing this stuff for free and
I am putting literally my full time effort into it
I want you to help me spread the message so
if you're finding this stuff useful if you think this
is something that helps you and you figure that it
could help someone else in your life friend or family
member or spouse please help spread the message like it
share it email it you know do whatever you got
to do also I love hearing comments and feedback from
you so if you want go ahead and email me
and leave a comment about what you think maybe ways
that I can make improvements maybe other principles that you
have that I could consider adding to the list or
just what you think and maybe share some stories about
how this stuff has been helping you and maybe how
it's been helping other people in your life I always
love to hear feedback because that is what keeps me
going that's what motivates me that's why I'm doing this
I mean I'm doing this too it's part of my
cure it's part of my job it is a business
of for me but also really the rewarding part is
seeing what you guys think and interacting with you guys
and hearing your problems and hearing the solutions and hearing
how stuff is working and how it's not working I'd
love to hear that stuff so please leave your comments
this is leo signing off please don't forget to share
to comment and to like
