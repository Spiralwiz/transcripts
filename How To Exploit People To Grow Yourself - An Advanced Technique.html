hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm gonna tell you how to exploit others to
grow yourself alright let's talk about exploiting other people to
grow your self now what do I mean by this
it sounds a little bit nefarious on the surface let
me tell you this is actually one of the single
most powerful personal development techniques that I've ever found and
if you apply this in your life you are gonna
skyrocket with your understanding of yourself and your personal self
control and self mastery so what do I mean by
exploiting other people well what you're gonna find as you're
going through life and especially as you're interacting with people
and you're in relationships both intimate relationships but also relationships
at work relationships with your family relationships with your friends
or any other human beings what you're going to find
is invariably you're gonna have conflict right you and them
there you're gonna clash you and someone else is gonna
clash and they're gonna start doing things that you clearly
perceive as being wrong as being unwise you might tell
yourself well these principles of personal development that I'm trying
to embody that I'm trying to kind of live in
my life I know what the principles are I've studied
the principles maybe you've studied them and you heard them
for me here at actualised org or maybe from some
other book from Tony Robbins from a seminar you went
to you know you just know you know what's right
you know what should be doing you know what people
should be doing you know what you should be doing
and sometimes you go a long life and you you
meet people that are totally breaking these principles they're behaving
in horrible ways they're angry they're anxious they're unconscious they're
acting like a victim they're blaming you for their own
victimhood and you know all these kinds of nasty situations
that create these dysfunctional relationships and as you get wiser
and wiser and wiser what's gonna start to happen is
that you're gonna see you start to see that people
are behaving and the reason that people are behaving in
bad ways and the reason that people are suffering in
their lives and that they're blaming you a lot of
times for that suffering is because they're breaking the core
fundamental principles of success and Happiness right they don't understand
their own psychology and so you're going to start to
see this and as you become wiser and smarter and
as you roll yourself in develop yourself you're gonna become
stronger you're going to develop that sense of self mastery
and so as a student of self mastery you're gonna
you're going to become more and more proficient and you're
gonna see people acting in all sorts of neurotic and
crazy ways you're gonna see people get angry you're gonna
see people yelling you're gonna see people having panic attacks
and being upset and acting like a victim and doing
petty spiteful things to each other maybe fighting with each
other cursing at each other doing all sorts of these
nasty things and because you've worked on yourself and you
know the principles you're gonna be like oh I see
what's going on there and what's going to be very
tempting is you're gonna start to feel kind of bad
for those people and you're gonna wonder like why why
don't they know better why aren't they doing better why
aren't they following these principles that I'm following maybe I
can show them how to follow these principles and maybe
they can like apply them in their lives and what's
gonna tend to happen is that you might even go
out there and you might try to show one of
these principles or show someone close to you how they're
behaving in a way that's basically sabotaging their own life
and you're gonna like you're gonna go you're gonna try
to show them and what's gonna happen is that they're
gonna reject you and if they're gonna get angry at
you for showing them their own faults and I'm gonna
blame you and what's gonna happen is that if you've
never encountered this before you're gonna you can actually you
can get triggered by this it's gonna trigger you emotionally
and you're going to start to notice that people are
behaving in all sorts of like nasty and bad ways
and you're gonna start to suddenly judge them and you're
gonna say to yourself well they should be doing better
here they should be doing better than there and you're
gonna get into this mode where you're gonna think that
you're better than other people because you are in a
sense you're developing more psychological awareness you're developing more consciousness
and as you become more aware you start to notice
how other people are asleep you start to see that
everybody is sleepwalking through life all your friends your family
maybe your spouse your girlfriend or your boyfriend they're totally
sleepwalking through life and and you're gonna be like wow
that's a that that's incredible and you're gonna start to
feel like you're above them well this is this is
the next this is the next phase of your development
is to now instead of judging these people this is
how you exploit them this is where the exploitation comes
in you exploit these people here's what I mean by
that it's not as evil as it sounds on the
surface the way that you exploit someone is you see
them doing something that's nasty or distasteful something that is
wrong according to the principles that you know are right
and instead now of judging them what you do is
you turn it back on yourself and you say oh
this person he's getting angry how am i doing the
same thing right now in my life oh that person
she's a victim wait a minute how am i a
victim in my life oh that person that person is
a neurotic pessimist wait a minute how am i a
neurotic pessimist oh that person that person right there she
is totally unconscious totally sleepwalking through life has no clue
even where she's up wait a minute where do I
behave unconsciously still where am i behaving in a way
where I'm up and I don't even know that I
am this is how you exploit people to further yourself
this is so valuable what you do here you basically
Akito the problem the problem is that you've got all
these people that are unconscious and doing all sorts of
stupid and now if you think you're better than them
there go around and go to point fingers you're gonna
judge them and you're gonna act superior to them and
in fact it's going to disturb you because you're like
gonna be saying to yourself and to them you're going
to be pointing out their flaws and you're gonna be
saying well look you're unconscious clearly you need to wake
up to that force you're going to say look you've
got an anger management problem you need to start to
manage your anger better here are some techniques and you're
gonna have to you're going to have this tendency to
go around and like try to to instruct people from
your from your wise position but actually when you do
this you're gonna start to notice that there's going to
be a little bit of a dissonance between you and
the wise you the wise you is going to start
to see that something is wrong with the way that
you're approaching all these people and what that is is
that you are not registering within yourself those same flaws
the fact is that no matter how developed you are
no matter how how far along you are along this
path of personal development they're still always going to be
ways subtle ways sometimes very glaringly obvious ways where you
are behaving in just the same exact ways that all
those other people are behaving you're behaving unconsciously you're sleepwalking
through life you're getting angry you're getting negative pessimistic you're
out of control you can't control your own thoughts you're
not following through on the good habits you need be
following through on you're breaking the good principles that you
know you should be following right you're doing this every
single day I guarantee it it's just that you have
this tendency of ignoring your own faults and being very
hyper aware of the fault of the people and so
once you reach that point first of all congratulate yourself
you've gotten very far because at least now you're conscious
enough to see how insane the rest of the world
is you're conscious enough to see just how unconscious everybody
else is and that's already putting you in a class
all by all by itself that's very good except now
we need to take you to the next level to
get to the next level you're not gonna get there
by going around and criticizing and judging other people and
finding fault with them the next level for you is
to start to use everybody that's doing all sorts of
neurotic stuff is to first of all come to accept
that that is the world that we live in so
be at peace with it don't be all anxious about
don't get an erotical that's the first thing but the
second thing is then to say okay I can actually
use all these I can Aikido all these situations towards
my benefit and it hurts nobody right you're using these
people as reminders of what you should not be doing
and in fact when you start to do this you
get very thankful you get very thankful because what you
start to see is you start to see all these
people that are doing all this stupid stuff in their
lives you start to see them as just oh this
is just a reminder this is a reminder that I
need to stay on track when you see someone self-destructing
and get really angry in traffic that's a nice reminder
for the fact that you know what it's really important
for me to keep doing my meditation every morning because
that meditation I'm doing is keeping me from being that
person and I don't want to be that person that
person is ugly I want to be the calm self
that I am right now in order to stay that
way well this person just reminded me that I should
take my meditation very seriously perfect reminder then maybe you
go to the office and at the office you see
someone criticizing a proposal maybe there's a new project that's
being planned somebody's criticizing the proposal nay saying it being
very negative and cynical okay now you notice that person
and you look at him and you say yes I
don't like his cynicism but more importantly how does that
now affect me how does how does that reflect back
at me how do I use that person to be
a mirror for my own behavior and my own flaws
and when you reflect that back on yourself you go
okay wait a minute where am I being cynical like
that oh so I'm not cynical here at work maybe
I got the work situation figured out maybe this proposal
I'm not cynical about that but if I think about
it really hard I'm cynical in my relationship with my
parents and then you you take it to that level
and you say okay so I'm cynical there I'm negative
there why don't I try to like work on that
so basically what you're doing is you're using people as
mirrors to yourself now the reason that this takes you
to a whole nother level is because this takes incredible
self-discipline to do this because it's it's actually very difficult
to do this our mind doesn't want to focus on
our own flaws it wants to focus on the flaws
other people it wants to judge it wants to to
blame our circumstance but when you are really truly self
developed and you go to a you know a whole
new level what what you start to do is you
start to be okay with the neuroticism of everybody out
there and you just start to use it as as
like lessons for yourself you start to derive wisdom from
it literally you're taking negatives and you're turning them into
positives into a very very powerful way of developing yourself
and that you know if you're a student of personal
development then you've probably realized already that it's important to
get reminders right it's not enough for me to tell
you some principle or some some lesson and then you
go off and you just go and run your life
according to that principle that listen no it doesn't work
that way what you got to do is you have
to constantly reimburse yourself in two principles you got to
reimburse yourself in that in the core truths that you
know are right and you do it again and again
and again and again and again and you just kind
of train your brain and no matter how good you
get it's always nice to get another reminder another lesson
it's kind of like if you were a golfer I
mean you wouldn't just go and golf really hard for
a couple of years and learn to golf really well
and then never golf again in your life and just
kind of let rest on your laurels right if you
did that then you would not be a great golfer
you might be good for a couple of years but
then you would get rusty and so this is the
same thing with your spiritual and personal development is that
you have to keep practicing it and reminding yourself because
otherwise even though you might be doing good right now
you know if you fall off track you fall off
the habits that you've been cultivating then you're gonna become
rusty so you can't rest on your laurels right now
if you're positive right now if you're feeling very strong
and you're not acting like a victim in your life
right now if you can control your anger right now
if you're not neurotic well that's really good but you're
not gonna stay that way if you don't keep reminding
yourself if you don't keep following through on the good
habits that you've developed the best way to do that
is to see in others reminders use other people as
reminders for the way that you should be living your
life also it'll help you cultivate some gratitude right when
I see people now behaving and really stupid unwise unconscious
ways you know I tried to remind myself like wow
that's that's awesome because because like I mean I would
like them to be better I would like them to
to awake from their unconsciousness but to me it's like
wow that could have been me like all the hard
work that I'm putting into my life like that's so
that I don't become like that person and to me
that just like fuels me that gives me fuel for
the journey because sometimes you feel like you're doing personal
development but then you just get so a climatic to
the results you're getting that you don't really know what
you're working towards anymore well when you see someone losing
their temper or you see someone destroying their life with
with drugs or addictions or alcohol or anything like that
or you see someone being neurotic or you know you
see someone being so critical of themselves and other people
that they basically can't progress in life then you can
tell yourself wow you know all this work that I've
put into myself has been so worth it because I
would give anything not to be like that person and
in fact I can find some current flaws in me
that that person is now highlighting and I can introspect
and say okay how am I still doing that how
am I still doing that in very subtle ways maybe
I ironed out the worst of it but I'm still
doing it in subtle ways let me eye on out
a little bit more alright this is Leo I'm signing
off this is how to exploit people to your maximum
personal development right use negative people to fuel you to
become a better person it doesn't hurt them and it
massively improves you so go ahead and do that try
that out start to practice it right now maybe pick
one or two people in your life that you can
use as as negative examples of how not to live
your life it can be a really powerful force or
