            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/TVPzXaHMifw' target='_blank'>How I Do Research & Develop Big Picture Understanding</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of Epistemic Foundation</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes on developing the right epistemic foundation, the understanding of knowledge, to achieve big picture understanding of life. It's not a gimmick but a structural method to success, and it is often overlooked even by intelligent and enlightened individuals. 
</li><li><b>Awareness in Philosophy</b>: Leo notes his own self-awareness when practicing philosophy, and his realization of how personal emotions and biases shape the practice. He touches on the limits of philosophy and reason, and the importance of understanding these limits to avoid misstep.
</li><li><b>The Starting Point</b>: The starting point in the journey of understanding is acknowledging the lack of knowing what is true. This paves the way for recognizing that anything could be possible. Despite this seeming self-evident, many people don't accept or understand this, and this leads to unecessary assumptions and biases.
</li><li><b>Openness in Investigation</b>: It's crucial when starting research to be open to all possibilities, recognizing that there might be unexpected findings or paths in the research process. This is because not knowing what's true means not knowing what could be true or false, and which principles could be apt to determine these. 
</li><li><b>Reliance on External Information</b>: Leo indicates the importance of questioning the information already provided by others, whether in books or expert advice. The existing knowledge provided by others can sometimes be conflicting, and it is important to critically evaluate all sources of information.
</li><li><b>Deception and Denial</b>: Leo mentions that self-deception is the primary obstacle in the research process. Recognizing one's biases and weaknesses is a key part of developing a solid understanding, as well as the willingness to vigilantly scrutinize the self throughout the research journey.
</li><li><b>On recognizing self-deception as an enemy in research</b>: Leo Gura discusses that self-deception, particularly personal biases and weaknesses, is the biggest challenge when conducting research. He warns against outward judgment of others while overlooking one's own biases, which hampers the research process. He emphasizes the importance of emotional labor required when dealing with topics that trigger personal fears and insecurities.
</li><li><b>On understanding hidden assumptions of perspectives</b>: Leo highlights that every perspective on reality comes with hidden assumptions that are often overlooked. These assumptions serve as the foundation for one's perspective and significantly shape one's world view. He urges individuals to identify these hidden assumptions and constantly question them to avoid erroneous conclusions.
</li><li><b>On the partiality of perspectives</b>: He asserts that all perspectives on reality are partial and adopting any one of them will lead to incomplete understanding. He suggests studying multiple perspectives and adopting an impartial outlook to gain a comprehensive understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>On the difference between models and reality</b>: Leo stresses the difference between schematic representations or models of reality and the actual reality. He warns about the risk of conflating well-built models with reality, asserting that such a mistake can lead to a significant epistemic trap. 
</li><li><b>On the fallibility of foundationalism</b>:  Leo posits that the idea of foundationalism, or grounding theories in one indisputable truth, is proven to be false. He adds that having a notion of an indisputable, fundamental truth is unrealistic and attempts to establish such a truth have repeatedly failed.
</li><li><b>On the limitations of rationality</b>: He argues that rationality is too limited to be the sole tool for exploring and understanding reality, given that rationality is just a subset of reality. He advocates for the acceptance of the inherent irrationality at the beginning of the universe and the reality that much of the universe lacks rationality.
</li><li><b>On embracing paradoxes</b>: Lastly, Leo encourages embracing paradoxes encountered during research, suggesting that they are indicators of depth rather than obstacles. He raises the possibility that the essence of reality could itself be paradoxical.
</li><li><b>Paradoxes in Rationalizing Reality</b>: Leo encourages embracing paradoxes, stating that they might be an indication that one is trying to rationalize the entirety of reality. He suggests that chasing rational explanations for every aspect of existence can limit understanding, as there is more to reality than just rationality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Direct Experience</b>: Leo shares that one of his guiding principles is that direct experience is the "truest" source of information for investigation. He cautions against relying solely on external authority figures or personal reasoning abilities, stating that these can lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions. 
</li><li><b>Expanding Range of Experiences</b>: Expanding direct experiences beyond a narrow subset is essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of reality, says Leo. If one limits their frame of reference to a narrow band of experiences, it can obstruct the ability to develop a broader, holistic understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Practicality Matters</b>: Leo stresses the importance of not losing sight of practicality in the midst of philosophical exploration. The ultimate goal of seeking understanding should be improving the quality of life, mastering emotions, and achieving success in personal endeavors.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Defending a Position</b>: The process of understanding life should be devoid of defending any particular position, believes Leo. The pursuit should be centered around understanding what existence is and how to live it optimally, rather than rallying around a particular ideology or set of beliefs.
</li><li><b>Understanding versus Seeking Truth</b>: Leo advises focusing on understanding different elements of life rather than on the pursuit of absolute "truth." He explains that understanding is a more fluid concept, involving a bird's eye view on various aspects of existence rather than rigidly adhering to a set form of "truth."
</li><li><b>Seeking Holism</b>: Leo encourages seeking a holistic understanding when investigating or studying any subject, in contrast to hyper-specialization. He criticizes academic squabbles over minor points that have no relevance to practical life improvement. He suggests that focus should be on wider aspects of life rather than on niche academic points.
</li><li><b>Integration of fields</b>: Developing a comprehensive understanding requires examining and recognizing links between different subjects, not just immersing oneself in a singular field.
</li><li><b>Risks of argumentation and debate</b>: Engaging in argument and debate may hinder the pursuit of understanding, as it can lead to the defense of fixed positions rather than fostering openness to new ideas.
</li><li><b>Harmful loyalty to positions</b>: Defending a position fiercely can cause an individual to maintain outdated beliefs and inhibit the development of a comprehensive view of reality.
</li><li><b>Needs proper mindset to investigate reality</b>: Investigating the realities of life requires a certain mindset that acknowledges we may not know the truth and that understanding does not come solely from authority.
</li><li><b>Hindrances of the default position</b>: A c-complacent acceptance of the status quo or mainstream beliefs, without questioning them, limits one's understanding of life and creates persistent struggles.
</li><li><b>Limitations of an academic approach</b>: A narrow academic focus on one field may provide deep understanding in that area, but creates a lack of understanding in other aspects of life, inhibiting a holistic view.
</li><li><b>Shortfalls of a spiritual tradition approach</b>: Sticking to a specific spiritual tradition may offer personal growth and potentially enlightenment, but it will carry its own limitations and cultural biases, thereby limiting one's big picture understanding.
</li><li><b>Strict reliance on direct experience</b>: Using only direct experience as a way to understand reality can lead to self-deception and may limit understanding to personal perspectives.
</li><li><b>Principle of Commitment to Understanding</b>: Leo Gura advises committed dedication to understanding rather than position-taking. By avoiding the defense of any particular ideological positions and focusing on understanding, one's pursuit of knowledge becomes more effective.
</li><li><b>Importance of Avoiding Semantic Disputes and Nitpicking</b>: Gura suggests looking past semantic differences and focusing on the root teachings of different perspectives with the intent to personally experience and live them. He discourages nitpicking sources and encourages an open-minded, charitable approach towards reputable teachers and perspectives, no matter how radically different they may seem.
</li><li><b>Wide-Ranging Learning and Direct Experience Input</b>: Leo recommends learning from hundreds of differing sources, including spiritual and religious teachers, scientists, philosophers, and self-help authors. This wide spectrum of knowledge should be combined with one's direct experience, allowing one to test hypotheses and refine understanding through cross-referencing.
</li><li><b>Constant Evaluation and Refinement of Understanding</b>: By cross-referencing different perspectives and intuitions, Leo emphasizes that one's understanding will be constantly refined. Truth, according to Gura, stands out like a diamond in the sand and can be recognized with the strengthening of intuition.  
</li><li><b>Discrepancies as Potential Leads</b>: Leo identifies discrepancies between different teachings and perspectives as possible leads to follow for further learning and investigation. They need to be considered actively and followed up, as they could lead to deeper and broader understanding.
</li><li><b>Holding all Knowledge as Provisional</b>: All knowledge acquired should be held as provisional and open to revision or further understanding. This approach encourages constant progress, open-mindedness, and continued personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Adopting a Holistic Approach</b>: Gura highlights the importance of comprehensive and integrated approach in developing personal understanding and growth. It involves combining perspectives from different sources and aligning it with personal experiences. It emphasizes the constant refining of one's understanding through intuition and embracing discrepancies in knowledge as possible leads for deeper understanding. The knowledge acquired should be held provisionally, with an openness to revisions and further learning. This holistic method promotes constant progress, open-mindedness and sustained personal growth.
</li><li><b>Understanding as a continuous process of construction</b>: Leo Gura compares understanding to a building that's continually constructed, with some elements being discarded over time as one's knowledge changes and grows. He emphasizes the need to hold everything as provisional, without clinging to any piece of knowledge unquestioningly.
</li><li><b>Openness to being wrong</b>: Gura mentions the importance of being open to the possibility of being drastically wrong in one's understanding. Such openness includes receptivity to others' views and the readiness to acknowledge if one has followed a misguided path. This mindset stems from accepting that one knows nothing definitively, and that everything learned could be potentially incorrect.
</li><li><b>Adopting a positive outlook</b>: Despite the uncertainty and the potential pitfall of being completely wrong, Gura promotes adopting a positive outlook on the pursuit of understanding. He believes that understanding is achievable and will yield practical value. This optimistic stance is underpinned by faith in the worth of the investigative process, even if it doesn't initially yield the hoped-for results.
</li><li><b>Avoiding an attitude of defeat and ignorance</b>: Gura suggests that surrendering the quest for understanding and labeling the quest pointless can lead to a stagnant default position of absorbing mainstream ideas uncritically. Such an attitude only results in ignorance and aligns with the majority's status quo.
</li><li><b>Avoidance of loyalty to any one teaching</b>: Gura highlights the risk of becoming a loyalist to any one teaching or tradition as it can limit the attainment of a bigger picture understanding. Despite the potential benefits of following a single tradition, such loyalty can lead to a narrow perspective and ward off opportunities to explore various other perspectives.
</li><li><b>Being open to the absurd and counterintuitive aspects of reality</b>: Gura advises openness to the potential absurdity, irrationality, and counterintuitiveness of reality, considering it vital to discoveries about truth. Many limit their investigation by dismissing elements that seem irrational or illogical, becoming an obstacle in the path of discovering reality.
</li><li><b>Negligence of immediate utility and focus on long-term benefit</b>: Gura urges not to worry about immediate utility or short-term gains from investigations, instead focusing on long-term benefits. The fruits of intensive investigation may percolate slowly to one's life surface but can bring about remarkable life improvements.
</li><li><b>Importance of wisdom and growth over surface achievements</b>: Gura encourages seeking wisdom and personal growth over surface-level achievements like money. He believes this approach roots success deep within one's being, leading to a robust and resilient position immune to the challenges of external circumstances.
</li><li><b>Utilization of meta sources</b>: Gura recognizes the value of using meta sources, i.e., perspectives incorporating multiple perspectives for a holistic understanding. He himself serves as a meta source, having extracted information from various sources and perspectives to present an ever-evolving big picture of reality.
</li><li><b>On developing layered meta sources</b>: Leo Gura discusses the concept of developing a meta-meta source by accumulating various perspectives and sources. It's an ongoing process requiring continual adjustment and evolution until one's last breath.
</li><li><b>On the worthwhileness of the journey</b>: Gura emphasizes how the journey towards a comprehensive understanding of life is incredibly valuable, although it can be difficult to articulate its worth to those who have not gone through the process. This approach is intellectually satisfying, practical, and noticeable in how one lives their life. 
</li><li><b>On reconstructing beliefs</b>: Gura uses a metaphor likening the re-examination and modification of our beliefs to rebuilding a ship at sea. One must perpetually check and fix any problems, never taking for granted that the ship is in its best shape. This vigilance requires effort and energy throughout one's entire life.
</li><li><b>On overcoming objections to the research process</b>: Gura acknowledges that the research process may lead one to explore unproductive topics but clarifies that such dead ends are an inherent part of the exploration. Trivial roads need to not deter one's pursuit for big-picture understanding. 
</li><li><b>On drawing the line with research</b>: Gura admits the impossibility of knowing where to draw the line in terms of what is worth investigating. He advises relaxing the need for immediate efficiency or tangible outcomes, emphasizing the long-term benefits of the process.
</li><li><b>On risks and avoiding silly beliefs</b>: Gura acknowledges the risk of adopting erroneous beliefs and emphasizes that this risk is inherent, irrespective of whether one aligns with mainstream beliefs or not. He promotes his approach as the best way to minimize these risks by encouraging openness to varied perspectives without equating all perspectives as equal.
</li><li><b>Importance of Pursuit for Truth and Understanding</b>: In this section, Leo Gura argues against ignoring the pursuit for truth and understanding based on the idea that it might be time and energy-consuming. He emphasizes that the accumulation of subtle effects over time can lead to a life transformation, which is worth the pursuit. Gura also cautions about the short-term, narrow-minded approach in life, suggesting that it commonly leads to unsatisfactory outcomes.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Pursuit of Enlightenment</b>: Gura challenges the belief that focusing solely on the pursuit of enlightenment is the answer to understanding reality. He argues that even after becoming enlightened, there is still uncertainty  as enlightenment could just be another illusion or a scam. He advocates for maintaining an openness to the possibility of more, to other perspectives and the potential for other practical considerations beyond enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Caution against Certain Beliefs or Positions</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of being extremely cautious about firmly held beliefs and the perceived understanding of reality. He advocates maintaining a broadly open-minded approach and highlights his own practice of being flexible, open and willing to question everything.
</li><li><b>Warning About His Own Apparent Certainty</b>: Gura points out a perceived contradiction between his outward demeanor and his internal approach to understanding. Although he may appear certain or even arrogant in his presentations, Gura assures that he maintains a strong inward humility and carefulness while studying perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Self-vigilance</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of vigilance and being aware of self-deceptions. He lists himself as his own greatest obstacle in pursuit of understanding, and states that he's acutely aware of the potential blind spots in his understanding. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org and Future Plans</b>: In this section, Leo Gura promotes his website, Actualized.org where he shares new content and recommended readings. He also communicates his passion for research and promises to share mind-blowing findings in the future. 
</li><li><b>Ongoing research and future prospects</b>: Gura expresses his commitment to studying personal development, seeking the best techniques, methods, and frameworks to help people elevate their consciousness. Looking ahead, he promises more eye-opening and profound insights in the future that can challenge conventional thinking and beliefs.
