hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're talking going to talk about how to stop
worrying okay this is a big one this is a
deep topic that I can barely cover in the this
little quick self-help segment but let's crack into it I'm
going to give you some practical tips and also how
you understand what is it the cause of your worrying
why are you worrying so much first thing to understand
we all worry this is just how the human mind
works where natural warriors we're worrying all the time why
because your lower self and your reptilian brain is always
on the lookout for problems it's always looking for something
that is going to be on the horizon that you
gotta watch out for there's always a fear lurking somewhere
there's always a worst-case scenario it's really good at catastrophizing
situations so that is why you're worrying and you probably
think that this is a good thing if you are
like me and you had a problem with where I
had a problem with wearing so I still do but
at least I understand now after doing years of personal
development work that the worry is a big mind game
and it's a trap it's like a sand bit and
if you do not understand this idea that worry is
useless then you are really sucked in to the worry
here's the problem is that your mind is always going
to worry about something it's always going to five fears
and those fears always going to be projected so what
you got to do is you got to start to
tame that and what that is called is actually taming
your gremlin you literally have like a gremlin in your
mind this little devil's advocate that is criticizing all the
time it's judging all the time it's always casting blame
at you all the time and so this gremlin is
in your mind it's running around in there and it's
causing havoc chaos and when you're worrying this much you're
not able to get good results in your life not
to mention feel good you definitely don't feel good because
you're always frantic and anxious but you're you're probably not
getting the results you want in your life from fitness
to business to to relationships because this worry is creating
sabotage for you quite simply right you keep telling yourself
that something is going to happen you focus on it
so much that you actually end up attracting it to
you maybe you're so worried that the relationship you're in
is going to break up and that you're going to
end up alone that you become so needy in that
relationship that you actually end up alienating the person that
really loved you and then you actually do end up
alone and it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy effect and then
you say well look I should have been worrying about
that because it actually happened it was a real problem
when in fact that was created by your negative thinking
how about business let's say you're starting a business and
you're worried that the economy is bad and that starting
a new business nowadays is not really possible it's too
hard it's going to require a lot of work and
it's probably going to fail if you have that kind
of thought and you go in and start a business
what you think is going to happen well your mind
is going to start to focus on all the challenges
that before you and it's going to start to point
fingers and say look that technique for starting a business
didn't work because like I said the economy is bad
and nobody wants to buy anything and this this process
here doesn't work either because that it uh whatever and
you just go through and you keep saying no no
no no no look at this look at that I
told you so I know it's going to fail I
just know it's going to fail and what do you
think happens to your motivation what do you think happens
to your resourcefulness and your perseverance in making that business
work and creating a business is something that requires a
lot of resourcefulness a lot of creativity and a lot
of perseverance and if you're lacking those well you can
get a pretty good idea of what's going to happen
but your mind in its infinite trickiness will say but
that's how it is that's how reality is that's how
the market is it just is that way businesses are
hard to start and I knew that that was going
to happen so this worry was completely justified and the
fact that it failed now is not because of the
worry it's because of the reality of the situation so
those are two examples of how you could be creating
self-sabotage with your worry so what do we do about
this you know is it always the case that worry
has a purpose or it doesn't have a purpose well
I don't know how it really is but I think
for practical purposes to run your life as effectively as
possible from everything that I researched and everything that I've
experimented with out myself then here's what you want to
believe you want to hold the belief that worry is
entirely useless there is no point nothing empowering about the
process of worrying ever ever ever ever ever you never
worry you never want to worry now of course it
doesn't mean that you're going to not worry anymore because
it's deeply ingrained in you you cannot beat that out
of yourself even if you tried what you can do
is you can reduce that and then you could also
reduce the amount of episodes of worrying that you have
so just a simple fact that you start - from
now on believe that worry is useless is already going
to eliminate some episodes of worry and it's going to
reduce the severity of them so maybe you're gonna let's
say go to work next week and you've got a
big presentation in front of the boss and you need
to really impress the boss and then the boss's boss
is there you got to really make a good presentation
otherwise well your mind fills in the blank something bad
is going to happen maybe you can get fired right
you might think well it's good to think about the
fact that I'm gonna get fired because that motivates me
that charges me up I'm worried but that worry is
creating some sort of action in me which is actually
going to get me to overcome my procrastination to work
on that project get it done and that's how done
in the past in the past when I worried about
something that's gotten me to action that was like a
fire under my ass okay I hear what you're saying
I've had that experience myself but if you didn't worry
if that worry wasn't there I would argue that you
would do equally better I mean equally as good as
if you did worry or better and in many many
cases you're gonna do better and better by a lot
because what's happening is that that worry is is creating
self-fulfillment it's creating a it's creating like a self sabotaging
effect on yourself because the drain your energy literally your
psychic energy your mental resources your willpower and your focus
is being drained on this worry and that worry is
not productive in and of itself it might light a
fire under your ass for a short bit of time
but in and of itself it's not going to actually
take the action that's not going to create the presentation
for yourself it's not so what you got to say
is you got to say wait a minute okay catch
yourself in the middle of the worrying process because you're
probably gonna be some or in the middle of it
then you gotta say wait a minute from now on
I thought I believed that worry is no longer is
no longer powering it doesn't serve any function so I'm
gonna try to just cut it out this weren't even
though I think that it's going to help it's actually
not helping it would be better if what I did
was I just focused my attention on the things that
I could control things that I could do how about
I just focus on what I could do for this
presentation rather than worrying on all the worst case scenarios
that will happen if I don't do what I need
to do why don't I just do them why don't
I just start to think about all the cool stuff
that's going to happen if I do it well right
how about that for change for you pessimists out there
that's probably you probably your jaw dropped I know for
me sometimes that is that is the case is I'm
so caught up in the worrying and just sometimes I'll
just stop myself and I'll realize what's happening I'll be
in that worry spiral and I realize what's happening and
I'm like whoa what if I just was thinking about
the flip side of all that instead of thinking about
how my business is going to fail and nothing's going
to work out what if I think about the fact
that it's going to succeed and things are going to
work out better than I thought they did it's like
180 degree shift and it's like whoa when I start
thinking about that then all the sudden it's like okay
that's really cool well if that's the case what if
I then do this and then what if I use
that strategy that maybe this other strategy will work and
then maybe I'll get some more money and then maybe
I can do some more advertising and then maybe I
can get some more clients and then I can make
it when I get more clients I'll get more money
and then I can use that money to create a
better product and then we'll just build on itself and
now you get excited now you get a vision now
you want to go out there you take so this
is positive motivation versus the negative motivation that you get
with worry so even though we can create motivation it's
not a really good high quality type of motivation and
besides you're going to feel awful why would you want
to want why would you want to motivate yourself with
with pain when you can motivate yourself with pleasure and
ambition and desire much more powerful right so other ways
of stopping worrying I think the biggest one is to
start to get more awareness around the fact that you
are worrying and be honest with yourself if you're a
constant worrier and all you do is you think negative
thoughts all the time and you are always catastrophizing situations
and especially if you worry about stuff that is out
of your control that you have nothing that you can
do about and especially if you worry about things and
then if you look back in your past you see
that most of stuff that you worry about doesn't actually
pan out for you it never becomes an issue in
the first place then you really got to admit that
you've got a negative thinking problem your pessimist and your
a constant worrying I'll constant worrier and if that's the
case then you know that's where you're at that's a
valuable insight to have now what you got to do
is you got to start a gradual process of bringing
more awareness to your worry start noticing when you're thinking
negatively stop periodically throughout your day for just a few
minutes and just notice how are you feeling are you
feeling anxious frustrated anything negative and then notice what are
you thinking because your thoughts are creating the feelings if
you're always anxious there's only one reason why you are
only anxious because you are visualizing very vividly negative things
to yourself that means you're visualizing yourself bombing the presentation
you're visualizing yourself bombing the final exam you're visualizing yourself
wanting a poor destitute on the street in rags you're
visualizing yourself being rejected by your boyfriend or girlfriend you're
visualizing your marriage crumbling you're visualizing your kids dying you're
visualizing these very catastrophic things and that is of course
creating frustration and negative feelings inside you how could it
not you got to start to shift out of that
and start to basically do the flip of it right
the opposite and what's the opposite of worry it's what
I call positive worry other books talk about it too
it's positive worry why don't you adopt a habit for
the next seven days of positive worrying that means what
you do is you do the same thing as you
would if you were worrying about the situation but everything
you worry about is the positive of it so that
means you're going to think about that presentation and your
think about it a lot but you can think about
all the amazing stuff you can think about that you're
going to do better than expected you're gonna you're gonna
think about how maybe you're going to get a raise
what if you get a raise you're going to consider
hypotheticals and that's kind of how what worrying is is
a consideration of hypotheticals but improper worrying it's negative hypotheticals
and here you're going to consider positive hypotheticals like what
if I really a stat presentation and then I get
a raise from that we know what if what if
what if the people on my team get really inspired
by that presentation what if I actually learn something about
myself in the process what if what if what if
what if all this positive stuff so start doing that
do that for a week and see how you feel
I think you'll start to notice just how much worrying
you do and that will create the inner shift you
need just to start to get a handle on it
it's going to take you a while to really get
a solid handle on it but you got to start
somewhere so that's a good place to start it even
if you've got a decent handle on your worrying you
can still start with this exercise it's still a really
really powerful exercise to do all right this is Leo
