hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to control anger
all right so let's break into this how to control
anger in this video we're going to talk about in
about 15 minutes we're going to quickly cover a lot
of stuff so it's going to be a jam-packed session
we're going to talk about what anger is the root
causes of anger ways to manage anger that are just
covering up the root cause and then how to actually
get at the root cause to fix your anger problems
more permanently we're also going to talk about different techniques
practical techniques that you can use to control your anger
and also techniques for going deeper and introspecting and getting
at that root cause that we're talking about I'm going
to give you some really powerful techniques here if you
just use them think that can help you quite a
bit so let's crack into it first thing that I
will tell you is you know this issue of anger
it's a little hard for me to relate to throughout
my life I don't know why it's been this way
but it's always been hard for me to get angry
at stuff of course I do get angry I get
frustrated which is frustration is a lower form of anger
I get irritated sometimes but like really full-out rage anger
I don't really get that and it's a little bit
hard for me to relate to people that do even
though I do study a lot of this stuff so
I do understand it on a logical level I don't
really you know I don't experience it myself emotionally so
ultimately I want to ask you because when I see
people being angry I see people in rage like full-on
rage having these episodes where they're just blowing up at
other people getting frustrated yelling at them getting into heated
discussions or flaming somebody on a message board you know
whatever that is when I see that to me it's
like whoa what is going on there that person is
at such a low level of consciousness and self-control that
to me is just disgusting it's literally disgusting and I'm
disgusted when I see it and I'm discuss it when
I say to myself - on those rare occasions so
you know what the hell are you angry about honestly
what are you angry about you need to wake up
life is short life is beautiful and you're a [
__ ] loser if you're angry all the time and
you're exploding at people that's not a problem with the
world that's a problem with you so let's get very
clear on that someone who is in a conscious state
someone who is living a charged life someone who has
emotional intelligence does not get angered easily like I will
get angry when something extreme happens like when my life
is threatened when you know when I have some severe
catastrophe that might happen when my family is threatened like
those are cases where ok if that happens fine get
angry but throughout your day if you're driving in your
car I don't care how bad the traffic is if
something at work is not going quite well or something's
happening in your relationship you should not be getting angry
at those situations at all like you should not be
your blood should not be boiling you should never be
yelling you should never be so frustrated that you want
to punch a wall if that's happening to you something
is wrong there something is wrong with your psychology you
need to start to get that psychology dialed in that's
what we're going to talk about now so one quote
that comes to mind from reading all this self-help material
is uh there was this quote and I forget exactly
which book it was from but it went something like
this analogy which said that when you're angry at someone
it's kind of like going to the store and buying
a bag of rat poison because you've got a rat
infestation at home coming home and then consuming that poison
yourself well you don't realize you think that when you're
angry you get to express yourself and that somehow maybe
that resolves the situation somehow that that releases your emotions
and all of a sudden things are lighter better but
in fact what you're doing is you're not helping yourself
in any way deep down psychologically you're injuring yourself even
more than person that you're angry at you're not going
to have an amazing successful life happy fulfilling life if
you're angry it's just not going to happen it's impossible
so I really want to motivate you to start to
go on a journey to discover what the root causes
that's what if you take away one thing from this
video it's that that is the thing you don't need
a quick little technique for how to just control or
relieve some anger what you need is you need to
go on a journey to discover what the source of
it is so let's talk about what anger is as
an emotion because I I bet that most people out
there don't even realize what anger means as an emotional
signal so every emotion is actually a signal that your
mind your subconscious mind is sending to your conscious mind
and these signals you can learn to to decipher the
messages because the messages are pretty simple if you just
think about them you can gain more awareness around them
and then you can actually use and kind of use
the anger to point you in the right direction you
can use the anger against itself kind of like a
key towing the anger into something positive so what is
anger the reason that you become angry is because you
perceive somebody else or some situation out there violating your
standards or your model of reality so you have a
certain model of reality you have a certain thought process
and belief process about how reality should be you have
certain ideals so maybe one of your ideals is being
honest maybe the other ideal of yours is performing work
well maybe other idea of the ideal of yours as
being very creative or maybe another ideal of yours as
being humorous and so what happens is that we all
have these ideals for each person's a litte bit different
what happens is we have these ideals and then when
we see other people not fulfilling those ideals which are
ours they might not be those person's ideals then we
get angry at it for example we see somebody lying
we catch someone in a lie and we say ah
you're lying you shouldn't be doing that you should be
honoring honesty and we get angry at that person even
though if we go and we do a search we
can find cases where we ourselves have done similar things
in the past or it could be with let's say
humor I had one client at one time who was
really the humor and he loved to do he'll have
to do comedy he let's do improv and one of
the things that was really high on his list of
values is humor and then one of the things that
he really didn't like what was interesting is humorless people
and why is that well because he has this value
of humor of joy funniness and when he doesn't perceive
it in others then he he doesn't like that it
rubs him the wrong way and we're going to get
into the deeper reasons of why that is in a
second so really anger is about violation of standards what
I want you to start to realize though to get
a little bit more awareness around this is that your
standards are your own they are not necessarily the standards
of another person and so you have to start to
understand that there is this distinction and so when somebody
else is not living up to your standard if to
ask yourself well could they have a different value system
than I do and could I be okay with that
could I be okay with somebody else having different values
and not having to judge them for that because in
the end that's what you're doing is you're judging you're
pointing the finger at someone and you're saying ah you
did that ah you did this and you get upset
at that you know someone cuts you off on the
road and you get upset of that person why because
you think that that's wrong they should observe proper Road
etiquette yet how many times in your life have you
cut someone off maybe you cut someone off you didn't
even realize it one of the easy quick little technique
that I'm gonna give you right now to fight rote
rage is to get curious whenever something happens on the
road to you just starts out get inside the mind
of the other person ask yourself what is actually going
on there so someone just cut me off he's being
an ass he's not observing proper Road etiquette okay but
then ask yourself the next question like have I ever
done that myself yes maybe I don't do it all
the time maybe I'm better than that person but I
probably have done it once or twice okay what went
on with me at that time that I did it
was I in a rush because I had to get
someone real somewhere important really fast or did I have
a sick baby in my in my car and I
needed to get to the hospital or maybe there was
an important report that was due at work or important
business meeting or maybe I was just so upset because
I just had a breakup with my relationship that I
was driving and I was just being careless and I
was being being Petty and being mean you know think
about that and wonder that if that person is doing
something that you think isn't right they probably have some
sort of justification for it and just start to get
curious about what that justification is even if it's wrong
even if they're wrong just get curious that will naturally
get you shifted out of the outrage that you have
into more of this kind of just wandering mindset it'll
give you more consciousness it will reduce your anger so
that's a quick little technique for road rage and you
can use that for all forms of anger really because
anger is the root of anger is the same no
matter where it happens in your life whether it's a
relationship at work or on the road all right so
the the next technique that I'm going to give you
is I want you to just allow yourself be angry
the point here is that to get yourself out of
anger permanently you need to start to develop and raise
your consciousness the more consciousness you have the more conscious
awareness the more you're going to be able to control
your angry episodes and what you got to start to
do is just let yourself be angry after watching this
video tomorrow for the next week try this just observe
yourself the next time you're angry try to remember this
video and try to remember this point that I'm making
now is just just be the watcher let your anger
happen and watch it happen as though you were a
third-person observer like you were looking at yourself on a
TV monitor or on a camera and just let it
play out don't try to control yourself don't try to
judge yourself be angry so go ahead and yell at
that yell at that person that worked go ahead and
flick that guy off who cut you off on the
road you know go ahead and yeah let your spouse
do it but watch yourself there's a big difference between
doing that and not seeing yourself doing it and doing
it and at the mote in the moment that you're
doing it to be watching yourself watch yourself throughout the
whole episode and just notice what happens where you're going
to start to see is if you do that if
your discipline is enough to do this and you actually
remember you don't get triggered too much you're going to
see that as you're watching yourself you're going to stop
becoming angry you cannot it's almost impossible psychologically for you
to be watching yourself doing something mean or hurtful or
spiteful or outrageous or angry like that yelling at someone
for example while at the same time watching yourself it's
almost impossible because you're too high consciousness for that that
is pettiness that only operates on a low consciousness level
so if you can raise your consciousness to the point
where you're watching it and you're just observing it not
judging you're just observing it you're gonna start to see
that I don't need to yell at that person right
now you're gonna start to see you know what that
guy cut me off but I don't need to flick
him off I don't need to even honk at him
you're gonna start to notice that maybe someone said something
mean to you and you're gonna say you know what
I don't I don't even need to respond just because
you're watching yourself you might start to respond then you'll
you'll notice yourself is like oh I'm just about to
say something petty and nasty and you see yourself in
it's like you know I don't really I don't really
feel like saying that I still might be a little
bit upset I might be hurt but I don't need
to respond in an angry way okay the next technique
I'm going to give you is and I'm not going
to go into the depth of this but meditation if
you're an angry person meditation might be the saving graces
for you start to develop a habit of meditation I'm
not going to go into all the nitty-gritty of that
it's a little bit too much for one video I
have other videos that talk about the benefits of meditation
other videos to talk about the how to develop a
meditation habit and make it stick but all I'm gonna
say about meditation is that it calms your mind it
puts you into present moment and it rages your conscious
awareness so develop a habit of meditating I always say
start with 20 minutes every sin day in the morning
or in the evening be very consistent about it and
you will notice that it has a profound effect on
how peaceful and calm you feel throughout your day throughout
your whole week and that of course will diminish angry
episodes in your life it will reduce their severity it
will reduce the amount of them and it will have
many many other benefits for you in the long run
as well so consider that all right let's after I
gave you some practical techniques because I want to give
you some context to control your anger right now but
what I also want to talk about is the root
of your anger and the root of your anger is
a disintegration of different parts within you what you're doing
when you're angry all the time is that you're denying
something within yourself you're repressing something that's the core of
it and this is probably stemming from some sort of
childhood trauma or maybe even adulthood trauma some sort of
events that have shaped your personality have shaped your ego
in such a way where now you feel like there's
something within you that you need to repress because what
you've done is you've set up these high moral standards
but at the same time your subconscious mind also realizes
how hard you have to fight to live up to
those moral standards and that you're not perfect at them
yourself so when you see somebody else breaking those standards
you become extra critical because you want to shift the
focus away from yourself now this is a deep idea
your ego in fact if you've ever heard this idea
before your ego is not going to accept it you're
being either gloss over this you're gonna ignore this you're
going to say no that just doesn't apply to me
you're wrong you need to do more introspection to understand
really what's going on here and this is I'm telling
you this is factually what's happening is that when you're
getting angry at someone the only reason you're getting angry
is because there's a disowned part of you that you
are really angry at you have not integrated it so
for example you you might think that being honest is
super super important and therefore whenever you see dishonesty you
always call it out you always get angry at that
person yet what are the areas in your life that
you are dishonest in think about that that is more
of a subtle point than you are willing to admit
right now so maybe you're going to say well Leo
I'm actually a super super honest guy I'm honest all
the time I try so hard to be honest I
try to be more honest than everybody else I see
out in the world so I'm entitled to this I'm
entitled to be judgmental of people okay but just that
very struggle that you're going through is already telling us
that there's a disintegration within you because you would not
have to struggle so hard to be honest all the
time if you were truly and naturally comfortable with being
honest so what's happening is that you're really forcing yourself
into an unnatural inauthentic state and your body in your
mind is rebelling against it and therefore that is causing
you to project your anger out into the world in
situations where you see that in situations that highlight your
own disowned mint in your own disintegration what you do
is you focus on the other party on the other
person because it's more comfortable for your ego to look
for the problem out there in the world that admit
that you have a problem inside and anger is all
about the inside it's not about the world at all
it's not about the external world it's all about the
internal world it's about the beliefs you have it's about
the self-image that you have so that is where you
have to work do that deep work to really get
your anger controlled permanently and this can be done it
takes work it takes introspection there are various techniques I
can't go into all of them now coaching is great
for that therapy is great for that various awareness techniques
I would start you off with just being an observer
go with that technique and do some meditation those two
will have some big impact on the level of anger
that you experience all right so that is it I'm
going to wrap it up there that is how to
