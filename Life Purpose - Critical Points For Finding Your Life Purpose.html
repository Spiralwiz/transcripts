hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org and
I am here in Zion National Park in Utah and
today as I'm up here on our path towards angels
landing just up behind the mountains I thought I would
talk about life purpose and what life purpose is and
really ask you the question and that is what is
your life purpose what is your purpose in life and
by that I mean what kind of impact do you
want to have what is your life about are you
just living your life going about the day-to-day the nine-to-five
like most people do or do you have something that's
driving you to that's deeper some sort of principles that
you're living by something that you want to accomplish some
sort of impact that you want to have with your
life and being driven by that now it's interesting that
life purpose I always intuitively understood that it was something
that was very important to figure out because if you
don't have a life purpose then nothing is grounding you
in what you're doing and you're like a leaf in
the wind you're just blowing around you don't have any
anything there that is connecting your job to your deepest
values you don't have anything there that's connecting everything that
you're doing in your life your deepest values and so
first of all I think it's difficult to be fulfilled
when you don't have a purpose second of all I
think you'll just have this sense of loss and you'll
have this sense of just blowing around in the wind
as it were and not being able to accomplish the
kind of great success that you might want whether its
financial or whether it's a certain prestige you want to
have certain reputation you want to have whether it's within
your relationships whatever and the life purpose is very deep
and personal thing for everybody it's going to be something
different the question is do you know what yours is
and I spent a lot of my own time figuring
out what my purpose is for me and that has
taken taken its time it's not something which I like
originally the way that I thought it would be is
that I would just either have a purpose to begin
with as I was growing up or I would pick
a purpose and then set myself on that track and
then just there it is you know one sentence purpose
do x2 dua whatever what what actually happens I think
is purpose life purpose is a much deeper topic and
nobody really tells you about this but David data in
his book way the superior man has a really good
discussion about life purpose and about the way that it
works it's it's more like an onion with a bunch
of layers to it so it's not just this simple
one-sentence definition of what it is that you're doing with
your life it's more like you are the onion and
you've got all these layers to you and so you
start with the outer layer and the outer layer is
is just like your your basic intuitions as to what
you want to be doing with your life and by
purpose I mean and by what you're doing with your
life mostly related to your career because you're spending eight
hours a day 40 hours a week probably if not
more than that on your career so you want that
to be something that is is important to you something
that that is deeply fulfilling for you because if you're
not doing that think about it eight hours a day
forty hours a week that's like a third of your
life spent on your job so if and then the
rest and then another thirty your life just is spent
sleeping so third of its spent sleeping a third of
it is spent working and then another third of it
is spent doing other miscellaneous things you want that third
that you spend working to be something that's fulfilling for
you and so what David data's talks about is that
you're like an onion and you've got that outer layer
that you start with and that outer layer is just
your basic intuition as to what you want to be
doing and then what happens is you go and you
pursue that thing you try it out you're feeling around
when you're new at this you don't really know what
you should be doing so you're feeling around maybe you
like this thing or you don't like that thing you
get little hints here and there and then you peel
that layer back as it were you peel it back
and then you reach another deeper layer inside and then
you work on that for a while you work on
that and you think that that's the thing that you're
really after and then you start to see that it
starts to peel away as well and there's something deeper
there and so you go even deeper and then you
get to another layer and you peel that away and
so this process really is the dynamic process the dynamic
way to think about life purpose it's not just a
static thing it's a dynamic thing and it's something that
keeps evolving over the course of your life so maybe
you're the kind of person right now that has no
idea what they want to be doing with their life
maybe just have kind of a dead-end job that you
just doing just to earn money that means you got
to start with that the outermost layer and start working
on that and working your way inwards and that outer
layer is the first one you got to start with
and it might take you a year just to figure
out the first layer but maybe you're already pretty deep
into it and maybe you already feel like you have
a pretty pretty decent career you went to school you
know that what you're doing is something that that is
resonating with you but still there's more right that means
you've penetrated maybe past that first surface but then there's
there's still more in there and what is more mean
there well what is it that you really want to
bring forward and share with the world what kind of
impact do you want to have through your job so
maybe you're already happy you know you already have a
decent job maybe you're an engineer or you're an artist
you're a graphics designer or whatever it is that you're
doing maybe you know that that's the line of work
that you want to be working in but maybe now
the next step for you is going off on your
own and maybe doing your own thing because what you're
doing at your job right now you feel like it's
not letting you express yourself fully it's not letting you
share your full potential and it's not letting you have
the kind of impact that you really want to have
at your job maybe that means going and finding another
job that's that's along the same lines so let's say
if you're a web designer maybe you're still going to
be a web designer but now you're going to go
to a different company because that company is more in
line with the values that you have maybe they're working
on websites the kind of websites that you're more interested
in that you feel are are necessary and important for
the world to to experience and to see and to
interact with so maybe it's like that or maybe you
feel like you've been a web designer and that's you've
been that way for a few years you've been working
at it and now you feel like it's totally not
your gig anymore and you found it you found out
an important lesson here that even though Web Design is
not your purpose now you've kind of peeled back that
first layer and now you're going deeper and it's like
okay my purpose is something something else so I like
maybe I like art and I like and I like
programming maybe I can mix those somehow in some other
way somewhat original way maybe I should go in and
do something that's like an offshoot of web development so
maybe it's like that and you just keep drilling deeper
and deeper and deeper until you get to some sort
of core and I don't know if this core is
ever gotten to it might be just kind of an
idea that you're trying to strive for but ultimately what
you're trying to do is you're trying to dig deeper
and try to get to the core of of yourself
really if who you are figuring out what your values
are and the kind of expression you want to have
so you're a hundred percent authentically expressing yourself through your
work and how do you want that to be because
this is a choice for you there's so many different
ways regardless of the kind of values that you have
there's so many different ways that you can actually go
out there and manifest them in the real world right
there's so many different careers that will line up with
the kind of impact that you want to have in
the world or maybe you have a very specific objective
maybe you want to have a specific influence on on
different people in society maybe you want to have a
specific influence on maybe on kids or maybe on seniors
or maybe on people that have suffered through the same
kind of problems that you've suffered through and so that
is your purpose and now you got to start figuring
out how do I get my life aligned with that
purpose and that's the trick right because not only does
it take sometimes years to figure out what your purpose
is then it takes a lot of courage and actual
action to get your life aligned with it I'll give
you an example when I started off I always thought
that my purpose since I was kid was to be
a video game designer and that's something that I've pursued
very vigorously and eventually I got up after college I
finished college I got hired by a pretty nice game
design studio up in Boston and I I moved all
the way from California to Boston and I started working
there and I thought that that was going to be
my dream job and that was gonna be fulfilling my
purpose and then when I realized when I was at
Boston about a year later I realized that there was
there was aspects of me that were not coming out
there at that job even though I loved designing video
games there were just certain aspects that I feel were
being repressed and I couldn't be completely expressive for example
I felt like I needed autonomy in how the overall
big picture of the design of the game was coming
along I didn't have much say in that so I
felt like that was something that I couldn't bite my
tongue and and carry on with that that's something I
had to do something about so what I ended up
doing is through much consternation I ended up having to
start my own business and it wasn't even a game
development it was internet marketing business so that I could
fund so I could build the capital that I needed
in order to then start my own game business and
so I went through a year-long process of starting a
business and then running my internet marketing business for about
three or four years I still have it but I
don't take an active role in it anymore and so
the idea there was that I had to really take
a lot of Kurt it took a lot of courage
to leave a job that was a really nice position
that had a lot of room for growth in it
and then I would get a lot of experience from
but leaving it because I knew that it somehow wasn't
aligned with who I really was and so it took
me really three years to kind of to go start
a new business get involved in all this stuff take
all this action just to bring my life into some
sort of alignment but counter totally what I figured out
was that it brought me out of alignment because internet
marketing was not something I wanted to do in fact
it was something that I hated doing and that I
wanted to get myself out of I was just using
it as a means to build capital and so in
that case what I have to do is I had
to reconnect with my purpose had to find what my
purpose was going to be and I didn't know at
that time what it was going to be I had
ideas you know there are things that I kind of
gravitate towards but how to actually make that into something
that's valuable to other people how to make it into
something that actually produces money for yourself so you can
support yourself with it and how to make it such
that you can express yourself in that position that you're
in so that you're not beholden to some sort of
other company or sometimes a client or some sort of
special interest that's going to undermine the creative vision that
you have the kind of impact that you want to
have well that's tricky you know that takes a lot
of work and designing your life around that is is
definitely challenging it's something that takes years of effort to
do and it's like a long-term goal that you can
set for yourself but I think it's really important to
do that because what else would you do with your
life I mean if you're not pursuing a purpose if
you don't have some sort of concrete objective in mind
as to the kind of impact that you want to
have with everything that you're doing in your life specifically
your work then you're just going to be floundering and
you're going to be going here to there you're going
to maybe be motivated by a bigger paycheck maybe going
to be motivated by better benefits maybe you're going to
be motivated by a nicer company that has better reputation
and so you're going to be doing that and doing
this back and forth but you're not going to be
really expressing who you are and if you're lucky enough
to have the kind of job where you're doing that
and you're totally passionate about it and you love it
then I think that's great and you should be really
grateful and thankful that you have that because most people
I think don't and because I think most people don't
take the time to plan this thing out long term
and to do the introspection that's necessary over a course
of months and years to build a life purpose and
to design their life around it I think because of
that a lot of people are lost and a lot
of people are living mediocre lives quite simply because it's
hard to have a massive impact on others without being
very dedicated to it without putting that intention into it
it's hard to do that accidentally right and I think
if you look at all the great visionaries out there
that have started amazing companies and have done amazing things
amazing politicians and businessmen and political leaders and anybody like
that in society you know they knew what they wanted
either the lives and they pursued it with with like
with determination with total determination because if you're not doing
that then you're just kind of like living your life
day to day and that tends to lead to a
mediocre kind of life so the point of this video
is to to really get you to understand and to
see that life purpose is it's a dynamic shifting evolving
thing and even right now even like as my purpose
right now is is to coach other people to counsel
the people on personal development issues to become really well-versed
in personal development and to apply it to my own
life so that I can help others apply it in
their lives that's my purpose at this point but that's
something that's evolving for me as well like that's pretty
abstract in generic there's so many different ways that can
flesh out you know should I do that through more
coaching or should I do that through through a through
my website or should I do that through public speaking
or should I do that through running seminars like or
writing books there's so many different ways that it can
be done and all the time I'm still thinking about
my purpose I'm still peeling those layers back I feel
I felt like I've peeled the outermost layers that onion
I'm getting a little bit deeper and so it's nice
to start to feel it out after about like God
four years and now I'm starting to peel like those
inner layers and that's really exciting and empowering start peeling
those inner layers and understanding that on some level there's
a core to you that is just you your deepest
values and things that you really want out of life
the things that excite you they get you creative your
creative juices flowing so there's that and that might be
an eighth on some level but then there's also what
you want to create and that's something very conscious right
so there's there's any I can take my life from
this point on to wherever I want it to go
any way I want and so now it's really a
question of where do I want to take it and
now it's about asking myself well what-what would I like
to do more what I like to do more writing
what I like to do more public speaking what I
like to do more videos you know what I like
to be traveling the world what is it and started
starting to to feel that out because you can't really
tell ahead of time what's going to resonate with you
what you're going to like what you're not going to
like you can have certain intuitions and certain guesses but
a lot of times what I found is that I
have to go into something and actually do it for
a while until I really start to like to develop
a love for it or maybe I'll figure out that
it's not something that I loved after all and so
I'll have to I'll have to shift and do course
corrections dynamically so to speak right so this stuff is
not something that you can just plan out you can't
just sit down and plan it all out for yourself
and set it in stones is something that's going to
shift and evolve for you over time and best way
to start to work on your purpose is to start
asking yourself questions questions like what would you be doing
if you had all the money in the world and
money was not a motivating force for you anymore what
would you be doing with your time what kind of
impact do you want to have on the world well
you know what kind of legacy do you want to
leave behind after you're dead what do you want people
to remember you for and and what do you feel
most proud of what kind of accomplishments in your life
do you feel most proud of because chances are those
accomplishments that you feel very of already are giving you
little senses of what would really make you very fulfilled
if you did it full-time at a very very high
level and you just like gave yourself completely to that
process of creating creating value creating value for people because
I think inherently if you think that your life is
all about you you you and what you can get
and about you know how much money you get or
what kind of car you can have a kin a
house you can have how much travel you can do
that's that's going to be limiting there's going to be
a limit to how much fulfillment you can get from
that you're going to get a little bit of titillation
here and there but ultimately that's going to let's go
sir if you feel empty you're going to start to
want to contribute you're going to start to want to
influence other people and the question is how do you
want to do that and there's probably already different ways
in your life that you've done that and you felt
good about it but you just haven't really forged a
career out of it and you haven't set that deliberate
conscious intention to make it your purpose and to be
something that you're going to pursue so that you're the
master over a course of years and decades and so
that's what I want you to start thinking about working
with the life coach is a really good way to
start to get your head around life purpose if you
don't know what your purpose is at all that's a
good way or place to start and if you already
do know your purpose but you feel like you're not
living up to your full potential well then that's also
a good place to start because then we can kind
of pick you up and take you from where you
are right now and take you to to your dream
career to your to that path that's going to leave
you completely fulfilled and that's something that I personally love
to do that's why I really got into coaching myself
because I struggled through this issue myself personally for years
and I've kind of been feeling my way out through
all the different angles all the different problems and and
solutions and techniques that are out there to develop your
life purpose I felt like I've worked on it myself
and also read a lot of information literature about it
from from other people who have tried to figure out
this this thorny issue but for now I'm going to
leave you on this last thought what would you be
doing if you had all the money in the world
and money was no longer a motivating force for you
all what would you be doing with your life and
I don't mean partying or decorating your house or buy
a new car because you can do all those things
but on top of that because your life is pretty
long you still got a good ways to go a
third of its going to be spent doing some sort
of work even if you had all the money you
still would not want to party 24/7 you'd want to
spend a certain chunk of your time doing something fulfilling
for other people question is what would that be one
more point that I wanted to make about life purpose
is that there's this tendency I think to assume that
people are born with one or people are I understand
what their purpose should be in life and that's very
deceptive to think that way because if you think that
people naturally have a purpose what's going to happen is
that you're going to assume that you should have one
as well and that's not true at all I think
purposively that has to be built over time if you
don't have a purpose right now then I'm going to
make a suggestion for you make your purpose to find
your purpose that's where it all starts start with wanting
to find your purpose like it's something that's deeply important
to you personally for me that has always been at
play since I was like 6 years old I always
knew that I needed a purpose I needed a purpose
in life I needed to channel my energy towards some
sort of means you know towards some sort of goal
and if I wasn't doing that I felt like I
wasn't living optimally and I wasn't living to my full
potential and so I went on really a quest to
find what my purpose is going to be and I
went through a lot you know I've done my career
so far which has been pretty short has not really
has actually covered a lot of territory so I went
from in college aerospace engineer to philosophy major to then
video game designer to web designer to SEO internet marketing
then to mobile games developer than to now life coaching
and and now I'm kind of taking life coaching and
I'm even evolving into more of a self-help kind of
expert guru type of a career track so you see
how that like it evolves like there's so much ground
that I had to cover there just to start to
understand what I wanted and what would make me happy
because I used to believe that I could just sit
down that I would just one day I would just
sit down and figure it out like I would just
sit down and say to myself okay what already with
my life and then I would just kind of like
think about a little bit philosophize about it and it's
like okay I want to do engineering and then I
would just be an engineer and that would be it
would be solved for the rest of my life didn't
quite turn out that way what I found out is
that in reality let your life purpose is so dynamic
that you just have to work with it it's like
a it's like a big lump of dough that you
have to constantly need need and need a need a
need and if you don't have a purpose right now
set your purpose to be to find a purpose so
that means whatever is that you're doing if you know
that you're not happy doing it right now that's fine
you know that's where you at that's where you're at
and maybe you can't leave your job immediately that's not
what I'm saying you might have to stick around just
because of the financial situation you're in or whatever that's
fine but start to think ahead start to think about
what you want your purpose to be right if you
weren't doing your job right now what would you be
doing instead what would you rather be doing what would
be the best possible position for you in any possible
company in the world or maybe it would be starting
your own business you know start thinking about that and
maybe what you can start doing is start start reading
start researching start exploring start testing testing out the field
right testing out what it is that you want to
go into so maybe you're doing one thing and you
want to go into something totally different test out that
totally different thing see if it's going to work for
you because a lot of times what will happen is
that you'll try it out you'll figure out you know
that this is really not what you want and so
then you have to go search for something else and
something else but ultimately if your purpose is to find
your purpose that is what's going to ground you at
least for now that's going to ground you and you're
going to use that to test out all these different
niches that you could potentially fill until you find one
that's going to be nice and comfy for you and
it's going to make you fulfilled so for now if
you don't have a purpose start by making your purpose
to find a purpose that is your purpose right now
you
