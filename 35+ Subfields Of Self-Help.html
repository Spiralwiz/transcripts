[Music] let's talk about the many subfields of self-help self-help
is an entire industry an entire field and a world
really onto itself most people don't even know that self-help
is a field or a domain of inquiry or something
that you can pursue or something that you can seriously
study and for most people just to discover the domain
of self-help is already a life-changing event I can recall
very vividly the first time that I discovered self-help almost
about 10 years ago almost exactly 10 years ago when
I walked into a Barnes & Noble bookstore and I
discovered the self-help aisle back when there were still Barnes
& Noble bookstores in most towns and I remember discovering
that and just saying to myself oh my god this
is like a whole new thing this is a life-changing
thing that I've discovered and it was because I could
already immediately see the potential of it because for basically
most of my early teenage life and my early 20s
up to this point I was interested in self-help type
topics like I was interested in psychology I was interested
in philosophy I was interested in what happiness was I
was interested in being more productive and so forth but
I didn't know about the field explicitly I didn't know
that there was an entire industry that catered to these
types of people who were interested in this type of
stuff experts who had studied this stuff for years and
then put all their insights into books and you could
find all in just one category in the in the
book sell self-help section and at a at a book
store you know so for me that was a life-changing
event because what happens that you pick up one of
these self-help books and then that gives you all sorts
of new ideas and then you pick up another self-help
book and that gets another set of new ideas and
there's a sort of geometric expansion that happens where every
book gives you some new ideas which sprat off into
a bunch of new ideas and each one of those
first browse off ten more new ideas and you get
more resources more ideas more other subfields to study and
then all the sudden you're very deep into this and
then your whole life changes five ten years down the
road but self-help is a very broad category super super
broad so most of you who've been watching me probably
now understand that there is this thing called self-help or
you could call it personal development you could call it
self actualization these are all same words for the same
basic category of stuff self-improvement type of advice and material
but most people have no idea just how vast self-help
is it's both very vast in its breadth and it's
also very deep as well and it's useful to break
down this broad category of self-help into subfields which is
what we'll be doing today I'll give you a long
list of twenty or thirty subfields which will help you
for doing research for finding books for finding teachers workshops
seminars websites videos and so forth it's really helpful to
kind of know what all the territory looks like from
a from a 30,000 foot elevation perspective then you can
direct yourself towards the kinds of material and teachings and
research that you need to solve your particular set of
problems a really big mistake that people make is they
try to oversimplify self-help and I notice that a lot
of spiritual people do this people who get into enlightened
work they love to simplify self-help and they just say
all l√©o but all that self-help and all that all
of it just boils down to enlightenment with enlightenment if
I get enlightenment than everything else I don't need to
know and this is such a big mistake such a
huge oversimplification there are so many problems that people have
in life that have nothing to do with enlightenment and
while enlightenment is very important and spirituality is very important
and consciousness work is very important that's all very important
stuff but if you think you can boil all of
life down just to that you're in for a rude
awakening your life is not going to turn out as
well as you think it will there's a lot of
very specialized problems that life presents us with that require
very specialized solutions and specialized expertise that you will never
hear from some non-duality teacher yogi or guru or a
carto late or anyone anyone else like that we have
to understand is that most teachers become very specialized and
they might be very very good and masterful at one
particular thing that they teach like non-duality but don't expect
them to help you solve all the other stuff in
your life that's going wrong and there's a lot of
ways that your life can go wrong because there's so
many traps so many ways that your mind can deceive
you and trick you and there are many different categories
in your life that you need to get into order
including your career your finances your health and fitness and
your education and your relationships and your family I mean
there's a lot of stuff here to cover so here's
the list of subfields for self-help perhaps the biggest and
most prominent one is success productivity and goal-setting for me
that's one giant chunk of what self-help is about and
this is how probably most people actually get into self-help
it's through this kind of thing because most people in
our society in first world countries are very stage Orange
biodynamic stage Orange they're very success oriented so when you're
for example walking through an airport and you're walking by
one of those little uh snack kiosks that they have
there they have all the snacks and candy bars and
bottled water and so forth but then they always have
a rack of self-help books right there it's right in
front of you you can't walk by the place without
seeing those self-help books and one of those usually those
are usually the most mainstream of self-help books and a
lot of them have to do with how to be
more successful had any more productive how to set goals
and stuff like this why is that because that's very
appealing to most people it's very easy to sell them
on success in productivity because you sell it to them
as like well I'll pay 20 bucks 20 bucks for
this book and I'll get my money back by increasing
my success at work by even a few percent if
I do that I'll recoup all my money so it
pays for itself another big category of self-help sub subfield
is law of attraction a lot of books have been
written about law of attraction how to use various visualization
and affirmation techniques and how to use your mind to
to to instill yourself with the sort of confidence that
you need to achieve your own goals and so law
of attraction is sort of a different perspective on how
to be successful and productive in fact the most successful
and popular self-help book of all time by Napoleon Hill
think and get rich that book has sold tens and
tens and tens of millions of copies and I think
it's called ya think Think and Grow Rich yeah I
think that's what it's called that's just a self-help classic
and that's really just one of the various kinds of
Law of Attraction books that exist out there there's also
the subfield of time management how to manage your time
better there's the subfield of career and life purpose how
do you find your life purpose how do you get
your career in order how do you master your career
what are the tricks and tips and mindsets you need
to be successful in your career and that's very easy
to sell to people because again your career is how
you earn money so if I can promise you some
tips that we're gonna that are gonna improve your career
opportunities you are gonna pull out your wallet really quickly
that's something that's just like very practical it's not esoteric
it's not mystical it's not spiritual it's just like yeah
just help me with my career that's a very easy
sell very common entry point into the self-help field another
subfield is creativity there are a lot of books and
courses available out there that will teach you how to
become more creative how to become a better artist how
to deal with creative anxiety and fear and various kinds
of obstacles that artists and creative people face and that's
a really fascinating subfield and one that I'll be talking
and shooting some videos about in the future some more
because I personally I love being creative I love studying
ways how to improve my own creativity but that's not
a really a a focus of actualized I work per
se there's also the sub field of business and entrepreneurship
there are so many seminars and workshops and books and
products out there that are created for business people serious
business people who are very hard nosed any practical advice
in their particular line of business so the advice could
be just generic business advice or it could be more
specialized or super super highly specialized depending on what kind
of business you want to run whether you're a dentist
or a doctor or a lawyer or online entrepreneur whatever
there's material out there written for you so a lot
of people enter from the business side of course also
there's a subfield of marketing and sales and marketing sales
interesting because you think like well what does marketing and
sales have to do with self-help but actually this goes
back to the early days of self-help marketing and sales
has always been taught alongside with self-help because as it
turns out marketing and sales skills are pivotal for being
able to develop your own financial independence for being able
to be persuasive to be able to pitch your products
and services your business if you want to be an
entrepreneur or even if you're not going to be an
entrepreneur just to be able to be successful in your
career and in your workplace you need some marketing and
sales skills whether you're doing a presentation for your boss
or you're competing with another team at work all of
this requires some marketing and sales skills and in general
for you to be providing a lot of value in
your company and in your job you want to have
some marketing and sales skills for example if you're a
programmer you might think Auliya but I'm just a programmer
I don't need marketing and sales skills right well actually
that's why you're not rising up the corporate ladder is
because programming skills can only take you so far and
how much value can provide but if you want to
take your programming skills to the next level you add
some marketing and sales skills to that as well and
then when you're sitting there talking with your boss in
your meeting in the morning it's very clear which programmers
in that team meeting have marketing and sales skills and
which ones don't because it's one thing to just be
talking about programming and coding something technical and nerdy but
for you to really be successful in business you need
to be able to make sure that your programming actually
has marketing value and that it fits in with the
sales goal and the marketing goals and that it it
all works together to advance the larger goals of your
business and since business survives and lives off marketing and
sales people who have these skills become the most valued
and the most paid in the corporation or if you're
working for yourself it's super important to have these skills
so there's a lot of material out there that teaches
you marketing and sales you do have to be a
little bit careful some that can be pretty sleazy some
that can be downright blackhat and unethical so watch out
who you're getting your marketing and sales advice from and
what you're using it for it's very easy to take
various kinds of advice from all of these categories and
to miss apply it or to use it for devilish
evil purposes in a selfish egotistical manner so you got
to be careful with this advice make sure you apply
it with the right intentions another subfield is leadership and
management there's a lot to learn about how to be
a great leader and how to be a good manager
another subfield is money management there's a lot to learn
about how to manage your money properly how to save
your money how not to waste your money how to
invest your money how to make your money work for
you how to hedge against inflation so forth and there's
a lot of experts out there who can teach you
that sort of stuff again you got to be careful
because when it comes to finance business marketing and management
of money there is a lot of sleazy people out
there who will of course offer you all sorts of
schemes for how you can invest your money in their
in their operation and get a bunch of money back
and you got to be careful about that stuff make
sure you're you're getting solid advice not just get rich
quick schemes and flimsy gimmicky type of stuff another subfield
is dating an attraction this is a very popular one
because people generally suck at dating struggle with dating this
goes to their core basic need of sex and and
intimacy and love and so figuring out how to be
more attractive as a man or a woman how to
date properly hmm to find better mates that's quite challenging
and that can be an entry point for a lot
of people into the self-help field also of course there's
the relationship subfield which is different and distinct from dating
and attraction dating an attraction is about how to just
basically find new people meet new people connect with new
people and then relationships is more about how to build
longer lasting relationships and it's very easy to get good
at attraction but be terrible at relationships because relationships require
commitment intimacy honesty communication skills all of these kinds of
skills that a lot of people who are going to
trash actually lack so learning up on relationships is very
important and of course everyone has huge relationship problems people
are so bad at relationships that there's so much that
you can learn from learning and studying high-quality relationship advice
there's also the subfield of love how to be a
more loving human being which is again distinct from relationships
and distinct from attraction and dating and is distinct from
sexuality - we're gonna get to sexuality in a minute
here but with love most people are not taught how
to love what love is I recently released an episode
what is love and as you can tell from that
long episode there was a lot of detail there and
a lot of things that just go completely over people's
heads because love is a very advanced topic how to
become a more loving human being is really a life
project for you and there's a lot of books that
you can read that will that will teach you about
that and will teach you about the importance of love
most people don't even understand the importance of what love
is and how powerful love is and how you can
use love for example to build a powerful business and
to actually earn money and all sorts of things like
that people think that love is somehow antithetical to practicality
into business and to finances no not at all not
if you really understand what love is there's also the
subfield of family and marriage how to manage your marriage
a lot of good books have been written about that
which most married couples never read and then of course
the why are you surprised that they get divorced so
often of course because they don't really study this it's
such an important thing to study if you plan to
get married and if you plan to have a family
if you plan to have children there's a lot of
books that are written about how to manage your family
and so forth then there's a subfield of sexuality masculinity
and femininity most of us suck at sexuality because we're
not taught about sexuality in school because it's a taboo
subject we're not taught how to be good at sex
we're not taught how to please the the opposite sex
or please our partners we're not taught what it means
to be a man or what it means to be
a woman we're not taught how to own our masculinity
or if them and our femininity we don't really understand
the opposite sex how the opposite sex thinks how they
feel and so this becomes a huge sticking point for
a lot of people in relationships and with attraction so
studying this there's many books many great books written about
this and it's really worth your time to study then
of course there's the huge giant subfield of health fitness
nutrition and alternative medicine all this I call basically health
but of course within health there's so much stuff there
you've got all those books about proper nutrition which you
were never taught about from your parents or from school
you've got a bunch of books about how to exercise
effectively how to lift weights properly how to do yoga
properly if you're doing physical forms of yoga there is
other kinds of health issues that arise for people and
of course as you get older this subfield becomes more
and more important to you and alternative medicine alternative medicine
is a hugely powerful powerful subfield with a lot of
potential there and most people poopoo alternative medicine until they
get a terrible condition themselves which traditional classical Western medicine
doesn't have any solutions for and then that's when they
turn to alternative medicine they discovered it a whole new
world of stuff and it's like your eyes are open
by exploring alternative medicine and all the stuff that you
didn't know about the human body and the human mind
and the connection between those two and and then it
starts to lead you down the rabbit hole of spirituality
and and so on and just that one subfield right
there could save your entire life depending on what kind
of problem generally take this entire health subfield health nutrition
all that for granted until of course they suffer from
various kinds of physical ailments and diseases that come from
just going balls to the wall with stage orange with
that mentality they become obese they become overly stressed overworked
and they get all sorts of subtle ailments and diseases
that traditional medicine can't solve and so that's when they
start to take their health much more seriously or they
do it because they want to look more attractive so
they learn how to how to eat healthy and how
to diet and and this sort of stuff so they
can build big muscles and look sexy and attract attract
more more beautiful people into their life that's rather shallow
and vain but you know however you get into it
it's it's good you start to take yourself your health
a little more seriously then there's a subfield of body
awareness and disciplines like bioenergetics which is all about becoming
more conscious and aware of your body and the mind-body
connection as I talked about in my mind in my
body awareness episode and and then how do you use
and leverage the mind-body connection how do you use your
body in order to heal yourself psychologically that's what bioenergetics
is about and there's lots of various kinds of of
sub disciplines that were created that are analogous to something
like bioenergetics which teach you about how to use your
body basically to cure yourself of various kinds of physical
and psychological ailments there's also the subfield of self esteem
and confidence and this is a really important one for
most people because most people have terrible self-esteem they have
self-image issues they lack confidence they're shy they are meek
they don't know how to set boundaries they turn into
doormats they get abused by others in relationships they don't
know how to assert themselves they don't know how to
be decisive they don't like their physical appearance they have
some sort of trauma from the past because they were
ridiculed or bullied in school or something like that they
weren't the cool kids and now you've got these self-esteem
issues that are carried with you throughout your whole life
and they create a lot of suffering for you so
that's a really good subfield to study if you've got
that problem another really big subfield is emotions emotional mastery
and this subfield is huge there's so much here because
this basically is all about the quality of your life
and of course we're not taught how to really recognize
their own emotions how to deal with our emotions we
don't even know how to be aware of our emotions
and how to label our emotions properly most people don't
even know how to label fear and anger and jealousy
and depression and anxiety and all these sorts of things
but if you suffer from depression anxiety panic attacks anger
jealousy envy fear and this stuff is holding you back
then you got to study this subfield and there's there's
so much you can learn about your emotions all sorts
of various kinds of techniques that you can use to
become more mindful of your emotions to specifically focus on
particular emotions that are problems for you some people have
a problem with anger while others don't so you don't
want to focus on anger some people have a problem
with depression while others don't so you want to focus
on depression but even if you don't have one of
these crippling neurotic emotional problems like depression or anger or
anxiety chances are you're still very deeply unconscious of your
emotions overall you don't know how to label them your
emotional intelligence is very low so developing that by studying
this field is gonna be life transforming for you and
closely related to that is the subfield of shadow work
shadow work is about working with repressed aspects of your
psyche and of your ego there's a lot to talk
about there entire books have been written about it it's
basically the work that most psycho therapists do if you
go to them they'll help you to do shadow work
on yourself pulling up old memories and various kinds of
neurotic repressed issues that you have but of course you
can also do it yourself and in fact in the
future pretty soon I will be really seeing a shadow
work episode that will show you how to do it
yourself so that's a great subfield because almost everybody has
a shadow and that shadow holds you back and even
those people who do a lot of spiritual work meditate
a lot do a lot of yoga mmm self and
choir are really serious into non-duality guess what that will
still not solve your shadow meditation alone doesn't generally solve
shadow issues which is why it's very dangerous to pursue
enlightenment or meditation to the exclusion of all these other
subfields pooh-poohing all these other subfields and saying I don't
need any of those if you do that what's gonna
happen is yes you might become enlightened and you might
become a great meditator but you are still gonna have
problems with your relationships problems due to your shadow problems
with sexuality problems with your health and fitness and so
forth problems with your emotions there's also the subfield of
addiction recovery if you suffer from addiction problems whether it's
porn sex food alcohol hard drugs these can be a
source of huge life destroying problems for people and there
is an entire category subcategory of self-help that deals with
helping addicts to recover and to create a new healthy
lifestyle for themselves and there are experts who are really
good at that people who have gone through it themselves
and you can read about their stories and how they
went through the the heartache and all the all the
misery and suffering that goes with recovering from some of
these hard wired addictions that you've developed there's also trauma
recovery as a subfield now this one has to do
with people who have been abused molested had various kinds
of trauma maybe earlier in your childhood or in your
early adulthood maybe you experienced a near-death experience or something
something like that some sort of serious disease or injury
that's left you traumatized and that trauma now you're carrying
it with you and of course chances are that if
it was a serious trauma especially early in your life
chances are you've repressed it you don't even admit to
yourself that you have this trauma and yet it's still
there and it's affecting your life and it's souring your
mood it's it's making you depressed and it's ruining your
emotions and it might even wreck your ability to have
and keep a career or to be in a relationship
and so forth so this is a huge problem for
people and you if you have this problem you need
some very specialized expert advice for how to deal with
that because dealing with trauma just on your own without
any kind of expertise or advice that's really tricky and
challenging most people don't know how to do that and
you're gonna waste decades of your life struggling with it
unnecessarily there's also the subfield of mental disorders people with
bipolar disorders for any OCD depression could be a mental
disorder for some people ADHD and this sort of stuff
and this usually requires specialized knowledge sometimes I have people
who will post me comments under my videos or they
will even send me personalized emails or messages on my
forum and they will admit to me some problem that
they have some mental disorder and it could be something
rather serious and then they ask me for advice and
I'm not really an expert in serious mental disorders but
what I always tell them is that if you've got
a serious mental disorder just you have to understand that
you're not the first person who's had this people have
been having this disorder for thousands of years hundreds of
years and there are experts and books and material that
have been designed and written for just your situation so
you don't have to reinvent the wheel you don't have
to be in the dark you just got to go
and be willing to do the research and find though
that's specific expertise that you need on your specific issue
right so that's all that that requires don't be afraid
don't be worried about it you can solve your problem
all these problems are solvable you just got to be
willing to do the research and to find the experts
who have the knowledge that you need and the solutions
that will work for you and sometimes that requires some
searching but the good news is that all that information
is out there the problem is that most people don't
know that this information is out there it might seem
obviously I'm like I'm talking about these subfields as though
it's the most obvious stuff but you'd be surprised people
go 30 40 years suffering from some trauma or some
mental disorder or from some emotional issue or some shadow
issue or some sexual hang-up they go for for 30
40 years and it never even occurs to them that
hey there's an entire subfield of self-help that can help
me with this of other people who have gone through
this and solved it see on the one hand it's
so obvious on the other hand it's not obvious at
all if you don't know about it which is why
we're going through all this we're covering all the bases
here there's also the subfield of personality types this can
be very powerful for example you can learn about the
myers-briggs personality types and there's a lot to learn there
you can learn about the Enneagram and there's various other
kinds of personality type assessments and models and schemes that
are out there that you can learn you can take
various tests and they can tell you about what your
personality type is and while of course they're not definitive
and they shouldn't be your only tool for understanding yourself
they can be very powerful for helping you to understand
what type of person you are what your true identity
is what kind of career you should have based on
your personality type what kind of relationships you should cultivate
based on your personality type so that can be very
helpful to getting to know yourself especially if you're young
cuz when you're young when you're in your teens and
and 20s basically you don't know who you are I
don't mean metaphysically existentially spiritually I mean you don't even
know who you are as a as an ego you
don't even know what you like and what you don't
like what kind of career you should have or what
kind of career you shouldn't have what kind of business
you should be in what kind of business you shouldn't
be in what kind of women you should be sleeping
with and what kind of women you shouldn't be sleeping
with and men and and so forth right and that's
just because you don't you haven't really studied it understood
your own personality and personality is different from your exit
existential identity as the absolute consciousness nothingness the stuff that
enlightenment reveals personality is is still gonna be there even
if you when you're fully enlightened you still have a
personality and you still want to understand your own personality
there's also the subfield of NLP and hypnosis NLP is
neuro linguistic programming I sort of lump these together because
both of them are really techniques and tricks that you
can use to program your own mind and they can
be very powerful there's also a lot there it's a
very technical field you can learn various kinds of visualization
and techniques and ways of speaking to yourself and even
self hypnosis to hypnotize yourself to accomplish work also things
in your life to make state changes so you can
actually change the emotions you feel in your body based
on these various NLP techniques for example and that can
make you a lot more productive in whatever areas you
want to be there's also the field of religion you
can study religion you can study Christianity Buddhism Hinduism Judaism
Islam Tantra Jainism Sikhism paganism whatever other kind of isms
are out there you can study them all you got
to be careful though what I'm not suggesting you do
is pick a religion and then become a dogmatic adherent
of it well I suggested that you study all religions
and that you pick and choose very carefully various bits
of wisdom from each tradition because there's a lot of
wisdom in all these traditions but also a lot of
corruption and dogma and nonsense which will [ __ ]
your growth so you have to be very careful and
choosy and you also don't want to become exclusive and
start to believe that Christianity is is gonna solve all
your problems or that it's the one true a way
to do spirituality or Buddhism or anything else which brings
us to spirituality spirituality is a giant subfield of self-help
and then within spirituality there are sub sub fields so
spirituality is an important sub for thinking it's not the
same thing as religion there's actually a lot of very
powerful spiritual techniques which will totally transform your whole life
and in fact spirituality is really where you're gonna get
your biggest gains in your life if you want to
transform your life the most allocate all of your skill
points into spirituality you're gonna get a lot more out
of it than you will from pursuing success or business
or anything else because spirituality is really where you start
to address the root existential issues that are governing your
life all the stuff that your success in your business
and your relationships and all the other stuff that that
even if you became successful in you still didn't really
solve anything you're still unsatisfied well now that's when you
turn to spirituality and you start to research all the
subfields of spirituality like non-duality which I highly encourage very
good stuff field to study meditation mindfulness also really good
one there's so many different meditation teachings out there yoga
many different kinds of yoga and I'm not talking about
hatha yoga western style yoga I'm mostly talking about various
Indian kind of yoga's the old school original meditative forms
of yoga like Kriya yoga Kundalini Yoga and others like
that there's the subfield of psychedelics which I'm a huge
fan of as you know there's also a giant subfield
called new age new age / paranormal / psychic abilities
and this is a really really deep subfield which has
further subfields within it including things like astral projection clairvoyance
out-of-body experiences near-death experiences chakras and auras and channeling and
healing there's a lot there like a lot there and
you'll be shocked at how practical some of those things
are and how real some of those things are like
you never could imagine under the material's paradigm that usually
you're on when you start spiral that when you start
self-help all right so a lot of stage orange people
who start self-help stay far away from this whole spiritual
realm of self-help and from the New Age realm because
they view it as just some sort of a delusion
or some sort of like a new form of religion
but that's really just because they haven't actually studied it
they don't really know what it's about but there's so
much there and if you're one of these people who
has some natural psychic abilities paranormal abilities you're gonna have
to do a lot of research into this subfield to
start to understand what you're really going through because chances
are you're kind of on your own you're different from
everybody else around you you're not like your friends you
have these abilities but you also don't know what these
abilities are they could be freaking you out scaring you
you're not sure what to do with them or what
they mean you might think you're losing your mind or
going insane you might even be on medications that help
to suppress this sort of stuff when actually this is
an enormous gift but you have to learn how to
develop this gift and that's gonna start by you doing
a lot of research into these things you know again
sometimes people write to me and ask me comments or
write me personal messages with this sort of problem of
likely oh I experience this weird paranormal thing and I
don't know what to do about it and I've been
maybe keeping it a secret because none of my friends
or family understand but I don't know like is this
normal I feel like I'm losing my mind is this
right like I started meditating and I started seeing some
auras or my chakra activate or some weird thing like
this or I started to astral project when I'm sleeping
and like I don't know what to make of this
am I losing my mind and of course the answer
is no you're not losing your mind you just got
to do much more research into what's happening with you
all of this stuff is just completely standard there's nothing
weird about it at all you just haven't been taught
about it it's not part of our standard mainstream spiral
dynamic stage Orange culture that we're in we're in a
very materialist culture so of course our materials culture denies
all this stuff which is why it's gonna take even
extra work from you to do research into these subfields
and if you do you will discover a whole new
world of possibilities and people who are just like you
who have explored all this stuff we've become experts in
all this stuff and have actually channeled all these weird
abilities into creating a beautiful powerful life there's also the
subfield of shamanism and occult there's a lot of occult
teachings out there personally I don't get too deeply into
them because I feel like they're distraction I would much
rather focus on non duality and and consciousness work but
and also because I'm not one of these super psychically
gifted people but I can understand how though who are
psychically gifted and have certain occult tendencies and are more
mystically minded that they can get into that shamanism an
occult type stuff and so yeah you could you could
research that I just want to warn you that it
can become a deep rabbit hole at a distraction in
fact this whole psychic paranormal realm this whole New Age
realm can become a big distraction from simply pursuing enlightenment
and mastery of your everyday world make sure you master
your everyday world first master your emotions master your family
situation master your career master your finances master the basic
stuff before you go chasing occult stuff because I know
people who go chasing occult stuff but then their ordinary
life is in shambles and then they suffer from that
all right so you got to get your priorities straight
there's also the subfield of healing and there's lots of
different kinds of healing mental healing physical healing emotional healing
spiritual healing occult forms of healing paranormal healing abilities that
you can develop there there's a lot to healing and
people need healing in different ways many people need emotional
healing made many people need physical healing many people need
spiritual healing so you can read about that and there's
many different healing modalities out there that you can learn
and practice and find what works for you you know
with healing it's all about finding the right fit you
got to find the technique that's gonna fit for your
particular issue you have and different people like I said
need healing in different ways so that's gonna take some
research on your part there's also the subfield of psychology
there are many books that are written by classic psychologists
like Freud and Jung and Reich and Maslow and from
and Rogers in all the classic psychologists that have become
prominent over the last hundred years some of them have
silly ideas some of them have very useful ideas you
know you got to be choosy and selective about psychology
but there's a lot like for example I got a
lot of value from studying Abraham Maslow's work Erich Fromm's
work Carl Rogers these are some top-notch psychologists I don't
recommend Freud too much you could get some value reading
Carl Jung and there are many other psychologists that I
haven't really read but you can definitely you know go
go into that field and I'm sure there are many
cutting-edge new psychologists that are doing psychology today that is
great stuff there's there's an entire academic discipline of positive
psychology and people like Martin Siegelman and me Hayley Csikszentmihalyi
whose author of flow the book flow mmm and Carol
Dweck and various other kinds of people who are doing
psychological research right now which is more in the new
vein of positive psychology which is more practical and you
can apply it more directly to your life that's good
stuff there's also transpersonal psychology perhaps the best the best
best expert in this field is stanislav grof he's in
a lot of work on transpersonal psychology and this is
where positive psychology starts to move into spirituality and some
of this new-age paranormal stuff and so it's like the
intersection of psychology and spirituality and New Age stuff these
are the higher stages of the spirals this like turquoise
level stuff and especially if you suffer from trauma or
deep emotional problems you can get a lot of value
from transpersonal psychology and the work of stan grof for
example alone I released an episode on shamanic breathing and
that's a very powerful transpersonal psychology technique and there's many
more like that out there so really cool field to
study in fact I think it's it's the best branch
of psychology if I was going to a university to
get a degree in psychology I would get a degree
in transpersonal psychology but of course very few universities actually
offer this type of degree probably only a handful in
the world but they do exist I know there are
a few in California that exist not sure about elsewhere
in the world it will become more popular in the
future though that's for sure over the next hundred years
transpersonal psychology will become huge because it's um it's exactly
the direction that psychology needs to go the whole problem
with traditional psychology is that it didn't factor in the
entire spiritual realm and all the insights that you get
from consciousness or gayden factor that in so that's what
transpersonal psychology does then there's a subfield that's called a
lifestyle design this is various kinds of books and teachings
which show you how to live your life and a
more adventurous and fun way I know Tim Ferriss isn't
sort of an advocate of this and there's various kinds
of books on how to travel around create a fun
lifestyle for yourself become independent financially and then use your
freedom to do cool stuff go on vacations go mega
bonding around the world and exploring different cultures and cuisines
and countries and there's people out there who teach you
how to do this so if you're the adventurous type
and you want to use self help and your financial
freedom to live this sort of fun adventurous lifestyle you
can find experts who will show you how they did
that there's also the subfield of what I would call
technical how to I don't know how else to call
this technical how to these are all this how-to books
that have ever been written you can go into a
bookstore and find how-to books about almost anything public speaking
how to be more humorous how to draw how to
dress as a man how to dress as a woman
I mean there's there's like there's so many how how
to books out there in fact the whole how-to book
industry there's this our industry that just pumps out these
how-to books now a lot of them are very flaky
and not high quality but some of them are really
high quality you got do your research and find the
good ones but uh basically anything you want to learn
how to do someone has written a guide or a
book or crated a course or seminar for how to
do it so you can just ask yourself what do
I want to do in my life that I can't
do right now or if you're wondering well yeah I
want to I want to advance my life in this
area here but I don't know how well you just
type in how to blank and then fill in the
blank with whatever you want to learn how to do
and you'll find some kind of solution there now those
are all the subfields that I would call traditional self-help
and then there are some aspects that I hesitate to
call self-help but which are still very important and these
would be politics and government educating yourself about how politics
and government work that is something that a lot of
people are missing these days most people these days they're
so passionate about politics whether they're on the left or
the right and what I notice is that so few
of them actually have any kind of academic foundation about
politics they haven't read a single book about politics they
haven't read a single book about feminism they haven't read
a single book about post-modernism never read a single book
about how government works they haven't read a single book
about the history of how politics evolved in America or
around the world they haven't read a single book about
fascism or communism or socialism or capitalism right you got
to read about this [ __ ] and this is
becomes a big problem for for us as a nation
and for us as a globe is because most of
our citizens are so ignorant about politics that their version
of politics just becomes a religion it just becomes an
ideology like capitalism is awesome and communism is evil it
becomes just as black and white ridiculous identity politics that's
what it becomes so if you're gonna have political opinions
at all and if you're gonna vote make sure you
educate yourself about how politics really works not partisan stuff
I mean like the foundations of politics the foundations of
public policy the foundations of government there's a lot of
research you could do there a lot of really good
books are available also the subfield of philosophy metaphysics and
epistemology there's a lot of books that have been written
over the years about philosophy and a lot of them
honestly are waste of your time a lot of them
are filled with [ __ ] but on the other
hand partially for me my entire approach to self-help is
grounded in philosophy metaphysics and epistemology that's why the material
that I release is much deeper and more profound than
almost all other self-help teachers out there because it's grounded
in something much much deeper much more fundamental it's grounded
in the ultimate questions about the nature of reality and
about truth the pursuit of truth that's what philosophy is
about figuring out how knowledge works these are absolutely foundational
topics which are rarely taught in school they're taught very
inadequately and because people have such a poor grasp of
these topics they're not able to question their own reality
very deeply and so any self-help that they do and
any kind of even spiritual work they do it's all
surface level stuff it doesn't really get to the root
of what existence is and so those those problems that
are that are that are there in you which are
existential problems don't let's never get addressed which is why
you can keep doing self-help over and over and over
again for decades and still really not resolve your problems
because your deepest problems are existential problems they're really metaphysical
and epistemic problems but you can't know that until you
spend a lot of time studying this up field there's
also the subfield of social psychology cognitive psychology and anthropology
there are a lot of great books written about these
topic and there's a lot of great research being done
today and various kinds of universities about various kinds of
psychological anthropological studies and experiments that are being done that
teach about the nature of the human mind the nature
of the brain the nature of culture the nature of
societies we're learning a lot about that in the last
fifty to a hundred years and new books are coming
out on these topics every every year and they're very
eye-opening they put things into perspective for you they teach
you why mankind works the way that it works why
people are selfish why people are evil why people are
biased why people are racist why people are religious why
people are ethnocentric so forth also a very broad category
but still very important is the the subfield of history
of science most people just don't have a a good
grasp of history and science and by science I mean
stuff like you can read up on evolution quantum mechanics
relativity chaos theory biology physics like there's so much here
that you're missing out on and all that stuff will
serve as a foundation for your understanding of all of
life and even though it's not directly related to yourself
helping your success it's not directly gonna help you to
get laid or to earn a bunch of money or
to deal with some emotional trauma that you have but
what I find is that actually these sorts of general
topics are super important in my understanding of reality as
a whole and so most of my time actually these
days is not spent reading narrowly focused self-help books on
how to become more successful or how to take care
of some emotional issue they are actually focused on these
very general broad topics scientific topics historical topics I love
to read about history study history history puts all of
mankind's nonsense into perspective by reading history you learn all
the traps and mistakes that have happened in politics and
governments in race relations in sex and gender relations within
science within philosophy you learn about all the errors all
the mistakes that mankind has made so that then you
don't repeat those same mistakes yourself it's all right there
in the history books if you go through all the
history books and you read them very carefully you can
learn a lot of lessons about how to live your
life properly just from the history books and also a
lot of people have only knowledge of Western history but
not history of the rest of the world because in
our schools were not taught the history of Africa or
Japan or China or India or the Middle East so
people are so ignorant about other cultures outside of American
culture and European culture that they don't have the proper
context they don't really understand and also if you're only
studying history from the Western perspective then you're not you
you're implicitly buying into the whole Western paradigm you're not
looking at the world from the perspective of other cultures
other races other ethnic groups and that's a real shame
because the whole point of of learning about all these
different subfields is that it opens that you up to
new perspectives it gives you more flexibility there are solutions
that exist within Indian culture and Japanese culture and Chinese
culture and Middle Eastern culture solutions to your problems exist
in those cultures and yet you never hear about them
because you're so locked into the Western cultural perspective and
of course the Western cultural perspective has all sorts of
biases built into it that you're not aware of until
you start to study other cultures and lastly I would
say the last subfield is biographies biographies are important for
people who are pursuing self help because in reading a
high quality biography of some inspiring human being you get
to see what it took for that human being to
be come who he or she became like what did
it take to become someone like a John F Kennedy
or a Gandhi or an Albert Einstein or a Nikola
Tesla or Benjamin Franklin or an Abraham Lincoln what kind
of leadership qualities were required what kind of trials and
tribulations do these people go through what kind of fears
do they have what kind of pathologies and neuroses did
they overcome what kind of habits that they build how
do they do it how did they get their financing
for their first business how did they advance their career
how did they persevere against all these obstacles that they
had right by reading biographies you get insights into that
and that shows you that oh these people they were
just human beings like me they worked really hard and
they worked through all these challenges and look how high
they got and that shows you that oh I can
do that too and you can actually model your life
on some of these biographies they can also inspire you
they can also show you what it's like to be
a human being with integrity and with a certain set
of values with higher consciousness ideals and that can be
really good if you're just getting your feet wet with
self-help because one of the biggest things that people lack
when they start a self-help is they just lack imagination
they lack a sense of what's possible with their life
right did they lack a sense of vision they'd like
a sense of ambition because they've just kind of been
living an ordinary life and they've never really thought about
how do I build a great life who could I
really become in my life but dedicate myself to it
if I have a vision if I set some goals
and if I have all these subfields that I study
I have all these tools at my disposal I can
use to become a great human being and really right
now is the best time to be alive because at
no other time in human history was so much expertise
and knowledge available to you so easily so quickly so
cheaply as today all of these subfields are available to
you 100 years ago many of these subfields didn't even
exist so you would be a fool to take this
for granted almost anything you want to do in your
life someone else has already done someone else has devoted
40 years to becoming an expert in that thing whatever
it is whatever problem you think you have that can't
be solved someone has already solved it they've been solving
it for 40 years and they've been teaching other people
how to solve it quickly and easily and painlessly and
all you got to do is you got to seek
out that expert find their book find their course find
their teaching and study it and then apply it that's
it it's a very simple solution very simple formula you
would be foolish not to take advantage of all this
expertise that has existed that people have invested so much
time people invest years writing these books packing these books
full of the wisdom of 40 years of their deepest
experiences and all their lessons and all their trials and
tribulations they they extract the best nuggets of that and
put that in the book and all you got to
do is just read the book and not be lazy
so don't take this for granted now most of these
subfields notice that I've mentioned up above they're not covered
in school or university almost at all school University doesn't
just not cover them it doesn't even tell you that
these things are in existence and oftentimes it does even
worse where it demonizes and it actually dismisses the importance
or validity of some of these subfields for example nowhere
in academia or in science or in university will they
tell you that there's enormous value to be gained from
studying the new-age subfield or the spirituality subfield or the
emotional mastery subfield or the psychedelic subfield or the mmm
addiction recovery subfield or the success and productivity subfield right
these are not traditional academic university topics and so what
happens is that even if you which university and you
fancy yourself a rather educated person ultimately all the topics
that are the most important for your happiness and well-being
in life and your success all the topics I just
listed up above you almost know nothing about them unless
you have made a deliberate effort to educate yourself about
them by studying these various subfields because you sure as
hell were taught this stuff in university or in high
school science it's not gonna teach you this stuff because
Sciences is worried about very specific types of problems which
have really nothing to do with emotional mastery have nothing
to do with your success and your ability to handle
yourself or your ability to find a sense of purpose
in your life see and this way university is really
a travesty because the most important topics are not taught
and so people spend 12 years going through school and
another for six years going through university and they come
out of that and they're completely clueless about what they
need to do to survive in the world but that
is the state of our current education system so that's
gonna be that way for a while in the meantime
though what you got to do is you guys take
responsibility and double your efforts tell her in this stuff
yourself the silver lining is that it's much more enjoyable
to learn this stuff on your own without having to
do stupid homework assignments or essays or reports or any
that you can teach all this stuff to yourself and
it's gonna be much more enjoyable then school ever was
for you so don't be put off by that and
it's also super accessible it's super easy it doesn't cost
much money you can buy cheap books and get it
all done and you get to set your own direction
nobody tells you what you got to study you can
study whatever you want whatever works best for you whatever
you need whatever floats your boat now of course notice
that actualize that org doesn't cover all these subfields I
tend to have specific things that I focus on with
the videos that I shoot although I do try to
cover a broad swath the stuff we talked a lot
about various kinds of things from spirituality to psychedelics to
success and relationships and life purpose and confidence and self
esteem and and we'll be branching out even further in
the future with future episodes but you have to understand
that I'm not going to cover everything don't expect me
to be your only source I could create a separate
channel about each one of these subfields that I mentioned
and I could devote my entire life just to pumping
out videos on that particular sub field but for me
that's not what I want to do I have certain
topics that I want to cover and I also want
to introduce I see myself as sort of a person
who introduces people to this and then you can go
and find more specialized experts notice that no one teacher
or school or teaching will ever cover all of these
subfields it's way too much this is such a wide
domain this self-help stuff most teachers you find will be
very very narrowly specialized most spiritual schools and teachings will
be very very narrowly specialized so don't be surprised if
they're not gonna give you all the solutions to all
your problems you've got to be the CEO of your
own life don't outsource that responsibility to anyone else because
they will fail at it for you you can only
do it yourself that means you got to figure out
which subfields you need to study and I can't tell
you which subfields you got to study that all depends
on what kind of issues you have what it was
like what your genetics are like and what your interests
are like what your personality type in life is like
and so forth see and you won't know which of
these subfields is gonna have the perfect solution for you
like I said some of these subfields have the ability
to save your life they are that valuable they are
that powerful but the problem is that you don't know
which ones until you've delved into each one and gotten
a lay of the land and to do that you
really gotta like read five to ten books within a
subfield just to understand what that subfield is about and
how much value it can offer to you many people
they look at one of these subfields and they say
oh well that new-age subfield that's kind of stupid it's
not gonna be very valuable that MN LP subfield oh
that's not really powerful that love subfield a who wants
to study that that's not going to change my life
be very careful about that you got to keep a
very open mind I'll tell you this right now every
one of these subfields exists for good reason it's not
just some fool it's you know woke up one day
and said you know what I'm just gonna write a
book on some stupid topic some new-age topic and I'll
just put it out there just to earn a bunch
of money and buy myself a sports car that's not
how these books get written usually the way these books
get written is that some expert has struggled for decades
in their own life going through trauma and problems and
not knowing how to figure it out and then finally
they figured it out through luck and through study and
trial and error and then after many many decades of
that and teaching others finally they compiled all their wisdom
into this concise little book so it's there for a
reason there's not a single extraneous subfield of all the
fields I mentioned not a single one all of them
are necessary all of them serve a useful function all
of them solve specific problems that human beings have encountered
by the thousands and millions so if it seems to
you that some subfield is stupid and pointless and [
__ ] well that's just your own bias that's your
own closed-minded is talking that's what that is so be
careful not to judge too quickly there's enormous value in
each of these subfields the prob of course though is
that you have a very limited amount of time and
there's way too many books to read and even way
too many subfields for you to explore them all so
you got to be a little selective and you got
to decide what's right for you what do you need
most now to change your life and to kick-start your
journey and then over time you'll branch out and explore
more and more subfields but also I want to encourage
you not just to pursue those subfields which will give
you some immediate tangible results like maybe if you struggle
getting laid you probably obviously want to go read a
book about how to date and how to get laid
that's kind of obvious but but go further than that
I challenge you to be an explorer and an adventurer
explore these various subfields especially ones that maybe normally you
wouldn't think would be valuable to you explore them anyways
buy a few books from them read them just to
see what's possible there you'll be shocked to see the
kind of discoveries you'll make that's one of the most
amazing things about self-help is say you study stuff that
you think is stupid and then you realize just how
wrong you were and just how much value there is
in this thing now of course you're not gonna need
every subfields so don't go trying to just read as
much as you possibly can you want to be strategic
about what you're reading and what you're studying so keep
it to stuff that's gonna be things you can take
action on not just read about but stuff you can
take action on stuff that will actually engage you and
the stuff that engages usually the stuff that you're in
your life if you're lacking a good career if you're
lacking in finances if you're lacking in health then you
probably want to start with those topics but then also
explore and branch out into stuff that maybe you normally
wouldn't by exploring more of these subfields you're gonna move
automatically into spiral dynamics stage yellow because what we're doing
here by studying all these subfields is we're getting such
a diversity of perspectives so many perspectives about so many
facets of life that we're not going to be able
to stay in our rigid one perspective view of the
world that we had before before we started all this
research so which subfields are the best for you well
hmm it very much depends on you but I'll give
you a few that I think are really good for
newbies to start with so firstly success in productivity and
goal setting that's a really good foundational one secondly is
self-esteem and confidence because so many people have problems with
self-esteem and confidence and because that's a very generic problem
that if you a problem there that's gonna carry over
into everything into your relationships into your career into your
business into your own feelings about yourself and about your
life also emotional mastery that's absolutely essential for everybody because
your emotions run your entire life and if you're suffering
in your life then it's all emotional it's not factual
it's not objective it's purely emotional all suffering is purely
emotional and also I recommend studying relationships because chances are
you have plenty of relationships in your life or you
want to form high quality relationships and we are not
taught how to relate properly to other people especially within
intimate relationships and the last subfield is spirituality spirituality like
I said has the possibility of completely transforming your life
and that's where you get the deepest growth is when
you start to get into spirituality but with spirituality the
problem there's they're sort of a pea a cost to
that the payoffs of spirituality spiritual work is huge huge
payoffs but the downside is that it takes time it
takes time for spirituality to start to bear fruit probably
takes a few years of work or you do a
lot of work but you don't see a lot of
results and then the results start pouring in so I
recommend you start investing in that early so you can
get that first few years that first few unproductive years
out of the way and then you'll be enjoying the
fruits of your work so we're going to end this
with a homework assignment and the homework assignment is very
simple what I want you to do is I want
you to pick three new subfields that you don't have
a lot of experience in out of those that I've
mentioned above and I want you to commit to purchasing
three books from each one of these three subfields so
we're totally gonna buy ten nine books of course you're
gonna want to research these books and find three good
books from each of these subfields so that's your homework
assignment now I'm not saying you have to necessarily read
all these books I'm just saying I want you to
do some research into it and then to buy them
and to have them sitting on your bookshelf or on
your office desk looking you in the face you don't
have to read them per se just have them there
and just by having them in by purchasing them already
you're gonna gravitate towards picking one of those up and
reading it just that small step and then you know
by reading that one book in that book you're gonna
find exercises techniques ideas resources other book recommendations that that
book talks about various kinds of references and resources and
then it's gonna start to flower and geometrically lead to
new stuff and then that one book will lead to
three more books and those three books will read the
three more books and so on and so forth and
then before you know it you'll be a neck-deep and
all sorts of self-help stuff and you will have all
sorts of solutions and possibilities for your life that you
never had before that's one of the most amazing thing
things to me about studying all these subfield when you
study them deeply enough and broadly enough eventually you get
to the point where you feel like any problem that
will arise in your life you're gonna have a solution
for even if you don't have it in the back
of your mind already you know where you can go
to find the book that will have the solution because
you already know all these subfields kind of in a
broad sense not in a deep way just in a
broad sense you know that they're out there so you
know that if you have some trauma you know where
to go to fix your trauma if you have some
weird New Age mystical experience you know where to go
to find out what the solution to that is if
you have a problem while you're meditating you know where
to go to find a solution to your meditation problem
if you ever get depressed you know what to do
and this is the exact opposite of what most people
in society have most people in society are so lacking
in expertise and in in information that when they have
a problem they don't even know that there is a
solution to their problem and they live with their problem
for 10 or 20 years sometimes for their entire life
suffering this problem when the solution was just sitting there
in a book that they never knew about so do
that homework assignment and if you need ideas for books
check out my book list where I have over 200
books that I review and a lot of my favorite
books are they're rare type of books that you don't
really find anywhere else for those of you who already
have the book list I would challenge you to actually
not just pick nine books from my book lists because
probably you've already done that I would challenge you instead
to branch out and do a little bit of independent
research by yourself into three new subfields that I mentioned
and find three new books that are not on my
book list for yourself because you need to teach yourself
how to not just get books for me but um
but also discover them for yourself and I will be
updating my book list in the future with more new
books I've been reading quite a lot of great books
lately which I'll be adding in the months to come
I usually try to update my book list twice a
year and I've already updated it for free for those
who purchased it like I think five or six times
at this point so lots of free updates with lots
of new books I I think I've added over 50
new books to my book list since I first released
it and all the new books that I'm adding are
usually higher and higher quality books than the ones that
were there at the very beginning because I'm getting much
more choosy about the books that I read and and
yeah I'm just mind my standards for what counts as
a high quality book has changed a lot in the
last two or three years because as my knowledge base
grows I get a much deeper understanding of what a
good book is and what a bad book is and
you will develop that sense as well as you read
more and more alright that's it I'm out of here
please remember to click that like button for me and
come check out actualized org that's my website you will
find the book list there the life purpose course there
my blog and the forum where you can go and
talk about all this stuff and the final thing I
want to end on is this a little story from
tenth grade when I entered tenth grade I deliberately wanted
to challenge myself by taking some really difficult AP classes
advanced placement classes that were offered at my high school
before that I was just taking sort of the easy
classes and in tenth grade I just said you know
what I want to challenge myself so I enrolled in
like three AP classes and one of them was AP
European history and that was the hardest class I've ever
taken and it was probably the hardest class in my
whole school we had a really kind of a tough
teacher and he expected a lot from us and also
because the topic is so broad there's so much to
to European history to learn and and anyways so I
was struggling through this class for the whole year and
I kept taking tests that my teacher would be giving
me in preparation for the ultimate AP exam that comes
at the end of the year because the whole the
AP class is to prepare you for the AP exam
that you need to pass in April or in May
around that time so the whole year we're preparing for
that and I keep taking tests and writing essays for
my teacher and I keep just like bombing these tests
and just doing very poorly on them even though my
teacher is a really good teacher you know he writes
entire whiteboards full of notes and I'm sitting there copying
down all these notes and studying all this stuff but
I'm still like I still might my grasp for European
history was so poor and I just couldn't understand you
know why I'm struggling so much in this class and
I think I ended up getting a three a three
out of five on on my AP European history test
so I passed the test but ultimately but um mmm
it was it was a tough tough tough going for
me and then the next year I took more AP
classes and I did really good at them and I
did really great for for the rest of my academic
career but what I learned in eleventh grade after I
finished tenth the tenth grade and I struggled so much
is that I learned that actually what I wasn't doing
the reason I was struggling so much was because there
was a European history textbook that came with the class
that I didn't read at all that had all the
answers in it that had all the history in it
and I was looking at that time I was looking
at kids around me who were like doing good on
their tests and it baffled me like how how are
you guys doing good when I'm doing so bad and
I don't understand what's wrong so it took me a
whole year after the whole class was over to realize
that I wasn't reading the book I wasn't reading the
book that's it all the answers were in the book
I just it didn't click for me that I was
supposed to read a [ __ ] book right and
you would seem like well Leo that how could that
be a move so obvious how could you not connect
those two dots but that's exactly how learning is is
that it's not obvious until it becomes obvious it's always
obvious after the fact and that's exactly how it is
with self-help in all of your personal problems so right
now if you're struggling with your depression or your anxiety
or you're you're not you're struggling with business or your
career or your life purpose or you're starting with spirituality
and it just seems confusing and you don't know what
the answers are and it seems like you'll never get
it it seems hopeless but then after the fact it
will seem so obvious that's always how learning works so
the moral of this story is read the [ __
] book the answers are all there for you the
problem is you're not connecting the dots it's the most
obvious stuff that you're overlooking the information is all out
there don't just expect that you're gonna get everything you
need for this journey from me or from YouTube or
from videos it's not gonna happen there is depth and
detail that comes within books that you will not get
from me lecturing to you my mistake with this European
history class was that I thought that just by listening
to the teacher lecturing to me that the teacher would
teach me everything that I needed to know to pass
the test that wasn't the case and it was my
mistake for thing that it worked like that that was
just a false assumption I had I didn't realize that
yes the teachers is lecturing he's a great lecturer and
he writes lots of notes on them on the whiteboard
and I'm copying it all down in my notebook but
that's not enough not enough these actualized videos are not
enough for you to succeed on this journey you need
to read you need to read the [ __ ]
book a lot of you ask me very silly questions
about various kinds of personal develop problems you have and
what that tells me is that you're asking these silly
questions because you haven't bothered to do the reading you
haven't bothered to do the homework assignments you think you
can just skate by by listening to me while I'm
talking and you're [ __ ] playing video games or
something and I'm just talking in the background and you
think that's gonna be enough for you to master your
life get [ __ ] real you're a joker you're
not serious about this you haven't realized how important this
is to your life what this really means for you
how valuable this information is you're still taking it for
granted and also a lot of you question me and
asking me all sorts of skeptical questions about enlightenment about
this and about that Oh Leo how could you possibly
know this and Oh Leo how could you possibly know
that all you're so arrogant and this and this because
you're not doing the [ __ ] reading I'm not
the arrogant one I'm not the ignorant one you are
there's nothing skeptical or questionable about what I'm saying you
don't need to debunk what I'm saying you can just
got a [ __ ] read most people don't read
it's just that simple if you read more most of
your life's problems would be solved it really can be
that simple sometimes solutions are just that simple most of
your results just come from the fundamentals executing on the
stuff that's just basic if you can't discipline yourself to
do something as basic as reading I mean how serious
are you about mastering your life how serious are you
about spirituality how serious are you about creating a an
incredible life for yourself you think that's gonna happen for
a person who's too lazy to read a hundred books
no you're you're completely not seeing the value of this
work if you really saw the full value of this
work you would be willing to read a hundred books
you'd be willing to read 200 books you'd be willing
to read 500 books you'd be willing to do anything
whatever it takes to get it done that's the kind
of attitude you need that's the attitude of a winner
is I will do whatever it takes not just listening
to convenient videos where I regurgitate everything for you see
in a sense I'm doing a disservice by doing that
because I'm making you weak and lazy and complacent and
taking all this information for granted because all this information
that I reveal to you this is information that I've
spent years thinking about studying grinding towards you know working
my ass off to acquire and for you it's just
a one hour two hour episode of just me telling
you stuff and it just goes in one ear and
out the other and that's it that's it that's not
going to be enough to transform your life so get
serious do the homework read the books do the research
and then stick around for more and that's where you're
going to see the magic happen you
