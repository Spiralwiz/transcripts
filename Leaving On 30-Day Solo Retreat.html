the time has come for me to take a break
from actualised org and in this video I want to
explain why that is and how this is going to
work so basically I've been releasing videos pretty much non-stop
now for about five years since 2013 and releasing videos
every single week is pretty grueling and pretty exhausting I
did pause for one month last May where I did
a 30-day meditation retreat and that's basically what I'm doing
again this time right now so that's the plan is
to do a 30-day u meditation retreat and then come
back and reassess things and see how it is so
the reason that I'm doing this in and the reason
I'm sort of slowing down my releases with videos you
might have noticed is because yeah keeping up with this
schedule is quite challenging especially because the videos are becoming
more complex more nuanced I have to be more careful
with the advice that I give because as I become
more conscious and more knowledgeable I realize how how tricky
giving advice is and my advice needs to become more
nuanced and more careful and so it takes a lot
of time to study and to research all this stuff
every single week and that interferes with my own personal
ability to grow myself so running actualize that org is
a very delicate balancing act balancing between doing research reading
formulating ideas which is all very conceptual puts me a
lot in my in my mind and then also at
the same time going deep into myself doing consciousness work
doing inner work meditating contemplating doing all the sorts of
stuff and actually working to embody the stuff that I
talked about now a lot of people don't understand is
that these are two totally distinct things just because I'm
doing the talking part and the reading part in the
researching part in presenting nice episodes for you I can
do all of that and completely neglect my own in
her work conversely I could just focus entirely on my
inner work and not release any stuff for the public
for public consumption and so these are two totally separate
things and this this needs to be really understood because
it's really easy to just talk stuff but then to
not actually actualize it for yourself and for me to
really now actualize the stuff that I talked about because
we're getting it's more advanced territory with the topics that
I talk about I require more time in solitude to
just contemplate and meditate and really work to embody this
stuff which I've been doing so it's not like I've
been completely neglecting this part I've been doing it all
along but it's just that I need to go deeper
and lately over the last year I've been feeling more
and more that I need to take serious time off
at least a month maybe even a whole year and
just really go in wordly and focus on mastering various
things that I've shared with you so that I could
continue to share better insights in the future so that's
what these next 30 days for me are gonna be
about it's going to be about taking what I did
in May but going much further in May I did
only 15 days of the full 30 days that I
wanted to do it was very very challenging and so
what's changed now well again I don't know how long
I'm gonna last my intent is to go for 30
days straight it's gonna be a silent retreat just by
myself totally solo not under anyone's guidance meditating and contemplating
and basically just observing myself observing my own emotional reactions
and so forth hopefully aiming towards a pretty big awakening
experience which I think I'm overdue for now the difference
is that over the last nine or ten months since
last May up to today I've had a significant increases
in my baseline level of consciousness I experienced you know
growth just from those 15 days in May and after
the after that retreats I released a lot of very
deep content deep videos and with doing Kriya yoga and
with doing my brain training practices and with meditation and
with self inquiry I've had breakthroughs and in all these
practices my my monkey mind has quieted down a lot
mm-hmm I've also been working on improving my health and
my diet and doing some detox removing heavy metals from
my body and from my brain detoxing that I'm still
going through that process right now so a lot of
a lot of change and growth has occurred within me
since May and all I want to do is I
just want to take it much deeper and for that
I just need time by myself to really go into
it and so that's what's gonna be happening here in
the future I will be back but in the future
the releases that I do they're probably gonna be slower
it may not be weekly releases maybe it'll be bi-weekly
or maybe it will be weekly I don't know we'll
see but but yeah the releases will will will be
less consistent probably because what I'm noticing is that I
care less about the consistency these days I care less
about the quantity of material that I release I care
more about the quality and I care more about doing
original research and putting out groundbreaking stuff that really moves
mankind forward and so for that I just need more
time to research it and also to make sure that
the quality is there so that's that's really all this
going on and I also need more time to myself
also you know with the way that YouTube works there's
a big pressure when you're launching a YouTube channel to
be very consistent with your work and pretty much I've
I've tried to do that for the last five years
I was quite consistent missed missed a week here there
sometimes but mostly quite consistent and that was necessary to
get actualized I rigged up and running to build a
big audience big subscriber base but at this point I'm
at the point where I don't really care so much
about that I cared before about my own spiritual development
and then my ability to be a better teacher rather
than just keep pumping out content on a on a
weekly basis just for the sake of pleasing some YouTube
audience or some YouTube algorithm or whatever else so um
so yes I'm kind of outgrowing that to a certain
degree I'm really outgrowing the need for for having an
audience the need for getting subscribers the need for having
lots of views and clicks of course these are all
nice things success is nice I still like success but
but also I mean part of growing up part of
waking up is overcoming your materialistic desires and the holy
illusion of material success whether it's sex or money or
views or clicks or subscriber counts or whatever else you
basically outgrow it because you realize that it doesn't actually
make you happy no matter how much you get I
could have five million subscribers and millions of views but
what like is it really gonna do anything for me
no it's not the real value is in going deeper
into the work so I feel like I'm just this
is all kind of natural it's you just feel like
an all a natural evolutionary curve that I'm I'm going
through and so I will be beginning this 30-day meditation
retreat I plan us to last all thirty days without
breaking or cracking without turning to the TV or to
internet or to chatting with friends or any of that
kind of stuff so that's my goal you know but
you never know what happens on these retreats they can
be very very challenging and I expect this one to
be challenging but I also feel like I'm more prepared
for it than I was for the previous one because
you know you always get experiences even when you fail
doing something or you only seed halfway which is basically
what happened last time you see you learn a lot
from those failures you learn about your own weaknesses and
then the practices you do after the practices that I've
been doing for the last ten months those have all
been kind of building me up and preparing me to
now succeed on this on this next one and that
will be pretty exciting to see what do I plan
to be doing doing these during these 30 days I'm
not gonna be talking to any humans I'm not going
to be on the Internet I'm not gonna be engaged
any kind of media I'm not gonna be reading any
books or listening to any audio books so basically a
complete digital disconnection I'm not gonna be doing any work
so disconnection from work which is a big thing for
me because I spend most of my time doing work
mmm-hmm I'm not going to be coming up with new
business ideas or new video ideas I'm gonna be focusing
on just going deeply into myself and becoming more conscious
that's the plan and what techniques will I be using
to do this Kriya yoga I plan to be doing
two sets of Kriya yoga every day so it's about
an hour and a half total of that each set
lasts me it takes me about 90 minutes so I
don't know that's actually three hours yeah if every set
is 90 minutes about three hours right there for two
sets per day and then I'm going to be doing
about three hours of brain training using my EEG brain
training machine which is very effective for meditating so I'll
be doing that so already that's what three hours plus
five hours it's already eight hours right there of training
and that's going to be a shitload but but also
I'll just be doing mindfulness with labeling that technique that
I've shared with you in the past I'll also be
doing do nothing just sitting and basically doing nothing I'll
also be doing some concentration practices just focusing on an
object like a candle flame or a metronome or just
some visual object in the room and I'll also be
just contemplating various existential questions that I still have yet
to answer and also observing my emotional reactions so some
of the most tricky work within spirituality is to really
be mindful and conscious of your emotions to deconstruct your
entire emotional system so I'll be spending a lot of
time doing that as well psychedelics may be I'm not
sure yet if I want to do psychedelics psychedelics can
be quite disruptive of your meditation if you're doing a
solid retreat on the other hand thirty days is a
lot of time so to meditate for 30 days straight
is it's quite a lot so maybe psychedelics will be
used sprinkled interspersed in there too to just spice things
up a bit and that can also be very powerful
so we'll see how that goes mostly I'm mostly just
interested in increasing my baseline level of consciousness at this
point so the psychedelics aren't that central to me anymore
I've gotten a lot of value from them and I
still will do psychedelics in the future and also get
a much value from them I always get value from
them when I do them but for me it's really
about the practices and really cranking up my baseline level
of consciousness so that's what I'll be doing I thought
about shooting videos but I probably won't as far as
vlogging during my retreat because I just want to focus
on going inwards so I will not be doing any
vlogging videos I don't think unless some huge breakthrough happens
and in which case maybe I'll do one or two
spontaneous ones but what I will do is at the
very end of course after I complete my retreat I
will gather up all my conclusions and insights and breakthroughs
and those I will share with you and in sort
of one video explaining how everything went and what I
learned and maybe how you could learn from my own
experiences so that's how it's gonna go I'm gonna be
preparing all of my own food I will be driving
to the grocery store of course because I didn't stock
up on 30 days worth of groceries that's way too
difficult to do so yeah I will be driving to
the grocery store and shopping but even when I do
that when I'm in the car when I'm shopping for
a groceries I will still be meditating I will still
be maintaining mindfulness and so that's how that's going to
work let's see what else yeah I'm really excited actually
about this this next 30 days it's both simultaneously exciting
but also intimidating because I know there's gonna be a
lot of suffering ahead but I also know there's gonna
be a lot of amazing insights and breakthroughs even if
I don't have some massive awakening there will still be
more minor breakthroughs and insights that are still very profound
those 15 days that I did in May like really
some of the biggest growth that I got in years
and so I anticipate that this this here is gonna
be very powerful for me and part of it is
just because I feel like everything's been culminating to this
point all of my practices it also feels like I'm
overdue for some new awakening experiences and that's very exciting
and also just I feel like at the I'm at
the point motivationally and emotionally now where it feels like
I really am ready to get like really serious about
embodying spirituality on a daily basis mmm to really get
rid of a lot of the ego deconstruct a lot
of the ego and I'm also feeling like I'm sort
of at the end of a certain chapter in my
life cuz I've been doing actualize that work for five
years and it feels like in a certain sense is
getting a little bit stale I feel like I sort
of overcome many of the initial obstacles that came with
starting this business starting this channel getting subscribers releasing content
that I like releasing enough content that there is there
that there's enough of it there that it gives you
a comprehensive view of of spirituality and personal development and
so it feels like you know I'm getting to the
end and that something new needs to come to really
engage me next and that's always been the case in
my life is I do something I get involved in
some kind of project or some kind of endeavor whether
it's improving my health or going to the gym or
doing pickup or starting a business or starting actualize I
don't work something like this and it lasts for a
few years actually actually actualize that Oracle had been one
of the longest projects that I've ever done five years
that's quite a long time but then there's sort of
a natural closing and you need to know when to
close a certain chapter in your life and move on
to the next thing and then you know the next
chapter opens up and that becomes some new exciting thing
so now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that
I'm leaving actualize that Organa this is it what I'm
saying is there's going to be sort of a rebirth
a renaissance of actualize that org so what I'm sort
of hoping to happen I guess the ideal scenario would
be that I do these 30 days I have amazing
breakthroughs experience the awakenings and so forth and really what
I'm looking for is a is a radical stepping up
in my level of consciousness and development and kind of
moving on to the next stage of my life the
next chapter and the next chapter is going to be
a more spiritual chapter then this chapter was because really
this chapter that I've been working on was the business
chapter it was the life purpose chapter it wasn't it
wasn't the enlightenment chapter now I really need to go
to the next chapter and finally open up the enlightenment
chapter and of course that doesn't mean that I leave
actualize at org the idea is always that I want
to evolve and bring you guys along with me and
bring my content up with me as I do this
and maybe also changing the format of my content may
be doing more teaching in person rather than through videos
I may be doing a tour around the country or
maybe working on a book so you know there's there's
multiple different avenues that I could pursue and at this
point I'm still not sure which way to go I
want to kind of let it unfold organically and let
it be driven by the insights and developments that I
have over the next 30 days so that's that's the
idea I'm still very excited about teaching and sharing content
and I have you know have I run out of
ideas for new videos no I have at least a
hundred and fifty outlines already in the works for videos
so it's a hundred and fifty separate video topics the
way I work on new content nowadays is that I've
sort of developed a new system where before I would
work on one outline at a time I would you
know brainstorm various ideas and insights for one particular topic
now what I do is now I am simultaneously sort
of just like working a little bit on 150 different
outlines at once and it's sort of this multi threaded
approach and it actually works a lot better for the
way that my brain and my mind worked is that
I'm constantly thinking of a million different things at once
always interconnecting everything so it's it's very nonlinear and so
what I do is I just every time I get
some new idea for some particular topic I kind of
just jot it down into one of my outlines for
some particular topic and I keep adding to it and
adding to it and adding to it but this takes
time this takes months sometimes you know certain certain outlines
that I'm creating take months to create some of them
have been in the work for years literally years and
I'm just kind of waiting for my mind to to
gel more stuff on that topic and to really get
some juicy insights and then to interconnect it with with
stuff that I'm releasing and then so the benefit of
doing this way is that I can interconnect all these
different 150 topics in an interesting way and it gives
you much more of a bigger picture perspective so there's
there's a lot of stuff to talk about and it's
not just going to be a rehashing of non-duality or
enlightenment there's completely new topics that I haven't talked about
ever before and some of the most practical stuff that
you'll hear me talking about is yet to come so
there's a ton of stuff and I'm constantly excited I
haven't lost my motivation to teach this stuff or to
do these outlines or videos it's just that I'm the
one thing that I learned about myself is that in
order to be engaged with life I always need some
amount of newness I'm always searching for it for new
ways of doing stuff I can't just like keep doing
the same thing over and over and over again even
if it's successful like some people they can just like
maybe start a business and then their business is succeeding
and they just can't like keep selling I don't know
whatever they're selling let's say they're selling vacuum cleaners and
so they just kind of keep selling and selling vacuum
cleaners like over and over again for like year after
year after year for 40 years I can't do that
right for me the whole point of my life and
the whole point of my work is to constantly be
innovating it has to be new I can't be just
rehashing stuff that other teachers have said and talked about
like know what needs to happen is like I need
to I need to use my time in order to
advance the cutting edge of spirituality and personal development and
science and philosophy that's what my life is about and
so that's a very very different thing from just teaching
standard material right so like there's two different types of
teachers you might say there's the kind of teacher like
maybe you might imagine your 5th grade math teacher your
5th grade math teacher has spent 40 years teaching the
exact same set of math equations and math formulas and
math teachings at the 5th grade level like for 40
years and like he's happy doing that I would never
be happy doing that for me I always have to
be teaching something new and to be teaching something new
I always have to be researching and actually experi minting
with this stuff and it's not enough for me just
to like read a new book because I read new
books all the time anyways so it's not that's not
the issue I'm always reading new books but it's like
I have to actually discover new stuff and I'm not
just interested in discovering new stuff that others have discovered
I'm actually interested in discovering new stuff that no one
has ever discovered and believe it or not there's plenty
of stuff within spirituality that no one has yet discovered
and articulated via writing or via speech or via video
that's how deep this stuff is the stuff is very
deep very broad and it's not just about discovering new
stuff but it's also about interconnecting stuff and modernizing stuff
bringing it into the modern era so with spirituality you
might say well Leo but the Buddha the Buddhist scriptures
you know they're so voluminous they have all the teachings
you could possibly want what more could you want well
that's not true yes the Buddhist scriptures contain a lot
of amazing insights and they may even have all the
stuff you need to know if you're talking about meditation
only but I'm interested in a lot more than just
meditation or enlightenment or non duality I'm interested in how
do you interconnect that with neuroscience with the cutting edge
field of psychedelics and the new research that's being done
there with addiction recovery with psychotherapy leading cutting edge discoveries
within psychotherapy cognitive behavioral science within sociology within politics with
an evolutionary theory right so I'm interconnected spiritual insights with
cutting edge scientific insights so you might think well Leo
you're not scientific at all actually no I'm very much
pro science even though I rant against science a lot
I'm actually very much pro science what I rant against
within science is the corruption the unscientific portions of science
that's what I rant against so my whole thing is
making science more scientific and then integrating spirituality psychology philosophy
science all of it together but also not just that
but also politics and understanding how government works understanding how
to build societies at how to be better leaders so
to me all of this combining it with new technology
various kinds of brain trading machines and slight cutting-edge psychedelics
and research chemicals and whatever else is out there there's
all sorts of exciting technology that's that's gonna be coming
online in the next 50 years and it's gonna improve
your ability to meditate to understand how the brain works
to diagnose diseases and problems so you know it's not
enough to just have a fixed set of teachings for
how to become enlightened that's not enough for humanity to
do what it needs to do and even for you
individually to live the kind of life that you want
to live that's not enough there's so much more to
life than just non-duality there's so much more to life
than you'll discover if you read all of the Buddhist
scriptures or even if you study all the spiritual traditions
from the past that's not gonna cut it because society
technology humanity is constantly evolving it's changing we're having to
deal with new challenges stuff is getting more complex and
that's why spirituality is a constantly growing and evolving thing
it never stops more and more needs to be integrated
and interconnected and this will keep going for thousands of
years more so you know don't think that we're like
at the end of anything here we're really just at
the beginning Humanity is just the beginning we're just starting
to awaken we're just starting to see the first rays
of light from a long period of being stuck in
the dark ages and we still are in the dark
ages but we're starting to see a few rays of
light but then we do a lot of work to
really to spread that light throughout all of society that
work isn't just physical it isn't just technological it's also
intellectual in fact first and foremost its intellectual before we
can lay the mental infrastructure like the actual roads and
bridges and fiber-optic cables which are going to interconnect the
whole world we first need an intellectual revolution we intellectual
frameworks and foundations and don't you think for a second
that because you become enlightened and now you're in some
state where you're not thinking a lot you're out of
your mind so to speak that somehow that now none
of these problems that I'm talking about that there are
real problems and that and that what I'm talking about
is just mental masturbation or monkey mind no no no
no no there needs to be serious serious intellectual framework
and infrastructure built for all of mankind to be able
to awaken that's very very important and that's what actualize
it really is it's a lot of theory it's a
lot of concepts and you should never confuse that with
absolute truth or with Awakening itself but it's this theory
it's the frameworks that are necessary in order for people
to be able to study spirituality properly in a holistic
integrated manner and also to develop themselves to understand spiral
dynamics and the different developmental stages that exist to understand
the shadow and various problems that exist there to think
about how their spirituality is going to interconnect with their
career with their health with their life purpose with their
political positions with technology new technology that's emerging how we
need to transform various institutions within society like education universities
government corporations and so forth so there's there's an enormous
amount of intellectual work that needs to be done here
more than I will be able to do in my
lifetime I will die before I finish doing all this
even if I live to be a hundred years old
so really I mean we need thousands of people doing
this work laying these intellectual foundations in the same way
that the current era that we're in the sort of
materialistic air that we're in the scientific age of reason
the Information Age that were in right now the corporate
business age that we're in right now really the foundation
for that was laid during the French Revolution in Europe
the European enlightenment which should not be confused with non-dual
enlightenment the European enlightenment with figures like Voltaire and Rousseau
and David Hume and John Locke you know many many
of these intellectuals and philosophers they laid the foundation for
modern liberal capitalist democracy which you see in Britain and
Western Europe in America and has been spreading more and
more throughout the world these were intellectual philosophical foundations that
were laid first you know many kings and monarchs and
tyrants were overthrown which led to the modern age and
so those ideas are starting to run their course now
in a new set of ideas we need to have
new enlightenment the real enlightenment and we need to when
in we need a scientific enlightenment we need a philosophical
enlightenment we really need to transform how philosophy is taught
we need an Enlightenment of our education system we didn't
enlightenment of our political system we knew new forms of
government beyond capitalism and beyond standard Marxism Marxism is quite
outdated right so we need new stuff the problem is
that when people study spirituality they get they get stuck
they get stuck thinking like oh well Blio you know
I'm reading my Buddhist scriptures and that's good enough for
me or I'm just gonna follow the course in mirror
and I'm just gonna like go through there abc123 connect-the-dots
formula and nomina and that's going to be it we're
gonna be good after that no these are very narrow
approaches there's nothing wrong with any of these per se
but they're just individual tools and really what we need
is we need a much more broad framework very few
spiritual teachers or schools at this point right now in
the 21st century take an integral holistic approach to spirituality
and human development very very very few maybe there's one
or two exceptions but they're they're certainly not known by
almost anybody they're very niche not very mainstream the stuff
that's mainstream is stuff that's basically thousands of years old
or hundreds of years old and people are following it
like sheep they're not thinking independently one of the things
that blows my mind the most is when I when
I really look at the world and I see what's
going on with people in the world is that I
look at it and even those people who are supposedly
doing spirituality and consciousness work the Buddhists the Yogi's the
Hindus I look at it and it's still so barbaric
and it's still so short-sighted and it's still so little
picture and there's still so much stuff that's missing and
it's not interconnected and it's not cutting edge it's just
not cutting edge stuff it's at least hundreds of years
old if not thousands of years old it doesn't integrate
modern for example insights from psychology and psychotherapy modern insights
that we're learning from psychedelics and most of the stuff
most the obstacles you're going to run across when you're
doing spirituality he's not going to be spiritual stuff it's
mostly going to be psychological baggage that comes up that
needs to be processed but a lot of these ancient
spiritual traditions because they were developed long before there was
an official research field called psychology or sociology or anthropology
or any of these kinds of ologies these human sciences
you know these human signs are just 100 years old
oftentimes even less than that so so many spiritual schools
just are completely ignorant of this and then what's worse
is that they justify to themselves to say alia well
we don't really need psychology or sociology or anthropology and
supposedly when you're totally enlightened you figured out everything of
course this is total ignorance that's not how it works
because there's much more to it than just enlightenment it's
about figuring out how to live your life there are
amazing insights and techniques that have been developed over the
last 50 years just within the modern self-help movement I'm
just talking about very simple stuff material stuff like the
Tony Robbins style teachings Jim Rome Rohn style teachings there's
a lot that many of you still need to learn
from that and really what needs to happen is that
we need to integrate non-duality all the spiritual traditions and
religions across the entire globe including the Hindus the Buddhists
the Christians the Muslims the Aztecs and all that the
Jew the Jews and everything is so integrate all that
with non-duality plus with science with physics and with evolution
plus with all the social sciences like anthropology sociology psychology
plus with philosophy plus with technology plus with political science
what else am I forgetting there's probably more but at
the very least we need to integrate all of those
oh well also of course very importantly with personal with
self-help basically with Tony Robbins style self-help and now when
we integrate all of that now we're really starting to
get something see so that's sort of my vision of
what I'm trying to accomplish here of course we also
need to reform massively reform science the foundations of science
the the metaphysical and epidemiological foundations of science need to
need to be completely reformed and of course we need
to reform our entire culture as well and of course
we need to we need to change our entire nutritional
system needs to change our entire educational system needs to
change so all of this you know and probably more
than I that's still not coming to mind there's so
much a bit one of my biggest problems is that
there's so much stuff here to integrate that I can't
keep it all in my memory banks it's too much
you know you got to have thousands of pages of
notes to interconnect all this stuff it's quite challenging it's
it's way more challenging than just sitting on a cushion
and becoming woke which is not to say that that's
bad you should definitely do that you should definitely sit
on a cushion you just become woke which is what
I'll be doing over the next 30 days is just
doing that but there's also then a lot of work
to be done integrating all this stuff together developing more
sophisticated systems and not sophisticated and says that they're more
complex it's not about complexity per se it's not about
mental masturbation just develop ugh developing a bunch of knowledge
per se it really all these things really are necessary
if you really want a large chunk of mankind to
wake up it is not going to happen simply by
spreading Buddhism across the world or Christianity across the world
or even neo-advaita across the world or Eckhart Tolle lays
teachings across the world that's not going to do it
that's still far too limited if you really want all
of mankind wake up if you want all mankind to
wake up you gotta you gotta throw everything and the
kitchen sink at this problem including psychedelics technology you got
to reform the political system the education so everything I
mentioned previously you got to bring all that in you
got to reform corporate culture you got to reform nutrition
like everything has to change so this is a very
massive C massive project so this project doesn't really end
but for me to really be able to to do
this to contribute significantly to this project first and foremost
I have to start with myself you see it's very
tempting to go out there and try to change the
world without first having conquered yourself worked on yourself really
developed a strong connection with Toyota develop a really strong
tail utilized heart really purified yourself and really also spent
a lot of time doing research and interconnecting all this
stuff because one thing that the ancient sages and masters
got really well was that they mastered themselves internally they
were pretty good at doing that through yoga and meditation
and so forth but what they weren't so good at
is they weren't so good at then integrating all of
that with various kinds of intellectual frameworks that are necessary
to shape intellectual tradition and culture as a whole you
see they kind of siloed themselves spiritual people became monks
and Yogi's they isolated themselves into monasteries and caves sure
they developed sophisticated assistance of spiritual teaching and sure they
spread their message across to millions and even billions of
people in the end but still they separated themselves too
much from government from politics from science from mmm philosophy
and other kinds of intellectual research you see and that
creates sort of fracturing or schism and so there's a
lot of work to be done to stitch all those
together to break apart those silos if you really want
this stuff to go mainstream the way that of course
it will inevitably go so what I'm talking about here
is I'm talking about the wave of the future of
human development and the development of society government education nutrition
philosophy science all of this is to me I think
of it all as all one giant just movement forward
advancing forward it's really just one arc of evolution that's
happening with humanity and so to be right on that
cutting edge in this very holistic and integrated way that's
something quite new very few people have done that ken
Wilber is one pioneer within this field but even Ken
Wilber really doesn't there's there's still more like for example
Ken Wilber doesn't integrate psychedelics because he's never done them
himself which is a shame because I think his work
would benefit a lot from that now of course he's
done a lot of integrating already so I can't really
blame the guy he's he's done a massive amount of
integration so I'm really grateful for his work it's amazing
but it doesn't stop we need to take it and
build upon it and go further and deeper and broader
all at the same time and we need to make
it more mainstream so that other people know about it
so it's not just for nerds or for academics and
so yeah so it's very tempting for me to go
and run off and do all that while neglecting my
own inner development and so again I have to strike
a very delicate balance between the external work that I
do and the internal work that I do and so
um for those of you who have Lala a sense
of life purpose and who are ambitious and want to
change the world that's great and those of you who
want to help mankind to awaken that's all great I
just want to caution you here to be very very
careful because a lot of people have fallen into this
trap is that they go about doing that while neglecting
their own inner development you can only lead people to
Asshai a place as you yourself have reached and no
higher so if your ultimate vision is to lead people
to very high places you need to be able to
first lead yourself to those very high places and as
your leading lots of people thousands and millions of people
and you're trying to have this big impact on culture
and on society and on science and on politics on
government on all the stuff you've got to be extremely
careful because the more influence you have the more the
devil in you will want to co-opt you and the
truth within you to serve the devil's purposes you see
this is natural this is totally inevitable so the more
power and status you acquire the more careful you have
to be about all of your base materialistic desires and
how easily corrupted you are by the devil how much
do you lost after sex food power status fame all
these sorts of things these sorts of things if you
don't gain consciousness over them they will corrupt you and
make you a vehicle of the devil's bidding and even
though you be teaching spirituality and you might think you're
having a good effect really what's gonna happen is you're
gonna build an organization which is going to become a
cult which is going to become the next Christianity the
next Catholic Church the next Buddhist Dogma you know the
next dogmatic yogic system which is not going to be
flexible enough and integral enough to really accomplish the ultimate
aim that Te'o is shooting for which is a total
of integration a total integration of everything a total self
understanding that's what Toyota wants and that's what Toyota results
have been going to get but that's a very long-term
vision you know that'll take millennia to accomplish all that
in the short-term though there's gonna be a lot of
hiccups a lot of obstacles a lot of dead ends
and a lot of disasters that will befall us because
people who do this work will not have sufficiently purified
their own hearts and therefore they will mislead others and
they will fall into temptation and wickedness and sin and
depravity and they will mislead their followers into doing the
same so I'm very mindful about not doing that myself
so I have to work on the the devil within
me before I can really actualize some of these big
plans that I have going forward like one of the
things I've also been struggling with is with my own
health in the last few months I had the sinus
infection which I'm still working on I have some energy
problems and chronic fatigue problems because of my hypothyroid condition
and so I've been I've been I've been looking for
ways to increase my health naturally because you know I've
gone to doctors I've tried various things and nothing seems
to really work especially none of the traditional Western doctors
so um like just in the last month I've been
starting to eat a lot more healthy and starting to
take detoxing my body varies seriously and I'll be doing
that basically over the next year because I can tell
that for me to be able to accomplish this big
vision that I have one of the things that's going
to hold me back is just that I don't have
enough energy to do it physical and mental energy to
do it unless I eat very cleanly and that requires
for example making sacrifices I have to sacrifice my favorite
foods and never eat them again in my entire life
and eat various kinds of nasty vegetables and stuff drinking
various kinds of nasty juices and you know saying no
to that for the greater good you know serving this
mission so and improving my health improving my immune system
so you know when you have a big vision what
you'll find is required is making sacrifices for it and
the way that you make these difficult sacrifices that you
make your vision so much more powerful than anything that
you're giving up that giving it up no longer seems
like a big problem you're happy to give it up
because your vision of what you're going to get in
return for it is so huge see and that's what
the hero's journey is all about it's about making sacrifices
for some greater good and actually that's what makes you
feel the best in life is when you're on the
edge you're pursuing something new something really worthwhile something that
would push mankind forward and then to do that you
realize that you need to become a much better human
being in the same way that you know people have
children and I'm not speaking from experience here but I
can just imagine it that the moment you have a
child in a certain sense your whole life changes on
that day because now you have a whole new set
of responsibilities and in a certain sense that child within
you has to die because you have a real child
to take care of so your childish ego you know
you can't keep your childish ego and also do what's
necessary for your child you have to make sacrifices on
behalf of your child you have to be more responsible
you have to quit doing stupid stuff the way you
used to do when you were younger you have to
grow up but also at the same time like you
look into the face of your newborn baby child and
you realize that it's worth it for her or for
him um because you know that's something amazing to you
that's a miracle that's worth it to you so it's
just like that with with anything that the hero is
doing it's just like that if you're starting some new
business or you're trying to awaken the world or you're
leading a political movement or whatever you have to make
sacrifices for it and you're gonna have to surrender yourself
because you yourself are your own greatest obstacle you yourself
are getting in the way have you noticed how many
great politicians have ruined their careers by getting in their
own way like one that comes to mind to me
is for example John Edwards a few election cycles ago
John Edwards seemed like a nice politician he was like
on his way up he could have even become president
or vice president quite easily but then you know he
screwed it all up because he couldn't keep his dick
in his pants destroyed his entire career because he couldn't
keep his dick in his pants or Anthony Weiner another
politician from from New York you know he also seemed
like a very kind of up-and-coming energetic charismatic leader and
he had some you know progressive ideas for New York
City and he wanted to become was a senator or
I don't know what he was running for but again
he couldn't keep his dick in his pants and he
just screwed it up you see he could have had
an amazing career where he could have like transformed millions
of lives changed New York maybe he could have been
become president you know really made a big impact on
the world really helped mankind but he couldn't keep his
dick in his pants and now he just got out
of prison spent a whole year in prison for texting
with a with a minor you know it's that kind
of stupid stuff that just derails your whole life derails
your your biggest vision so you have to be very
careful whatever your vision is whether it's starting a business
or awakening the world watch out because the devil is
still within you you haven't purified the devil out of
you yet and so that devil will tempt you with
all sorts of selfishness basically you yourself will get in
your own way and sabotage yourself so how do you
prevent that by doing these sorts of retreats that I'm
about to do by really going inwards facing your own
self being really honest with your own limitations and problems
your own wickedness really look at it come with come
come face to face with it suffer face suffering these
retreats if you ever do one of these retreats it'll
be the most suffering you've ever done in your life
but the difference will be that it will be conscious
suffering whereas most of your life what you do is
you do unconscious suffering and we need to unconscious suffer
you don't learn anything you don't grow when you suffer
consciously that's when you really grow and you know as
you become more successful more famous more prestigious you have
more status this is actually very necessary these kinds of
retreats because these retreats make you humble the suffering makes
you humble otherwise you can get a position in life
where you become too comfortable it becomes too easy you're
too famous people kiss your ass too much people agree
with you too much you feel like you've built this
comfy nest for yourself so now it's like you know
you have a bunch of money you have a bunch
of sack so you have a bunch of you have
a house you have two houses you have a car
you have a family everything's taken care of and you
know you have a big business and it's all successful
and now you know you get too comfortable and you
forget what it's like at the bottom you forget what
it's like to suffer that disconnects you from other humans
around you because other humans around you are suffering you
know when you are in such a nice cushy position
for yourself in life after a few years of that
you forget that suffering even exists anymore and then you
spend the rest of your life chasing pleasure and titillation
and also avoiding suffering and then it gets so bad
that you could you know resort to all sorts of
really dysfunctional pathological behavior just to avoid a little bit
of discomfort and suffering in your life and then of
course that pathological behavior just snowballs and eventually it explodes
into a giant supernova of suffering and then and then
them and then things go bad for you but this
suffering that you do when you're avoiding suffering that's unconcious
suffering and so you don't grow from it so really
what you need to do in life is you need
to deliberately put yourself into challenging situations where you suffer
consciously now that doesn't mean that you you know you
cut your arms with a razor blade in some sort
of dysfunctional teenage fashion it doesn't mean that you that
you inflict pain on yourself unnecessarily what it means is
that you just do the things no need to be
done that's really all you need to do if you're
doing the things that you know need to be done
that are for the greater good don't worry plenty of
suffering will come your way from doing that you'll have
to face many fears and you'll have to face your
own inadequacies and in capacities and limitations you know like
for example when I do one of these retreats for
30 days and I tell you guys that I'm gonna
do for 30 days and then I only last 15
days and I fail you know that gives me a
lot of suffering because I know that I you know
I I broke my own word and I broke my
word to you so you know that kind of suffering
that's a good kind of suffering because that keeps me
honest whereas if I wanted to you know I could
just like I could go buy a million dollar house
on some tropical island and just live there surround myself
with beautiful women you know go through some new hot
woman every month and just rake in more and more
money you know start some big advertising campaign sucker in
a bunch of newbies earn a bunch of money sell
them a bunch of cheap self-help products or whatever and
just become rich and fat and lazy on my tropical
island living in my million dollar house you know thought
I could do that but eventually that would explode into
a supernova of terrible suffering and and also if I
did that and I wouldn't be able to really get
the higher level fulfillment that I would get if I
executed on my hero's journey and I did the stuff
that I know toyota wants done see Toyota wants certain
things done and so your job in this life is
to make yourself a vessel a vehicle for Toyota's work
and the best of Nestle's four tails work are those
that are fully purified of their own egotism so they're
not getting in their own way so that a yodel
can work through you like a superconductor remember that analogy
that idea I talked about in the past you want
to become a superconductor for the energy of Toyota to
work through you and that's how you have the most
fulfilling most beautiful life is if you can do that
but what you have to realize is that that is
not an easy thing that's not an easy thing to
do you will suffer for it but the consolation is
that it's going to be a good kind of suffering
not the bad kind of suffering that you get by
avoiding things you need to do it's the good kind
of suffering and not only will you get the good
kind of suffering but you will also get an enormous
pleasure and ecstasy and I feel a feeling of fulfillment
and profound profundity that you would never otherwise get if
you just chose the easy life so this is not
the easy life we're talking about doing Toyota's work is
not the easy life what do I mean by this
what's an example of this Gandhi is a great example
of this and I'm not saying Gandhi didn't have his
problems I'm sure Gandhi had many problems but what I'm
saying is that overall if you look at the arc
of Gandhi's life and what Gandhi was doing and if
you don't know what Gandhi was doing you should go
read and read his biography I'll read biographies about him
it's very inspiring um but this is what Gandhi was
basically doing and he really walked his talk really walked
his talk he made a lot of sacrifices you know
he was jailed he was beaten he was near killed
many times and eventually he was killed that's right because
transformative people who really wanted to advent advanced the cutting
edge of society and who really want to make a
big splash in the world a lot of them end
up getting killed because there's a collective ego backlash against
them very understandable you know who killed Gandhi by the
way Gandhi was killed by a Hindu nationalist not by
a Muslim but by Hindu nationalists because India and Pakistan
at that time they separated when India was gaining its
independence this was like in the in the early 20th
century so it was all under British colonial rule Gandhi's
whole mission was to gain Indian independence he accomplished that
but as soon as that account was accomplished because India
has a lot of Muslims and Hindus in it that
quickly became the problem of well is our government gonna
be a Hindu government or a Muslim government and so
they couldn't agree about that so they basically created two
states they created India and Pakistan India was the Hindu
government and Pakistan was the Muslim Ron government and and
Gandhi was basically in agreement with this he was for
sort of a two-state solution but he was assassinated by
a Hindu nationalist because that nationalist perceived Gandhi as being
a traitor to Hinduism because he wanted even the Muslims
to be basically under the yoke of Hinduism you see
so so this shows you you know people love to
hate and people love to hate especially those who are
most tolerant and who are most loving so that's just
a little tangent inside there but the point here being
is that um they're definitely sacrifices to living this kind
of hero's journey life but at the same time it's
the most rewarding because you're engaged with life the most
miserable life is when you're just working at Starbucks your
whole life and that's all you do and there's like
no future prospects for you your job is just like
making people's coffee which is gonna make no impact on
the world in fact even worse here your addicting people
to coffee and just fattening them up with sugar destroying
their health and then you're depressed and miserable and you
just live a very mediocre life right because you chose
you were bored of this world and at some point
in your life you chose to just kind of phone
it in and be a hack in life and not
to do anything amazing enough to do anything important and
not to make yourself a vehicle of Toyota you see
Toyota doesn't want you to be standing in a Starbucks
pouring coffee for 40 years straight that's not what Toyota
wants that's what you became because you have refused Toyota's
call and of course most people don't even know what
a ol is or that there is such a possibility
of a call so that's mostly why they get sucked
into something like that they don't know any better but
you because you're listening to me and you should know
better because we've talked about this stuff a lot and
go check out my episode called the highest hero's journey
where I talk about that and also check out my
life purpose course which is all about that so anyways
I've gone on too long here hopefully this gives you
a little idea of what I'm doing what my vision
is for the future and now it's time for me
to begin the inner work and I'll report to you
how that goes the good the bad and the ugly
and fear not because there's still more videos to come
actual eyes that rook is not over I will be
back soon you
