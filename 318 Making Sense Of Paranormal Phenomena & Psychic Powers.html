            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/CIPE5YH2zgc' target='_blank'>Making Sense Of Paranormal Phenomena & Psychic Powers</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Paranormal Spiritual Phenomena</b>: Leo Gura explores various supernatural phenomena that are often considered paranormal but asserts that they are part of his reality. His definition of reality is rather subjective, viewing it as one giant infinite hallucination. Phenomena such as ESP, telepathy, clairvoyance, remote viewing, healing, astral projection, among others, come under this sphere. 
</li><li><b>Research into Non-Duality and Occurrence of Paranormal Aspects</b>: For the past two years, Gura has been researching non-duality to help himself become enlightened. Throughout this process, paranormal aspects of spirituality have continuously appeared. Upon cross-referencing dozens of sources, he developed a paradigm shift, making the paranormal, the new normal for him. 
</li><li><b>Skepticism Towards Paranormal Phenomena</b>: Leo recognizes that the idea of paranormal phenomena is likely to be met with skepticism. He suggests that what one considers normal or paranormal is largely subjective. Gura urges listeners to keep an open mind, think critically and conduct their own research.
</li><li><b>The Flaws in Current Scientific Approach to Paranormal Phenomena</b>: While science is seen as the ultimate source of truth, Leo criticizes its limitations, particularly its paradigm restrictions and its framework limitations. He asserts that these could be the reasons why science hasn't fully acknowledged or validated paranormal phenomena.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Radical Open-mindedness</b>: Gura highlights the need for radical open-mindedness while dealing with this subject. He further emphasizes the importance of thinking critically and encourages viewers to explore and conduct their own research.
</li><li><b>Being Comfortable with Paranormal</b>: There is an explanation of why Gura, through his research and experiences, became comfortable with paranormal activities and even considers them as part of his new normal. He believes these phenomena contribute further to understanding spirituality.
</li><li><b>Resistance against Paranormal in Mainstream Science and Culture</b>: Gura mentions how mainstream culture and science often misunderstand and dismiss paranormal phenomena. He elaborates the resistance faced when presenting unorthodox beliefs, leading to what he calls the "blackhole effect."
</li><li><b>Actual Existence and Misunderstanding of Psychic Powers</b>: Gura argues that psychic powers exist but are often misunderstood. He believes that while there is scientific evidence for these, they do not work in the concrete, physical ways that are conventionally portrayed.
</li><li><b>Discussion on Various Supernatural Phenomena</b>: The talk covers various supernatural phenomena, including past lives, auras, witchcraft, etc. Here, Gura asserts his belief in their existence based on credible accounts and practices despite lacking personal experiences with these phenomena.
</li><li><b>Belief in Various Supernatural Powers</b>: Leo expresses his belief in various supernatural powers like levitation, telekinesis, etc., asserting that there are credible accounts from trustworthy sources. However, he acknowledges that he has not personally experienced these powers.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging Paranormal Abilities</b>: Gura emphasizes that paranormal abilities exist, as experienced by enlightened individuals. He talks about how these abilities often remain undisclosed, fearing they may distract from spiritual exploration.
</li><li><b>Speaker's Intent</b>: Leo assures he is not attempting to promote New Age beliefs or conspiracy theories but only sharing his informal findings and worldview. He encourages skepticism and individual research into these abilities.
</li><li><b>Caution in Exploring Supernatural Abilities</b>: Leo cautions against ego development and over-information during the exploration of supernatural abilities and adds that his models of reality are constantly evolving which may result in communication difficulties in the future. He ends by emphasizing the importance of humility, openness, and exploration in self-actualization.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Radical Open-mindedness and the Bias in Our Information Sources</b>: Leo highlights that our understanding of paranormal phenomena is greatly influenced by our media and cultural exposure. Our perception of reality may be biased and limited by the people we interact with and the information we consume. He advises that traveling, exploring diverse cultures, and learning from spiritual masters could radically change our perspective and open our minds to paranormal experiences.
</li><li><b>The Potential for Paranormal Abilities</b>: He expresses that individuals with paranormal abilities often exist outside mainstream circles. These people may fear being marginalized or persecuted if they openly shared their abilities. Hence, it is no surprise that not many people encounter individuals with such powers in their day-to-day lives. Our fixed belief in a physical, predictable reality may also influence us to dismiss or ignore evidence of paranormal phenomena.
</li><li><b>The Impossibility of Capturing Paranormal Abilities on Video</b>: Leo points out that documenting paranormal abilities like clairvoyance or remote viewing on a video platform could be challenging due to its subtle and non-materialistic nature. He also suggests that even if there were videos of paranormal activities, our biases and preexisting paradigms might cause us to dismiss them as manipulated or false.
</li><li><b>Debate on Fortune-telling and Predicting the Future</b>: Leo presents a counter-argument to the skepticism around fortune-telling. He suggests that prophesying or seeing the future may not always be 100% accurate, but even if it is 30% accurate, it is still valuable and beneficial. He also proposes that some individuals may utilize their psychic abilities for financial gain, such as predicting stock market trends, although they would likely keep it a secret.
</li><li><b>The Compatibility of Non-duality and Paranormal Abilities</b>: Leo emphasizes that non-duality (the concept that everything is one) and paranormal abilities are not mutually exclusive. Although non-duality implies a singularity of existence, it doesn't preclude the possibility of varying facets of reality, including paranormal phenomena.
</li><li><b>The Imperative for Radical Open-mindedness</b>: Leo insists that an open mind is crucial for understanding and accepting the existence of paranormal phenomena. He acknowledges the difficulty in convincing people who dismiss or have no experience with these occurrences. He argues that the ones who have realized these abilities are so convinced that they feel no need to validate or prove their experiences to others. This reinforces the importance of radical open-mindedness in interpreting unconventional aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>Paranormal phenomenon convergence</b>: Leo highlights the sheer volume of paranormal phenomenon reports from different cultures, languages, and periods, numbering tens of thousands, indicating a convergence that is too significant to dismiss entirely as fantasy. Despite the potential inaccuracies and exaggerations in these reports, they shouldn't be completely disregarded but treated seriously due to their prevalence.
</li><li><b>Contribution of different mystics and religious traditions</b>: Leo suggests that famous mystics throughout history, like Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, did exploit some real paranormal abilities. Their exhibition of these abilities would have an enormous impact on ordinary people's beliefs, making them loyal worshippers. However, when spirituality tried to go mainstream, it's easily corrupted and turned into religious dogmas.
</li><li><b>Unwillingness of egoic minds to accept paranormal abilities</b>: Convincing the egoic, materialistic mind about the potential subtle, hidden dimensions attainable by the mind when the ego is sidelined, is argued to be challenging. Since the ego favors its materialistic control over reality, it often dismisses the idea of such subtle phenomena.
</li><li><b>Problems with discussing the paranormal</b>: There are two issues when discussing the paranormal; it's quickly dismissed by rational minds, and it's often exaggerated and misinterpreted by the superstitious mind. Therefore, it is important to discern the core truth from exaggerations and misinterpretations while investigating these phenomena.
</li><li><b>Biases of Modern Science</b>: Leo criticizes modern science for its focus on third-person objective phenomena, detachment from consciousness, and not taking personal investigation seriously. This has led to biases in science that prevent it from effectively studying paranormal phenomena.
</li><li><b>Radical Open-Mindedness towards the Paranormal</b>: Leo Gura underlines the importance of developing an open mindset towards paranormal phenomena. He criticizes the limitations of modern science, stating that it operates under a naive realist paradigm that deems reality as physical and objective. He points out that modern science has already demonstrated through quantum physics how this naive realist paradigm is incompatible with current scientific understanding. He believes that many scientists have not fully understood the implications of their studies, contributing to a continued resistance towards accepting non-physical phenomena as real.
</li><li><b>Drawbacks of Modern Science</b>: Gura criticizes modern science for being overly reductionistic and insular, which tends to undermine comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena, such as the paranormal. He notes that science has become overly bureaucratic and market-driven, which discourages unconventional research proposals about paranormal phenomena.
</li><li><b>The Paranormal and Intuition</b>: Leo explains that the paranormal is highly intuitive, posing a significant understanding challenge to rational-minded individuals. He asserts that rationality and evidence are constructed from pre-established beliefs about reality. Thus, a scientist, who considers reality to be rational and expects paranormal phenomena to be studied and proven within their established framework, is undoubtedly biased.
</li><li><b>The Limitations of Proving the Paranormal Scientifically</b>: Gura points out that paranormal phenomena may not be easily or fully proofed using conventional scientific methods. Paranormal abilities could be subtle and may not be easily controlled or replicated under typical laboratory settings. 
</li><li><b>Science's Infantile Stage</b>: He emphasizes that much about the nature of reality, such as the realms of dark matter and dark energy, remains an enigma to modern science. As such, he argues that the dismissal of paranormal phenomena due to their incompatibility with current scientific understanding can be premature and limiting. 
</li><li><b>Rarity and Discipline of Developing Paranormal Abilities</b>: Gura notes that paranormal abilities can be rare and may require vast amount of disciplined training, a commitment that few people are willing to undertake. Those who do often aren't interested in being tested like lab animals, which poses another challenge for scientific validation. He also mentions that these abilities may not have egoic or materialistic benefits, which could further reduce the incentive for their development and exploration.
</li><li><b>Radical open-mindedness and paranormal abilities</b>: Leo Gura reiterates the importance of open-mindedness when approaching paranormal phenomena and psychic powers like ESP, telepathy, clairvoyance, and remote viewing. He warns against applying materialistic expectations to these abilities, noting that they operate subtler, spiritual realms. He also emphasizes that ego acts as an obstacle to these powers, which work differently than they are often portrayed in mainstream culture.
</li><li><b>Scientific evidence for paranormal phenomena</b>: Gura mentions that there is significant scientific evidence supporting the existence of paranormal phenomena. This evidence is not only based on individual case studies, but also on extensive studies, particularly on trained meditators and yogis. However, mainstream science often dismisses evidence for these phenomena due to the threat they pose to the current scientific paradigm.
</li><li><b>The black hole effect</b>: Gura introduces a concept he refers to as the "blackhole effect", where someone discovers extraordinary abilities or truths but is unable to convince others about their discoveries. This effect often occurs when individuals who have developed their psychic abilities attempt to explain their experiences or findings to others, only to be dismissed as delusional. The concept suggests that these phenomena can only be truly understood by personally going through the experiences yourself.
</li><li><b>Clairvoyance, Remote Viewing, ESP, and other psychic abilities</b>: Leo acknowledges the existence of psychic abilities like clairvoyance, remote viewing, ESP, and fortune telling. He suggests that these abilities are real and are more prevalent in intuitive individuals, particularly women. He meets individuals who claimed healing powers, suggesting that these could be real and subject to scientific investigation. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of accepting paranormal abilities</b>: Leo summarizes the difficulties and resistance encountered by individuals who have firsthand experiences of paranormal activities and wishes to share them. He emphasizes that these experiences are typically met with skepticism and dismissal, which discourages sharing and potential changes in mainstream cultural beliefs. He concludes that the individual who undergoes these changes often loses the desire to convince others, accepting a new reality themselves.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's experiences with individuals possessing psychic abilities and his perceptions</b>: Leo Gura shares his experience of interacting with a woman who, following her enlightenment, developed healing abilities which she now uses professionally, stating that she can intuitively identify diseases in a person's body and energetically heal them. He is convinced of the existence of healing abilities, though remains unsure as to the exact nature and mechanics of such processes, and believes it requires scientific exploration. He talks about astral projection as a real and learnable phenomenon, citing numerous sources, books, and techniques that provide information on how to achieve it. He also mentions channeling as a plausible phenomenon, with people purportedly able to connect with higher beings or entities, though concedes he is unsure what the process exactly entails.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's perception of reality as a hallucination facilitated by the brain's chemistry</b>: Gura argues that all of reality is essentially a hallucination rendered by the brain, driven by brain chemistry, brain functions, and different 'modules' within the brain that are activated genetically at different times. He gives the example of channeling to argue that it might be a brain phenomenon, but points out that so is all of reality. He references the use of hallucinogens like DMT as a way to experience this hallucination in a way that can open people up to understanding the reality of certain phenomena.
</li><li><b>Different supernatural phenomena through Leo Gura's perspective</b>: Gura goes on to talk about several paranormal phenomena that include near-death experiences, past lives, auras, witchcraft, ghosts, spirits, aliens, beings, deities, angels, demons, exorcisms, and telekinesis. He regards all of these phenomena as real, or at the very least plausible, based on numerous accounts he has read or heard, though he admits he's unsure about their exact metaphysical nature, and emphasizes the need for open-minded enquiry. He ends this section stating that he's yet to experience any of these phenomena personally but believes their existence is plausible based on his research.
</li><li><b>Levitation among hardcore mystics</b>: Leo Gura shares that he would not be surprised if intense, dedicated mystics could levitate, highlighting this as an example of the 'crazy possibilities' that can be conceived once you've had deep spiritual and enlightenment experiences.
</li><li><b>Heaven and Hell</b>: He discusses the concept of Heaven and Hell, believing that there is something to it based on reports of people experiencing alternate realities that resemble these places, with the extreme suffering some people report in Hell-like experiences often leading to more compassionate behavior in reality.
</li><li><b>Transmutation and Blessed Objects</b>: He speaks of the concept of transmutation as a potential power to be explored, where physical matter is changed in an alchemical fashion with examples of mystics reportedly charging objects with certain energies, creating 'sacred objects'.
</li><li><b>Concealment of Paranormal Abilities by Enlightened Individuals</b>: Leo argues that enlightened individuals and teachers often do not disclose their paranormal experiences or abilities to prevent students from getting distracted from the path to overcoming ego. 
</li><li><b>Explaining Spirituality through Paranormal Lenses</b>: He posits that considering paranormal phenomena as possible makes more sense in explaining all aspects of spirituality, acknowledging the complexity and contradictions within various spiritual traditions.
</li><li><b>Developing Paranormal Abilities</b>: Leo lays out two possible ways to develop these abilities: being born with or predisposed to them, or through intensive and long-term practice (specifically concentration practice).
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and Accessing Other Entities</b>: He suggests that psychedelics, particularly DMT, can provide a possible preview of paranormal abilities and contact with other entities, with caution that the true nature of these experiences remains uncertain.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment and Paranormal Abilities</b>: Leo explicitly states that enlightenment does not guarantee the manifestation of paranormal abilities, as specific training and practice might be needed for their development.
</li><li><b>Paranormal abilities require specific training</b>: As with weightlifting, each ability must be trained for individually; no one method will develop all powers equally. Becoming enlightened may result in the development of certain powers, as it changes one's relationship with all of reality.
</li><li><b>Potential challenges of pursuing paranormal abilities</b>: While the pursuit of paranormal abilities may offer growth, it is also prone to delusion and corruption. One's ego may abuse these powers, doing harm to oneself and others. Additionally, such pursuits may distract individuals from their spiritual purification work and their journey to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Considerations when pursuing paranormal abilities</b>: Individuals need to balance their time and energy, recognizing that spiritual work already requires a significant commitment. If someone really wants to explore areas like extrasensory perceptions or channeling, they should consider this as an opportunity cost.
</li><li><b>Goal of enlightenment</b>: The ultimate goal should be pursuing enlightenment. After achieving this, it is perhaps healthy to pursue abilities and powers to help others. However, this should be based on a foundation of enlightenment, not on the current ego state.
</li><li><b>Gura's perspective on his claims</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes he's not trying to fill people's heads with New Age beliefs or conspiracy theories. His claims are based on his informal research and are open to change in the future. His mission is to make sense of the world around him, and he is open to admitting his errors.
</li><li><b>Empirical nature of his claims</b>: Gura encourages skeptics to do their own research or develop the abilities themselves. Easy abilities to develop include astral projection. However, once individuals become convinced of these abilities, they may struggle to convince others, a problem known as the black hole effect.
</li><li><b>Gura's future communication challenges</b>: Gura warns that he may reach a point where communicating through his videos is no longer possible due to experiencing indescribable things. Similarly, the most enlightened individuals often stay silent, as a significant leap in consciousness is required to understand certain aspects of life.
</li><li><b>The unpredictable nature of reality</b>: Life can be unexpectedly strange, as it's based on past experiences and therefore doesn't necessarily accurately predict the future. Understanding this requires humility and open-mindedness.
</li><li><b>Pursuit of self-actualization</b>: The journey of self-actualization is deeper than one might initially imagine. Gura encourages viewers to visit his website, Actualized.org, for additional resources and to stay tuned for more content.
