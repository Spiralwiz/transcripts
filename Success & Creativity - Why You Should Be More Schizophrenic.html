hey this is Leo for actualised org have you ever
run across a person that crazy person walking down the
side of the street who's always talking to himself I
don't know maybe you're like me but you had one
of these kids in school that everyone picked out and
laughed at because they literally were like the crazy person
they were like that schizophrenic kid who was the loner
nobody wanted to talk to him and he would be
off walking around always whispering to himself literally talking to
himself and people thought he was just plain weird and
crazy and everyone laughed at him kind of sad right
but this stuff happens well I'm here to tell you
that you need to be more like that guy what
do I mean by this well I was thinking about
this and there's an important thing that as we grow
up and we become adults we tend to start to
discount as I think as kids we have a stronger
sense of reality a stronger sense of inner reality than
we do as adults because as we grow up as
adults we tend to become very hooked on external feedback
and being very conscious of having the outer world reflect
and and basically dictate what our inner world is going
to be like and I think the difference between successful
people and unsuccessful people and also really genius people and
creative people is that successful and genes and creative people
they tend to have a really strong sense of reality
so what I really want for you and this is
something that I just realized for myself as well is
that I lost a bit of my sense of inner
reality so let's start from the beginning basically the way
we're going to lay this out is that you have
an inner world and inner reality and then you have
an outer world which is outer reality and in society
we tend to think and as we grow up as
adults we didn't think that the inner world is not
so important what's important is the outer world what's important
is how much money do you have in your bank
account what's important is what do people actually think of
you what's important is can you go out there and
get a result can you demonstrate this can you create
that kind of effect in your life that's what's important
right the external success or what people think of you
but there's also the more subtle important which is thing
which is the inner reality that you have in the
inner reality is well it's your beliefs it's your emotions
it's your feelings it's your thoughts it's how you think
the world works it's your philosophy about life it's the
principles under which you operate it's the habits that you
have it's also the visions that you set for yourself
and I think visions is a really big part of
what I'm talking about here because it's the ability to
use your imagination to create something in your mind and
have it be there and buy into it not just
say that oh this is a daydream or a fantasy
but really believe in it because here's the thing the
greatest accomplishments that are achieved out of the external world
have to start somewhere they have to start in internal
world every creative genius out there from business leaders like
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to to architects and artists
and authors and movie directors and musicians anybody like that
they have to start to get those massive kind of
results that they get they have to start with something
inside them first that stuff doesn't exist before they come
and create it and the process of creating that is
about having a very strong internal vision a very strong
sense of what is possible and then believing in that
right and I think that in in popular culture and
in media and society our parents etc in business when
we tell people that we have a strong imagination or
a strong vision they tend to think that you know
they tend to discount that because external people will look
at us and we'll say well he has a vision
but what does that vision really account for what does
that really mean what what really matters is whether it's
materialized in the external world whether it's here and now
and I can feel it it's tangible but those people
discount the importance of the imagination part in the inner
world it's the inner world that gets you going right
so if you envision architecting some sort of beautiful building
how does that process start it starts in your mind
it starts some sort of mental image it starts as
a vision and moreover if you're going to go through
with creating that going through that project and designing and
actually getting a team of thousands of workers to go
out and build that skyscraper how is that going to
happen that's only going to happen through certain perseverance you're
going to have a certain motivation because there's going to
be a lot of challenges and obstacles getting that two
to become realized and so the way to do that
and to really make it happen the people that are
able to make it happen they have to have a
really firm belief and that firm belief comes from something
inside of them that comes from a certain vision that
they have they're inspired by what could be they're inspired
by how they can change reality into a likeness of
what's in their mind so it really starts as an
idea and then only years later does it get manifest
into something tangible and most people of course discount that
whole process because that's happening on the inside and that's
really what a lot of the struggles that creative people
face is that they face all the emotional toil and
labor of going through that process because that process mostly
happens on the inside and other people don't see it
so you're kind of left to struggle there on your
own so what I want for you here and the
prescription I have is you need to turn this thing
upside down and you need to start to recondition yourself
to believe that having a strong internal reality is really
important and I was thinking about a good analogy for
this and I think that a good one is augmented
reality alright so you know how right now there's some
new technologies out there they have they have augmented reality
for your iPhone and for app you know apps for
your mobile devices or kind of in the experimental phases
and they also have augmented reality for this thing called
Google glass which are like these little glasses that you
put on and what it basically does is you're in
the real world but then there's like an overlay right
there's like a digital overlay and sometimes you can see
this in science fiction movies where people are walking around
the world and then you have like overlays like maybe
the computer will tell you that that thing that you're
looking at that chair you're looking at you know that's
a chair for my Kia and it cost $25 and
here's the name and here's where you can buy it
and here's a Buy It Now button so you can
go through that whole process and so it's basically like
a digital layer over reality and that's what I kind
of see the mind as being it's like the original
augmented reality right and I really mean this in in
a much deeper sense than just use your imagination to
come up with some fiction I really think that human
consciousness in reality as we know it we tend to
say that reality is out there it's tangible and there's
also the kind of the delusions we have our mind
but I think that really that distinction is a lot
more blurred than we make it out to be in
popular culture I think that actually the human mind is
responsible for a lot of what we call reality what
we think and when you go through enlightenment work and
you go through a lot of meditation contemplation you start
to see some of these distinctions blur and really what's
happening is that right now your reality is already augmented
by your mind it's already augmented and colored by filters
that you have it's colored by the experiences you had
growing up by the habits that you have the mental
habits that you have your own disposition and so really
what you're experiencing as reality even though you're telling yourself
that that's what's real it's not quite as real as
you think it is a lot of that is augmented
right when you're looking at your life and you're saying
well I can't start a business because the economy's not
going well well you know what that's a filter that's
that's filtering your reality so you're living in an augmented
reality world whether you like it or not and in
that sense what I really want for you is I
want for you to know first of all acknowledge that
and it takes some experiences some contemplation maybe some life
experiences that that trigger this this kind of sense the
sixth sense in you that really a lot of what
you're seeing out there and what you think is real
is partly a fabrication of your own mind the in
the trick though when it comes to success and fulfillment
and personal development is that you want to start to
use that to your advantage so why not have an
augmented reality that helps you be successful and by that
I mean really take your own visions seriously start to
view your own thoughts and your own habits and your
own imagination as something that's real right because you know
what right now you're using it already already whether you
acknowledge it or not and you're probably using it in
an unempowered negative way like you're worrying all the time
you're having that monkey chatter in your brain you're having
self doubts you're having all sorts of limiting beliefs and
you probably don't even consciously realize until you start observing
yourself but you know what those things are going on
in the back of your mind even if you've done
a lot of personal developing work it's really hard to
eradicate all of that so that's there and one thing
you can do is you can take undertake and basically
undertake a process to eradicate those and to shift them
and to become more positive more optimistic to remove those
limiting beliefs I think that's a really powerful strategy you
can work on your self-image things like that but what
I'm talking about here is getting a firmer sense and
I guess a deeper connection with your imagination and not
seeing it your imagination as something that's frivolous and seeing
as something that's airy-fairy but really starting to believe in
it like that schizophrenic kid walking down the sidewalk who's
a little bit nuts why is he so nuts think
about it the reason he's nuts and the reason that
we look at him and like ooh there's something wrong
there he's a little bit weird I don't know if
I want to talk to him it's because he has
a really strong sense of inner reality right the things
that are going on in his mind are literally true
for him it's like whatever demons he he sees out
there whatever whatever conspiracy theories he has you know whatever
monsters he imagines they're very real very palpable whereas for
a normal person who's not schizophrenic or has psychological problems
just psychologically healthy person for them we tend to think
of something like that and then we dismiss it because
we're like well that's not real that's just like a
dream name is a fantasy I think that's healthy that's
good but I think for a psychologically healthy person it
actually is good to learn to be a little bit
more like the schizophrenic and obviously if you are schizophrenic
or you have mental issues and this is a advice
is not for you you need to go the other
route but I'm talking about the 99% of people who
are psychologically healthy for them I think they need a
stronger sense of internal reality right when you imagine for
example for yourself the kind of business that you want
to build or the kind of book that you want
to write and the story of that book or the
kind of movie that you want to go out and
shoot wherever your dream is write whatever you want for
your life when you imagine it I want you to
really feel it as something that's real those thoughts should
become real for you it shouldn't be like a minor
dream or a fantasy it's like you want to really
buy into it like that schizophrenic and you want to
almost kind of like live in your like yeah you
know this is real and you don't want to say
to yourself well it's only real in my mind and
it's not real in the work in the external world
yet that's how it's supposed to be right that's normal
that's how it starts off that's how creativity gets going
that's what's cool about the human mind is that we
have this Faculty of imagination that is really not possessed
as far as we know about any other creature on
this planet no other animal really has this ability to
dream and to imagine and to believe in something so
much that then that guides our actions and ultimate can
lead to that becoming real so there's this interesting argument
that can be made that it is real because it's
in your mind and it's as real as you make
it out to be so that schizophrenic makes it really
real for himself because he buys into it whereas you
for you it's not probably as real because you dismiss
it as something as a figment of imagination I think
imagination is much more powerful than that and I want
you to challenge you to think differently about your imagination
and to really start to take all those ideas seriously
and to really give them life live into them and
see your world is an augmented reality so that those
imaginations are shaping and coloring your world but you're actually
thinking of it as one cohesive reality it's not really
two it's one it's just that we make this convenient
distinction between outer world inner world but really there is
an intersection and the two combine together and that's where
your thoughts are shaping your actions so whatever creative capacity
you have in your life whether you're building a good
family life or you see yourself as being fit and
buff at the ideal weight that you want to be
at and toned or whether you have that creative project
that you're working on see put it put it like
an augmented reality overlay on top of what you're seeing
right now so right now maybe you don't have that
dream house and right now maybe your career is not
doing what you want to be doing for you and
that project that you're working on maybe that book that
you're writing it's really not coming together like you want
it to but you need to start creating the castles
so to speak in your mind you create the castle
in your mind and then it will start to happen
out there your actions will start to make it happen
that's why visualization is so powerful and I have videos
talking about how to do visualization the power of visualization
but what I ultimately want you to have is a
stronger sense of internal reality and I want you to
really merge this idea that your internal world should overlap
your external world and then it all starts the power
that all comes from the internal world so let me
give you a few practical practical points about what I
really mean by how to do this because it's nice
to talk about it but how do you actually do
this in your life well I think number one start
giving a lot more importance to your ideas and your
visions right really see them as real don't let people
discount your visions don't let people just dismiss your visions
and tell you oh that's just in your mind you're
you're a silly dreamer these are just ideas you know
they're just ideas no just ideas are really powerful ideas
are where it all starts of course you have to
follow up and take action on it but the vision
is what creates Drive it's what creates motivation within you
and it's also something that you can use to literally
construct it within your own mind think of your mind
like a CAD program where you can do rapid prototyping
you can build designs in your mind for what you
want whether it's a design for your ideal for the
ideally how you look in the mirror with your body
or it's a design for your business or it's a
design for some invention that you're going to create you
can do a lot of the work in your mind
but most of us don't tend to do that because
we don't think that it's real we tend to think
that it's real when it's on paper when it's real
when it's on a computer but you know what your
mind is one of the best simulators out there so
you can do that in fact there are examples for
example Nikola Tesla he if you read his biography and
if you read any stories about him he was a
really interesting character he was actually a slightly mentally deranged
character he had like manic bipolar disorder but he was
extremely creative he had a really strong memory and he
had like a photographic memory and he also had very
strong visualization skills and so a lot of his inventions
complex designs like really complex engineering designs because he worked
on the electrical motor and he also invented alternating current
which we use now in our electrical sockets so he
was the inventor of that but a lot of those
designs that he made he made purely in his mind
and he made them work in his mind he worked
them out to such great detail that then when he
assembled it in real life it worked and these were
extremely complex designs so that just shows you kind of
the power of what you can do with your mind
and how real and tangible that can be so first
of all it's getting this mental shift it's getting your
blocks around kind of the hesitations of going down the
route of really believing in your inner world you have
to get that straightened up because that then is going
to open you up to go out there and and
actually live it and some of the practical ways that
you can live and create a really strong inner reality
I think spending time alone and spending more time contemplating
and spending more time concentrating on your thoughts is really
powerful so techniques like visualizations also techniques like meditation or
just sitting down and contemplating on thinking things through is
really powerful and I tend to think that now in
our busy lives where we're all running around we're all
socially connected through media and through the internet and things
like Facebook we tend to have less alone time less
time to just sit by ourselves in a room and
think things through think our ideas through think our visions
through in great detail I think this is something that
I personally right now am really excited about putting more
of into my own life because I'm not doing that
enough right now and I can see the potential that's
going to have long-term for me because I can do
so much with my business if I start planning out
in my mind and sometimes I'll have these flashes these
flashes I know I won't right now literally sit down
and dedicate the time just to contemplate I just haven't
created that habit which is something I want to do
but with like for example when I'm in the shower
or I when I'm in the car or when I'm
walking down the street sometimes I'm going to have these
ideas and I have this flash and it shows me
the power of it it shows me the power of
this visualization and of this inner reality they're talking about
because all the sudden have ideas for how I want
to shoot a video or the kind of article I
want to write and stir things just start to click
in my mind really fast that all the sudden half
an hour goes by in the shower and I come
out of the shower with all these ideas and I
feel really engaged I feel really motivated and then all
of a sudden I go out there and actually make
it happen whereas other times when I'm not doing that
then I'm just kind of running on autopilot and I'm
not really being creative and so those those creative moments
I think we can we can see where those creative
moments are in our lives kind of the conditions that
lead up to them and then we can consciously go
out there and extend those moments try to get more
of those into your life right so the showers may
be one place to do that but maybe another habit
that you can do is just to sit down for
half an hour every morning before you start doing your
work and do a little bit of visualization or do
a little bit of journaling and contemplation and just think
about you know what is that you want to be
working on it create a really strong in a reality
so that you're believing in those things and then go
out and take action the rest of your day so
this isn't something you should be doing all day but
I think a little bit of that daydreaming time is
really good so creating that habit can be powerful that's
one way to go another thing is journaling I think
journaling is really powerful it can really dovetail nicely with
this meditation visualization / contemplation time is not only are
you doing that but you have some place that you
can write this stuff down and you make this also
into a habit something that you do consistently where you're
journaling and you're writing things out because as you're doing
that you tend to get immersed in it it's like
reading a novel it becomes your reality or it's like
watching a movie it becomes your reality and that's kind
of what you want with your creative life right whatever
you're trying to create in your life you want to
be thinking about it all the time you want to
become like that schizophrenic where it's just like it's real
for you it's tangible it's palpable and other people might
kind of sticker it you know say you know what
he's kind of off in his own world but that's
a good thing I think for most of us that's
a good thing some people that are a little bit
far out there maybe they need to dial it back
but for most of us we're we're so concerned about
our external world and we're so concerned about reacting to
the external world that were not creators in our own
lives so I think that's another way to do it
is through journaling other ways is you know I want
you to just really have a high regard for your
own thoughts a high regard for your own imagination and
find ways where you can use your mind build your
willpower muscles so that you can become a stronger visualizer
right and don't be so concerned about what other people
think of you unhook yourself from that need have the
courage to say that I'm going to believe in my
visions and that they will become reality over time and
if you think about it that's the way that you
really accomplished anything creative and great in your life if
you have in the past and most of us has
had at least a couple of moments where we can
say you know what yeah I kind of believed in
something that wasn't real and then I made it real
just through sheer through sheer will through sheer imagination through
sheer vision because I really believed in it and then
after months of work or maybe even years finally it
came about but the only reason that really came is
because you had that vision for it and I think
intuitively kids understand this really well because when they grow
up they're just free they're present they're in the moment
and they're really good at using their imagination that's why
they can play with toys that to us seem boring
because for us we just look at them and we
just say oh these are toys in the external world
there's no story there there's no action there for kid
give him a couple of toys that are very simple
and he'll create a story he'll create a plot there's
going to be something going on he's basically literally going
to be the director of his own movie in his
mind and brahim is so real he buys into it
and it does become his reality so it's kind of
like that saying if you believe that it can't happen
then you're right and if you believe that it can
happen you're also right so you're right either way the
question is what's empowering you why not have that augmented
reality you don't need an app you don't need Google
glass what you can do is you can use your
mind to create a filter a conscious filter that you
put on reality so that when you're walking down the
sidewalk you're seeing it as you want it to be
not as it is but as you want it to
be and if you start seeing things as you want
them to be sooner or later they become reality not
only for you internally but they also then become a
reality for all of us and that is the way
that you improve the world that's the way that you
become a creative genius all right so I'm going to
wrap it up there go ahead share your thoughts give
me your comments I'd love to hear from you about
what you think on becoming more like a schizophrenic you
