[Music] in this episode I want to introduce to you
a very powerful distinction which I call the content versus
structure distinction so this whole episode is going to be
about making it clear in your mind what the difference
is between content and structure on the other hand and
we're going to do this with a lot of examples
so let's just jump right into it so consider a
DVD disc the DVD disc itself and the format of
the disc the encoding that's the structure will say and
whereas the data encoded on the disc that's the content
or for example consider the NFL the National Football League
that's the structure and then the content includes the teams
all the teams all the games that are played all
the individual players all the people who work for the
NFL that entire organization is structured under the NFL and
the NFL sets the parameters of what the teams are
gonna be who they're gonna hire how they're gonna play
what the rules are gonna be how much is gonna
be charged etc what the punishments are gonna be who
the referees are gonna be so forth so what football
can be is very much dictated by the structure of
the NFL now of course you can go outside that
structure but that's another story another example of structure is
the English language the English language sets up elaborate structure
and then the content is all the stuff that can
be said or written using that language and the stuff
that's said or written or even thought because you also
think in the English language so even your thoughts are
shaped by that structure so literally there are certain things
you can't think because your language doesn't allow you to
think them and conversely there are certain things you can
think only because your language allows you to think them
people often overlook those sides of the coin another example
of structure is a TED talk you watch some of
these videos on YouTube the TED videos so that's a
very specific format he's got a very specific audience there's
a specific length like a 20-minute segment that you have
to do there's only specific topics you can talk about
you can't just talk about anything you want there's a
very specific audience you're targeting you're doing it in a
specific setting there are certain rules you're following when you're
doing that it's very tightly constrained and yet there's a
lot of diversity of content within what a TED talk
can be you've probably watched some on environmental issues you've
watched some on politics you've watched some on psychology sociology
science physics philosophy computers engineering and God knows what else
so a lot of variety within that narrow structure a
video game is also a structure it's an entire medium
a medium basically is a structure so there are certain
norms and standards in the video games there's certain things
that are possible to do in a video game that
aren't possible to do for example in a movie or
in a book and vice versa there are sort of
things that are not possible to do in a video
game that you can do in a movie or in
a book there are certain constraints when you start to
design a video game and then of course the content
is all the different games that exist within the structure
of video games there can be shooter games and horror
games and adventure games and online games offline games and
whatever else another structure is school school has a very
specific structure to it that most people have a question
very much and then the content is the stuff that
they teach you the individual classes you go to the
teachers what time you go there and what time you
leave to go back home and what you learn which
books you read and what the rules are and all
that that's part of the content of what a school
is so people don't consider for example that the structure
of a school might determine what kind of things can
and can't be learned in that environment there might be
certain topics that can't be taught in a school because
that's the structure unless you change the structure of the
school but then your school isn't really what it used
to be so notice that you can make changes in
content and then you can make changes in structure and
a lot of what we do is we make changes
in content we get wrapped up in content and we
ignore the structure and so this whole episode is about
helping you to make this distinction to see the structure
better because structure can be challenging to see structure usually
sits deep and it requires study and awareness to get
at you don't get it at the surface level it's
not usually at the level of appearances like for example
when you're watching a football game on television you're not
thinking about the structure of a television and what a
television can display or can't display and you're not thinking
about the structure of the NFL and all the structure
of the business and the marketing and the team management
and the rules that go into it you're just sitting
there you're watching the the end result the sort of
appearance of the content and you might be so wrapped
up in one of the individual games or one of
the particular teams that you get so wrapped up in
that content that you forget that there's any structure whatsoever
and so this this becomes a trap and a problem
and a really powerful way to illustrate this for you
is with the example of a dream you know the
kind of dreams that you dream when you're sleeping so
you've had those now all of the stuff that goes
on in your dream all of that is content so
you can see animals people houses trees cars various scenes
you can experience emotions stuff happens in your dream all
that is content almost like a video game or a
movie but the structure is that it's a dream that's
the structure that you're in a dream now of course
as all of us have experienced you know what it's
like to be stuck in a dream thinking that you're
in real life only later to awaken and to realize
oh that wasn't real life it wasn't just a dream
what was happening in that situation you were so engrossed
in the content of that dream that you were unconscious
of its structure the fact that it was a dream
and that's why you got tricked into it and so
the only way you can break out of a dream
is you can't do it by changing content within the
dream no amount of buying a house within a dream
or talking to people within a dream or cutting down
a tree in a dream or driving a car and
dream whatever you're experiencing any kind of scene in a
dream that's not going to break you out of a
dream to break out of a dream well either you
have to break out of it or you have to
realize oh wait a minute maybe this content isn't really
what's going on here maybe there's a sort of a
deeper higher metal level and then when your attention shifts
to that then you could pop out break out of
the dream and sometimes that is exactly how you break
out of a dream oftentimes what happens is that some
sort of crazy thing happens content-wise in the dream and
it's so crazy and so outlandish and so yet like
impossible or weird relative to ordinary reality that it actually
disturbs your sense of reality and it shifts your attention
away from the content and onto the structure so you
know like if if you are driving a car and
then all of a sudden you're you're lifting off the
highway and you're flying through the air that such sort
of a crazy outlandish thing that wouldn't happen in a
normal life that that gets you to to change your
attention until now focus it on the structure and then
you realize like oh wait a minute this must mean
I'm in a dream and then you can either loose
a dream or you could just wake up so to
realize that you're in a dream requires going Metta what
is this notion of going Metta this is a notion
I've talked about in the past but I don't think
I've made it very explicit before which I want to
do right now it's a notion that I personally use
a lot it helps me in navigating all this stuff
that I talk about this notion of going Metta this
is a very handy notion that you can use for
the rest of your life it's also sort of a
little distinction you could make going Metta what that means
is that you're you're stepping outside of the plain of
the content it's almost like if you're imagine that you're
in a two-dimensional drawing on a two-dimensional plane and you've
been living on these two dimensions your whole life and
thinking about two dimensions your whole life and then all
of a sudden you realize like oh there can be
a third dimension you can kind of go Metta out
of the plane of whatever you were living in and
I'm sort of like what you're doing in a dream
you might say that in a dream you're sort of
a stuck on a two-dimensional surface and then to wake
up from the dream you have to realize that there's
a third dimension to the surface and that takes a
sort of an intuitive leap a leap of consciousness of
stepping back you might say rather than being absorbed in
the content it's like discovering a hidden dimension to life
or to reality that you hadn't noticed before I call
this going meta so for example if you're sitting there
doing science your whole life going meta would be realizing
that there's a sort of a meta science a science
of science it's being able to observe what science is
and how science works rather than actually engaging in the
science same thing with like for example religion if you've
been religious your whole life let's say you were raised
an Orthodox Christian or Muslim or something like that or
Jew and you've been practicing and you've been believing in
it you've been reading books and you've been going to
church and study groups and all this and you've been
praying and doing all this stuff but then what can
happen is that you can actually go meta and you
can real like well this is just one religion there's
other religions maybe my religion isn't the only one and
in fact maybe it's not just that I think that
I found some better religion over there it's not like
I was a Christian and now I want to become
a Muslim that would be just a change in content
rather what happens is that you go meta so much
you step so far back from all religions that you
realize oh all religions are basically different flavors of the
same sort of structure and I'm done I've outgrown that
structure I don't want to live within that structure anymore
so it's not just that I'm unhappy being a Christian
and now I want to look for some better thing
it's like no I'm done with that entire structure I'm
done with the structure of religion and ideology and dogma
and following some authority figures and then that that is
like discovering a new dimension to reality there's sort of
freedom that comes with that now of course just because
you do that doesn't mean you're free you're not free
at all so there can be structured within structure within
structure content within content with encanta so realities are nested
there's not just one or two dimensions that are hidden
for you to discover there's a lot more there's many
of them and in many different areas of life so
it's quite complicated and tricky so for example here's another
example that I like let's say that you're interested in
buying a used car and so what you do is
you go around to different car dealerships and you shop
around and you're really attached to getting that one car
that you really like and so you're just looking for
a good car at the right price with the right
features that you want that would be like being lost
in the in the content and unaware of the structure
whereas if you cared about the structure of buying used
cars what you would do is you would go to
these different car dealerships and you would study how are
these cars sold what kind of car are sold and
bought what kind of tactics are that used by the
salesman to sell these cars what kind of prices and
what kind of Rangers that they have what are the
profit margins what kind of marketing strategies do they use
how did they get these cars who buys these cars
what are the demographics so you're studying how used cars
are sold and purchased notice this is a meta activity
its meta in the sense that you're you're not any
longer interested in in one particular car that's not what
you're looking for you're interested in the entire process of
how cars are bought and sold you see how different
that is so likewise with the religion for example you
could live life where you are shopping for the one
true religion the best one and then you could shop
shop it you could buy it you could subscribe to
it and then you could stick with it and practice
it that would be like buying one used car or
you could live your life where you're living it from
a matter perspective where you're studying the structures of religion
you're not being seduced by any one piece of content
within religion you're studying the whole thing from a distance
we might say by transcending it so that's another word
for going meta is transcendence you're rising above it so
to speak or you're getting underneath it whichever phrasing you
want to use or another example for you with structured
content and going meta is let's say you enjoy movies
you go to a movie you watch it then you
go to the movie next week you watch it and
you're just into enjoying movies okay that's fun that's great
but you're wrapped up in the content you have no
idea how movies are actually made you don't even think
about what movies even are you don't consider the science
behind the movies you don't consider the art you don't
consider the people who make them you don't consider the
various rules for making movies how do you please an
audience what kind of movies are why are they made
wire movies a certain length what kind of film are
they on how are they shot how much money is
paid to the director to the cast to the actors
and what kind of business and marketing goes into these
movies who are these movies made for what kind of
audiences see so there's a huge difference between the content
of movies versus studying the the structure of how movies
are made you see can you see how powerful it
is to go from simply consuming content to becoming conscious
and to deeply studying and understanding the structure of a
thing whatever it is if you really care about movies
and you're like a film buff you can find a
lot of value in just going beyond just watching movies
but actually critiquing them studying movies critically and even making
your own movies cuz it's really only when you try
to make your own movie that you start to really
appreciate all that behind the scenes stuff and personally for
me I've always of course I always have enjoyed watching
movies most of my life I basically was raised on
them but what I even enjoyed more is I enjoyed
the behind-the-scenes making-of documentaries of the movies like as much
as I like Star Wars for example the classic once
not the new ones that's great I enjoy even more
reading the behind-the-scenes making-of or watching the documentary of how
they made the original Star Wars movies like to me
that's even more fascinating that's that's the more interesting story
and as you do that it kind of goes meta
but also notice that there's there's a cost there's sort
of a benefit and a cost that comes with this
the the benefit is that you learn so much more
about the movie and how movies are made in general
it also makes you appreciate the movie and also it
allows you to kind of spot its flaws and be
less naive about it if you were just watching it
for entertainment but the downside is that it disillusions you
it makes you kind of jaded it robs or breaks
the magic and the spell of the movie so if
you watch a lot of the behind the scenes of
how Star Wars was made you're gonna know so much
of that meta stuff all the problems they had and
all the imperfections in it and how it should have
been but how it couldn't be because the budget constraints
and all this that you can't really watch that movie
the same way anymore it sort of ruins the story
and that's that's one of the one of the key
features of going meta is that it it shatters the
illusion shatters the illusion of a dream it shatters the
illusion of how used cars are sold it shatters the
illusion of how the sausage is made see most people
enjoy sausage but they don't want to know how it's
made well it's exactly the same thing with reality most
people enjoy reality are so wrapped up in the content
of reality they don't want to know how it's actually
made but the downside is that when you don't know
how something is actually made you're stuck with how it
is you're sort of powerless to change it or to
do anything about it content can be hypnotizing literally it
hypnotize us when it's really good content know if it's
shitty content then it doesn't hypnotize us but like for
example a really good horror movie you're so wrapped up
in it that two hours can fly by in what
seems like minutes and it gets your emotions pumping and
you're really scared and you know the jump scares get
you and you're entertained and all this and maybe you're
even crying or you're laughing and so it completely hypnotizes
here your mind and your consciousness for those two hours
see and for it tippet eyes you it you need
to lose sight of the structure because if you're sitting
in a horror movie and you're hyper analyzing it from
a meta perspective then well while you're sitting there you're
gonna be constantly telling yourself stuff like well this is
just horror movie I mean I know that this isn't
real the monsters not real it's just some guy in
some makeup it's just some computer-generated CGI stuff and the
blood isn't real and the weapons aren't real and so
you know you can just keep telling yourself all this
but that's gonna spoil the movie so you can't have
it both ways you can't be wrapped up in it
and also understand what it really is because what you're
doing is you're you're subjecting yourself to an illusion here
and of course if you've ever made a movie or
really if you've ever made anything then you have a
totally different appreciation of what that thing is compared to
somebody who never made it so if you've made a
movie you can't be entertained by watching your own movie
because you spent so much time making that movie you
know it backwards and forwards you're sick of it same
thing with a video game if you make your own
video game you you can't really enjoy playing it there's
no surprises the illusion is gone and you're probably sitting
there and thinking about all the problems and flaws with
it rather than appreciating for it is where as somebody
who is detached from all that process doesn't know the
meta stuff they can just enjoy enjoy your game see
that's the trade-off religion the content of religion can be
very engrossing for the mind literally hypnotizing us and when
we're so hypnotized in the content of something we can
not want to break out of the illusion and talking
meta about the thing that we're attached to us content
revealing the structure of it this can actually threaten us
this can make us fear of real afraid depressed angry
you know if you come to a really religious person
you tell him hey you're just you're just executing a
religious dogma a script that you were programmed with since
birth just like all the other religious people that's gonna
make him very upset uncomfortable he's not gonna want to
hear you because he doesn't want to be taken meta
because he's absorbed in the illusion culture another example we
get so absorbed and engrossed in a culture whatever it
happens to be probably the one you grew up in
the one that you liked the most that we forget
that culture is just like religion there's hundreds thousands of
different ones and they're all basically arbitrary and if you
go meta on culture you see that the commonalities between
all different cultures and you see that culture is just
a a system a set of norms and standards that
are being executed by groups of people there's nothing particularly
special about your culture nothing extra true or better than
other cultures about your culture they all have their pros
and cons there's no one best culture but you can
only see that when you go meta of course if
you're stuck in a culture and nobody has taught you
how to go mad and you haven't figured out for
yourself then you truly believe that your culture is the
best culture you believe European culture or Western culture is
the best one or whatever you believe does it matter
see every culture believes that they're the best culture don't
you find that funny but see the only way you
can understand that to really appreciate that point that is
a meta point that I just made see most people
are so entrenched in a culture that they don't understand
that every culture thinks they are the best culture like
people who really like European culture or Western culture or
American culture they actually honestly believe that American culture is
the best culture and they have a whole set of
rationale and arguments that they're gonna put forth and deny
the meta point that know the way you feel about
your culture is the same way the Japanese people feel
about their culture if they're attached to it or Chinese
people fear about their culture or middle-eastern people feel about
their culture and that's what nationalism is about nationalism is
about getting absorbed and defending the content of a culture
rather than looking at it from a meta perspective see
nationalists don't like the idea of going meta on their
own culture because that would shatter the illusion the identity
that they've created out of their culture to maintain an
identity and identity is an illusion whether it's a cultural
identity or religious identity or whatever other kind which brings
us to science science can also be very engrossing you
can get so wrapped up doing science your whole life
that you forget that you're only interfacing with reality looking
at reality through a very particular lens and there's a
very particular structure that goes along with science and the
content of that structure can make you blind to the
structure which is shaping the content so what happens with
a lot of scientifically minded people and scientists is that
they think that while they're exploring all of reality through
science actually science is just a very narrow like keyhole
that you're looking at reality from or through and so
you're only seeing the content that is allowed by the
filter by the polarizing filter of science but of course
many scientists deny this precisely because they're wrapped up in
the content and they're attached to the structure of science
and they don't want to go meta on that structure
they don't want to truly look at science and investigate
the structures of science which shape the content that then
scientists see or study so the key insight here for
you is that the difference in content is far less
important than a difference in structure difference in content distracts
from seeing the sameness in the structure and here are
some examples to illustrate this point so for example Christianity
versus Islam on the surface these two to many people
seem like polar opposites or very different because it seems
like well the Christians believe such different things than the
Muslims do and they're fighting with each other there's so
many disagreements they have different prophets they have different holy
books that they believe in they pray in different ways
they they live in different parts of the world they
have a different history a lot of different stuff there
are actual metaphysical doctrines are different their moral standards and
rules are different so in a certain sense you could
say well these are as different as as two religions
can be but if you go meta on religion itself
what you see is that there's a deeper structural similarity
between Christians and Muslims then each of them like to
believe or admit and in a certain sense Christianity and
Islam are are very very very similar they stare so
many structural similarities they're sets of ideologies really and really
ideology is a larger structure which encompasses both Christianity Islam
and then many other things but we can we can
go even further here we could say for example within
Islam there's this the Sunnis and there's the Shia from
a Western perspective from a Christian perspective or from a
non Muslim perspective the difference between Shia and Sunni seems
trivial and almost ridiculously absurd because like in the Middle
East Sunnis and Shias they they will ethnically cleanse each
other and they will kill each other they will go
to war over each other they were slit each other's
throats over the difference between Sunnis and Shiites but really
the difference is so small if you go and you
study historically what the difference is the disagreement is minor
both of them believe in Allah both of them basically
believe in Muhammad and they revere him as the main
prophet so there's no real contradiction there it's really a
minor discrepancy about the lineage that was passed on after
Muhammad died and of course I'm not a scholar so
I'm not familiar with all the technical details of that
dispute but there's there's a disagreement there between the lineage
of like well so who was a successor to Muhammad
after his death was it was it like his uncle
cuz I don't think he had any children so it
was either his uncle or some other part of his
extended family and so they traced the lineages in different
ways and so the depending on which way you think
the lineage should be traced that determines whether you're she
a Shiite or or a Sunni I mean if you
think about it in the grand scheme of things very
minor difference they're basically like 95 percent in agreement and
then there's five percent disagreement and yet they kill each
other over this and so why does this happen it
happens because if you are if you were raised as
a Sunni or Shiite and you're very Orthodox and serious
about it and you've created a whole identity out of
it then you're so wrapped up in and gross and
hypnotized by the content of being a Sunni or Shiite
that you can't go met you don't see the Metta
angle you're not able to zoom out you're not able
to step above it see because you take it too
seriously you're too attached to it and so this is
an example of the hypnotizing power of content so really
to resolve these sort of ethnic disputes in the Middle
East what needs to happen is the way you solve
that is not by having the Sunnis conquer the Shias
or the Shias conquer the Sunnis the way that they
think because when you're wrapped up in the content you
think that the way to resolve a Content dispute is
by having your way like the Suey's believe that hey
if if we just had all the Shia's died and
then all the sunnis were just reigned supreme then that
would solve this problem and of course the other side
believes the exact opposite so that's exactly what contributes to
this conflict which is irreconcilable how do you reconcile it
by going meta by realizing that the problem is not
really at the content level is it the structural level
rising above your content problems another example is atheism versus
theism many people believe that these are polar opposites as
opposite as two things can be an atheist or the
theist the the atheist is very rational doesn't believe in
God the theist believes in God and religious stuff but
this is not true at all there is a much
deeper structural similarity between the two then both would like
to admit it's the same issue as with the Shia's
and the Sunnis the the meta structure of what atheists
and theists are doing is they're both believing atheism is
a belief system theism is a belief system both atheists
and theists believe that their beliefs are not just beliefs
but that they're the truth both of them believe that
they're right both of them believe the other side is
wrong both of them believe that if my side just
wins and conquers the other side that's going to be
for the best of everybody else that's gonna be the
truth and so the fantasy of the atheist is that
one day atheism will reign supreme and theism won't exist
at all and God will be removed from from all
the books and never talked about again because it's so
ridiculous and and the fantasy of the theist is that
one day his religion and his God we'll be taught
in all the schools and atheists will be long gone
cast out or whatever or admit of their of their
ignorance this is this is what's going on you see
the deeper structural similarity here of course atheists don't like
to admit that atheism is a belief they like to
say that no ilio atheism isn't a belief it's a
lack of belief no it's not a lack of belief
atheism is a belief that there is no God and
that there can't be a God and that the idea
of God is ridiculous that's essentially what atheism boils down
to it's not based on any actual proof or even
on reason I mean atheists of course like to say
that their beliefs are based on reason but hey you
know what every religion and all the theists like to
say that they're theism and all their religious ideas are
all based on reason reason is not the exclusive province
of atheists everybody champions reason towards whatever they believe so
you can't adjudicate this problem based on reason or logic
or facts because it's not about facts it's about belief
it's about your worldview it's about your metaphysics it's about
the epistemology that you're using but to understand these higher
things you'd have to go meta you'd have to go
above both atheism and theism and look at the commonalities
between these things but of course both I see it
atheists and theists don't want to admit the things that
I'm saying here and they will argue vehemently with me
and they will try to criticize me and poke holes
and debunk me and all this sort of stuff but
all of that is just the hypnotic pull of the
content of your atheism or your theism see if you
were willing to surrender all of that and to go
meta you would learn some powerful new things about yourself
about life about how your mind works how ideology works
how atheism works how theism works but if you're really
attached you don't want to do that you don't want
to go meta you don't want your illusion spoiled because
if you did go meta I promise see this you
would realize that both atheism and theism are deluded that
are not true both see but you can't realize that
unless you're willing to let them go first which of
course most people are not so they're stuck at the
level of content how about another example of drugs versus
psychedelics mainstream society loves to conflate these two the way
that schools teach against drugs various anti-drug programs and schools
the way that we were raised most of us the
way our parents think and the way our governments think
about drugs versus psychedelics is that they think that these
are identical the same thing because they look at the
surface appearance of like well what's the difference between mushrooms
and LSD or heroin or a crack cocaine or something
like that you smoke both of them or you ingest
both of them they give you some sort of cool
high they make you feel good and then it's just
the it's just like a emotional state then they make
you addicted and then it's just a cycle it doesn't
go anywhere and it's waste money and it's a criminal
activity like like this is a sort of like the
conflation that's made but structurally drugs what we think of
as hard drugs like heroin and cocaine and meth these
are very very structurally different from psychedelics very different almost
the opposite whereas a classical hard drug like heroin cocaine
crack and meth these will a dick to you really
hard psychedelics have the exact opposite properties they're anti addictive
in fact most psychedelics have tolerance so you can't just
take mushrooms today and then take more tomorrow they won't
work if they wait a week some psychedelics don't have
tolerance but even those that don't have tolerance still you're
not gonna want to take them with psychedelics if you
really do psychedelics you don't want to take a psychedelic
the next time you have to take a second you're
not looking forward to it you're not doing it for
a high and you're doing it for very very different
reasons than the reason people get addicted to meth or
to heroin and of course the effects of it on
your body are very very different whereas heroin and meth
and cocaine these these can ruin and harm organs in
your body they can damage the brain they can rewire
the brain in in unhealthy waves and really they're used
as an escape from real life with what psychedelics is
it's the opposite they can be healing that can help
you to deal with your trauma they can help you
to to introspect they can help you to go meta
sea they can help you to break addiction the most
powerful cures to hard addiction like heroin and meth and
crack is psychedelics there's no better proven scientifically proven method
of addiction recovery than psychedelics so is it right that
we classified both of them as drugs of course not
it's it's ridiculous but for you to discover that difference
you would have to go meta you would have to
actually have some experience you'd have to want to change
your mind about these things people don't want to they're
just stuck on the content of like drugs are bad
that's the content here another example is voting for politicians
based on their identity or on their superficial appearance I
guess or their superficial talking points sometimes two politicians can
appear very similar but be structurally very different in their
policies or how they're gonna run the government or even
they're in their psychological cognitive or moral development or spiritual
development sometimes you hold in the trap a thing like
well next in cycle we need a woman to be
President or we need a weed a Hispanic to be
President we need a gay person to be President this
is this is being stuck at the level of content
you see cuz you can have a gay president who's
terrible president who's very low in cognitive moral and spiritual
development who will make terrible decisions that will harm many
people just because he's gay doesn't doesn't mean he's gonna
be a good leader same thing you could have a
woman and just cuz she's a woman doesn't mean that
she won't start a war doesn't mean that she won't
be racist doesn't mean that she won't have some regressive
policies see there's a big difference you have to you
have to look beneath the surface at the structure and
just because someone running for president some old white guy
doesn't mean that necessarily he's gonna be the same status
quo as we've had before because I mean the sort
of the the conventional thinking is like well we've had
we've had old white guys running the world for four
centuries now now isn't it time for a woman to
do it and of course there's some validity to that
but you can't just look at it like that because
it's so that's a very superficial way to look at
it you can have a woman who's gonna be more
regressive racist and violent as a leader and more incompetent
than some old white guy so gender and diversity doesn't
automatically solve your problem it very much depends which is
not to say that these are unimportant factors if all
things are equal you know it's nice to have diversity
and representation all that but it can't be your only
criteria otherwise you're falling into the content rather than the
structure and structure is ultimately what you care about if
you want to make a significant improvement in anything you
have to care about the structure of it otherwise you're
just shuffling content around so nothing fundamentally changes because the
structure is the thing that sets the parameters of how
a thing functions it's the structure of the government that
is the problem if you think there's a problem with
government it's not the content it's not just replacing a
person here or there that's gonna change anything it's the
structure and the structure is a really difficult thing to
change and one of the maze the main reasons why
the structure is so difficult to change is because we
don't see it we don't acknowledge it it's difficult for
us to collectively talk about the structure because most people
are so wrapped up in the appearances they're hypnotized by
appearances when all of your friends let's say you grew
up in the Middle East in Iran or someplace all
of your friends are wrapped up in the content of
Islam so how are you gonna change structurally change that
even if you managed to break free of it if
you go meta how are you going to convince them
to go meta when they're hypnotized by the content so
you're if your whole family supports conservatives or Trump let's
say how are you going to convince them to go
meta on that they're attached to that conservative content that's
what they like they watch Fox News they consume it
they lap it up and fox news is just serving
you up content exactly the kind of content that that
you want if you're an unthinking uncritical person who does
not want to go meta so the function of fox
news is to reinforce the illusion of the solidity of
that content they're that they're that they're pitching because that's
what many people want and it sells it sells because
most people don't wanna go meta they like the comfort
of that illusion and they pay good money for others
to maintain and to hypnotize them in that illusion see
people actually pay money for this [ __ ] people
will pay money for being in a cult people pay
huge sums of money for being in a religion and
having that religion the money is literally paid into the
religion so that religion hypnotizes you people will pay money
to science as well people of course will pay money
to politicians whether you're a liberal or a conservative you'll
pay so don't think I'm choosing sides here almost everybody
is guilty of this to some extent or another so
it's the structure that sets the parameters of how things
work for example cable news cable news has a certain
kind of structure it's cut up into very short segments
it needs to be punchy it needs to be breaking
news it needs to be shocking it needs to get
eyeballs it needs to appeal to millions of people it
needs to be mass market it needs to to appeal
to advertisers like giant oil companies military companies aerospace companies
you know pharmaceutical companies so that they could fund the
large budgets of these news anchors and news shows and
you know maintain that whole infrastructure that is the structure
of cable news and so when you're looking at cable
news what many people don't realize is that they're only
they're only seeing the filtered content that comes through that
TV screen they have no idea of the structure behind
it and how that structure is warping distorting and biasing
filtering polarizing the content that is coming through this is
true not only of Fox News but of course CNN
MSNBC any of the cable news shows so I'm not
just peeing on Fox News here now of course Fox
News is particularly egregious at this particularly shameless at it
because they're the least meta like their whole business model
is just feeding you exactly what your reptilian brain craves
and that's that's very problematic that's basically a indoctrination machine
but you know CNN MSNBC they also give you very
biased perspectives on the world for example one of the
biggest biases it's not a liberal conservative it's just shock
value and breaking new stuff so the important in depth
news that really needs to be covered that's not covered
on cable news you don't get that there well you
get there is you get shocking stuff somebody died somebody
killed somebody somebody raped somebody somebody was involved as some
sort of heinous act somebody is a cannibal and somebody
is this and that like it's all this this stuff
that you see mostly on the news and that can
give you a very twisted biased perspective of the world
cuz you know you if you watch the news every
day for 365 days by the end of that period
you're gonna have a very twisted and warped perspective of
what goes on in the world because the news doesn't
show you all the good stuff the news doesn't show
you I mean sometimes they do but rarely you know
they don't show you all the people who were saved
and benefited all the people who had enlightenment experiences this
year they don't show you about all the humanitarian aid
that was done and all the dogs and animals that
were saved and all the kind acts that mankind is
that none of this is shown what's shown is the
cannibals the rapists the murderers the the war criminals this
sort of stuff you know the the scandalous politicians and
the mass shooters that's what's shown because that's the structure
of it but it takes a lot of experience in
life before you start to realize that this is the
structure of the news when you're a kid and you're
just watching the news you have no idea about any
of this you just consume that news and not just
kids but adults too will just blindly consume that news
a lot of fox viewers will just watch fox news
and nothing else they never go meta they never realize
there's even a possibility of going meta they have no
idea that there is such a thing as structure they
haven't made this distinction being content in structure that we're
making here in this episode and so they really get
hypnotized by the content and that shapes their whole worldview
and their sense of reality literally constructs their new reality
and then they think that that reality is actually what's
true when it's just content see you have to peek
behind the curtain to really see what's going on you
can't just look at the TV screen the end result
it's almost like people imagine a whole society of people
who grew up watching movies thinking that everything that they
watch all the movies are actually real life like they
you know they spend eight seasons watching Game of Thrones
or something like that or Breaking Bad and and nobody
tells them in this society that this is all fake
and that these are all actors they believe that these
are just some TV shows that were discovered from a
lost civilization let's say that they're in the future let's
say and they're they just they found this and this
is some lost civilization that was somehow magically filmed and
I think all these people actually look like this and
there were dragons and there were zombies and and all
this stuff and there were all these beautiful people and
all the CGI stuff that was real see you see
how twisted their worldview would be so it's very important
when you're watching Game of Thrones that in the back
of your mind you understand that this is an illusion
it's not real because if you think that Game of
Thrones is real that's gonna really screw you up in
life now you would think of well this is Leah
this is such a ridiculous example that it would it
would never happen in the real world it could not
possibly happen that people confuse illusion for reality like you're
describing this is an absurd example this would never happen
but of course it's happening right now it's happening all
over the world right now Fox News is doing it
Cable News is doing it science is doing it religion
is doing it politics economics is doing it there are
so many ways in which this is happening the problem
is that when you confuse illusion for reality when you
make that critical mistake and you have no way of
going meta and you're not even interested in going meta
because what you think you have is reality see you
don't know that you don't know the only way you
could know what you're missing by not going meta is
by going meta you see a fox a fox news
viewer for example has no idea what they're missing by
constantly only watching fox news but the only way they
could know is if they went meta and they started
watching other news sources questioning this stuff questioning all new
sources in general questioning the worldview questioning their conservatism questioning
their religious ideas and all that only if they questioned
all that could they then look back and accept oh
my god it literally was like I was hypnotized watching
Game of Thrones thinking it was real that became my
reality but I didn't know it because it seemed real
that's precisely what a really good illusion is a good
illusion is indistinguishable from reality people forget that when people
hear the word illusion they think oh well illusion that's
some fakery it's not real I know what's real and
illusion is just us or some nonsense it's so easy
to tell what's what's a losery but it's not because
this thing that you think is real that is the
illusion if you know that something is an illusion it's
not really an illusion anymore it's an illusion precisely when
you believe it's reality and in that case you're so
satisfied thinking that you have reality right here that you
don't bother to go meta you don't bother to go
look at the structures you don't bother to pull back
the curtain because in your mind it seems like well
why should I pull back the curtain because I've already
got reality by here it would be a waste of
my time to pull back the curtain but you don't
know if you've got reality unless you pull back the
curtain is the meta point but you don't care about
them at a point because you're absorbed in the content
you're so satisfied with the content you're so satisfied and
thinking you're right and thinking that you're righteous and that
you're moral that you're stuck this is what I call
paradigm lock your paradigm locked they're really hard to break
out of that of course it's possible but it's hard
the structure of Facebook for example sets the parameters of
everything that happens on Facebook everything that happens on Facebook
all the messages in the news that's shared and all
that other stuff the videos it's all it's it's like
pushing cheese through a cheese grater that's what structure does
and then what comes out the other end is determined
by what the holes are and your cheese grater or
I guess maybe a better example would be a better
metaphor would be play-doh through one of those play-doh machines
and then that extrudes it see that's what's happening so
there are certain trade-offs pros and cons it's not I'm
not saying that structures are necessarily bad or good there's
nothing bad or good about a structure it's all relative
and there's trade-offs to each one so cable news has
a certain structure with certain pros and cons Facebook has
a certain structure with certain pros and cons it allows
you to do some things and not other things and
it also depends on who you are and what your
agenda is as far as what the pros and cons
are like if you're if you're a foreign country that
wants to manipulate US elections Facebook is great the structure
of Facebook is great for you you can use it
to exploit people and propagandize to them in a convenient
and affordable way and that serves your agenda so from
like Russia's point of view there's no problem with Facebook
it's awesome from them from that point of view from
the American point of view it's bad if you care
about having integrity in our elections but you know if
you're a trump supporter and you think that like well
Trump needs to win it all cost doesn't matter how
he wins if he has to use you know Russian
help through Facebook to do it no problem as long
as he wins well if that's your agenda then Facebook's
no problem for you either and if your agenda is
that you want to reinforce your conservative worldview and you
want to live in a certain bubble but of course
there's liberal bubbles on Facebook too I imagine I don't
personally use Facebook but but you know there's a lot
of ideal bubbles on facebook Facebook helps you to preserve
these ideological bubbles because their algorithm should kind of feed
you more and more of the same kind of ideology
by matching up keywords and so forth so in this
case it's great for those who want to be stuck
in content because Facebook allows marketers to basically market to
you and to exploit the hypnosis that you're under with
the content that you like they don't really care about
what content you like they will just feed you whatever
you want fed to you see they don't care about
helping you to go meta another example is religion is
a structure religion is a very specific structure with very
specific parameters and think things work in a very specific
way when you subscribe to a religion University in school
is a very specific kind of structure academic philosophy academia
in general but then specifically like academic philosophy is a
very particular kind of structure when you do academic philosophy
you have to do philosophy in a very specific kind
of way you have to write your research papers in
a certain way there's norms and standards you have to
behave in a certain way or they'll kick you out
and they won't consider you an academic philosopher anymore literally
it's so bad these days that if you want to
go into a university and do real philosophy the kind
of stuff that we talked about here on actualised at
work you can't do it they won't allow you to
do this even though it's real philosophy it's high-quality philosophy
you're really searching for the truth they actually won't allow
you to search for the truth within academic philosophy in
a university can't do it because to them the structure
is more important preserving the structure is more important rather
than going meta but if you go meta with an
academic philosophy you'll realize that academic philosophy is very limited
it's a limited structure and that it's it's not conducive
to truth seeking and then you'll you'll transcend it and
you'll leave it which actually something that I did because
at one point I was considering becoming a philosophy professor
in a university and I quickly saw that the structure
of it simply was not appropriate for truth seeking which
is what I really cared about I cared about truth
seeking not being a professor or upholding some university structure
the health care system in America for example is a
structure and right now for many people it's a very
dysfunctional structure for other people it's a it's a great
structure if you're a doctor who benefits from it if
your insurance salesman if you're a pharmaceutical salesman if you're
a giant CEO of one of these companies if you're
a shareholder of a company that rakes in billions of
dollars from health care then for you it's a great
system to great structure but then for many millions of
other people it's a terrible structure people die needlessly with
our with our kind of structure and this can't change
once we change the structure see it's not enough to
just change your doctor you have to change the whole
structure because the doctors are educated and corrupted by the
very system that they then work in they're corrupted long
before they become doctors they're corrupted through the entire university
doctor educational system through Medical School they start getting corrupted
through that and they go through eight years of that
or however long and then they do the residency they
get corrupted by that by the time you know they're
they're actually a real doctor and they have their first
patients they've already gone through ten years of corruption in
the system and now you know they got half a
million dollars of student loans to pay off that's part
of the system they're basically indentured servants they got to
work that stuff off and then you know there's a
there's a carrot at the end of the stick which
which promises them to be rich you know they could
become millionaires if they just keep at it for another
ten twenty years they can become real rich and so
that that benefits them in a certain way but it's
also highly dysfunctional because that system isn't open to alternative
medicines isn't really interested in healing patients it's just treating
symptoms not really interested in root causes many people die
needlessly diseases go undiagnosed and uncured it's really an atrocious
system our healthcare system right now is in the dark
ages literally barbaric Dark Age type stuff like using leeches
on people that's the equivalent of what we're doing today
really by analogy when you are gonna look back at
this health care system in 21st century when people look
back on it a thousand years from now they're gonna
think that we're monsters today and that were barbarians and
that we're so ignorant about how we how we treat
human health but in anyway that's a that's a tangent
so a medium is a new structure which then allows
for a whole new domain of infinite content for example
novels writing novels is a medium filmmaking is a medium
video games in medium music is a medium the internet
as a medium languages and medium science as a medium
and then within each one of those you can have
an infinite expression of various kinds of content the content
is so bewildering that a lot of people they get
stuck in this one medium this one structure and then
they just are stuck in it their whole life and
then just they play with the content within that medium
that structure and they miss out on all the other
mediums and structures that exist in life think of how
much you miss out on if you just become a
Christian and you only do Christian stuff but never Muslim
stuff Hindu stuff Jewish stuff Buddhist stuff science stuff and
many other kinds of stuff you miss out on a
lot of the diversity and beauty and richness of life
you artificially narrow yourself same thing with science you know
you can go into science you can specialize into some
sub sub sub field like you're some sort of quantum
nuclear physicist and that's all you do your whole life
but you miss out on so much of science but
not just other sciences I mean you miss out on
biology - out on chem sure you might miss out
on psychology you might miss out on philosophy you might
miss out on art you might miss out on engineering
medicine but of course you miss out on other stuff
beyond the whole academic field as well no of course
people do partake in and in sort of a smorgasbord
of all sorts of stuff but generally people limit themselves
artificially they don't see the fullness of what reality is
things can look very similar on the surface but be
very different in structure one example is education versus indoctrination
these can look very similar when they're being done but
actually they're very very different true education or you help
to guide somebody towards a process of discovery and inquiry
about reality figuring stuff out for themselves having their own
unique insights rather than just reading books and listening to
lectures and just copying notes like a monkey in a
classroom versus indoctrination when I say indoctrination you might think
I'm talking about a religious school which of course is
correct that's indoctrination but I'm also talking about regular secular
school I don't know how it is other countries but
in America for my experience and I went to some
pretty good public schools probably some of the best in
America and I have mmm have them to think but
but also I mean it's completely an indoctrination system there's
almost no independent Discovery allowed in public schools and for
that reason for that matter in public universities as well
you're just copying down notes like a monkey you're just
reading books you're just regurgitating answers that the professor or
the teacher wants you to or that the state or
the government wants you you're memorizing stuff all the time
just to pass tests there there's no actual investigation no
inquiry no independent thinking it's indoctrination it's not really education
but it looks a lot like education so we at
that and we think that everything is fine but it's
not in fact there are a lot of different educational
structures that are possible for example there's there's there's very
different teaching techniques then the traditional public school system that
we have where you go into a classroom you sit
down and you read a book or you solve some
math problems that the teacher tells you to solve there
are there's a lot of research that's been done that
has been validated scientifically to be much more effective than
the current system we're using now of course it could
be more expensive there's stuff called like the Montessori method
in Montessori schools where kids are actually allowed to pick
their own topic they don't have to go to a
classroom to learn chemistry or biology or American history they
can pick their own topic like what are you interested
are you interested in cars go learn about cars will
help you to learn about cars and you can actually
like do your own independent research you could play around
with stuff you can solve problems and the teacher will
facilitate and guide you in doing that for every child
it's unique so not every child in the same room
is sitting there learning about cars or about biology but
they're learning about their own stuff it's a much more
powerful system but of course that says that's it see
that's a structural change but to implement a structural change
across the entire country for 330 million people that's a
huge undertaking very difficult politically financially I imagine and in
many other ways you'd have to you'd have to restructure
a lot of the schools sometimes even physically change how
the buildings are laid out and so forth same thing
for universities universities largely don't allow you to really do
independent study and to see they don't even allow you
to take the subjects you wanna member and I went
through university most the classes that I took even though
like I was in philosophy I was taking philosophy classes
half the philosophy classes that I wanted to take that
I was really passionate about I couldn't take them simply
because they didn't fit my schedule like you could have
two classes but they would conflict with each other there
was one class that I would have to take because
like a requirement to get a degree and then there's
another class and I really was passionate about but I
couldn't take the passionate one because it conflicted in the
timeslot for the one that I had to take and
so like the stuff that I was really passionate I
couldn't learn it there I had to learn it on
my own which is what I'm doing now see so
this is this is all a tragedy of the structure
another example of how things can look the same on
the surface but actually be different in structure is for
example when I talk about God so people who listen
to me for the first time if it's the first
video of mine you're watching and you hear me talking
about God already you're gonna put me in a certain
category because you have a very preconceived notion of what
God is and it's very likely that you'll conflate my
uses of the word God with a sort of a
Orthodox Christian conception or maybe a Muslim conception of God
or a Jewish conception of God whereas when I use
the word God it's it's it's so radically different from
the way that mainstream culture and most people talk about
God most people talk about God as a belief I
talk about God is a direct experience it's a very
different thing and if you're scientifically minded watch out because
when I talk about God you might get spooked and
you might push the off button and not want to
listen to me anymore and the reason that is is
because you're stuck in content you're not seeing the structural
difference of how the word God can be used there's
huge structural differences and how that word can be used
so don't be fooled by surface appearances another piece of
structure that's rarely acknowledged by people is how different human
psyches and minds are we assume that all human beings
are just basically the same living in the same reality
seeing reality in the same way having the same basic
set of facts having the same kind of brains and
minds this isn't true at all go check out my
older episode called why people seem crazy where I go
into a lot of depth about this topic I won't
retread that ground here but suffice to say that actually
structurally people have very different genetics biology brain types personality
types their brains process information in different ways process language
in different ways process chemicals in different ways psychedelics for
example affect people very differently based on their genetics biology
chemistry and so forth and people just have very different
psyches there are some people who can add up large
numbers instantly in their mind there are people like that
you you couldn't even do it on a calculator they
can add it up in their mind how do they
do it because their their psyche in their brain in
their mind or just structured very differently there are people
who have perfect memory that can recall phone numbers that
they learned 20 years ago they can recall them today
how is that possible they're just different very structurally different
psyches and minds you can't just assume they're all the
same things can also look very different on the surface
but have the same structure underneath we've talked about this
a little bit already with the Shiite and Sunni example
but for example Christianity versus Hinduism these look like two
very different religions but actually they share a lot of
the same structure sometimes scientists and atheists will will use
the discrepancy between different religions as an argument against religion
and God they'll say like well Leo how can we
take religion seriously if every religion believes something so different
and they're all hundred taking each other well it seems
that way on the surface because you haven't actually studied
deeply what religion is and what religions were talking about
but if you actually deeply study Christianity Hinduism Buddhism Islam
mmm Jainism Judaism if you really study the text very
very deeply and you think about them at a structural
level what you'll see is that there's enormous commonality and
fact this will actually go from being evidence against God
to evidence for God because you'll wonder how is it
possible that human beings on every continent in every era
for the last hundred thousand years all across history and
all around the whole globe every single culture there's not
been a single culture which has not been spiritual and
has not had beliefs in God and supernatural deities and
various mystical ideas how is it possible so if your
theory is that well it's just all some mind virus
some indoctrination [ __ ] some some wishful fantasy some
you know some clever a bit of wishful thinking like
you don't appreciate the depth of the problem of explaining
this so could that be a clue that there's actually
some deep truth there that you're missing maybe but for
you to realize that you would have to look at
the structure very deeply and not get stuck on the
content differences again we come to the example of science
versus religion as as an instance or example of how
things can look very different on the surface but actually
have the same structure because for example both science and
religion one commonality they have is they both rely on
Authority very heavily science cannot exist without Authority and religion
cannot exist without Authority the whole point of these institutions
is that you are appealing to an authority figure to
tell you what is true in both cases and many
scientifically minded people are in denial about this they don't
like to admit the commonality of authority to see they
like to criticize and religious people for blindly believing in
the Pope or some Bible or something but then what
do you do when you're reading a science textbook you're
blindly believing in a science textbook basically have you done
any biology no of course not you're just believing your
biology textbook that's what you're doing there so now of
course there are structural differences don't get me wrong between
science and religion but there's also a lot of structural
similarity as well another example of how things can look
very different on the surface but actually have the same
structure is survival as a poor person versus survival as
a wealthy person so if you're a poor person you
think like you're really struggling in life to just barely
make ends meet you're working to make my minimum wage
job you're not getting enough money you can sometimes not
afford to pay for your bills and you don't eat
the right food you want life is difficult for you
you're you're worrying about the stuff that you buy you're
worried about your money all this and you imagine that
well if I just become rich then all these problems
will go away all my money problems will go away
I won't have to worry about money anymore it'll be
so nice I'll be so happy but it's not true
because structurally survival is survival regardless of whether you're poor
or you're rich rich people have to survive as well
they're just engaged in survival at a higher level and
a lot of times you know have you heard this
of course you have where they say oh that's a
first world problem right so sometimes you know maybe somebody
watching Americans talking about their problems if you're watching Americans
talking about the problems from some third-world underdeveloped country in
Africa maybe or in India or some place you know
where the economic growth is very very low you might
say oh well these Americans are what are they bitching
and moaning about they got such a great country they
got so much freedom and they make so much money
and they got well you know they're complaining about health
care but you know their health care is still great
relative to India or to Pakistan or someplace and you
know they're complaining about racism but the racism in America
is is is insignificant compared to the racism the Middle
East or in mmm I don't know some other underdeveloped
part of the world so but what you don't understand
is that when your country if right now you're living
in third-world country if right now you're judging the problems
in America as first world problems well when you become
a first world country you will also have those same
problems you've to understand you're not gonna be above these
problems so the problems with luxury that rich people have
you're gonna have the same problems when you become rich
that's what the poor person doesn't understand so survival for
a rich person rich person has to worry about money
except now the money he's worried about is not the
money that he needs to pay his electric bill or
to buy some groceries for his baby or whatever or
to feed his dog now he's worried about how do
i buy that yacht how do I pay my golf
membership you know golf golf Country Club can cost two
hundred thousand dollars a year you know I need that
membership as a rich person because my survival depends on
now you might think oh well leo but a golf
membership for two hundreds of uses so extravagant has nothing
to do with survival this is this is silly it's
only silly from your point of view as a poor
person if you were rich it would not be silly
to you it would be a matter of life and
death because for a rich person to maintain his rich
status he has to hang around with other rich friends
so being rich a lot of what being rich is
about is the cultivating wealthy friends and creating a sort
of a social network that you use to manipulate and
to extract wealth out of society you do that by
increasing your fame your status your political connections and you
do that through yes things like being on a golf
course on a Sunday playing golf but while you're playing
golf you're not just playing golf you see you're maintaining
your entire way of life because on that golf course
you're hobnobbing with your friends you're building deeper social connections
you're using those to create new partnerships new business opportunities
new business ventures then those are used to exploit the
poor people you see how it works so yes very
much you're gonna need to buy that golf membership very
much you're gonna need to drive of course if you
buy a golf membership for $200,000 you know you can't
show up in your Toyota Corolla you're a Country Club
you need something fancier you need at least a Mercedes
you need at least a BMW but maybe even something
better maybe you need a Bentley or maybe you need
a Maserati you know to one-up your friends because when
you drive in there with a Maserati people think all
your successful I want to do business with that guy
when you're driving there with your Toyota Corolla they think
who is this schmuck driving in here I'm not gonna
do business with him see and then of course you
need a yacht because you know once the golf course
gets worn out or maybe it's too cold outside to
play or it's too hot you got to take your
friends on some yacht in the ocean and entertain them
wine and dine them out there and then get your
business deal get your political connection and all that which
is going to help you to land some government contract
which is going to help you to earn millions of
dollars feeds that whole cycle see survival this is survival
so structurally survival is survival no matter if you're rich
if you're poor if you're black if you're white if
you're a dog if you're a human if you're an
alien you're engaged in survival if you're a physical being
at least so that's a very deep structure that might
be worth studying but see the problem is that most
people are so absorbed in survival you're either absorbed in
survival as a poor person or as a rich person
and you're oblivious to anything else you're hypnotized by the
content of your survival and as a poor person you're
so hypnotized by it that you hate the rich people
as a rich person you're so hypnotized by it that
you look down on the poor people and you have
a whole ideology about how although the poor people don't
work hard enough they don't really deserve it I earned
my wealth I deserve all this but the poor people
don't because they're because they're lazy bums they didn't work
as hard as me so forth right you're stuck in
the content you're not seeing the structure for examples as
a rich person you're not seeing how structurally unfair and
absolutely rigged the economic system is in America for example
but in most other countries as well it doesn't matter
to you because you're not interested in going Metta you're
not interested in fairness you're not interested in truth you're
not interested in love you're not interested in goodness or
not interested in consciousness you're not interested in understanding anything
you're not interested in you're only interested in survival another
example I have for you is Nintendo games I've I've
studied the structure of video games for most of my
life cuz I I want to be a game designer
and I I was a professional game designer for a
short while so I studied a lot I still sometimes
you know will read an article here or there about
the structure of a game or watch some video about
breaking down the structure game to be interesting and recently
actually not that long ago maybe a few years ago
there's this this one article I read about Nintendo Nintendo
is like probably I would say it's like the most
successful single game company it's amazing how successful they are
N and a lot of their success has to do
with the structure of how they maintain their company and
how they make the games they're really good at the
design of their games better and more consistent in almost
any other game company it's quite amazing and they have
a long track record of like 50 years doing this
it's it's quite remarkable considering how many game studios go
corrupt and they make terrible games after they get bought
up by some other students so forth anyways so I
was reading this article and like the reporter was complaining
to one of the Nintendo designers or bosses he was
saying well you guys make the same games over and
over and over again it's all Mario games all the
damn time like you're making Mario games in 1970s and
you're still making them today so what gives and I
was kind of empathetic with that point of view and
I'm like yeah I said I was critical of Nintendo
in that same fashion I was thinking to myself yeah
what like you got to change it up like enough
of these Mario games make something [ __ ] new
and then this this is what shocked me is that
the the design the Nintendo guy he said but we
don't make the same games we make different games every
time the Mario brand is just a rapper every single
Mario game is a totally different game has totally different
structure totally different design mechanics totally different gameplay we just
put a Mario wrapper on it so that people play
it because people know Mario is just a branding thing
because of course people are are so wrapped up in
the content that they're just gonna go out and bar
by any random Mario game they don't really bother to
look at the structure of a game before they buy
it cuz people are naive they're not very structurally minded
see and it just so happens luckily for them that
Nintendo generally delivers a pretty good game regardless and so
yeah there's so many different Mario games structurally different like
there's Mario soccer games tennis games racing games platforming games
but even the platforming games are all different there's so
many different mechanics within them and so it when I
when I heard this and when I realize that I'm
like oh yeah I've been making this mistake and I
was a designer at this point so I had a
sophisticated design understanding of videogames but even I sort of
got swept up and hypnotized by the content of Mario
rather than really looking at how different the structure is
between different Mario games now of course don't get me
wrong a lot of Nintendo's games are literally rehashes of
the past so I'll structurally of course they do pump
out a lot of similar Mario games but also there's
there's quite a lot of diversity there as well so
to me that that's a perfect little encapsulation of the
difference between content and structure and how it's easy to
confuse the two and misunderstand things success is often deeply
structural big companies like Microsoft Google Facebook Amazon Netflix what
do they all have in common they're not just successful
because they work hard they're successful because of the structure
they found the right structure structurally they're monopolies and that's
basically what every giant corporation tries to be and do
because that is how you become massively powerful and successful
as a company that is how you ensure your survival
you need to win the game structurally not at the
level of content it's not because Microsoft produces the best
operating system that is so successful it's not because Google
does everything the best that they're so successful it's not
that Facebook is the best that they are so successful
it's because of the structure they have the best structure
to make sure that they dominate everybody else and squeeze
out all possible competition that's why they're so successful and
then that gives them the funding and resources they need
to then do a lot of research and invest a
lot in themselves and then they can they can do
some really good stuff they can be the best at
certain things but really a lot of is just structural
a lot of what wealth and power is and fame
is highly highly structural and this is something that a
lot of wealthy people are in denial about they don't
want to admit that their wealth power and fame is
highly structural and so when they make the argument that
oh well others can just pull themself up by their
bootstraps just work hard and you'll become a millionaire or
a billionaire - no no no no no no you
can't become a millionaire or a billionaire without betting benefiting
from the right structure and the structure of course is
such that it's not a it's not a universally sustainable
structure see there can't be 300 million millionaires or billionaires
in America to have millionaires and billionaires the system has
to be designed as a hierarchy as a pyramid see
my episode called escaping wage slavery where I talk about
this a bit in depth it has to be structured
as a pyramid scheme that's the only way you can
have millionaires and billionaires in a society and this is
what the millionaires and billionaires do not want to admit
because then their whole identity and their whole sense of
self-made Nastase myth of being the self-made millionaire billionaire this
would be shattered they would feel so guilty and bad
for how they acquired their wealth that they would have
an existential crisis and a mental breakdown and they certainly
couldn't continue doing it to continue doing it and getting
more millions and more billions you need an ideology which
makes you oblivious to the deep inequities and this hierarchical
arrangement of the economy and how corporations work its structural
millions and million heirs and billionaires are that way structurally
now I'm not saying you can't exploit this structure or
that you can't build on top of this structure or
that you can't you know rise from being poor to
being a billionaire you can but the way you'll do
it is by exploiting and using this structure it's a
highly unfair structure it causes a lot of suffering so
you're gonna have to come up with an ideology or
a method for being unconscious to the suffering that you
cause while you climb this hierarchy because of course by
climbing it you also need to then maintain it it's
not enough that you climb it you have to then
once you're on top you have to maintain it because
the tendency is for this hierarchy to collapse but you
have to keep propping it up all the time with
political donations and ads ideologies books that are written think
tanks that are paid for all this has to be
it's a it's an active process maintaining this structure otherwise
it would collapse and it's constantly collapsing on its own
anyways but uh it's sort of like maintaining a tyranny
you have to have to you have to really do
it by force cuz it's not it's not all that
natural and most people aren't all that happy about it
but see if you're gonna be maintaining the structure you
need an ideology that's gonna make you feel good about
yourself while you maintain it so you're gonna have a
sort of mythology about how you're a self-made millionaire or
billionaire how you deserve it all and how you're the
smartest you're the best and all this in there you
go and again why does this happen because you're so
hypnotized by the content of being successful of being wealthy
of being famous of being powerful your stipend ties by
it that you don't want to go meta by not
going meta of course by being stuck in the solution
you caused yourself a lot of suffering and you cause
those around you a lot of suffering if you want
to be a powerful creator become good at understanding and
solving structural problems if you want to be good at
business or art become good understanding structural issues the ability
to step back from the contents of consciousness is a
superpower that you want to develop this ability to go
meta this is a superpower and right now you're very
poor at it so if you want to really change
your life become good at this ability consciousness which is
what you use to go meta allows you to step
outside of content allows you to see big structural met
apat urns and to detach yourself from content this is
what allows you to transcend of course what counts as
content versus structure this is a relative matter there's nothing
absolute about it there's no firm lines saying that this
thing here is content and nothing there is structure it
all depends there are nested orders of content and structure
for example we might say that ideology is a structure
the content of which one content of which is religion
is one kind of ideology but then religion is also
a structure for a specific type of religion which is
the content which would be Christianity within Christianity we could
say well Christianity its content but it's also a structure
because within Christianity we can have the content of prayer
it's a specific method within Christianity we might say and
then within prayer prayer is a structure certain kind of
method and then within that prayer we can have the
content of the prayer what are you praying for there's
a lot of fun things you could pray for within
the structure of a prayer you could pray for health
for wealth for whatever for evil on your enemies to
forgot to smite your enemies so forth see so it
all depends on kind of how you're looking at it
and all of that that I just said ideology religion
Christianity prayer the content of prayer all of that is
happening within the larger structure of mind all of that
is mind the most meta structure of all is consciousness
everything ultimately is content within consciousness there is nothing which
is not content within consciousness this includes religion science language
logic reason physical reality the Sun the earth the moon
human history sexuality relationships because of social activities video games
movies all of it is happening within consciousness it's all
content so with that being said understanding the structure of
mind and consciousness is the master key that resolves and
unlocks all of life so if you really want to
master life and you want to have control over life
and not just be a slave to life then what
you need is you need to study the structures of
consciousness you need to go betta on all of life
you need to sort of you need a making-of or
a behind-the-scenes documentary about consciousness because all of life is
content within consciousness if you don't understand consciousness you can't
understand life and you will be a slave to the
various content types that are subtypes within consciousness and conversely
without understanding these structures of mind consciousness you will forever
be lost in an infinite sea of content like a
leaf blowing in the wind to and fro left and
right north and south bewildered by the whole thing and
always puzzled and suffering because you're at the whims of
the winds this way and then you're at the whims
of the wind that way you're at the whims of
the structure the structure is controlling you and you're not
able to accomplish the things you want to accomplish and
do the things you do because you haven't gone meta
enough you're trapped in the content so let's go through
a list of some more examples to illustrate the difference
in content and structure so we've already talked a lot
about the different religions basically different content but same structure
science versus religion there's a lot of ways in which
these are structurally the same both rely on Authority a
lot both rely on belief systems a lot there are
differences for example science does tend to be more open
to evolving and changing itself it does tend to be
more empirical and more interested in running experiments whereas religion
is less interested in that so there's there's some differences
there but not as much as many scientists like to
believe with liberals versus conservatives here it's sort of the
opposite problem the general prevailing notion when it comes to
liberals versus conservatives is that they're basically just two sides
of the same coin and that they're just equal and
polar opposite and that there's no structural difference really between
them it's just a difference of content it's like do
you want good control or don't you are you for
climate change or are you against it are you for
immigration against immigration and and so on and it's treated
often as though like wow you just kind of pick
one or the other and whichever one you pick it's
just difference in content but actually there's a serious difference
in structure the psyche and mind of a liberal is
different than the psyche and mind of a conservative and
I've said this again I guess not popular say I've
talked about this in Maya conscious politics series four part
series go check it out but what people aren't denial
about is that the liberal psyche is more cognitively and
spiritually morally developed than the conservative one and this seems
very counterintuitive is it's a controversial point because of course
conservatives don't wanna admit it it also goes to liberals
heads cuz liberals then to think that we're the best
and that we can't do any wrong well that's not
true either there's still plenty of delusion in you don't
get me wrong but uh but relatively speaking remember it's
all relative relatively speaking on average your average liberal is
more cognitively morally and spiritually developed and I'll also add
sexually developed more sexually developed to then a conservative not
by a whole lot so I'm not saying it's a
massive you know difference but by a significant amount which
affects how how these different content policy differences are you
know separated out how the two sides kind of sort
themselves I'll have a whole separate video about that I
want to do a video in the future about the
difference between liberals and conservatives we're all go into a
lot of depth and I'll all justify right now I'm
not really citing a lot of evidence I'm just giving
you this as a sort of fact but in that
in that episode in the future I will present a
serious case for why this is true and it's not
just my own personal political bias it's not just because
I happen to be a liberal there are metal reasons
there are structural reasons for why liberals are more developed
than conservatives again it doesn't mean that liberals are morally
superior in the sense that they're they're good they're the
good guys no no no I'm not looking at it
from that simplistic perspective there are some very deep factors
involved it has to do with with consciousness ultimately so
we'll talk about that in future the next example is
cults cults have there's a lot of different kind of
cults difference in content of course what the cult indoctrinate
see you with can be very different some cults believe
in aliens some cults believe in the devil some cults
believe in God some you know some are Christian cult
some are Mormon cults some are whatever Buddhist cults I
don't know but they have a lot of structure in
common oh why it's a shocking amount of structure between
cults in fact I have a whole series two part
series called psychology go check that out if you want
to understand the structure of cults once you understand from
those two episodes the structure of cults you will never
be able to be fooled by a cult ever again
because what that two-part series does is it takes you
so mad on cults that actually not only will will
you be suspicious of cults and be sort of immune
to cults but you're you're also gonna start to even
go so mad at that you even go beyond cults
and and now you're gonna start to escape and transcend
culture by realizing that mainstream culture is the biggest cult
that there is and in part two of that series
I explained a lot of the common structures between the
classical virulent dangerous cults that we usually think of and
mainstream society how mainstream society works see and you can
only understand that by going meta not only from the
perspective of different types of cults you also have to
go meta on culture itself on society it's mainstream society
on religion on science on politics on government on economics
on political parties all of it we're trying to go
metal on all of it it's what we're doing with
this work nationalism is a great example of difference in
content there are Hindu nationalists there are Pakistani nationalists there
are mmm white nationalists of course he heard of those
there are black nationalists Asian nationalists Japanese nationalists there's literally
a nationalist movement in every single country in the entire
world over 200 oh why is that because because people
develop an identity with their nation and all these different
nationalists whether they're Nazis or or KKK or whatever they
all have the same structure they think that they're doing
something very unique and different no you're not when an
American nationalist is demonizing Islamic nationalism like Wahhabism jihadi ISM
and so forth he's doing the very same thing structurally
as the Wahhabist or the Islamist is doing the Islamist
nationalist is doing relative to the West it's just a
Content difference see the Islamist believes that Allah and Islam
should be the highest principle in the whole world and
the the white supremacist in America believes that the white
race should rule the whole world because it's the highest
value system and that the Christian God and Christ are
you know the highest value system the most true and
that they should rule the world and they use very
similar tactics and strategies and ideology ideological mechanisms and structures
to advance their nationalist agenda clan warfare is an even
more primitive example really than nationalism we don't really have
a lot of clan warfare in modern developed countries in
America or in in Europe for example but there's still
a lot of clan warfare that goes on in less
developed countries especially in the Middle East there's a ton
of clan warfare in South America in Asia there's still
a lot of clan warfare going on because in tribal
cultures where people are living in small tribes they haven't
even developed into cities and nations yet they're too primitive
for that just clans these clans are like lot larger
set of families which have hundreds or thousands of people
in them and that turns into an identity and then
these clans can can go to war tribal warfare it
can happen like in African someplace for example between two
different neighboring villages that hate each other can go on
for hundreds of years they can hold grudges they can
have entire mythologies and ideologies about how they're they're evil
enable neighbors are our Devils and how they need to
be killed and how they're they're a threat and all
this how do you resolve the problem of clan warfare
you can't resolve it by thinking that your clan is
the best and it needs to dominate and kill and
exterminate the other clan because there's always other clan even
if you kill this clan here well there's gonna be
a new clan over there or your own clan will
split in two in a hundred years and then there'll
be two clans again so the solution clan warfare is
to go meta and to realize that oh this is
just content to sides in a clan warfare battle they
just have different content the structure is the same the
structure is that they both think that all my tribe
is the best they are the devil's over there and
if I don't kill them they're gonna kill me and
so I got to go kill them first and they
did something wrong in the past that justifies why I
should hate them this is also of course explaining a
little bit of the situation with Israel and Palestine that's
sort of a basically clan warfare on a larger scale
it's also nationalism it's see once clan warfare gets to
a certain advanced point where it involves tens of thousands
and millions of people and entire nations then it turns
into national ISM another example a great example of why
the structure and content distinction is so powerful is when
it comes to fighting evil the problem of eliminating evil
in the world is a structural problem evil is not
a Content problem but most people don't understand this most
people think that all we do to remove evil from
the world is to kill all the murderers rapists predators
abusers you know criminals and thieves if we kill them
all or if we like launch them to the moon
on a rocket ship then we're good we've solved the
problem of evil no if you do that that itself
is evil evil is such a deep structural problem that
man it deserves a video of its own or not
of course I have I have many of those probably
the most important one here is what is the devil
go check out that episode what is the devil best
ones where I talk about the mechanics of evil and
how structural it is but anyways the point here in
a nutshell is that the reason that evil is so
prevalent in the world is not because people are doing
evil things it's because people don't realize that their mind
constructs evil evil isn't a material fact in the world
evil is a matter of perception it's a relativistic matter
so to really resolve evil you would have to understand
relativity very deeply you'd have to start to understand how
your mind constructs evil projects it into the world and
how the very mechanism you're trying to use to stop
other people from being evil is the very mechanism that
creates that evil because everyone who stops evil or tries
to stop evil tells himself that he's doing it in
the name of good nobody does evil in name of
evil all evil is done in the name of good
so when you think that oh well I'm gonna stop
all those evil people out there that's exactly what they're
thinking when they're doing their evil onto you so again
it's sort of that clan warfare situation to solve evil
you to go so meta that you realize that your
own mind constructs evil and then when you awaken so
much you become so conscious you realize that evil never
even existed it was all a projection of your own
mind and just a function of your own selfishness and
lack of self-acceptance and lack of self-love and your limited
ego identity as human when all of that is realized
and you transcend your identity as a human you stop
caring whether you're alive or dead anymore you stopped completely
judging and you have direct consciousness of infinite love when
you realize all that then the problem of evil is
soft and then you understand that that is what is
necessary and then you understand that oh well this is
why evil is so prevalent is because almost nobody has
done everything I just said structurally they're trying to fix
evil on a Content level we'll think they can just
eliminate evil by passing laws or by judging people or
by locking people in jail or by killing people or
by demonizing people and none of that works because all
of that is evil you understand you're using evil to
fight evil which only perpetuates more evil and makes you
with the evil this is a very very deep structural
problem probably the deepest structural problem there is and yet
people think it's content people get mad at murders for
being murders without understanding that it's purely structural there is
no need to get mad at a murder in fact
when you get mad at a murderer you're committing evil
because your judgment and your anger and your fear that
is the very source of evil that is selfishness you
are projecting your own selfishness onto that murder now I'm
not saying if the let murderers run loose but there
are compassionate and loving ways to deal with murders which
don't involve demonizing them and trying to exterminate them but
is is more understanding of the structural problem behind why
their murders in the first place of course this is
all deeply unpopular and of course I would be demonized
for defending murders by just by saying this precisely because
people are really attached to demonizing and judging murders and
so they don't want to go meta on murder they
don't wanna go meta on evil they're attached to the
identity of crusading against evil it's very addictive to be
a crusader in the name of goodness and truth and
love against evildoers this is one of the most addictive
identities you can have you can get so hypnotized by
this content of being such a crusader that you will
become the biggest evildoer of them all and yet of
course you will be so in denial about it because
you think you're so good and so righteous that you
won't even know you're doing it and that's how evil
is made ah ha ha there's your solution evil another
example that I like is from from pick up and
dating if you've done pick up if you try to
attract girls as a guy and you struggled with it
as I have in the past you're trying to figure
out what do girls like how do I attract them
and you know how do I get laid one of
the things you learn from pick up after failing a
lot a lot a lot a lot you know you
try to attract a lot of girls you try to
tell them different things to get them to like you
and a lot of things you say don't work and
then what you realize it's not what I say it's
how I say it it's not the content it's not
the pickup line that I use this is the common
mistake people think that all what's the pickup line I
gotta say what do I gotta that's some magic pick-up
line that's gonna make her sleep with me there is
no magic pickup line that's gonna make her sleep with
you it doesn't matter what you say the words that
are coming out of your mouth do not matter when
you're talking to women I mean I'm exaggerating of course
they matter you know if you come up to a
woman and you say that I am a rapist and
I'm gonna rape you that's probably not gonna work very
well for you so you know of course there are
things you don't want to say which are just egregiously
bad but for the for the most part it's not
what you say it's how you say it it's the
sub communication behind the content which is what the woman
is unconsciously assessing all the time which is determining whether
she finds you attractive or not and whether she finds
you honest authentic and credible or not trustworthy or not
valuable enough in her eyes or not see so actually
and this is why you can't you can actually now
I don't recommend this okay please don't get me wrong
here I'm not recommending you do this because this can
get you in a lot of trouble but it actually
is possible if you're in a loud nightclub definitely don't
try this at daylight in the streets if you're at
a loud nightclub where people are rowdy and having fun
it actually is possible to walk up to a woman
and to tell her I'm a rapist and I'm gonna
rape you and make her attract it to you by
saying that why you would think that's impossible because you're
saying the most disgusting vulgar atrocious illegal thing like you
would think like well it's completely against her self-interest to
accept that and to be attracted to it but that's
if you assume that content matters what really matters though
is the structure the sub communication so if I walk
up to her and say that with a smile with
a nice little wink if I do it confidently without
fear or creepiness if I don't do it as some
sort of creeper where I'm kind of creeping in and
like tapping her on the shoulder and like trying to
say this as though I'm like really gonna do it
you know if I'm not dressed like a rapist if
I'm dressed nice if I smell nice if you know
I'm shaved nice and all this and I have some
friends around me and it looks like I'm having fun
and like that's what she's really reading off of you
whereas of course if I come up to her and
I'm all by myself and I'm sort of like meek
and creepy looking and haven't shaved and I smell terrible
and I'm wearing a ripped shirt and then I say
it to her in some sort of creepy way yeah
that's when you get really in trouble that's when she'll
call the police on you and you know so that's
that's what makes the whole difference with pickup pickup is
all about the structure the sub communication it's about how
you look at her it's about the state you're in
it's how you feel even the mood you're in is
gonna affect your whole interaction so there are there are
sometimes things that I can say that would normally work
but then they don't work because I'm in a bad
mood I'm not congruent with the thing that I'm saying
and then sometimes the most absurd lines work lines that
you would think would never ever work because you're in
a good mood you're having fun and the context is
perfect for it and it comes off as cute or
funny or irreverent and she giggles at it she likes
it and she gets attracted to it and in fact
it gives you bonus points and her eyes because you
say something edgy or bold and you know it's hard
to pull that off so if you're able to pull
that off consistently then women will reward you for it
that's that's the counterintuitive nature of Attraction like it's it's
so so counterintuitive but again be careful I don't recommend
that you that you test some of these extreme cases
you know start small start with simple huh with simple
approaches and then you can see how far you can
push it and again you got it you got to
be very it's all very context sensitive so for example
you know loud noisy nightclub where people are drinking and
having fun doing drugs and stuff listening to loud music
in that environment it's very socially acceptable for example to
come up and to hug a girl or to even
slap her on the ass again you gotta be careful
with it can get you into trouble even there but
it's a lot more acceptable to do that sort of
stuff at a loud nightclub than it is like in
the mall during the the middle of the day where
nobody's drinking and nobody's yelling and partying you see so
that sort of context sensitivity that sort of social awareness
is extremely important to pull some of these more edgy
things off and again that's a structural thing see and
the only way you can learn what's appropriate and what's
not and what these structures are is through massive experience
it's almost impossible to learn it by reading a book
or watching a video you got to really get out
there and go through trial and error and learn what
the structures really are but then you can get very
good and women women will actually appreciate that you're good
and that you're not creepy about it because most guys
who aren't experienced there they're quite creepy so actually women
appreciate when you're able to be very socially aware and
you're able to to do edgy things in such a
way where you push the line but you don't cross
the line and you don't creep them out or freak
them out and you're still a cool guy and you
still understand you know her comfort level and you know
how to kind of calibrate to what she needs that's
not easy to do that takes massive experience another example
is money in politics money in politics is a structural
problem it's not a Content brought it's a structural problem
both Democrats and Republicans liberals and conservatives are very susceptible
to money because very basic survival resource and so you
know people will follow to the traveling at all well
the Republicans are the corrupt ones they take all the
money or the Democrats are the trouble is they'll take
all the money now both Republicans and Democrats they both
take quite a lot of money and it's a very
big structural problem and they both resist campaign finance reform
they both resist taking money out of politics for selfish
reasons and that's basically corruption now of course they're not
equal at it generally liberals are again more evolved than
conservatives so they're gonna be less prone to bribery and
corruption but they're still pretty damn susceptible to it it's
a problem in politics another structure content conflation is for
example have you heard of the conservative talking point about
how all well the Scandinavian countries is socialism and it's
just like Venezuela Venezuela socialism so we shouldn't have socialism
America because we're gonna be like Venezuela I'm gonna be
eating dogs and cats off the streets that's socialism but
again this is a Content conflation when conservatives think this
way they're just looking at the content they just hear
the word socialism it's like well socialism Scandinavia has it
Venezuela has it it's the same thing they don't look
at the structure of it the structure of Scandinavian countries
is it very different from the structure of Venezuela there
at totally different levels of the spiral they're different cognitively
they're different morally than if it's spiritually they're different infrastructure
you know Venezuela is basically a dictatorship or a tyranny
it's not it's not a a well-functioning democracy and it
never really was it lacked massively lacks infrastructure so of
course when you introduce socialist ideals into that kind of
system it's completely unsustainable in it results in problems because
they have to grow through a capitalist phase first but
then a country that is post capitalist like scan a
navy that has already grown through that and they actually
have a thriving capitalist market in an economy they have
infrastructure they have a court system they have rule of
law they have a constitution they have a Supreme Court
they have all this stuff they have low corruption levels
they are they are non ideological non-dogmatic they tolerate minorities
all this sorts of stuff that does not really exist
in Venezuela they're basically staged green on the spiral and
even shades of stage yellow tier two so in that
kind of situation when you introduce elements of socialism against
skin a name is not even fully socialist but when
you introduce elements of socialism then it works and it
works better than capitalism so that's very important and then
when you consider America structurally whereas America well structurally America's
a lot closer to Scandinavia than it is to Venezuela
so there's this this right wing talking point that like
Barney Sanders will turn America into Venezuela it's it's completely
absurd it it completely misses the structural understanding of what's
really going on in government in politics and economics it's
a deliberate straw man and of course the people who
make this straw me and they have no interest whatsoever
in analyzing the structure because they're just they're they're wrapped
up in the content they're just defending their conservative ideology
and for that a straw man is perfect the truth
is irrelevant here this is survival this is this ideological
survival this is an identity that's being defended another example
is with religious schools and how they indoctrinate so religious
indoctrination is the same structurally regardless of the religion Catholic
schools Protestant schools Muslim schools Jewish schools Buddhist schools it's
all indoctrination of course there's different degrees of indoctrination so
some Muslim schools are really really bad at it probably
more much more so than than a Catholic school but
but still the structures are the same just different degrees
so if you're stuck in content you might and you're
Catholic let's say you might say well Lea while Catholic
school is not indoctrination the reason it's not a doctrine
ation is because Catholicism is true from your point of
view that's exactly how I look because your paradigm locked
but then you look at a Muslim you know some
Muslim madrasah in Iran or in Pakistan or wherever and
you might say oh that there look there indoctrinating the
children into some crazy Muslim radical Islamist ideology structurally though
it's the same as you sending your kids to Catholic
school it's no different if the degree is a little
bit different you know in Pakistan it will be more
extreme than it is in a suburb in America but
when you kiss send your kids to it to Catholic
school that this is exactly what you're doing but due
to self bias see my episode called self bias during
Portland due to self bias you're excusing the Catholic and
dr. nation because it's your kind of indoctrination is kind
you like he's the kind you were indoctrinated with whereas
the Muslim you know when the Muslim parent sends his
his child to some madrasah religious camp he justifies it
by of course saying that Allah is the one true
God is Lama sizz true and so this indoctrination isn't
really indoctrination it's just education into the truth and if
you're a scientist you do this too you might send
your kids not to a religious university but to a
very technical scientific university you might send your kid off
to become an engineer at Caltech or MIT and you'll
say well Leo that's not my tea is not indoctrination
this is high quality education what are you talking about
but it is indoctrination your indoctrinating him to be a
materialist academic scientifically rationally minded person and this is indoctrination
just because it happens to be your flavor and of
indoctrination doesn't make it any less indoctrination watch out for
yourself bias see for it to not be indoctrination you
would have to truly allow freedom for this child to
to choose for themselves and to research and to inquire
for themselves without forcing them to go anywhere without getting
them into any particular paradigm without biasing them against religion
or Catholicism or Islam or science or anything else but
you don't care about that you just care about perpetuating
the kind of stuff you were indoctrinated with when you
were younger whether it's science atheism or anything else another
great example that I like is a string of bad
relationships have you encountered this or maybe somebody close to
you has a relative of yours or a friend where
they just keep getting into a bad relationship after a
bad relationship after bad relationship and they keep complaining about
it like the same girl keeps getting together with another
abusive guy another alcoholic guy who keeps abusing her keeps
cheating on her keeps hitting her keeps doing this treating
her badly she stays with him she keeps justifying it
and then finally she breaks it off or even he
breaks it off cuz he gets tired of her whining
and then and then she finds another guy exactly like
that why does this keep happening she tells herself well
I'll just changed the guy the guy is bad I'll
just get a new guy but it ain't the guy
of course the guy has problems do if he's doing
this but he ain't the guy because the guy in
this case is just content changing content by changing a
guy or changing content but the problem is structural the
problem is in her low self-esteem the problem is in
her depression the problem is with her substance abuse the
problem is with her certain fantasies about reality or certain
fantasies about relationships her dependency her her neediness her feeling
unattractive her feeling worthless her feeling unlovable these structural psychic
problems within her these are what allow for these sort
of codependent abusive relationships to materialize in the first place
if you're a needy person who thinks that you're unattractive
and you're depressed and you have low self-esteem you will
tend to attract people who will sustain that for you
and that's not gonna change until you make a structural
change in your psyche but of course that's hard work
she usually won't want to do that now of course
guys have this problem as well I'm not just picking
on women here just happen to be using a female
example because it's a very classic one that we've all
probably experienced at some point through friends and family so
yeah so you can only fix this through structural change
by going meta this means you have to rise above
all your relationships you can't just look at one relationship
in isolation from another you have to look you know
you have to take the 30,000 foot elevated perspective bird's-eye
view you look down and you have to ask yourself
okay what what is the common thread the structure behind
all the bad relationships if I've been in why do
they keep happening why do I keep attracting these kinds
of guys and then you might notice something about yourself
something meta and of course this whole thing is made
much worse because you're hypnotized by the guy if this
is happening to you as a woman you're falling in
love with these guys head over heels and you think
you can change him and you think that you're so
good together and you think that you're not gonna get
a better guy this is he's the only one for
you and if you know if only this one little
thing could be changed about him then everything would be
perfect that's how you rationalized yourself you love the sex
you're addicted to the sex you're addicted to his masculinity
or whatever else he makes you feel at times you're
hypnotized in the content and you don't want to break
that illusion it's like a romantic dream that you're in
you're in this hypnotic romantic spell and you don't to
break it you feel comfortable in it it makes you
feel safe and secure at least at certain points and
breaking that illusion is very difficult but it's the only
way you'll be able to escape that sufferings by going
meta so the question is how much are you willing
to suffer before you wise up in you go meta
another good example is being at the effective emotions versus
being aware of emotions as a structure so being at
the effective emotions is content emotions are content I want
you to notice this in your body you feel different
things you feel anger happiness sadness depression guilt fear blah
blah blah blah blah all this emotional content stuff and
usually this is all controlling you and you're just like
a marionette pulled by strings all day long all year
long by these emotions so to master your emotions you
have to go meta you have to realize it's not
about the particular emotion that I'm feeling it's about the
structure of what these emotions are doing at all it's
about becoming mindful of emotions getting detached getting distanced from
the emotions becoming a witness to your emotions so you
can observe them and you can analyze them and you
can see the structures the meta structures that cause them
and once you snip those structures once you become so
conscious of the structures of emotions that's what allows you
to transcend emotions and ultimately master your emotions and it
appears that as though you can control your emotions you're
not really controlling them you are just observing them from
a much elevated perspective and in fact it's possible to
have such an elevated perspective so much consciousness that you
observe it emotion and the emotion cannot even arise because
you're too conscious to let it arise you're not suppressing
it you're not denying it you're just so [ __
] conscious that it can't even arise or if it
does arise then you can quickly let it go but
this requires an enormous amount of training going really really
really meta that's not easy to do don't think you'll
accomplish this in a month or even in a year
another example I like here is Sam Harris he's a
great example of a guy who's stuck on content he's
really stuck on harping on the content of Islam and
on the content of religion overall cuz he's built an
identity out of being a rationalist that's his whole shtick
that's his whole career and it's his whole his whole
ego is about that but in in being so wrapped
up and so critical of the content of Islam he
misses this the deeper structural problems which are really the
the cause of terrorism and problems in the Middle East
so sam harris likes to attribute terrorism and Islamism and
all the sort of stuff to what is written in
the quran and his idea is that well the quran
is particularly bad religious book yes the bible is bad
but the quran is worse because it's more violent the
actual content in the quran encourages violence that's his sort
of argument and the problem with that is is that
that really misses the point the the thing that's really
running the show that's responsible for terrorism and radical Islamists
doing bad stuff is low cognitive moral and spiritual development
on the spiral which of course is prevalent in the
Middle East and the reason it's prevalent in Middle East
is not because of the Quran it's because of a
long chain of historical geopolitical factors that go back thousands
of years which are independent of the content of the
Koran and simply because their spiral development hasn't been given
enough time to rise to stage orange or green or
yellow or turquoise most the Middle East many of the
the poorest countries in the Middle East are still stuck
in spiral dynamics purple and red and maybe if they're
developed blue and like if they're really developed a little
bit of orange but mostly it's a lot of purple
and Red's - a lot of tribalism going on there
but you know this has to do with a lot
of geopolitical factors has to do with the temperature the
climate that they live in has to do with the
geography the mountain Rangers has to do with the animals
that live there has to do with the farming the
agriculture there's so many factors so to reduce all this
to bad phrases within the Quran is quite ridiculous it
ignores the historical context it ignores the structure of small
dynamics it ignores the problems of ideology in general the
problems of Islam Islam are not limited to the Quran
or to the Islam these are in general well-known ideological
problems these are basically this is basically cult psychology at
work cult psychology is that work not only in Islam
it's it's at work in America in Christianity but not
just in Christianity in science so while sam harris is
overly focused on islam he's missing the structural similarities between
Islam Christianity and science and atheism and himself which is
of course the whole point of what he's doing because
the whole point is to separate himself and his culture
and his ideology from that of Islam and to put
his own on top that's the whole underlying never spoken
or admitted agenda which is fueling everything he's doing of
course none of this can ever be admitted because to
admit it you'd have to go very meta just to
see it and it would be very painful to admit
that probably ruin his here so it's not in his
interest to admit that Dada that's the Harrison how about
Trump is an example Trump is a great example to
use because see the whole trap that Republicans have fallen
into the defenders of Trump they fall into this trap
where now they're for a damned if they do and
damned if they don't on the one hand they love
Trump at the level of content they agree many Republicans
agree with his financial policies with his immigration policies with
its gun policies environmental policies and so forth some Republicans
disagree with the fact that Trump is kind of crude
and he tweets and does this cuss you know stupid
stuff on the surface I guess many many even Republicans
don't really think that that's wise or beneficial to their
cause but they put up with it anyways because generally
they like the content they like the conservative judges they
love the rules he's passing the deregulation he's doing the
tax cuts this is content stuff but what they're not
aware of is the structural corruption of Trump they're so
eager to get there they're content that they want that
they're attached to that they completely are willing to overlook
Trump's corruption illegality criminality his terrible history his sex scandals
his moral depravity the fact that he's not really successful
in business his scams with Trump University and his scams
with his charity his his connections with foreign governments which
are very sketchy his violation of the emoluments clause his
conflicts of interest around the world from his businesses his
connections with Russia his connections with Saudi Arabia like this
is also this is all the deep structural stuff which
is what contributes to corruption but to a conservative Trump
supporter they're so hypnotized by the content of conservativism that
they don't care about the corruption they don't care about
the structure they haven't gone sufficiently meta to see that
the very swab that they want Trump to drain is
the very swamp that Trump is burying into office and
of course Trump doesn't see this as well Trump is
so clueless he doesn't think structurally about anything he's too
impulsive and short-sighted and selfish that he thinks he's gonna
go in there and he honestly believes that he can
just like drain swamp by deregulating stuff and doing the
stuff he wants to do making these content changes it's
not gonna work because he himself has brought the structural
corruption into everyone he's surrounded stuff in his administration is
is basically roughly around his level of development and they
are so prone to corruption which is why everybody around
it keeps go to jail and getting in trouble and
there's bribery charges and mismanagement of falak funds and all
this this is this is how corruption happens you can't
fix corruption if your psyche has the same structure as
that of the people who do corruption changing the people
doesn't matter because it's the psychic it's the psyche structure
that matters and right now Trump is the biggest corruption
in Washington since probably the last century and most of
Republicans don't see it because they're in denial about it
because they're stuck on the content they don't want to
look at the structure that's what's going on right now
see if people were aware of iodine Amex they would
clearly see that Trump is is at a low center
of gravity around stage red which makes them very impulsive
narcissistic and very prone to corruption see he he has
no qualms with corruption as long as it serves him
that's what selfishness is selfishness doesn't care about applying anti-corruption
measures to itself selfishness excuses itself for being Karan and
blames everybody else for their corruption that's devilry 101 structurally
Trump's psyche has more in common with Kim jong-un or
Putin or Hitler or Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein or the
Chinese leader Xi zan with European leaders or leaders of
Scandinavian countries or leaders in Japan or leaders in other
kind of developed first world countries because the leaders in
European countries are roughly around stage green orange green maybe
even a little bit of yellow but the leaders in
in underdeveloped countries dictatorship countries like in Russia in China
in India in especially North Korea these these people are
staged red maybe blue maybe a bit orange but mostly
I like especially kim jeong-hoon why does Trump get along
so well with the North Korean leader because they're both
basically sage red they're perfect for each other they should
get married and the media is all surprised by there's
nothing surprising about this this is completely predictable if you
understand violent image another interesting example evangelicals share more and
common structurally with Nazis and Islamists than they do with
Christ isn't that funny of course they would never admit
this this is the most offensive thing you could say
to an evangelical Christian is that a Christian has more
in common with a Nazi or an Islamist than with
Christ and yet that's precisely the case if you look
at the situation not in terms of content but in
terms of structure see if you're only looking at content
it's very easy for the evangelicals they won't but I
am like Christ because I about Christ I go to
Christchurch maybe there's even Christ in my name maybe I
view a name Christian I pray to Christ I try
to emulate Christ by believing the things Christ believed and
saying the things Frye said but that's all content none
of that matters what matters for you to truly be
Christ like the thing that was most remarkable about Christ
and the only reason we know about Christ and we
speak about Christ 2,000 years after the fact is because
of the remarkable structure that Christ had that was so
different and so far above and so far meta beyond
anyone else of his time and anyone own and many
people of our time yeah of course you can reach
that same level of meta structure as well if you
want but that's that's that's a tall order to fill
and evangelicals are nowhere they're the structure of the evangelical
psyche is much closer to the structure of a Nazi
or an Islamist psyche its dogmatic its tribalistic its nationalistic
its its spirituality purely at the level of belief and
indoctrination he doesn't care about going meta doesn't understand consciousness
let's understand what love is it demonizes it tries to
fix evil - at the level of content see Christ
wasn't trying to fix evil at the level of content
Christ solved the problem of evil at the level of
structure he realized that there is no evil there is
only love that was his message but you can't teach
love at the level of content because love is not
about content love is about structure love is the most
meta thing that there is but all of this has
lost on evangelicals because you can't get there through dogma
you'd have to completely renounce and go meta above your
your Christian dogma and indoctrination to truly be christ-like so
actually the more do you believe in Christ unless Christ
light you are you can't be christ-like through belief or
by going to church it'll never work actually odds are
much better that you'll become christ-like by quitting Church and
not reading the Bible ever again that's what's so counterintuitive
about spirituality another example is religious materialism you know people
often say that well like there are scientific materialists that
I like to rail against a lot the materials paradigm
and then there's the religious people and they like oh
the religious people are supposed to be the immaterial ones
the ones that don't care about material matters because they're
they're worried about heaven they're worried about the afterlife whereas
the scientists and the materialist and the atheist and the
rationalist they're worried about the ordinary world so in this
sense it seems that they're so different but this is
this is a facade structurally both are materialists religious people
like that evangelical I was just talking about he's a
materialist he believes in an objective external material world he
believes that God is some human being like entity that
sits up in the clouds he believes he's going to
heaven which is a physical place he believes that when
he goes to heaven there will be physical benefits bestowed
upon him there will be riches and wealth and there
will be beautiful women or whatever you know I'm exaggerating
a little bit here but hey many many Muslims believe
in whole 72 virgins thing as their first of heaven
you know it's extremely materialistic because that's that's the level
of the psyche a materialistic psyche is a materialistic psyche
regardless of whether it believes in scientific content or Christian
content or Muslim content hmm if you care about wealth
you care about it independently of whether you're a Muslim
a Christian a Jew or an atheist that's a structural
thing you're not conscious enough yet to realize the limitations
of materialism and wealth which is why there are have
you seen these Christian evangelical televangelists that preach about the
prosperity gospel where they talk about how oh you can
become so wealthy by by sending me more money and
then they buy private jets they fly around these preachers
they plop fly around the country they have giant congregations
and they milk their their their flock for money you
might wonder well how is that possible when Christ's one
of Christ's main messages is you know as he said
a rich man has better as much chance of getting
into heaven as passing through the eye of a needle
well Christ was telling you that materialism won't get you
into heaven let go of your materialism why are these
Christian televangelists flying around in private jets because it's a
structural problem they don't see the structure of it what
they just see is that hey if I am in
a private jet but I'm praying to Christ on my
private jet that's good enough but see that's a Content
that's a content matter that's not a structural matter the
problem is not that you're not praying to Christ on
your private jet the problem is that you care about
having a private jet that's the structural problem let go
of that desire and then you will become more christ-like
you won't need to pray to Christ you won't need
to worship Christ you won't even need to think about
Christ and just relinquish your desire for a private jet
and that will automatically make you christ-like at a structural
level a little bit now you'd have to go much
further than that but that's a good start it's a
good start but of course that would be hard to
do and that would mean going against your survival needs
see your ego doesn't want to relinquish that private jet
your ego wants to hold on to the idea that
I can be christ-like and have a private jet and
that there's no contradiction and I can do both after
all wouldn't Christ want me to have a private jet
and lots of money wouldn't that actually help to spread
his world his word around the world after all I
can be a much better preacher I can convert more
people to Christ message if I have a private jet
I can fly around faster see the mind starts to
feed itself this this this this ideology that it constructs
it constructs whatever ideology serves its survival so if having
sex with lots of young women is is what serves
your survival as a preacher you will find a way
to rationalize why Christ wants you to have sex with
young women or marry multiple wives or abuse your wives
physically hit them physically lock them up in a cage
make them service you it's all very easy to justify
as long as you're operating on the level of content
and all you care about is the image of Christ
in your mind because you know you can you can
have a harem of women that you abuse and use
as your sex slaves while you're a Christian preacher flying
around on your private jet while you're praying to God
and converting more people to to read the Bible you
could make that work structurally though structurally that's devilry see
when you're doing that you're not being Christ you're being
a devil you're doing the opposite of Christ but you
can put a picture of Christ over out of a
veneer of Christ hood over it and make yourself feel
good and you can make that work of course it's
gonna produce a lot of suffering a lot of blowback
cuz devilry you know always comes with it's karma so
you're not gonna get away scot-free but you're basically gonna
ruin your whole life doing that but you can do
it people have done it people are probably doing it
right now don't think if this stuff is all fantasy
I'm giving you real-world examples of [ __ ] that
actually happens so the key here I guess is that
spirituality cannot happen at the level of content spirituality is
about the structure of your consciousness this is critical for
you to understand spirituality is about going meta meta meta
meta meta meta you keep going meta until you go
meta on absolutely everything and then you even go meta
ongoing meta you're so meta that you go meta on
life you erase yourself from life you erase physical reality
reality ceases to exist when you fully go meta nothing
remains nothing remains only emptiness remains nothing it's as though
reality never even existed you're walking around and reality doesn't
even exist for you really truly it's a you realize
that everything is a hallucination everything is nothing and when
that happens do you realize that your god and you
realize what God is and you realize that God is
infinite meta meta forever meta meta meta meta meta meta
meta meta meta meta forever and that's what you are
and that's true Christ hood then you become Christ and
then only then you can truly be a Crabby Christ
like you cannot behave like Christ unless you've gone completely
meta you must surrender all of your attachments all of
your ideologies all of your judgments all of your moralization
z' all of your ideals all of your beliefs everything
you hold true everything you must even surrender physical reality
the notion there is a physical reality you must surrender
that everything must be surrendered you must surrender your life
you must surrender caring whether you're tortured everything must be
surrendered then you can be christ-like then you're immortal then
you're invincible then you're fearless and then you discover infinite
love then you also you conquer evil by doing this
see but this is so hard to do this takes
so much consciousness this takes a complete detachment from all
absolutely all content all of life that almost nobody doesn't
see and now you understand now you understand why nobody
does it why Spa dynamics so powerful it's powerful because
it reveals deep structures about humans individually and collectively you
see structures you weren't able to see before where before
you saw content after you learn Spile and AMEX really
good from watching my series on it and reading books
and so forth it's like a whole new dimension of
life opens up to you but also I want you
to recognize that structural thinking the kind of sometta stuff
we're talking about here this doesn't really start to take
place seriously until stage yellow on spiral dynamics it's really
part of systems thinking and then even beyond that and
it really only comes into into full flower at stage
turquoise and then of course you go so many that
you're even gonna go you're gonna surrender and transcend spy
line Amex itself that's how a meta you ultimately need
to go but before you get there you know don't
don't give up file name is too fast a useful
model use it while you're growing because most of you
are not at turquoise yet but notice though that stage
is purple red blue orange and green on the spiral
they get stuck very easily in content differences so that's
what you're seeing everything at Tier one which is green
and below is people they don't see structure almost in
anything they see content then wrapped up in content they're
hypnotized by content and they're fighting with each other up
and down the spiral over content differences and it's only
when you get to green and above to yellow that
you wake up you get to tier two you have
a little bit of an epiphany and you go from
trying to survive within and amongst content this infinite sea
of content to finally realizing that it's not about the
content it's about going meta and then your life becomes
about transcendence and trying to raise your consciousness and trying
to detach from content as much as possible and you
start to do that and that's where actualize ever comes
in as we're doing that together and as we're doing
that we're detaching more and more and more we're getting
more more meta and we're getting more and more christ-like
godlike we might say but that's really hard to do
you start to see how hard it is to do
that it's much harder than you think and it'll take
you much longer than you expect to do that but
hey you might as well get started because there's nothing
nothing better to do in life than doing this the
more meta you can go the better but how do
you go Matt oh well that's where the Devils in
the details we got to talk about a lot of
specific topics that's work more of my other videos come
in we talk about how to go meta in various
different ways meditation is one way to go meta psychedelics
is another way to go meta visualization maybes another way
to go contemplations other way to go journaling another way
to go you know many of the techniques that I've
shared with you shamanic breathing yoga there's a lot of
ways to go meta reading books even learning Spalla dynamics
that will help you to go meta and so on
basically everything that I teach every video of mine tries
to help you to go meta in some way sometimes
a big way sometimes a little way there's a lot
to go meta on it's not just one thing that
you're trying to transcend here's a list of problems due
to lack of structural awareness common social problems racism slavery
corruption evil nationalism ethnic cleansing religious dogma intolerance violence indoctrination
of children war the drug war the opioid epidemic we
have here in America scientific closed closed mindedness and denial
of the paranormal false equivalency between the left and the
right capitalism run amok money in politics demonization of socialism
and socialist economics labor exploitation income inequality the kind that
we have here in America and in many other places
in the world the key inside here is that these
problems are not at the level of content this is
why our politics is so dysfunctional is that many of
our politicians are trying to fix these problems at the
level of content and that's because our voters the people
who vote the politicians in of course the politicians themselves
as well they see the problems only in terms of
content not in terms of structure most of our politicians
are not stage yellow thinkers they're not systemic thinkers they
can't see structure very well they don't know how to
go meta they're stuck on content so most debates most
religious or most political discussion ends up being at a
very low level ineffective level of you know content disputes
which is never going to really resolve the problems that
we have because they're structural the problem is is is
not just structural in the way that the government structures
needs to change of course that is part of the
problem there's an even deeper problem the deeper structural problem
is how we perceive problems our worldview our piste Amala
G how we look at the world our metaphysics these
are the really true structural problems which create and reinforce
all these other social problems that I've outlined above the
chief problem we have is in how we perceive and
frame our problems our problem is a meta problem and
root solutions require structural understanding and structural change otherwise you
just shuffle around content and you're just putting band-aids on
things you're never solving the root issue the root issues
are all existential ultimately a metaphysical they're tied in with
your identity your mind your psyche your worldview they're tied
in with what you think reality is that's really where
these problems stem from from what you think reality is
and what you think you are and unless you solve
those problems they're gonna continue popping up in myriad ways
here are the most important structures of the mind that
you should be studying its most important if you're gonna
be studying structure to study not the structure of government
although of course that's useful with the structure of business
but study the structure of your mind and what do
I mean by structures of the mind well I've talked
a lot about them in the past especially in my
three part series on self-deception understanding self-deception and so these
are structures like projection denial ideology clinging to ideas and
beliefs conform and biased cherry-picking paradigms question begging self bias
justification moralization groupthink conformity cult psychology judgment and demonization the
ego it's a huge topic emotions that's a huge topic
meaning making and storytelling the various roles that you play
I have dedicated episodes on at least half of that
list that I just mentioned and I'll release more going
forward in the future we still have yet to talk
about more deeply about meaning making and storytelling and we
have more to talk about justification and question begging and
denial and projection so but then again I've covered a
lot of the other ones as well I've covered self
just to covered self bias I've covered moralization I've covered
demonization and various other defense mechanisms self-deception Vic is in
conclusion your biggest life problems cannot be solved by changing
around content I hope you understand that by now and
of course to be clear here you're probably biggest life
problem is happiness right isn't that what everybody wants is
that what you ultimately want is that your biggest problem
so you don't have no happiness so how do you
think you gonna solve that problem are you trying to
solve the happiness problem at the level of content but
it isn't working you play new video games doesn't work
you watch new movies doesn't work you get more money
doesn't work you play at a golf course it doesn't
work you get a big house it doesn't work you
become more famous you're still not happy you get a
sexy girlfriend you're still not happy you're in a marriage
you're still not happy you have children you're still not
happy so what is it gonna take to make you
happy well at some point you're gonna have to acknowledge
to yourself that happiness is not a Content problem no
amount of content will make you happy happiness is a
structural problem more money fancy vacations mink coats fancy jewelry
fame and success a career you want travel shop sex
private jets and yachts even the acquisition of knowledge this
is still all content you're changing around content thinking that
it will satisfy you at one point and it never
will because you need to go meta and realize that
happiness is a structural problem you need to change the
strip the structure of your psyche in order to be
happy and that's why happiness is so rare and that's
why you can't buy happiness with money and that's why
you can't get happiness through a magic pill or a
drug at least not sustainably because it's a structural problem
even if a drug makes you happy for an hour
or for 10 hours when the drug ends you fall
back into your old structure the reason the drug actually
made you happy is because especially like for example with
a psychedelic no some of you who are into psychedelics
you know that you can be extremely blissful and happy
at the peak of a psychedelic trip what's going on
there why are you so happy when you take a
psychedelic it's not because you're being bombarded with pure pleasure
that's not what's going on it's not like heroin or
something where you're just getting a shot of of serotonin
or some beautiful chemical that's making you all happy and
giggly and whatever it's not that the psychedelic is actually
expanding your consciousness and making you go so meta that
the structure of your entire life expands and changes so
you become so conscious of the structure and you're putting
to a totally new state of consciousness that you're in
a new structure and from that structure this expanded godlike
christ-like structure you get a sort of a parting of
the clouds and you realize how beautiful life could be
if you were in that structure all the time but
then of course the psychedelic wears off in ten hours
the clouds close back up you is connect from God
you fall back into your own state of consciousness your
old structure nothing has really changed or a little bit
of change but not enough and you're depressed again or
you're miserable again you're suffering again and you wonder well
where did it go why can't I be this happy
all the time you've been shown a glimpse of the
structural change you need to make in order to be
that happy so consider yourself lucky that there even exists
such tools such technology that allows you to even get
that gloves because most people will never get that glimpse
in their whole life they will never go that meta
and they will never even understand what they're missing at
least you now do now if you want to actualize
it and embody it and stabilize in it you have
to work your ass off for it but that's a
topic for another day for now I just want to
leave you with this wherever you go there you are
wherever this structure goes there you are it doesn't matter
if you're in Rome or you're in Paris or you're
in Japan or you're at a party or you're having
sex or you're at a famous university or you're on
TV as long as this is here this is the
main structure you're carrying around with you and it's that
structure which is running the whole show and you can't
escape that structure you can't escape yourself that's the highest
truth all right that's it for this one please click
that like button your likes helped to make these videos
more popular and visible on YouTube and come check out
my website that's actualize that org right there click on
it I get the sense people don't click on this
enough click there's stuff there that you want to see
exclusive content that you won't find on youtube or elsewhere
check out my blog check out my book list check
out my life purpose course check out the forum all
these are potentially life transforming resources for you so make
use of it I've put a lot of time into
my blog I put a lot of time to the
forum I put a lot of time into making my
courses I put a lot of time updating the book
list I've updated the book list like close to 10
times now for free go get all those updates and
if you like my work if you think that this
is helpful for people and this is expanding mankind evolving
mankind then support me on action on patreon calm patreon.com
slash actualized there's a link down below you can click
it chip in five bucks a month that helps to
support the channel supports my work and in the future
I can use that money to help to do advertising
and to improve my equipment and hire more people and
so forth to help you out the final warning I
want to give you is this if you blindly accept
the things that I say in my videos that's a
structural problem there's a meta goal of actualize that org
is not to feed you content of course I do
feed you lots and lots of content but it's very
easy to take it out on as content without really
grasping the structure that's being pointed at all of my
content is always pointing to deeper structures the trick with
structures is that they can't always be verbalized and communicated
and made fully explicit they can't always be written down
in a linear sequence these structures are complicated and they
require consciousness so beware of this trap it's very very
easy to memorize a bunch of actualized content without actually
going meta by doing so you're committing the very same
error that that evangelical prosperity preacher is doing of flying
around on the private jet and preaching but not actually
changing his structure for you to get the results that
this work is capable of generating you must make structural
changes to your psyche that's all we really care about
here we're not interested in money or sex or all
that and stuff I mean we can be tangentially but
ultimately we're interested in structural change and I want you
to make a distinction between self-improvement videos and advice and
books or even spiritual advice and books which is content-based
and not structural most self-help books are talking about content
changes making content changes which is not going to resolve
anything deep and it's not going to lead to a
deep satisfaction or a deep understanding of reality or a
deep change in your circumstances which is why self-help sometimes
gets a bad rap and people say all self-help is
so corny nothing really changes to these self-help books really
work they work if you're making structural changes and there
are some good self-help books out there that talk about
making structural change and those really will help you if
you make those changes but these changes are not easy
to make it's not about reading one book and then
just memorizing it and then all the sudden the change
has been done no not at all reading the book
is like one percent of the work and most of
you are too lazy to even read a couple dozen
books and you're reading the wrong books you're reading the
books that are about content change not structural change so
how about you make this distinction and then of course
you push yourself more towards making a deep investment in
your own development and in your own life by focusing
on books which are about content I mean sorry about
structural changes which I have many of them on my
book list if you need ideas go check that out
and then you hold yourself to that standard whenever you're
doing personal development work is you you're holding yourself to
the standard of making structural this is such a deep
point that even though you hear it right now and
you think you understand what I'm talking about you don't
come back and watch this episode again another half a
dozen times over the next five years each time you
watch it every year you are going to understand deeper
and deeper what I'm talking about because right now it's
just like in one ear and out the other this
is the difficulty of this work you're not getting the
structure of it you're just getting the content of the
things I'm saying so be very careful about that trap
and I'll see you in the next one you
