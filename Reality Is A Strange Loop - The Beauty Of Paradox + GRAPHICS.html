[Music] you this episode will be very image-heavy so if
you're listening to this on itunes or as an mp3
audio make sure you actually go watch the video version
because I really put a lot of time into assembling
the images and they're gonna be important to understanding what
I'm going to be talking about and also they're gonna
be very beautiful and special I'm really excited about this
episode this episode here is really the whole reason for
why I started actualised org it wasn't to help you
overcome your depression or to help you get laid or
to help you to earn more money in your life
all that stuff yeah that's nice but it just it's
it's just pales in comparison to getting to the root
of reality thinking about the most deep epistemic and metaphysical
questions that's really what I wanted to to bring you
guys towards but it's taken time to build up to
it and also it's taken time for me to train
myself to get to the point where I can talk
about these things in a cogent inarticulate way which like
for example this episode I wanted to shoot several years
ago but I struggled to communicate it and articulate it
in the way that I can today so I'm really
excited to be sharing this with you so let's talk
about what is a strange loop this is an odd
sounding term what does it mean and why is it
so important well this was a term coined by a
guy named Douglas Hofstadter he's a professor of cognitive science
and he's an academic and in the 1970s he wrote
a very influential book it's especially influential in the science
community in the computer science community in the mathematics community
called girdle assure and BA this is a monstrous book
it won the Pulitzer Prize it's beautifully written and it's
also very profound but it's probably also one of the
hardest books you'll ever read in your life it's over
a thousand pages long it's got complicated logical proofs and
things that will completely twist up your mind it'll take
you months just to get through it it took me
a couple of months to work through this thing maybe
eight or ten years ago and in this book he
introduces this concept called a stranger there's a lot different
stuff he talks about there but the core of it
is strange loops he also wrote a book later which
is a more simple version called I am a strange
loop and basically in both these books he argues the
same point his point is that the self the eye
that is in you that that thing is a strange
loop what is a strange loop well a strange loop
is a paradoxical sort of circular hierarchy it's when a
symbol becomes self reflexive and it points back at itself
and this leads to all sorts of interesting paradoxes and
it really stretches the imagination bends the mind to think
about the way that it works is that when you
have a hierarchy traditionally a hierarchy it's just like a
pyramid where you can move up or down the different
rungs of the pyramid so to speak and each one
just is sitting on top of the other and that
is not paradoxical that's how we think of life but
there is this odd sort of tangled hierarchy that's possible
when the the topmost level interconnects with the bottom most
level and so what that means is that when you
move up or down through the hierarchy it ends to
a circling back around and returning to where you started
from and this produces all sorts of weird paradoxes wikipedia
says the following thing very eloquently about tangled hierarchies it
says that they have no well-defined highest or lowest level
moving through the levels one eventually returns to the starting
point so if we want to express this symbolically it
would look like this a is larger than B B
is larger than C and C is larger than a
creating a closed loop in which notice every single letter
or symbol is greater than the previous one and when
you think about this it's like you do a double-take
your mind does a double take and it asks like
wait wait a minute how can this happen this is
clearly a paradox it seems like an impossibility and yet
very interestingly we find examples of this in the real
world so what this sort of tangled hierarchy produces is
a structure without a ground and where have you heard
me talking about that before what is a thing that
has no ground mmm interesting hold on to that thought
we'll come back to it later first let me show
you the prototypical example of a strange loop this would
be the Penrose triangle right here that you're seeing on
the screen so as you can see this is an
impossible object you can't really have one of these in
the physical world but you could have one on a
2d surface which is what you're seeing now and it's
a very beautiful sort of object and one of the
properties of this object as you can see is that
each element of the object is interconnected with every other
element such that if you actually travel along the the
this one of the surfaces of this object that ultimately
you traverse the entire object and you return to precisely
the same point at where you began but that's just
the beginning let me read to you a little bit
from Douglas Hofstadter because not only is he a profound
thinker but he is also a very pithy writer he
has a poetic way of talking about these things that
doesn't just show you there their logic ality and their
and the math behind it but the poetry comes out
it's like you start to see the awe and beauty
of nature when he writes about strange loops so here's
what he says quote when I mean but what I
mean by strange loop is not a physical circuit but
an abstract loop in which in the series of stages
that constitute the cycling around there is a shift from
one level of abstraction or structure to another which feels
like an upward movement in a hierarchy and yet somehow
the successive upward shifts turn out to give rise to
a closed cycle that is despite one's sense of departing
ever further from one's origin one winds up to one's
shock exactly where one had started out in short a
strange loop is a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop and quote
and here I want to show you precisely what he
means by all that because freeing it in that language
can make it sound abstract and difficult to comprehend so
what you see here on the screen is you see
the SEM the same basic Penrose triangle but now you
see the ball moving along the surface just like I
said and if you keep watching it what you'll see
is that the ball will eventually traverse every single facet
of this object and wind up exactly at the beginning
pretty cool huh pretty mind-bending that in a nutshell is
a strange loop it's really a very simple concept but
its simplicity belies its profundity so what I want to
do now is I want to show you the many
examples the beautiful examples of strange loops that we find
throughout art throughout geometry throughout physics throughout logic throughout life
so let's begin our tour of strange loops of course
first and foremost we have the quintessential strange loop which
is the artwork of MC Escher the theme of all
of MC Escher's work was basically paradox geometric and logical
and mathematical paradox and here what you see is we
see his famous engraving called drawing hands it's one hand
drawing another hand which is this sort of interesting chicken
and egg dilemma how can a hand draw another hand
when the hand needs to first exist to begin drawing
and yet the only way the hand can exist to
draw as if it was already drawn by another hand
is C so how can this be it sounds impossible
and yet here it is we see it on the
picture of course it's just a picture so we're not
saying that this can happen in real life but it
makes the mind wonder here's another engraving from MC Escher
this one is called relativity you've probably seen this one
before these are commonly seen in your high school geometry
textbooks or on posters people print these on t-shirts and
this is really interesting and captivating because every angle that
you look at it from it kind of makes sense
but only from that particular angle and then yet when
you look at it you're not sure which angle are
you looking at from you could look at it from
one side from the top from the bottom for the
left from the right or you can kind of look
at them all simultaneously and it produces a sort of
twisted tangled hierarchy which is very mesmerizing and captivating and
of course I'm she sure has lots of works along
these lines this is just two examples next here I
have for you an image of another Penrose triangle but
see and this one is broken up a little bit
differently and it's actually a little bit easier to see
the strange loopiness of this one because you can kind
of see how every single cube of this triangle is
simultaneously above all the rest and below all the rest
you see how there is no top most cube this
is what we mean by a structure with no ground
this structure doesn't have a ground it's another way to
put it would be it's a it's a flat hierarchy
it's a perfect democracy where every element is equal and
here we have another example of the Penrose triangle in
a sort of wireframe and I love this one because
it it kind of to me it reflects the the
skeletal structure of reality that's what makes me think of
is the skeletal structure of reality here we have a
Penrose cube you look at it and it just boggles
your mind you're not sure what you're looking at it
first and then you try to make sense of it
but then it kind of starts to make sense but
then it stops making sense it slips out of your
mind it's a paradox right there before your eyes here's
another example of a Penrose cube this is a different
kind you've probably seen this with before it's usually called
an impossible object you here we have the Penrose staircase
and what's interesting about this staircase is that again it
cycles back around in a strange loop sort of fashion
and then what you notice is that every single step
of this staircase is simultaneously above all of its neighbors
but also below them pretty mind-bending and of course MC
Escher makes use of this particular staircase a lot in
his work here we have an example of a mobius
strip a mobius strip is an interesting geometrical shape because
it's basically just like a a rubber band but with
one twist in the middle and really it's a one-dimensional
object because if you pick any point on the surface
of the band and you travel around what you're gonna
do is you're gonna travel around then you're gonna go
through the twist and so basically by doing one revolution
you go from the it from the outside of the
of the band onto the inside surface of the band
because it's all one surface and then if you continue
that revolution you come back to the outside precisely where
you started so two revolutions of a mobius strip puts
you right back where you begin and here's another depiction
of a mobius strip like object I really love how
this one looks and here what you see I don't
think this object really has a name it's just an
impossible object it's sort of like two Mobius strips connected
together in a three-dimensional cubic like fashion but you can
clearly see how this demonstrates demonstrates the strange loop and
here what you see is a trefoil knot which is
a really beautiful simple yet elegant structure where every loop
of the knot connects back with every other one and
when you look at it you see a sort of
sense of unity it's like the whole thing is just
perfectly self consistent in this weird and twisted way it's
self-contained everything that this object needs it feels like this
object has like it supports itself it is its own
ground and here you see the classic image of the
Ouroboros the Ouroboros is just the fancy word for the
symbol of the snake eating its own tail and this
symbol actually has a very rich history it goes back
thousands and hundreds of years to the alchemists and even
further back beyond that and it's supposed to represent life
itself the cycle of life birth and death the arising
in the passing away and then of course we have
perpetual motion machines and the whole paradox behind the perpetual
motion machine is that it's a strange loop and of
course we know physically that you can't have a professional
motion machine but here on the screen you see an
example of an old idea of what a perpetual motion
machine might look like and this one is called Boyle's
flask and it's just water pouring in like a funnel
and then the final going back into the container of
water and it's like a little waterfall and at first
glance you think about this and you're like well why
couldn't this work it almost seems like it's plausible it
would be a never-ending infinite flow of water but then
of course if you try this in real life you
realize that real-life physics makes it impossible because you have
friction and you have the force of gravity and air
resistance and pressure and it just doesn't work this way
and here what you see is you actually see an
animated diagram or schematic of a of a real life
proposed perpetual motion machine the way it's supposed to work
is that gravity supposed to knock the little balls down
and the the force of the ball is supposed to
kick the apparatus up and then it just spins around
and around and around forever in a circle of course
they can't work this way in real life but it
almost seems like it could this is a strange loop
and here's another example that I really love which beautifully
captures the the absurdity of perpetual motion machines and you
can see how somebody 200 years ago could have thought
that hey why couldn't that work even today it almost
seems like yeah I'm not even sure why that wouldn't
work why wouldn't that work seems like it should the
magnets should be able to pull that guy along and
give him free power forever no gas no solar power
we could really use a car like that today and
here what you have is the classic shape called the
Klein bottle this is actually an object in the field
of topology where the surface bends through itself so you
see the wireframe of it there and you also see
a glass version of it there and it's really interesting
cuz if you go on the outside of the surface
eventually you'll end up on the inside and if you
go through the inside you eventually end up on the
outside so the outside and the inside are really the
same this is sort of like a more three-dimensional version
of the mobius strip whereas the mobius strip was flat
this is volumetric it's like a volumetric mobius strip and
you can actually buy a klein bottle they are possible
to make and here's an image that I found online
which is funnies like a internet meme but it perfectly
illustrates metaphorically illustrates the notion of a strange loop and
here you have an animation of an infinite waterfall cheshire
also made use of this sort of prototype in his
work and you can just see how it goes round
and round round and it almost seems like it could
make sense but you couldn't build one in real life
not without using a pump or some other way to
drive energy into it and here what you see is
a tesseract a tesseract is like a four dimensional cube
and what's interesting about this is that it shows how
objects that are strange loops in some weird sense fold
through themselves in this impossible seeming manner and what also
that brings to mind for me is this image of
a bottomless floor falling through a bottomless floor that would
be a strange loop and here what I want to
show you is I want to take you through a
few different animations that demonstrate this effect of a thing
folding through itself because this is a very important concept
and I want you to see the beauty of it
and the paradox of it so I'm just going to
take you through some various examples of these sorts of
animations they're all basically showing the same thing but in
different ways and here's another you and here's another you
and another you and another you and another you and
another you and here you see a different of a
strange loop or the dots cycle back around and go
through that hole and come out the other hole and
it seems like this sort of self-generating self-contained system and
here what you see is an example of a strange
loop but also something called recursion recursion is this very
interesting property of a thing defining itself in terms of
itself so what you see as you see these little
circles circling around and then eventually shrinking down and making
the next circle which then is a part of the
whole chain and it happens over and over and over
again to infinity and here's another example an image of
recursion you see this when you're looking into a hallway
with two mirrors on both ends and then you see
the mirrors reflecting inside each other and the image just
gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller but every
image contains every other image and it's very interesting self
referential quality and it reminds me also of this other
example imagine if you will that you took a really
powerful microscope and you looked inside of it so you're
sitting there looking through this microscope and this microscope has
a zoom function and you press the button and it
just zooms in so it's oom z-- into the cells
the cells then get zoomed in further into molecules you
can see past the molecules two atoms past the atoms
two subatomic particles pass those you can see the strings
of which everything is made let's say if you believe
in string theory and then eventually what do you see
you see the back of your own head when you
zoom in all the way that would be a perfect
example of a strange loop if that were actually the
case and then of course we have the classic strange
loop from linguistics and from logic and that is the
liar paradox this statement is false well if this statement
is true then that means it's false and if this
statement is false that means it must be true so
which is it is it true or is it false
who knows it's a paradox the statement because it refers
to itself involves itself implicates itself and thereby contradicts itself
this is a hallmark property of self-reflexiveness of self reference
if you can reference yourself that means you can also
sort of negate or undermine or contradict yourself and this
statement is actually a very significant statement within mathematics and
within logic but I can't really go into that here
because that involves girls incompleteness theorem which is a very
deep topic and a very interesting topic but I can't
cover it here and then of course there is the
strange loops that potentially could exist within physical space so
Einstein said that space-time is actually curved and we can
have things like wormholes and black holes and actually the
universe itself could be curved and for a while it
was not clear and it still isn't totally clear to
us whether our universe is actually curved or not they've
actually done real-life tests they've set out satellites and tried
to measure the curvature of space and so far as
far as we can tell that space is not curved
so the universe is probably flat but maybe it's just
a very big sphere or it could still be a
saddle shape or it could be a doughnut shape so
if our universe was actually doughnut shaped or spherical shaped
that means that you could start at one point in
space you could travel a straight line and eventually like
if it's a sphere you will wind up exactly back
to where you started all the while just moving in
a straight line so if that turned out to be
the case we don't know if it is but if
it did turn out to be the case then that
would mean that space itself is a strange loop that
would be pretty cool to discover and then of course
we have all sorts of time travel paradoxes where you
invent a time machine you travel back in time to
the time in history where your father met your mother
and rather than your father meeting your mother you meet
your mother or you meet your father you have sex
with him or her and you end up being the
one who caused your own birth in this very paradoxical
sort of way now of course we don't know if
this can actually happen in real life it sounds rather
absurd sounds very unlikely but who knows maybe someone will
invent a time machine at some point and then we
can actually test this out in real life strange loops
are predicated upon this notion of self reference really what
a strange loop is is it's a system that implicates
itself a system that tries to describe itself or a
system that tries to point to itself and there's something
in that process of trying to do that which makes
everything wacky and paradoxical and usually when we're talking about
objects in the world we are not talking about them
so totally that they implicate themselves so we avoid problems
of self reference but then in certain situations you can't
avoid problems of self reference for example when you're talking
about yourself or when a language is trying to talk
about itself or like any of these other examples that
I was showing you so this raises the obvious question
our strange loops real or are they merely illusions it
seems like there are mostly just illusions like many of
these 2d objects that I was showing you which you
can't really create in the 3d world here's what Douglas
Hofstadter has to say about that he says quote the
abstract structure in pressures drawing hands for example that I
showed you would constitute a perfect example of a genuine
strange loop were it not for one little defect it's
fake but is there then any genuine strange loop a
paradoxical structure that nonetheless deny he belongs to the world
we live in or our so called strange loops always
just illusions that merely Grey's paradox always just fantasies that
flirt with paradox always just bewitching bubbles that inevitably inevitably
pop when approached too closely fortunately there do exist strange
loops that are not illusions I say fortunately because the
thesis of this book is that we ourselves not our
bodies but ourselves are strange loops and so if all
strange loops were illusions then we would all be illusions
and that would be rather a great shame on the
other hand it is not a piece of cake to
exhibit a strange loop for all to see strange loops
are shy creatures and they tend to avoid the light
of day and quote that is Douglas Hofstadter from his
book I am a strange loop but the plot thickens
so you see Hofstadter is saying that there are two
real main strange loops for him in life one is
girls incompleteness theorem which I said I can't cover here
I'll do that in a dedicated episode because it's a
very important discovery within logic and mathematics which has enormous
implications that very few people understand so that's a real
strange loop and then there is the self you and
me and I and my Hofstadter argues that the self
is a complex set of symbols which twists back on
themselves generating themselves from scratch so to speak and that
really the self is an illusion but of course Hofstadter
is a professional cognitive scientist he's an academic he works
in a university setting so as you might expect he
is of course a materialist and ultimately he believes that
the self and all experience and all consciousness boils down
to just molecules atoms neurons brain chemistry but here is
where the delicious irony the twist happens Douglas Hofstadter the
master of strange loops the inventor of strange loops as
a concept as it were has actually fooled himself with
his materialism because in being stuck in the materialist paradigm
he missed the biggest strange loop of all which is
existence itself tada existence itself is the ultimate real strange
loop and this division that Hofstadter makes between the real
and the illusory is itself illusory and that really when
you think about existence the real and the ilusory circle
back and connect with each other because they are actually
one to exist is to be the illusion see Hofstadter
doesn't go far enough yes of course the self is
a strange loop of course the self is an illusion
but not just the self existence and our bodies yes
our bodies are strange loops what you're experiencing right now
look at your body look all around you this is
a strange loop you are a strange loop inside of
a strange loop this is what the materialist cannot fathom
from his paradigm what the materialist paradigm really should understand
but doesn't is that the brain is inside the universe
observing the universe but then the universe is also inside
the brain you see the two are causally interlinked and
yet simultaneously the two are both groundless in exactly the
same way that if you travel back in time and
you give birth to yourself and for a second you
think about things like no that's not possible but of
course it's possible that's the only way that anything can
be that's what existence is the problems that the materialist
doesn't get it because for the materialist existence needs to
have a ground and for him that ground is matter
or energy or fields or whatever but what I'm here
to tell you is that there is no such thing
there is no ground existence is the perfect strange loop
existence and non-existence are not two things that's a duality
the two are actually identical for a thing to exist
is the same thing as for it not to exist
it's a matter of perspective it's a matter of relativity
and this is not a great shame the is mandatory
this is the only way that something could come into
being for something to come into being it has to
not be because illusion is the only reality there is
that's how you get something from nothing that's how come
anything exists at all if you wondered why is there
something rather than nothing there isn't something is nothing they're
exactly the same thing since reality means everything that means
everything is one thing which means that it cannot point
to itself because it's the ultimate self reference problem how
can one thing point to itself when it is the
only thing in existence it can't it has nothing to
point with it has nowhere to go to point outside
of itself so if you sort of imagine a basketball
how can a basketball point to itself well it can't
because it needs to have a hand with a finger
to reach outside of it to point to itself that
means the basketball has to be here the hand has
to be outside of it and also there needs to
be a space for the hand to reach out plus
the hand needs to be able to curve back to
point to itself so the basketball because it doesn't have
that it just is itself it needs to realize that
it just is itself in the same way that you
need to realize that you are just existence itself the
substance of everything is itself and it couldn't be anything
else what else could the substance be but it self
this is what the materialist doesn't understand the materialists always
thinks that the substance needs to be something else but
that's something else is itself a substance that needs to
be explained and so on forever and the material just
gets tired with this whole chain of reasoning he just
says well we don't know it's just a mystery it's
just one of those questions you can't answer it's one
of those philosophical riddles that have been asked for for
millennia and no one knows the answer no they do
know the answer just drop the materialist paradigm and realize
that the substance of everything is itself which means that
everything is nothing something and nothing are identical finitude is
identical to infinity self is identical to God the ultimate
irony the ultimate tragedy is that if any human mind
should have gotten this it should have been Douglas Hofstadter
he's a brilliant thinker he's not just a logician he's
just not he's not just a left brain thinker he's
highly intuitive and right brained but nevertheless even him he
got voice hoisted by his own petard he got tricked
by his own mind because the reality of strange loops
is that they are so goddamn strange that you can't
wrap your mind around it and what's really funny and
tragic is that actually in girl Escher and both Hofstadter
talks about Zen he actually cites Zen teachings as examples
of paradox and strange loopiness but what he never got
is what the Zen teachings are actually pointing to the
Zen teachings are pointing to exactly what I'm talking about
they're pointing to the fact that existence itself is a
strange loop and the reason if you ever wonder why
a Zen master talks in riddles and is confusing the
hell out of you is because there no way he
can point to existence itself as being nothing because the
thing he's pointing with is the thing you need to
get so every single word he says misleads you because
that's the nature of language it cannot grasp being and
that's something that Hofstadter came this close to understanding but
he didn't get all the way I would really love
for him to grasp it one day before he's dead
that would be amazing that would tie a nice little
bow around all that this life's work but sadly I
don't think you'll ever get there because of the materialist
paradigm he even has a chapter in his book called
I am NOT God which shows that he doesn't understand
that I and God are the same thing and so
the tragedy of Hofstadter's work is that as beautiful as
it is as poetic as it is as much effort
energy as he's poured into it his entire career went
into this this is his entire life's work into understanding
this stuff into explaining it and communicating to the masses
and he's done a pretty good job of that that
he himself has never gotten to the heart of the
issue and I am here to help you to avoid
that mistake that's how dangerous the materialist paradigm is doesn't
matter how intelligent you are doesn't matter how many phd's
you have doesn't matter how good of a scientist you
are none of that matters if you cannot grasp the
paradoxical nature of being nothing can substitute for that and
no one can do that for you but yourself this
is one of those things that's just so obvious that
it's too obvious to be communicated it's like if you
can't get that one plus one equals two if your
mind can't broke that then you can't do mathematics you're
stuck at square one you failed on the very first
step and it's the same thing with understanding being if
you cannot grasp being directly by being it that's it
you're done you're done you're lost in concepts forever let
me return to the image of the Ouroboros because actually
I didn't tell you the real depth behind the Ouroboros
the Ouroboros is an ancient ancient symbol it's one of
the most ancient symbols that we have that survives from
prehistory the earliest example that we have of the Ouroboros
actually goes back to the tomb of King Tut 14th
century BC found in the book of the netherworld that
was found in this tomb and there you see the
symbol of the serpent eating its own tail here what
you see is you see an example not from King
Tut's tomb but you actually see an example from Cleopatra
The Alchemist this is 3rd century AD Egypt so this
is much later than King Tut by wish I mean
more recent to our time and that's the actual symbol
that Cleopatra the alchemists drew and you see those letters
and words on the inside what does it say guess
what do you think it says it says all is
one this is the symbol for the ultimate strange loop
this isn't just a snake biting its own tail this
is the explanation for the cause and origin and substance
of all of reality in this one little symbol and
mankind has known about this since the very beginning since
before we can even record history King Tut knew about
this and many of his predecessors before him and of
course it's no accident that the serpent and the Serpent's
tail that these symbols have been used not only in
ancient Egypt but also for depicting Kundalini energy in Hinduism
which also goes back many thousands of years maybe as
far back as 5000 years ago or even further it's
been used as a symbol agnosticism it's been used in
alchemy and of course all of these are mystical traditions
which all recognize absolute infinity and the nature of reality
as being non-dual where all distinctions collapse where reality is
identical to illusion where the self is identical with God
where matter is identical with energy where the subject is
identical with the object where good is identical with bad
where everything is one where something is nothing and this
explains the origin of everything and also what I want
to show you is this strange loop image from John
Archibald wheeler so we go from ancient Egypt all the
way to modern times to the 20th century John Archibald
wheeler was a a brilliant modern day physicist who worked
post Einstein and post the development of quantum mechanics and
he was a very seminal physicist who worked on quantum
theory and also general relativity theory and cosmology and he
made very important discoveries and also coined many concepts for
example he coined the concept of black hole he coined
the concept of quantum foam he'd coined the concept of
wormhole so he was a very influential physicist he actually
died not too long ago just ten years ago he
died but this guy understood the nature of reality because
what I'm showing you here is I'm showing you an
image that he drew in one of his papers where
he was talking about the interesting and paradoxical situation which
we see in quantum mechanics where we see this problem
is that when you're measuring particles subatomic particles within quantum
mechanics the observation of the particle effects the result of
the experiment and this was something that boggled many quantum
mechanics mechanist minds for a long time they could understand
how to work around this this problem and here John
Archibald wheeler he he drew the situation in this sort
of strange loopy fashion as the universe developing this eyeball
looking back at itself and he has some brilliant quotes
here's one quote that he said he said space-time tells
matter how to move and matter tells space-time how to
curve that's a strange loop for you right there about
general relativity he went on to say something really amazing
which people don't really appreciate today when asked what is
the ultimate nature of reality he basically said that all
of reality is not physical but information let me quote
to you from him he said quote every particle every
field of force even space-time the space-time continuum itself derives
its function its meaning its very existence entirely from the
apparatus elicited answers to yes or no questions binary choices
or bits bits of information it from bit symbolizes the
idea that every item of the physical world is at
bottom a very deep bottom in most instances an immaterial
source and explanation that which we call reality arises in
the last analysis from the posing of yes/no questions and
the registering of equipment evoke responses in short that all
things are physical are actually information theoretic in origin and
that this is a participatory universe and quote so what
he's saying there is that observation creates reality literally there
is no reality there is nothing physical there is only
information and what is information but appearances which have no
substance something which is literally nothing he got it but
see the materialist paradigm is so deep and so stubborn
that even when people working within the materialist paradigm like
many of the fathers of quantum mechanics for example when
they do their tests and get their results and they
show you and they tell you that everything at root
is nothing that still doesn't register up the chain and
it still doesn't really get people to reevaluate their materialism
so people will believe in quantum mechanics but they will
still be materialists at heart which is the ultimate absurdity
the ultimate irony because in the last hundred years your
own science has shown to you that science defeats itself
that materialism defeats itself that ultimately everything boils down to
nothing there are no atoms there are no subatomic particles
there are just wave functions there are fields and what
our fields and wave functions there are nothing they're literally
nothing that's what your science tells you and yet you
still go around touting science as a defence of materialism
no you just haven't grasped the deep consequences the profound
consequences of what mankind has discovered in the last hundred
years even many quantum mechanic scientists and physicists and cosmologists
do not get this because there's a difference between doing
science experiments crunching numbers and actually being able to grasp
the nature of being these are two radically different things
just because you can write a PhD paper just because
you can do some number crunching and you can get
a professorship does not mean you understand the ultimate nature
of being it means you're very good at shuffling cymbals
around and you're very good at describing one thing in
terms of another thing but you never get to the
rock bottom of anything that's the tragedy of it that's
the tragedy of science and materialism is that it's missing
the thing that's right under its nose I personally realized
all this when I realized that everything is nothing in
me out of itself I drew a little picture which
I want to show you here this image was just
sheared into seared into my mind from the sheer magnitude
of the discovery that I made for myself and the
image was of a cat playing with a ball of
yarn except I was the cat and I was made
of the very same yarn that I was playing with
so see this cat innocently naively ignorantly plays with the
ball of yarn not realizing that the ball of yarn
circles back around and constitutes the very cat itself such
that if you ever truly unravel the entire ball of
yarn you will ultimately unravel yourself because the self and
the world are all the same thing they're always connected
because that's what it means to say that reality is
one see the notion of reality includes any other thing
that could possibly be outside itself as soon as you
say oh but there's something outside reality the notion of
reality expands to include that thing so the concept of
reality is a very interesting concept unlike most concepts and
that it's so flexible that it has to capture everything
you see it's a catch-all container for everything that's why
it must be one because by definition anything outside of
it is it it expands to include that thing and
so on and so on and so on and so
on which means that it is infinite tada you are
the cat playing with the ball of yarn not realizing
that the ball of yarn is actually yourself when it
comes to existence itself paradox is not a bug paradox
is a feature this should actually be intuitively obvious if
you're a right brain thinker and you're not overly attached
to any kind of ideological position like materialism or rationalism
it should be intuitively obvious to you because after all
we're trying to answer the mother of all chicken-and-egg problems
which is how did something come out of nothing how
come there's something at all when there could be nothing
when you're gonna answer that question you should Intuit that
the answer will be a strange loop that the answer
will be a mindfuck that'll be paradoxical as hell because
you cannot talk about the most fundamental aspects of reality
without contradicting yourself this is not a mistake contradiction is
not a mistake here it's a necessary feature because the
thing you're talking about is itself part of the thing
that we're seeking to explain you as the being who's
conscious of the universe is talking about the universe but
you must include yourself in the universe to explain yourself
you see the hand doing the grasping must itself be
grasped and that cannot be done with grasping the hand
cannot grasp itself it can only be itself so what
you need to become conscious off is the being directly
directly is completely direct there's no way there is no
chain leading up to it it is itself the ultimate
strange loop is a loop that's so loopy that it
just is itself it doesn't have room to band back
around it's such a loop that it just is like
a dot imagine a loop as a dot that would
be the most concise articulation of a strange loop is
just a dot a point a singularity that's what all
this is an infinite singularity but the only way to
grasp that is to literally become the singularity to become
the point you cannot grasp the singularity by reaching outside
of it because you're reaching outside is it so no
matter how much reaching you do with science with logic
with reason with evidence with proofs with talking with thinking
with symbolizing with testing all of that is the thing
that needs to be grasped and the talking about it
isn't the same thing as it you see so let
me guide you now through a little imagination exercise to
really try to get you to grasp this so what
you're gonna see on the screen here you're gonna see
one of these strange loops that I've shown you before
and it's animated it's moving and it's mesmerizing and you
can see how it twists in on itself and this
is a beautiful structure but now what I want you
to do is I want you to extend this metaphor
a little bit more into a little bit closer to
what it's ashli like what I want you to realize
is that this strange loop right before your eyes right
now is missing two components to make it total the
components that it's missing is that notice this strange loop
is separated right now from its background see so there's
a black background and the thing is twirling around now
what I want you to do is I want you
to imagine this of object but that it also isn't
different from its background the background and the object must
be one they must loop into each other so imagine
that there is no separation between the background and this
looping object imagine that and finally you must involve yourself
you as the one looking at the object right now
you are looking at this strange loop and there is
a separation there between you and it so now what
I want you to do is I want you to
make the final leap the final involution where you involved
the background into the object great now involve yourself as
the perceiver of G object into the object so that
the object the background and yourself are all identical one
happening simultaneously right now through no method through no mechanism
through no process and that that whole thing both exists
and does not exist simultaneously everything is itself with nothing
left over and it is pure magic and if you
can accomplish that feat right there then that will be
enlightenment but it's one thing to imagine it it's another
thing to accomplish it can you actually accomplish it can
you actually become that object that you're seeing on the
screen can you actually merge that object's existence with its
non-existence its foreground with this background can you dissolve every
single duality to get to a singularity if you can
you will realize the ultimate truth of all of existence
and you will see that everything that you see around
you is pure magic God is not something to be
found out there in the clouds somewhere God is not
an avatar God is this right here everything you're seeing
this you're inside of God right now this right here
is pure magic pure divinity everything around you is divinity
the problem is that you're not conscious of it because
you take it for granted because you're ignoring the completely
obvious because it's such a deep mind that it has
to unravel you in the process you cannot accomplish what
I'm saying here without the complete unraveling of yourself because
there is no such thing as a self because there
is just the one and right now you think of
yourself as not the one you think of yourself as
a little one amidst all this other crap that's the
bottom line so I hope you can see why this
concept of the strange loop is so important it's important
for many reasons it's important because it's just deeply fascinating
and beautiful like Escher's Arendt worked it's important because it
gets to the fundamental nature of all in reality it
is a mandatory feature of existence without this feature there
could be nothing well there is nothing you see but
our language is dualistic so it's hard for me to
articulate what I really mean there this concept of it
is important because it shows the limitations of logic a
lot of people who are stuck on Logic are afraid
of strange loops for good reason for very good reason
because strange loops will destroy as girdle's incompleteness theorem has
done since the 1930s it's important because it shows the
paradox that paradox cannot be avoided when you're talking about
the most fundamental things this concept is very helpful and
necessary to understand what existences it's important to understand this
if you're contemplating if you're self inquiring if you're meditating
if you're studying non-duality and if you're trippin I highly
recommend that if you're gonna do a trip it's like
a Nellie trip I mean that Yuri watch this episode
before your trip and then you go trip don't watch
it during watch it before right before and then go
trip and then notice how much deeper your trip will
be try to contemplate what a strange loop is as
you're tripping holy your mind will be blown your mind
will be blown to smithereens you will get so thoroughly
mind that it will be the best thing that's ever
happened to you if you care about understanding reality if
you don't if you care about protecting your ego and
you care about defending your paradigms then well you're gonna
be in for quite the mind-fucking and it's probably gonna
be quite a painful experience for you but if you're
open if you're willing to surrender if you really want
to know what's true it'll be the most beautiful thing
you've ever got in your life and your life will
never be the same from that point on see what
our culture doesn't tell you is that our culture is
scared to death of paradox of strange loops and of
self reference this is true in science it's true and
logic it's true in mathematics it's true in politics it's
true across every field of society because the only way
the Eagle can survive is by lack of self reflection
because self reflection leads to the collapse of everything that
is why paradoxes and contradictions are outlawed from logic by
Fiat not because they don't belong there they are at
the very core and center of logic without paradox and
contradiction there could be no logic but they are dismissed
and discounted and demonized because they literally threaten the collapse
of all of reality more on that in the future
when I shoot my episode about girls incompleteness theorem we're
all going to deeper depth about that but that's it
for now I hope you liked it hope you enjoyed
the pictures please click that like button for me if
you did and come check out actualized org look at
my book list there's a lot of amazing and important
books on my book list for you to read to
wrap your mind around all this stuff check out my
life purpose course chat on our forum there's a lot
of cool stuff happening on the forum it's been very
active lately come look at my blog I'm posting a
lot of my most advanced insights on the blog these
days so you want to make sure you're up to
date with those and then just stick to stay tuned
with more actualized dialog episodes every single week watch one
every single week the topics you will notice are getting
more and more amazing and more and more profound and
we are still only just scratching the surface of where
this content is going to go in the next few
years actualized org will be about personal development but also
personal development and also understanding the deep deep big picture
of life and don't worry I'm not just gonna be
talking about metaphysical topics from now on I'm still gonna
have a lot of very practical topics we're gonna circle
back around talking about emotions we're gonna talk about spiral
dynamics we're gonna talk about very practical things and various
techniques we're still gonna cover all that stuff right now
I'm just in this phase where I want to play
off some this metaphysical stuff to kind of test the
waters to see how you guys are receptive to this
if you're into it so in the future it's gonna
be a combination of all that plus we're gonna be
talking about society we're gonna talking about ecology we're gonna
be talking about government we're gonna talking about corruption we're
gonna be talking about history all this stuff is gonna
be all intertwined because ultimately what actualize that are what
aims to do is not just help you to improve
your personal life but to help you to understand everything
there is to understand about life at the highest highest
highest most holistic levels and this is something that is
quite rare you don't generally see this in personal development
virtually at all and you don't see it within science
you don't see it within history you don't see you
within government you don't see it within mainstream culture you
don't see it anywhere because the whole point of the
absurdity of the ego and the way that it lives
is that it fractures everything it's the opposite of holistic
science is fractured government is fractured education is fractured personal
development is fractured it's all fractured because that serves the
purposes of the self the purposes of the ego because
that makes it easy to escape the truth the only
way you get the truth is holistically so stay tuned
to see that whole picture come together it has not
come together yet there's still so many more fundamental topics
so many cornerstones we need to put into place to
be able to erect this giant structure to see it
all and then of course you have to follow it
up and contemplate and pursue it in your own life
you
