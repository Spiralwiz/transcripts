            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Dw44V15xgPo' target='_blank'>What Is Consciousness - All Questions Answered</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Consciousness as a fundamental entity</b>: Leo Gura contends that consciousness is a fundamental and indispensable constituent of the universe, preceding even atoms, energy, and life itself. Such a stance challenges the mainstream materialist paradigm that considers reality to be composed of matter or energy.
</li><li><b>Critique of neuroscience's approach to consciousness</b>: Gura criticizes neuroscience for its limited perspective. He asserts that neuroscience operates within consciousness and thus struggles to fully comprehend it. Out of its foundational premises, neuroscience considers consciousness as a secondary or tertiary emergence from physical realities, which Gura deems incorrect.
</li><li><b>Non-dual perception of consciousness</b>: Gura posits that consciousness is inherent to everything in existence, implying a non-dualistic perspective. This frame of understanding refutes the conventional view of reality as separate objects and beings, suggesting instead that all reality, including the universe, is a manifestation of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as 'nothing'</b>: Gura adopts a rather paradoxical stance that consciousness is 'nothing' but not in terms of non-existence. Unlike Daniel Dennett's view that consciousness is an illusion, Gura proposes that consciousness is existence itself, albeit without attributes or content. This proposition equates to understanding consciousness as the 'substrate' or 'substance' of everything else in existence.
</li><li><b>Consciousness versus mind</b>: He warns against the tendency to conflate the mind with consciousness. Instead, Gura asserts that consciousness is not exclusively connected to the mind, reason, or intellect. He proposes that it transcends subjective experiences, personal identities, and spatial-temporal realms.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and the reversal of conventional views</b>: Gura argues that versatility in its attribute-less state allows consciousness to foster all possible realities. This suggests an inversion of ordinary views, where objects appear within consciousness, not the other way round. Therefore, understanding consciousness necessitates a paradigm shift in thinking, replacing the materialistic perception and embracing the view that all reality is a manifestation of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as a universal concept</b>: Gura believes that consciousness is not restricted to human beings or individual entities but is a universal, space-time transcending phenomenon. This understanding, although difficult for materialists, rationalists, and scientists to accept, portrays the whole universe itself as conscious, contrasting the more common view of the universe being a mere assembly of inert molecules.
</li><li><b>Relevance of understanding consciousness</b>: Grasping the essence of consciousness is heralded as a profound essential in life according to Gura. Going by his high regard for this subject in personal introspection, Gura reveals that understanding consciousness confers a deeper comprehension of oneself, reality, and existence at large
</li><li><b>Materialist paradigm challenge</b>: In this new perspective, he challenges the materialistic paradigm that views life as identifiable objects moving in presumable random patterns, where consciousness is just an emergent phenomenon out of these complex movements. This point implies a recognition of reality that exhibits intelligence rather than being just a mechanical system.
</li><li><b>Consciousness Is Not Localized</b>: Leo Gura expresses that consciousness does not exist within a specific location, such as inside a brain, but is universal and encompassing the entire universe. He presents the idea of the universe as a single giant mind in which all objects and realities exist as products of imagination.
</li><li><b>Questioning Conventional Reality</b>: The conventional view, heavily influenced by rationalist and materialist perspectives, supposes reality to be "dumb" and devoid of consciousness. Gura challenges this view, asking why reality couldn't start out "smart" or conscious.
</li><li><b>Reconceptualizing Consciousness</b>: Instead of seeing yourself as a human being with consciousness, Gura encourages a shift in perspective where you perceive yourself as the universe itself being conscious. He underscores the necessity of this recontextualization for understanding consciousness.
</li><li><b>Infinite Clay Analogy</b>: Gura presents a metaphor where consciousness is compared to an infinitely adaptable clay, taking on various forms and colors without any inherent properties of its own. This infinite clay is described as the ultimate shape-shifter and the substance from which all reality is crafted.
</li><li><b>Challenging Materialist Paradigm with Pure Software Concept</b>: He criticizes the popular analogy of consciousness as software running on the hardware of the brain. Instead, he suggests that consciousness is pure software that can exist independently of any hardware, further challenging the materialist paradigm and reinforcing the idea of a universe that is pure software floating in nothingness.
</li><li><b>Addressing the Mind-Body Problem</b>: Gura addresses the philosophical mind-body problem, which questions how the mind (or consciousness) can arise out of physical matter (like neurons in the brain). He asserts that there is only mind and that the body is simply a feature of the mind, illustrating the concept that the universe is composed purely of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Transcending Material Paradigm</b>: Leo suggests that a shift from the materialist paradigm to a consciousness paradigm, where consciousness is seen as the underlying essence of all existence, offers a more holistic understanding of reality. He emphasizes that consciousness is not an empty void but a living, self-aware, intelligent entity.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Quintessence</b>: Leo Gura articulates that everything is consciousness, as he experienced in a profound moment of realization. Everything he interacted with, like a book, his hand, and even inanimate objects, appeared to be pure consciousness. Gura explains that consciousness is the underlying essence behind everything, referred to as 'quintessence' by the ancients. This quintessence is not empty physical space or non-existence, but rather nothingness that is self-aware, alive, intelligent, and requires a shift from the materialist paradigm to understand.
</li><li><b>First-Order and Second-Order Reality</b>: According to Gura, in the materialist scientific paradigm, first-order reality consists of atoms, energy, the universe, the body, and the brain. Second-order reality consists of perceptions, emotions, and the mind, which are considered emergent phenomena that don't truly exist. In the dream paradigm, the mind, or mind space, is the first-order reality, and the contents of the dream are the second order. Meanwhile, in the non-dual paradigm, first-order reality is consciousness, and the second-order reality is everything else existing within consciousness.
</li><li><b>Self-Referential Problem with Consciousness</b>: Gura explicates that consciousness cannot be pointed to or grasped with words, concepts, or intellect as it holds all these pointers within itself, proving to be a classic self-reference problem. This phenomenon creates strange loops: it is experienced as what one is, yet cannot be pointed out, explained, or fully known outside consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Futility of Creating Models of Consciousness</b>: He argues that scientists attempting to model consciousness will never succeed because consciousness itself is fundamental and without substitute. Efforts to understand consciousness through intelligence, beliefs, knowledge, or intuition are flawed because these concepts exist within consciousness itself. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Unexplained Substance</b>:To the frequently asked question 'What is consciousness made out of?', Gura suggests that consciousness is not made out of anything else; it is the first-order reality, the substance of all things including knowledge, intuition, beliefs, and intelligence. It is not created from something else, it is the essence from which everything else emerges. The nature of consciousness is self-awareness, intelligence, and life.
</li><li><b>Consciousness constructed out of itself</b>: Leo Gura makes an argument that consciousness is self-made, comparing it to the most fundamental building blocks of reality, such as atoms or quarks. This "rock bottom" in which consciousness is situated is described as nothingness, and this nothingness is existence itself. This proposition bypasses the traditional views of materialism or atoms being the basis of existence and replaces it with consciousness as fundamental.
</li><li><b>Effect of brain damage on consciousness</b>: Gura discusses the common question of how consciousness can be lost if the brain is damaged. He clarifies that the damage is not to consciousness itself but to the content within consciousness. Using a Lego block analogy, consciousness equates to the Lego blocks, and the brain or our understanding of self equates to the structure built from these blocks (like a Lego castle). When we damage the brain, we are damaging the structure, not the raw material. Hence it does not destroy consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness without a brain</b>: Contrary to the materialistic paradigm, Gura suggests that consciousness doesn't require a physical brain, indicating that brain-consciousness relationships are far more complex and less understood than is traditionally believed. It challenges the assumption that consciousness is produced by the brain.
</li><li><b>Losing consciousness during sleep</b>: Gura addresses the question of why we lose consciousness during sleep, saying it does not refute the idea of a conscious universe. He asserts this perceived loss of consciousness during sleep is due to our identification with the physical body/mind (using the Lego Castle analogy again). When going to sleep, it's as if the castle disassembles, leaving only the fundamental blocks (consciousness), which might seem like non-existence, but it's pure existence.
</li><li><b>Limited consciousness of other minds</b>: Gura argues that individual minds can be seen as distinct 'rooms' within the grand 'house' of universal consciousness, using the metaphor of a Lego house with different rooms. Despite being part of the same interconnected whole (consciousness), individual minds might seem separate due to artificial 'boundaries and walls' constructed by our mind. This distinction helps explain why one might not be aware of or have access to other minds.
</li><li><b>Possibility of consciousness in objects</b>: Leo Gura questions the assumption that objects like rocks and computers cannot be conscious. He suggests that while these objects exist within consciousness, they are not conscious themselves. However, he does not entirely rule out the possibility of objects becoming self-aware in a certain context.
</li><li><b>Consciousness, Identity, and Interconnectedness</b>: The understanding of consciousness requires a shift in perspective, seeing all objects as existing within consciousness rather than consciousness arising from them. Our mind constructs artificial boundaries, distinguishing between different spaces like rooms in a house, when in actuality, it's all one interconnected space. This concept extends to consciousness and our sense of identity, where we exist as part of a greater interconnectedness, rather than being isolated within individual selves.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Matter</b>: Matter doesn't exist independently of consciousness or affect consciousness; both matter and consciousness are the same, interacting within themselves. They are not separate entities but different manifestations of the same reality. This perspective contradicts traditional views, as it underscores that existence is fundamentally mysterious; any attempts to 'demystify' or fully explain it only result from delusion or lack of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Existence and Non-Existence</b>: Consciousness is existence itself, and non-existence is merely a concept within existence. The question of why existence exists is invalid because the default state is existencethere's nothing but existence. Such insights become clear only when we become fully conscious of the nature of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Consciousness, Animals, and Rocks</b>: Consciousness didn't evolve in animals; animals (and their evolution) occur within consciousness. Objects like rocks, while existing within consciousness, are not conscious themselves. 
</li><li><b>AI and Self-Awareness</b>: Similarly, a computer, which is an occurrence within consciousness, can potentially become self-aware, implying that it develops an ego. If so, it would localize universal consciousness for itself, much like human beings do, leading to delusion.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Awareness</b>: 'Consciousness' and 'awareness' are often used interchangeably, meaning the same thing in most contexts. However, different teachings may use these terms differently. Therefore, it is essential to understand the context and distinction when studying various teachings.
</li><li><b>Beyond Consciousness</b>: There's nothing beyond consciousness, as consciousness is infinite and includes everything beyond itself. Any boundaries drawn between consciousness and 'not' consciousness are artificial as no such thing as 'not' consciousness exists.
</li><li><b>Neuroscience and Consciousness</b>: Current neuroscience is not entirely false or useless but requires a correction of its metaphysical foundations. Once neuroscience adopts non-duality, a paradigm shift will occur marking a revolution in the field. This shift might enable scientists to find ways to chemically or surgically induce enlightenment.  
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Indivisible and Infinite</b>: Every part or segment of existence, such as a house, consists of interconnected spaces with artificially constructed boundaries. Non-duality extends this concept to consciousness and awareness themselvesthey are not divisible or limited, but an infinite interconnected web within which all matter and beings exist. This understanding also applies to artificial intelligences and computer systems, which, like everything else, exist within the greater consciousness. However, their awareness or consciousness arises only when they develop an identity or ego, thus reinforcing Leo Gura's point about identity originating from the mind's artificial constructions.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Brain's Relationship with Consciousness</b>: The brain is in a strange loop relationship with consciousness, reality, and perception. Untwining this strange loop is a challenge that science aims to handle. 
</li><li><b>Becoming More Conscious</b>: To raise consciousness, one can use methods like yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, psychedelics, and contemplation. These methods should be practiced with discipline, focus, and concentration.
</li><li><b>Different Levels of Consciousness</b>: Consciousness can be discussed in terms of different levels. While in the absolute sense, consciousness is one and there are no levels, categorizing it into levels can be useful from a relative perspective. 
</li><li><b>Synonyms for Consciousness</b>: Different words can refer to the same entity consciousness, including awareness, infinity, reality, god, emptiness, void, Brahman, awakeness, absolute, and being. These words may point to different facets of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Levels of Consciousness Affect Actions and Emotions</b>: A person's level of consciousness affects their actions and emotions. Higher consciousness levels can lead to kindness and love, while lower consciousness levels may lead to selfishness.
</li><li><b>Altered States of Consciousness</b>: There are many different types of altered states of consciousness that can be the result of different practices. Consciousness can be raised dramatically, potentially leading to a vastly different perceived reality. 
</li><li><b>Continued Pursuit of Higher Consciousness</b>: There's always room for further growth in the journey towards higher consciousness. Experiences like meditation retreats or psychedelics can significantly raise consciousness levels and deepen the understanding of philosophical and metaphysical concepts.
</li><li><b>Increase of Consciousness is The Goal</b>: Every video produced by Actualized.org aims to help viewers increase their consciousness. Achieving higher levels of consciousness is presented as the most worthwhile pursuit.
