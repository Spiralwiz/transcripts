hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about overcoming subtle addictions [Music]
addictions are bogging you down taking up all your time
so you have no room left for personal development work
that becomes a big problem in this episode what I
want to do is I want to help you to
draw a distinction between gross and subtle addictions now I've
released an episode in the past called overcoming addiction which
talks mostly about gross addictions the stuff that we would
conventionally think of as addictions the bad stuff that bad
habits and I talked about some of the root causes
of that and sort of solutions so definitely check that
out that's a foundational episode here we're going to do
like a part two and now we're going to get
into the more tricky and the more subtle stuff which
is still very important because you need to free up
room so that you can do all the other work
like meditation journaling contemplation self inquiry and all that other
good stuff to actually get the results from self actualization
that you want to see but first let's ask the
question what is an addiction it's something that you do
repeatedly which has negative consequences which leads to overconsumption and
feelings of low consciousness dirtiness guilt and regret it's painful
to stop doing it because it creates withdrawal symptoms and
cravings and then this activity becomes like a crutch which
gets you stuck in this loop that you can't stop
and this loop is an escape from legitimate suffering and
growth which is why we need to focus on addiction
so much here and it reduces your freedom and your
ability to become aware and awareness is really the key
to all growth so you can see how this addiction
all these addictions whether they're gross ones are subtle ones
they're like ropes tying your hands behind your back and
then you can't really do anything with your life also
these addictions break your integrity they disconnect you from your
higher self your highest values and the pursuit of your
full potential in life and it's something that you hide
and you're not proud of so that right there in
a nutshell is what defines an addiction now let's talk
about gross versus subtle this distinction by a gross addiction
I mean the obvious stuff so of course junk food
of course drugs of course alcohol television video games coffee
your phone internet porn sex gambling shopping this kind of
stuff a lot of these our culture recognizes as addictions
okay but some people set the bar so low that
to them half the stuff that I listed they don't
even consider as an addiction for example coffee or food
they might think of junk food as an addiction but
like when they think of junk food they think of
like the worst of the worst of the worst kinds
of food but then they don't recognize that even their
normal everyday healthy food is actually still very addictive in
very toxic and the same goes with your internet usage
and so forth so the bar has been set very
very low in our society and we need to raise
the bar so of course all these growth addictions are
very dilatory as to your efforts to self-actualize they will
stop you dead in your tracks take up take up
all your time all your energy and then what can
you really do to grow after that if you're hooked
on dad food drugs internet alcohol TV games and all
this kind of stuff so obviously you need to be
quitting this stuff obviously but then there's a lot of
subtle stuff that you're probably not even aware of is
a problem and these subtle addictions are tricky because they're
less tangible they're more conceptually based rather than chemically or
physiologically based so food drugs these are chemical addictions but
then you've got conceptual addictions which you shouldn't underestimate because
a conceptual addiction could be even harder to unwire that
chemical one and one of the reasons that is is
because these subtle addictions are not culturally recognized as such
and so they seem normal because your friends and your
family are doing it your entire culture is engaging in
this and so it's just you're like a fish and
water you don't see it and it's easy for your
mind to rationalize it away and these subtle addictions can
even appear to be good some people will watch television
and then convince themselves that hey this is actually good
for me and television I consider a gross addiction the
subtle ones are really tricky it's very easy to trick
yourself into thinking that the subtle addictions are good also
it's hard to see the damage of these subtle addictions
whereas with drugs and with food you can feel really
bad you can see yourself putting on weight so that's
more obvious whereas with these subtle addictions the damage is
spread out across time so you don't quite notice it
and you could be doing it for years and years
and years and not really see what's happening also the
federal addictions are so abstract that a lot of times
you don't know how to get your hands around it
or what you should even do to stop it for
example with food with drugs with television it's pretty obvious
we understand what needs to happen to stop these you
just stop taking the food stop taking the drugs turn
off the TV but with the subtle addictions it's not
like that you don't really know what to do to
stop it for example if you're addicted to love or
approval or you're addicted to arguing or to judging how
do you go about stopping that a lot of these
are deeply ingrained habits of your mind and they're not
easy to stop at all and also the subtle additions
are tricky because it's hard for the mind to imagine
alternatives because you're so steep in this toxic culture that's
also addicted and all the media and advertising is feeding
into this addiction your mind can't see what your life
would look without this what would your life look like
if you never judged again or if you never argued
or debated again or if you never sought love or
approval from people ever again now we start to get
into a lifestyle which is very out of the ordinary
you probably don't have a lot of friends or family
members who live their life like this and you might
not even think that such things are possible because they're
so really outside your realm of possibility and that needs
to change of course if you want to if you
want to really grow to your highest potential that's one
of the things that really holds you back from your
highest potential is that you don't even know what your
highest potential could be but anyways what I want to
do is I want to get you a lot more
awareness around what all these subtle addictions could possibly be
so I have a lot of examples for you have
a list of over 40 different examples so let's get
going and I'll give you some commentary and some of
these are just self explanatory so being loved can be
an addiction and this one's very tricky because it seems
like a positive thing okay I love love what's wrong
with love love is a beautiful thing but it can
become toxic very easily when you need it when you're
attached to it when your whole sense of being and
your entire career or your entire relationship or marriage or
all your family life is all about being loved and
then you actually crave it when you don't get it
see then you're hooked on it judgment and criticism is
a big point of addiction for people and they don't
recognize it because our whole culture in the media in
the news in politics it's all about judging and criticizing
people you can even get a job where they pay
you millions of dollars to judge and to criticize others
and that's all you do without recognizing that you're addicted
to it you just also double down and made a
career out of it which is a which is a
real problem being right and proving others wrong can be
a serious addiction arguing and debating is a big addiction
that I see people falling into again this is one
of those where they they make entire careers out of
this not realizing they kind of cul-de-sac that era leading
themselves into as far as their fulfillment and their spiritual
development goes in a long run anger hatred and racism
these are addictions and at this point is actually one
of the seven deadly sins is wrath anger being moral
or good can be an addiction preaching to others can
become an addiction and this one's especially tricky because those
people who preach a lot to others and try to
change other people and up oftentimes just using as an
excuse not to really work on themselves and I've noticed
that a lot in myself because this is kind of
what I do is that I give a lot of
advice but I have to be very careful to make
sure that when I'm giving a lot of advice I
have to also be taking a lot of my own
advice too otherwise I get very painful ideology and pet
ideas can become very addictive this includes of course various
kinds of cults and religious ideologies but not just that
also political ideologies economic ideologies scientific ideologies or any kind
of pet theories you have about life it can become
very addictive and then you spend the rest of your
life playing these games or trying to defend or to
preach your ideology or argue and debate it and you
can waste a lot of time doing that while neglecting
your own growth getting attention and being liked which can
be suddenly different than the addiction to to love just
getting attention from school or being liked or being approved
of in the addiction arrogance or cockiness its kind of
attitude that some people take towards life or towards other
people this could be an addiction and actually this is
also one of the seven deadly sins it's called pride
Success work and career advancement this is a huge point
which tricks a lot of people some of our most
high-functioning members of the species are trapped in this addiction
success is very tricky because our culture really reinforces it
and mostly what our culture tells you about life is
at the point of life is to become super successful
and when you get a little bit of success that
opens you up to having more power to get more
success and so of course you chase it and you
get more and then of course people tell you hey
you're successful and you're like thinking okay well I should
become more successful and you just keep doing this in
this cycle never ends you can waste your whole life
chasing success and then not knowing why you're not fulfilled
with life and that's because you're addicted to success people
just can't put it down they're workaholics or they're trying
to advance their career at all costs that becomes a
problem money can be a point of addiction and money
is different than success because you can be successful and
not have a lot of money from stamps you can
be like a scientist or an author or something and
you're you're in it for at least you're trying to
do something like good with your career maybe help people
okay that's good even though that can still be an
addiction but money is just extremely shallow and some people
just get caught on this it's like they're looking for
the highest paying career they can get or getting money
through get-rich-quick schemes or the stock market or taking shortcuts
once you make money your top priority in life you're
really going down a cul-de-sac there it's only a matter
of time until something catastrophic happens their material possessions and
luxury can also become an addiction and this is different
than money because some people get addicted to surrounding themselves
with stuff fancy luxurious stuff fancy cars fancy houses you
know they'll spend a lot of time designing the interiors
of their houses and marble bathrooms and carpets and drapes
and all this kind of stuff and that becomes addictive
that's almost like the same as shopping addiction there's so
much cool stuff you want to buy and then you
go out and just spend the rest of your life
buying stuff and the more you buy the less satisfied
you feel because you can never you can never really
satisfy yourself with material possessions also collecting and hoarding is
another addiction that I see people having they will collect
coins stamps Barbie dolls Star Trek figurines and they'll get
very meticulous and perfectionistic about it where it's like they
got their little figurine that they bought on eBay for
a thousand dollars and they want to keep it in
pristine condition with all their other figurines and if anybody
comes in there and messes around with them and get
all upset at them so that's clearly an addiction security
can be an addiction and this one might come this
might come from for example if you grew up in
an insecure family you didn't have money or something else
you didn't have safety and now as an adult you
spend the rest of your time trying to get the
security whether it's security with your finances or security with
your career just you want to get into a situation
where you're completely safe and everything is known there's no
risks because that's something your psyche wants its addicted to
worry anxiety and fear these can be all very very
addictive negative self-talk can be an addiction and by negative
self-talk I don't just mean the words you say to
yourself in your internal voice but also the tone of
those words a lot of people don't even realize that
they're speaking themselves in this nasty harsh negative tone and
then how do you expect to fulfill on your dreams
with the with that kind of voice in your head
the past and old wrongs and feuds can be addictive
some people are really hung up on something that happened
to them in the past and they make their whole
future as a reaction against the stuff that happened in
the past and then they relive all the trauma or
whatever that happened in the past and then that becomes
an addiction technology can be an addiction and of course
I don't just mean TV Internet and your phone those
I consider gross addictions technology has also a subtle element
of addiction to it in that our culture right now
is very technology obsessed and people are always talking about
the newest technology and there's this whole expectation that's like
you have your newest phone and who has the best
gadgets did you get this gadget oh my phone is
a i phone age or yours is a 9 and
a 10 like these technology wars and then all these
gadgets are following the gadgets new gadgets come out and
everybody's hyping them up VR phones augmented reality whatever it
is self-driving cars you know this will just keep going
and going and going and going there's no end to
technology and then people get really hooked on this idea
that the whole point of life is technological progress without
realizing that no matter what level of technology you're at
it doesn't really change how you feel about your life
technology does not grow you and in many cases it
it just takes up a lot of your time and
attention which you need to do real interwork another addiction
is being efficient and being productive this is a very
tricky one because it seems like it's a great thing
to be efficient and productive and yet the more you
make your life about efficiency and productivity the more you're
actually missing the essence of life you're getting sucked out
of the present moment you're not really able to be
spiritual because you're lost in concept land thinking about how
to be more efficient at work more efficient in school
more efficient with your morning routine as you're brushing your
teeth you're trying to cut corners and do everything quickly
and returning a multitask and do all this kind of
stuff and I think a lot of very successful people
a lot of high-functioning people of our species fall into
this trap especially CEO types managerial it's entrepreneurial types of
people these types of people have a lot of potential
for self-actualization but they shoot themselves in the foot because
of this efficiency trap also min maxing a good example
this is with video games I used to play a
lot of video games if you play video games like
RPGs especially you know what I'm talking about with min
maxing it's this this idea of you have your RPG
character and you try to get all the stats perfect
you're trying to find what the best equipment is how
do you find the best loot and get everything skilled
up I get the most xp to get the the
highest character possible but now imagine that applied to your
actual life and you can see how how neurotic and
addictive that can be if you live your whole life
that way it's a it's a really inhuman way of
living life and you're guaranteed to be dissatisfied with that
competition and winning is an addiction for some people being
special or being the best is also an addiction prizes
awards achievements popularity and fame these can be all very
addictive and very distracting multitasking and distracting yourself multitasking is
a huge problem these days and I notice myself getting
addicted to just like try to do three or four
things at once rather than just sitting down and working
for four hours on some project that I have to
do I will work on it for 10 minutes then
I'll check the phone then I'll work on it for
30 minutes then I'll check the internet then I'll do
something else and I'll listen to an audio book while
I'm working on it and just becomes a mess and
this really hinders your ability to raise your awareness which
is the most important thing you can be doing with
your self-actualization and really kills you with meditation with your
concentration practice and inhibit self inquiry so there's a lot
of bad stuff that a multitasking does for you hell
being people and changing people can be very addictive some
people get hung up on this idea that they are
helper and that their role in life is to help
people and to improve people to change people and then
that becomes part of their whole identity and they're addicted
to it and then all that of course backfires because
they're not working on themselves family can be an addiction
companionship and being with people can be a big source
of addiction a lot of people can't stand to be
by themselves in solitude and so therefore they can't meditate
they can't contemplate they can't do a retreat and they're
always needing opinions from other people they need comrades to
support them otherwise they can't motivate themselves they can't be
effective just by themselves a good solution to this one
is to do some meditation retreats with asana retreats or
some solo retreats suffering can be an addiction asking drama
and self-sabotage in a very sick and twisted way your
suffering and gets so bad that you actually then want
more suffering and you in this very schizophrenic way you
want to escape the suffering but also you secretly want
the suffering - of course that perpetuates it control power
and getting things your way can be a big addiction
for people being negative whining and complaining is another one
victim mentality is another one where you start to think
to yourself how you can't change your life and everything
you're trying isn't working and it's failing and all the
advice you're getting isn't isn't any good and you can't
apply it to change yourself and it's too late and
all the limiting beliefs all that comes in there and
you start to feel very stuck thinking theorizing philosophizing and
speculating our big addictions almost everybody addicted to thinking and
over conceptualizing and it becomes especially a big problem when
you're trying to pursue spiritual development and enlightenment analysis is
another one people get really addicted to analysis and then
they try to serve all they try to solve all
the world's problems through analysis and then of course that
doesn't work boasting and showboating is another one and this
is also one of the seven deadly sins it's called
vainglory physical comfort can be an addiction this is really
interesting one where you start to get comfortable physically like
if you're a patient in a hospital and you've been
recuperating from surgery and you're lying in the bed for
a few weeks and you haven't been walking and then
you actually find it hard to just walk to get
a bed because you're so addicted to just being comfortable
laying in bed or sitting on the couch laziness and
procrastination of course turn into addictions laziness is like this
slippery slope that you get a little bit more lazy
which makes it easier to a little bit more lazy
and a little bit more lazy a little bit more
lazy and then you're sliding all the way down and
then the lower you go the harder it is to
get yourself out of it and this one is also
one of the seven deadly sins it's called sloth perfectionism
is an addiction I've sewed on that depending on others
to support you can easily become an addiction this one
on more women face than men but men can face
it too this one you might face if you're like
a college student who depends on your family maybe your
family is wealthy so you're depending on them to support
you and therefore you don't actually go out there and
learn how to provide for yourself you're like a lion
doesn't learn how to hunt and then you have to
go out into the wilderness that's a problem and if
you're a woman like a stay-at-home mom who's been taking
care of the kids for five or ten years and
then the kids are off at school and stuff and
now you go out there and get back in the
workforce but that's very difficult because you're dependent on maybe
your spouse supporting you and so you're stuck in the
laziness stuck in a rut physical appearance can be an
addiction it can be an addiction in two ways one
is that you can be addicted about your own physical
appearance and that's what you see with celebrities who are
really obsessed about and they get plastic surgery after plastic
surgery and again that's like a slippery slope that just
goes right down into hell they're never satisfied with their
own physical appearance and then physical appearance also with others
so some people just need everybody around them to be
beautiful especially their spouse or their girlfriend or their boyfriend
your Trump this is your trophy wife your trophy husband
kind of thing and then when your wife gets a
little bit older she's no longer beautiful to you anymore
so you run and go get a younger girl and
you just keep doing this over and over again negative
motivation can be an addiction a lot of people fall
into this trap and some of them actually can be
very successful but then they're miserable as hell because the
only way that they taught themselves that they can be
successful is by always being pressured from the outside by
dire circumstances or by pain this is the example of
you know the kid in school who gets the CEO
the month-long book report and then he spends 28 days
playing video games in the last two days when it
gets really painful that's when he can motivate himself to
write the book report of course usually doesn't come out
too great when you do it that way and even
if it does it's just miserable those last two days
are miserable and then some people learn to to approach
all of life that way including their career and their
business and other things and they will only really act
when they are squeezed and pressured into it by circumstances
and of course you can become moderately successful doing that
but you're never going to reach your full potential doing
that and you're never going to be able to use
that to become highly conscious and another way that people
do that is through guilt which can be an addiction
so guilting yourself about everything you're doing all over and
over again and then some people really get into that
especially some religious folks like the Catholics jealousy and envy
can be addictions I have an episode on how to
deal with jealousy jealousy is actually also one of the
seven deadly sins seeking newness excitement and fun and also
danger and adrenaline this can be an addiction gossiping and
bad-mouthing are talking behind other people's backs can be an
addiction cleanliness and order also can be addictive cheating stealing
taking shortcuts that's another interesting one and this one can
be very damaging and it's also very seductive once you
go down this road of cheating and stealing and you
get a little bit of success with that you're going
to want to do more of it taking shortcuts can
be very addictive you take a shortcut in your business
and it happens to work a little bit and then
you take another shortcut another shortcut and another shortcut and
then eventually you run your whole business in the ground
because you've been taking shortcuts or maybe you're taking shortcuts
with your personal development and that's not going to end
too well either lying manipulating and exploiting some people get
very addicted to this and this could be very seductive
because you can become a very good manipulator and you
can actually manipulate a lot of stuff a lot of
systems and people in the world and become very successful
and very famous doing that but then on the inside
it's like you're selling your soul to the devil as
you do this so from the outside people will think
you're doing great and you could easily trick yourself into
thinking you're doing great but actually you're becoming addicted to
manipulation and then you find that you don't even know
how to interact with the world in any other way
but to manipulate and exploit it mystical states can be
addictive especially once you get pretty good at meditation and
then you start to be able to tap into those
high consciousness States which feel really good but then you
get hooked on those and lastly hoarding knowledge can be
addictive reading books just for the sake of reading books
learning facts just for the sake of having fact using
knowledge to impress other people or just doing mental masturbation
learning a bunch of self-help theory but then not implementing
any of it or just doing some kind of armchair
philosophy so watch out for that one so that's a
list for you I'm sure you could find others as
well it should give you a really good sense of
what I mean by subtle addictions you see how some
of these you probably never thought about before as being
an addiction and some of them society really tells you
is good stuff like knowledge know when you're acquiring knowledge
people applaud you for that and rarely will someone tell
you hey maybe you're addicted to acquiring knowledge or maybe
you're addicted to success or maybe you're addicted to manipulation
now it's important to understand that the addiction is never
in the activity itself a lot of people get this
wrong and they think like well leo so just because
I lied that means now I'm an addict I'm a
lying addict and just because I cheated once or just
because i gossiped once that makes me an addict no
not at all an addiction is really a groove that's
been carved in your mind that's the addiction not the
activity just because you what lie once or twice here
or there or you cheat or you're chasing some money
a little bit in your life or your guilt tripping
yourself or you're a little bit perfectionistic in this situation
here okay that's fine that's not necessarily an addiction here's
a really easy way to tell that you're addicted stop
doing the thing in question for seven days and see
if cravings come up and you compulsively want to go
back and start doing it again if craving come up
that's your sign that you're addicted it's a really nice
clean little litmus test for you now of course the
million dollar question is how do we overcome all these
and what I want to do here is I want
to give you a general strategy because of course I
could give you specific strategies for all of them but
then that would require individual episodes and I do have
some episodes like I have an episode about perfectionism about
stopping being a workaholic jealousy and some other stuff but
here's a more general solution so with the subtle addictions
the trick with them is that you forget about them
very easily so today you have the intention to stop
overthinking but tomorrow you forget or a week later you
forget see it's very easy and you're not even sure
of all the ways in which you engage in the
subtle addiction so the first step is to apply a
lot of awareness to the situation you need to really
start to wash yourself like a hawk and to see
all the ways in which this addiction manifests and all
the costs and benefits that you get from it and
as you're doing that you also want to start to
contemplate and to journal about the root cause of your
addiction and here's how I recommend you do that so
select your one addiction that you want to focus on
let's say is something like what let's say is manipulation
so if you're addicted to manipulation then okay that's that's
the thing you're going to be contemplating now what you
want to do is you want to write down and
list all the ways in which you do manipulation and
take some time with this because you can actually go
back into your past and look for examples of how
you do this and the more you find to these
examples the better because that then gets you the awareness
you need to be able to see it in the
future the whole idea here is you want to be
able to to have the foresight to see it before
you actually start to engage in it in that will
alow require some so once you make this list then
ask yourself how is this core to my identity so
manipulation how is that an important integral part of my
identity it's not just something I do it's something that's
core to me it's serving a function it's really an
escape from something what am i escaping from then ask
yourself why do I need this why do I need
manipulation and really try to go as deep as you
can with that you might discover some weakness in you
some belief about yourself like you need to manipulate because
you think that deep down you're not capable of surviving
if you don't manipulate or you're not capable of getting
the love you want or need unless you manipulate it's
going to be something deep like that so trace it
down to its core and then ask yourself the question
what would an alternative look like what would an alternative
lifestyle look like without manipulation that's a very important question
because if you can't envision something how are you going
to work towards it and with addiction is especially important
because you can't just drop a negative addiction and leave
nothing in its place because that'll just create a vacuum
or a void which means that your old addiction will
come back and that's the problem like for example heroin
addicts face is that if you take a heroin addict
and you ask them well what's an alternative lifestyle to
this heroin addiction if you have and one of the
problems is going to be is that they can't even
imagine it because they're living in a whole their whole
lifestyles wrapped around this heroin addiction and when they think
about something like maybe hey maybe I'm going to ditch
this heroin addiction and to become like a yoga instructor
I'm going to become meditator and I'm going to follow
my life purpose I'm going to clean my life up
and I'm going to have a family and some kids
and all that like if they have that kind of
alternative idea placed in their head well first problem is
that they they won't even have that kind of idea
but even if they do they'll quickly dismiss it because
they'll see that no that's not nearly as good as
what I've got already my heroin lifestyle is way better
than that so you need to consider an alternative that
actually registers in your mind as a as a much
better alternative it has to have sort of pull -
it has to be compelling so what would be all
the alternative to a manipulative lifestyle and really carried out
through what would your life look like if you didn't
manipulate any more how many what kind of amazing lifestyle
could you build based on that foundation so that starts
to get you your vision and then ask yourself this
other key question which is could I let it go
could I let go of this core aspect of my
identity which is manipulation in this case could I let
it go and there's multiple levels at which you can
ask this question you can ask it at a superficial
level where it's like yeah I could let it go
in the same way that if I asked you yet
could you quit eating potato chips you could say yeah
I could eat quitting potato chips but then I could
ask you like no could you really let it go
not just the activity of it but could you let
go that part of your identity that's where a real
shift can happen is when you say to yourself you
know what I actually am willing to not just not
eat donuts anymore because I know they're bad and unhealthy
but like I can really let go of this mechanism
of using Donuts to fill this gap in my in
my being I could let that go that's a whole
nother level that's where real change can happen and be
honest with yourself if you're not willing to let it
go yet take a look what are the things that
are keeping you clinging to that thing you might say
you know what I'm not willing to let it go
my work is so stressful that I need to have
my cup of coffee and my doughnuts every single morning
you might think about it like that see and then
just keep thinking about ki Baskerville could I let it
go could I let it go just keep asking and
and thinking about that until eventually you reach the point
where you see that you don't need it that really
is just a baby blanket and that you can let
go of your baby blanket and when you do you
can envision that great stuff will come and then after
you do all this journaling and all this contemplating take
your time with it set the intention a strong and
clear intention that you are going to make this change
and intention is a powerful thing you set this intention
even when you don't know how yet you're going to
make it happen maybe you don't know how to quit
overthinking or you don't know how to quit being jealous
but you can get clear with yourself you can reach
a point where say you know what I'm just not
going to tolerate this jealousy anymore I'm setting the intention
to become a person who is not jealous and I
don't know how I'm gonna get there how long it's
going to take me I'm sure I'm going to have
my obstacles and my my moments where I still get
jealous sometimes but I'm just going to keep my intention
and that's a that's a very important element then what
you do is you get a wristband like this something
along these lines and you stick it on your wrist
and you wear it and you use it to help
you become more mindful and aware of all the instances
throughout the day and throughout the week of where you're
engaging in this subtle addiction with the subtle addictions is
very important because with eating clearly know when you've over
eaten but for example when you're manipulating most times you
don't know that you're manipulating when you're manipulating when you're
addicted to it so this thing here will help you
to see it and then what you got to do
is you got to start to look for it everywhere
in your life and it'll be sort of like you're
looking for a certain kind of car on the road
as soon as you set your filter for looking for
that kind of car you're going to see it everywhere
whereas before you never saw it ultimately what you're after
here is you're going to replace this baby blanket that
you've been carrying with just raw being just being that's
ultimately what all these addictions are trying to avoid in
your life is just being the presence of being and
the sort of simplicity of it you see being is
very simple and sort of mundane and it's not very
flashy most of the time and people don't like that
so they fill that void with all the addictions from
above if you really want to get a taste of
what being is like in its pure form try to
do a solo retreat like I've talked about in the
past where you just do 7 or 10 days of
a retreat all by yourself not talking to anybody not
distracting yourself with anything complete solitude and get back in
touch with yourself and face that emptiness within you and
then that will be really the root solution to too
many of these problems but nevertheless you still have these
habits ingrained in your mind so these Solo retreats what
they'll do is they'll put you in touch with being
in the sense that they'll give you a good preview
of what your life could be once you go through
and systematically over the years clean up all these diction's
don't try to clean up all these addictions at one
time it's not going to work this is a lifelong
project here so if you're even cleaning up just two
addictions per year that will that will quickly snow ball
and turn you into an amazing person and your life
will be amazing it'll feel amazing after a few years
of doing that ultimately the reason that you want to
remove all these addictions is so that you're free you're
liberated and you're undistracted and you have the time and
the energy and the awareness to get to work on
yourself and to get to work on all your dreams
on your life purpose on following through on your top
values that's what it's all about this is one of
the highest leverage things you can do to self actualize
and to change the quality of your life because most
people have so many of these addictions that from the
time they wake up in the morning to the time
they go to bed it's just a series of them
living out one addiction after another it's like addictive breakfast
then addictive work style then addictive phone addictive family life
addictive relationship a addictive launched addictive more work addictive emails
you know it's just like addiction to addictive entertainment and
then addictive dinner and it's just addictions from morning tonight
so we're in that schedule can you fit things like
meditating contemplating reading good books going to seminars etc you
can't you see you can't and that's one of the
reasons that most people can't really self actualize is because
there's just so stuck their schedule is just too full
so start opening that up and then you'll get a
lot more out of these videos alright that's it I'm
