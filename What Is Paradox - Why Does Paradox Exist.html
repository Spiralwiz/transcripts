[Music] what is paradox a few years ago i released
an episode called the metaphysical implications of google's incompleteness theorem
and i promised that that was part one and there's
gonna be a part two well i'm long overdue on
part two and this episode is in a sense part
two fulfilling on that promise in this episode we're going
to go deeply into the nature of paradox and how
it works and why it exists this is going to
be a profound explanation for the existential reasons behind paradox
if you understand what i'm saying here you will understand
why all paradox exists and why it must exist and
the profound implications this has for science for epistemology for
understanding what reality is and this is the kind of
information that you will not hear from any scientists or
materialist or academic so we're really expanding and deepening our
understanding and appreciation of paradox here now i hope that
like me you love paradox from a young age i've
always been fascinated by paradox i didn't find it ugly
i found it beautiful to me paradox is is one
of the greatest beauties of reality to explore paradoxes and
to see why they exist and why they occur and
if you want a little bit more about that to
get in touch with the beauty of paradox go watch
my other episode called reality is a strange loop where
i introduce the strange loop concept from douglas hofstadter and
i illustrate it with many beautiful examples visual examples so
actually funnily enough my love for paradox is ultimately what
led me to the realization of absolute truth it's through
paradox that you do this and it can do this
for you too which is why this episode is not
merely purely aesthetic or philosophical but actually has practical consequences
because what happens is that if you are serious about
pursuing and understanding paradox and you you track all paradoxes
down to the very root of what sources them what
you'll discover is that the source is absolute truth the
thing that you've been searching for the most beautiful thing
that you can discover and so paradoxes are in a
sense like glitches in the matrix that point you towards
absolute truth that's why this is practical unfortunately most minds
especially scientific minds skeptical minds rational minds atheistic minds find
paradox threatening there's a very good reason for why that
is which we will expand upon here but before we
get into all those details let's start off with the
basics what is paradox the oxford dictionary has the following
definition quote a paradox is a statement or proposition that
despite sound reasoning from acceptable premises leads to conclusion that
seems senseless logically unacceptable or self-contradictory end quote that is
essentially what it is but we need to explore more
deeply why this is the case where does paradox really
come from and also we need to explore western intellectual
traditions history with paradox how it struggles to deal with
paradox and the fear that exists within western mainstream intellectual
tradition surrounding paradox there's a deep seated fear there and
one of the principles like as a rule of thumb
that you should take with you in all of your
investigations of reality is that any time there's any fear
about some portion of reality whether it's a paradox of
some kind or some sort of scientific truth or religious
truth or any kind of thing like this uh that
fear actually is your best clue that something deceptive is
going on and that you should want to look deeper
under that fear because that fear is hiding something from
you and so sure enough western intellectual tradition has always
feared paradox and it's actively swept it under the rug
and the reason that is because paradox is very threatening
for rationality for science for materialism and for the entire
academic game that is being played in universities so that's
an abstract explanation of what's going on but now let's
get very specific about it here's the best example that
i found to illustrate this point and this is an
example from douglas hofstadter's other book called i am a
strange loop so i'm going to read you an extensive
quotation by the way this episode will have a lot
of quotations that i'll be reading so here we go
from hofstadter he's gonna explain this situation to us with
one example quote some years earlier russell had been struggling
to ground mathematics in the theory of sets which he
was convinced constituted the deepest bedrock of human thought but
just when he thought he was within sight of his
goal he unexpectedly discovered a terrible loophole in set theory
this loophole was based on the notion of the the
set of all sets that don't contain themselves a notion
that was legitimate in set theory but that turned out
to be deeply self-contradictory when set theory turned out to
allow self-contradictory entities like this russell's dream of solidly grounding
mathematics came crashing down on him this trauma instilled in
him a terror of theories that permitted loops of self-reference
since he attributed the intellectual devastation he had experienced to
loopiness and to loopiness alone in trying to recover then
russell working with his old mentor and new colleague whitehead
invented a novel kind of set theory in which a
definition of a set could never invoke that set and
moreover in which a strict linguistic hierarchy was set up
rigidly preventing any sentence from referring to itself when i
read about this theory of types it struck me as
a pathological retreat from common sense as well as from
the fascination of loops categorically banishing all loops of reference
struck me as such a paranoid maneuver that i was
disappointed for a lifetime with the one spit and twice
shy mind of bertrand russell what remained with me however
was the realization that some highly educated and otherwise sensible
people are irrationally allergic to the idea of self-reference or
of the structures or systems that fall back upon themselves
i suspect that such people's allergy stems in the final
analysis from a deep-seated fear of paradox or of the
universe exploding metaphorically end quote this beautiful passage by hofstadter
just perfectly encapsulates the point that i'm trying to make
and many rationally minded people still don't fathom the significance
of what is explained in this passage there is sort
of just the simple literal definition or the literal example
here the literal lesson of this example which is some
nerdy aspect of set theory and mathematics and logic which
to most people you might be wondering like leo what
does this matter how does this apply to my life
it doesn't matter at all yes that's a very nerdy
application of this issue but what i want you to
see is that we need to expand and learn a
broader deeper more universal lesson here from this one specific
instance with the failure of set theory and and this
is a lesson that has still not been learned by
most scientists by rationalists academics and materialists because they're still
playing this game of believing that they can ground reality
into some sort of formal logical symbolic system this is
impossible to do and if you want more about the
problems with that go watch part one of the series
which is the metaphysical implications of girdles and completeness theorem
i won't rehash all that here but suffice it to
say basically in a nutshell what happened was that historically
is that a hundred years ago most mathematicians logicians and
scientists and rationalists believed that they could actually completely ground
all of mathematics within something logical like set theory and
then paradoxes were discovered by bertrand russell and by kurt
gerdel and by alfred tarski and others that proved once
and for all that this is a fool's errand that
is impossible to achieve but rather than actually biting that
bullet and learning the lesson of like aha our whole
scheme here of trying to formalize and rationalize reality is
impossible and that we've been fools for trying to do
so rather than learning that lesson instead what most scientists
and academics did is they said ah well that just
means we have to reconfigure our symbolic systems to outlaw
the possibility of paradox and the way that that was
done is by forbidding self-reflection or self-reference and so the
whole the whole thing here the whole key to all
this hinges upon the idea of self-reference if a system
is capable of and allows for self-reflection or self-reference which
i explained in part one go go watch that for
a deeper understanding of what self-reference means and why it's
so important then that system will always ultimately contradict itself
and destroy itself or eat itself alive and of course
this is completely unacceptable to most scientists and logicians and
academics and so what uh what they do is they
they pull up a sleight of hand which is what
hofstadter is saying happened here with the one spitting twice
shy mind of bertrand russell and whitehead and others like
like them is that what they do is they say
okay how can we reconfigure our logical schemes to outlaw
self-reflection by fiat and by doing so we will prevent
paradox and self-contradiction and then it will seem to us
as though we have our formal systems and that our
formal systems are are perfect and complete but they're not
complete that's what google showed they're not complete and they
don't capture all of reality and in fact they're missing
the most important part of reality which is the capacity
for self-reference and self-reflection in other words self-awareness or consciousness
that's the most important aspect of reality is self-reference and
when you cut that out of your symbolic systems it's
like neutering your children that's what you're doing here but
if you have a bias towards rationality towards being perfectly
logical if you're stuck in your left brain and you
need reality to be logical and to not have any
contradictions and no paradoxes then you have to play now
a game of denying a game of denial very sophisticated
denial that what you're doing is your your your neutering
reality you're dumbing yourself down you're dumbing yourself down so
much that you're becoming willfully ignorant of the self-reflection problems
that exist within science within mathematics within logic and so
on and you have to do that in order to
keep playing the scientific logical mathematical rationalist game that you
want to be playing but of course the question is
does that actually reflect the true nature of reality or
is reality a thing which is inherently self-contradictory because of
self-reference so sure you could construct a walled garden within
your logic or within your university or within your worldview
you could construct a finite walled garden where you outlaw
self-reflection and consciousness and then it will seem to you
from within that walled garden if you always stay within
that wall garden you're very careful guarding those walls it
will always seem to you as though reality is non-contradictory
and perfectly logical but what you're not seeing is that
that's just a little walled garden that you've constructed there's
there's an entire ocean of stuff that's real that exists
beyond your little walled garden which you've just stuck your
head into the sand about and you're actively in denial
about and so this is the situation that science mathematics
and logic finds itself in still to this day the
lessons of russell's paradox and girdles and completeness theorem and
tarski's influence and these lessons have not been learned even
by those people who proclaim themselves to understand girdles and
completeness theorems it's actually shocking to me how many mathematically
inclined people will will preach to me about how they
have dealt deep and they have proven and you know
they have done the proofs of of actual girls and
complaining serum and that they understand the proofs when in
fact they they might understand the technical proofs they might
even be able to do a technical proof it's a
very sophisticated proof they might be able to do it
but they have no understanding of the broader implications this
has for their understanding of reality because that's not an
accident if they truly did grasp the things that i'm
saying here this would destroy their entire worldview and their
entire epistemic attitude and their metaphysics so you have to
understand that there's something very sneaky going on here your
mind is playing very sneaky games especially when you're being
logical and rational and rigorous do not believe your lying
mind when you're lying mind tells you that oh leo
i'm just being very rigorous yeah you're being very rigorous
and you're using rigor as a weapon against actually grasping
the ultimate nature of reality and yourself and consciousness so
watch out watch out with the games you play so
a lot of what western intellectual tradition has done is
it it has created models theories and various kinds of
logics which had to be fudged to make reality c
more rational and linear than it actually is that fudging
that fudge factor is what bertrand russell did in this
explanation that hofstadter gave you can construct a sort of
set theory which is so crippled that it prevents through
fudging it prevents self-reflection and if you do construct such
a system then you can start to believe that this
system actually is a true reflection of reality and what
i'm saying is that it's not and see what's happening
here is that the mind again see the mind is
more attached to logic or to science or to academic
model building than it is to truth i've talked about
this divergence in my episode my series on deconstructing the
myth of science part one two three i've talked specifically
about this divergence between science and truth that can happen
well the same kind of divergence can actually happen between
truth and logic and that's exactly what happens in this
case with bertrand brussell and with seth theories and so
forth you see the scientific academic mind is so committed
to the academic pursuits that it loses sight of the
fact that academia and the way that academics study reality
could not be the same thing as the pursuit of
truth and then what's going to happen is that your
loyalties will be with academia and with model building rather
than with truth but you will convince yourself that no
leo i'm pursuing the truth by building my models you
will convince yourself of that without realizing that actually building
your models that is a survival activity of your mind
not a genuine pursuit of the truth and so you
see the human mind is so sneaky that it will
even fudge logic and rationality in order to defend its
worldview because to a rationalist reality has to be rational
and if you try to explain to a rationalist that
reality doesn't have to be rational he will say but
you're using rationality to talk to me therefore you're contradicting
yourself no i'm only using rationality to talk to you
because that's the level you're at and that's all you
understand so of course i'm using rationality to talk to
you how else am i supposed to get through to
you you're a rationalist you will only listen to rationality
now look i could speak to you in completely irrational
ways and that's perfectly fine for my point of view
because i have no loyalty to rationalism but will it
penetrate your stubborn ass mind probably not so therefore i
am forced to use rationality to communicate with you rationalists
just try to fathom the the sneakiness of what's going
on here if there actually is something profoundly true that
exists outside of rationality notice that you will not be
able to see it precisely because you're committed to maintaining
this walled garden that you've built that you call rationality
what is within the walled garden is rationality and what's
without is the dangerous stuff that you're scared of the
irrational stuff the a-rational stuff the stuff that is trans-rational
and you see the ego mind needs to construct these
sorts of walled gardens with its worldview whether it's a
scientific worldview or religious world you the ego has to
do this because the ego has a deep need for
control over reality and so while most scientists and mathematicians
and logicians might fancy themselves pure objective impartial pursuers of
truth this is not the case this is a ruse
that their mind is playing on them this is a
self-deception in fact their minds deeply want to control and
manipulate reality and they do that through the intellectual pursuits
that academics do and you see if your whole career
your whole life is is devoted to intellectual model building
the most dangerous thing to you is going to be
this conversation we're having right now about the fundamental limitations
of all models and the fact that all models must
ultimately contradict themselves because all models are finite and because
reality is infinite but we'll get to that in more
detail in a minute so you see science and academia
actually has a constructivist bias that means that scientists and
academics they're not just pursuing the truth for truth's sake
they're seeking to build something they're seeking to construct something
now it could be a technology or it could just
be some theoretical model or scheme but it has to
be something positive and constructive because if it's not positive
or constructive you can't write a research paper on it
you can't get published you can't get tenure in a
university you can't be a professor you can't contribute to
the growing knowledge base of science you see the scientific
knowledge base is always growing and growing and growing that's
construction science is constructing similar to a tree the way
a tree grows in rings every year every season it
adds an extra layer of ring of bark around itself
and then it grows bigger and bigger and bigger that's
what science is doing that's what i mean by the
constructivist bias so uh you're going to run into problems
as a scientist or as an academic if you take
a more deconstructive approach where you are deconstructing everything because
the problem is is that people will tell you well
why are you deconstructing everything what's the use in that
that's not useful since it's not useful we can't teach
it since we can't teach it then we can't charge
money you know thousands of dollars for students to come
to our university and we can't get grants either from
the government because the government is not going to give
grants for deconstruction of reality it only gives grants for
the construction of reality businesses will not fund you as
a scientist or a researcher if you're deconstructing stuff because
businesses all are in the business of constructing stuff not
deconstructing stuff see but what if truth lies in the
direction of deconstruction more so than in the direction of
construction what if the truth is that all of reality
is a construction and you're in denial about that what
if the truth is that science all of science is
a construction what if the truth is that all of
logic is a construction what if the truth is that
all of mathematics is a construction will you have enough
objectivity to admit that to yourself do you see the
conflict of interest here it's a very profound conflict of
interest that no academic or scientist fully fathoms so this
turns out to be a corruption at the heart of
science yes you can create a contradiction-free walled garden if
you disallow all contradictions but the deeper question is does
this actually reflect reality is this how reality is or
is this something you've constructed some simplification that you've imagined
of reality simply because you can't deal with the larger
reality you see if the mind is so small that
it can only deal with this much reality when in
fact this much reality exists but your mind can only
deal with this much of it you see notice the
following trick that the mind can play on itself is
the mind can define reality according to its own self
such that reality coincides with the limits of the mind
and then reality just appears to be your own mind
all that your mind can understand this is how much
of reality you see and you don't see anything beyond
that and therefore from your point of view you're so
ignorant you don't even understand what you're ignorant of you
don't see what you're missing and therefore you can act
arrogant and you can act as though you've you're about
to figure everything out when in fact you're nowhere close
to figuring everything out and this is precisely the situation
that modern science and philosophy even and academia find themselves
in this trap because you see as soon as your
mind is pushed outside of its comfort zone outside of
its own narrow self definitions you're pushed to explore some
new domain of reality that you haven't yet explained to
yourself that your own model and paradigm cannot account for
you see there's there's an interesting dilemma that you have
either you can be very open-minded and intellectually honest and
you can go forth and be fearless and explore those
new domains but then those new domains will contradict your
old definition of what reality was and so that means
you have to expand first first of all you have
to admit that you were wrong which most minds don't
want to do especially most intellectual minds because to an
intellectual person admitting their own intellectual errors is one of
the deepest fears they have and it's the last thing
they want to do the last thing a scientist or
an academic wants to do is admit a profound egregious
error in their understanding of reality that's that's the worst
thing that could happen to a scientist because it undermines
his entire reputation now sure most scientists and academics are
happy to admit of of little mistakes and in fact
this is this is a further game that they're playing
is they'll say oh leo we admit our mistakes all
the time what are you talking about man i admit
when i'm wrong you admit when you're wrong about shallow
easy things what i'm talking about is admitting that you're
profoundly wrong about the entire pursuit of your intellectual career
that's a much deeper level of of error than you're
willing to uh to admit to yourself and even to
me and so your denial about this so anyways you
have two options you can either admit you were wrong
and then expand your sense of reality that's painful emotionally
that takes emotional labor or what you can do is
you can actually just cut off that new domain and
deny that that domain even exists or that it's valid
or that it has anything to do with science or
that it should be of any significance or interest to
you or to the larger academic community you can do
that you can pull that move and when you pull
that move that's the easiest move to pull because to
pull that move all you have to do is fool
yourself into believing that that domain is some sort of
inferior marginalized st area of study some sort of pseudoscience
or some sort of irrationality or nonsense and then you
can just dismiss that from your mind very easily and
you can go back to just studying all the stuff
that exists within your established paradigm you see but the
cost notice the cost the cost is that you never
fully understand the larger reality so what do you want
ask yourself what do you want more do you more
care about understanding all of reality or do you care
more about defending your little paradigm and intellectual corner because
you can't have both if you want to understand all
of reality all of a reality actually the only way
you're gonna be able to do that is by completely
deconstructing all of your paradigms all of your assumptions all
of your attachments all of your pet theories all of
your models they're all gonna have to go and that's
unacceptable to most scientists and academics and logicians and mathematicians
and skeptics and rationalists so choose where do your loyalties
lie so yes if you want you can maintain non-contradiction
within your systems but this is maintained at a cost
and the cost is completeness and scope in other words
you can have a non-contradictory symbolic system or model you
can have that but it's not going to be complete
it's going to be extremely limited extremely partial and it's
not going to be capable of self-reference it's not going
to be able to explain itself you see because one
of the tricks that science pulls one of the dualistic
tricks is that science comes up with models but then
those models they can explain reality some corner of reality
but they never explain the whole of reality nor are
they capable notices they're not capable of explaining themselves and
this is true of science as a whole science as
a whole can explain a lot of stuff within reality
but science as a whole cannot explain science have you
noticed this this is not an accident there's a deep
fundamental reason for why this must be the case because
see science is something consciousness is doing science is something
the mind is doing so science can explain everything but
science can't explain consciousness and science can't explain the mind
and you might say well leo so what you know
what's the big deal but actually there is a big
deal because ultimately what science really cares about the spirit
of science is about trying to understand all of reality
which includes consciousness that includes minds too and so there's
a deep problem because right now you can find on
youtube many videos of like interviews with famous scientists and
they're commonly asked questions like what is consciousness where did
consciousness come from is conscious is fundamental and you see
them giving these long-winded winding answers which clearly show that
they are clueless about what consciousness is um and and
you know they're playing games and they're pretending to give
you answers but they're not really giving you answers and
some of these scientists are even forced into a position
where they have to deny consciousness they have to deny
consciousness because you can't explain consciousness through science because consciousness
is prior to science because science is something conscious is
doing so this is the self-reference problem the problem is
that they're not conscious enough to realize that this self-reference
problem is at the heart of all of science and
logic and mathematics and rationality and skepticism because they've limited
themselves to that particular paradigm and they refuse to see
anything beyond that and it's actually not possible to understand
accurately what reality is as long as you're working within
a finite closed carefully curated symbolic system you can't understand
the ultimate questions about reality that way you can't answer
questions like why is there something rather than nothing what
is consciousness what is death what is the purpose of
life what is love what is god is there free
will what is the self where did the universe come
from will it ever end you can't answer these questions
from that little walled garden and then here's the mistake
that many scientists and rationalists make is they say well
leo you can't answer those questions because those questions don't
have answers they're just [ __ ] philosophical armchair questions
that don't have any answers no they have absolute definite
answers they have very satisfying answers they have answers that
are beyond any word games and beyond even the answers
of of science but it's just that those answers lie
outside of your little walled garden your paradigm and so
see you can either admit that there are answers that
exist outside your walled garden or you can deny it
and you can say no only answers within my walled
garden are true answers and then if you do that
you're stuck forever in ignorance and then when you actually
do hear the answers like when you hear me talking
about love or god or consciousness and i give you
dfinity answers you get upset if you're attached to that
walled garden of yours you get upset why well you
have to because the things i'm saying are directly contradicting
your little walled garden they're destroying your walled garden and
you must maintain that wall of garden because that's what
you're committed to as a scientist rationalist academic materialist duelist
realist skeptic logician mathematician that's what you're in the business
of please see that so there's an enormous cost that
comes the cost that comes with maintaining your little walled
garden is so high that you don't even understand the
cost yet i haven't even begun to articulate the cost
you i've only been talking about some of the like
theoretical costs there are actually survival level costs there are
emotional costs there are karmic costs there is the suffering
and pain that you construct for yourself by constructing your
little narrow walled gardens and you don't see those costs
because your walled garden is so deeply at the root
of the way that you see reality that any errors
in your epistemology there will percolate through and distort your
entire perception of reality so thoroughly that you won't even
be able to have enough self-awareness and self-reflection to see
how your own epistemology is constructing your own limits as
a human as a living being as a conscious agent
it's sort of like you're handcuffing yourself without realizing that
you're handcuffing yourself and then you're throwing away the key
you're never ever going to be able to find it
again because not only do you throw away the key
you also brainwash yourself to tell yourself that the key
never even existed and that you've always just been in
handcuffs and that this is the natural condition that everybody
is like this and there's no solution there is a
solution but you have to stop brainwashing yourself with these
limited rigid narrow symbolic systems that you've constructed that you've
picked up from your culture so in practice the way
that science and logic handles this problem is that as
with like what bertrand russell did is that they create
second order logics and meta languages they create a language
to talk about language they create a logic to talk
about logic so there are truths that first order logic
cannot encompass so to speak or cannot hold because it's
too finite because truth is infinite so truth always escapes
any finite system so your finite system let's say is
first order logic there are some truths that exist that
are meta truths outside of that first order logic so
what the scientists did is they they came up with
a second order logic the second order logic expands beyond
first order logic and it can it can encapsulate some
more truths it can hold some truths about first order
logic that first order logic speak about itself because of
the self-reflection problem you see because self-reflection is prohibited within
the first order logic so for that reason you need
a second order logic but then second order logic same
problem you're just kicking the can down the road now
you need a third order logic to explain certain truths
meta truths about second order logic that second order logic
can't explain about itself you see because second order logic
is also finite it's just a larger form of finite
thing and so what happens then you go to third
order logic fourth order logic and you can keep expanding
but see there's a trick is that the human mind
is not so sophisticated and so conscious that it actually
can go this many orders and what this allows for
in practice if you just create a first order logic
and a second order maybe a third order logic this
will handle most objections by most intellectuals by 99 of
intellectuals they will just stop at third order logic and
they won't think any further they will think that well
you know we can just create more logics and then
and there's no problem there's nothing to see here nothing
to see here folks nothing's wrong um but but this
is just a plain old sticking your head in the
sand because the thing you're not seeing is that you
you can't capture reality with any number of any finite
logics no matter how many of them you create and
in fact the fact that you have to create more
and more logics to maintain the consistency of your logical
schemes is already evidence of infinity because how many different
logics are there infinity you can have an infinity of
metal logics you can have an infinity of metal languages
but it you still don't get it you mathematicians and
logicians and scientists and rationalists you still don't [ __
] get how profound this is you think you're smarter
than what i'm telling you you're not you're [ __
] stupid you are playing a mind game of rigor
pretenses of rigor you're acting as though you're being rigorous
and consistent and logical but you're not you're actually being
highly irrational in what you're doing and one of the
fundamental reasons for why you're doing this you're pretending to
be rigorous and the reason i say you're pretending to
be rigorous by the way is because to truly be
rigorous you would have to encapsulate all of reality that's
what true rigor means true rigor is not constructing a
little walled garden amidst this giant ocean of chaotic phenomena
that you have no idea how to explain that's not
true rigor true rigor would be having a full understanding
of the entire ocean of chaos that would be true
rigor but that kind of rigor cannot be done through
logic or any finite symbolic system or method or model
it can't be done through mathematics you can't quantify you
can't formalize it and so see there's a deep-seated fear
in you of expanding your mind to include the entire
chaotic field of infinite conscious phenomena because one of the
implicit biases you you've adopted as a scientist or as
a materialist or as a academic is what i call
the demystification bias you're actually biased towards demystifying reality you
fundamentally believe that all of reality is non-mystical and that
it can be demystified through a gradual process of scientific
empirical work and you believe that you're part of that
process and you fancy yourself a champion of that process
the process of demystification and you believe that if you
just systematically demystify every single natural phenomenon that exists that
eventually you will reach your goal your crowning achievement of
understanding all of reality and what i'm telling you is
that that's pure delusion that will never happen because actually
you have to ask yourself why are you assuming that
reality is something that is non-mystical notice that is something
you have to assume if you're trying to demystify everything
because again see you're assuming that your demystification project is
going to be the same thing as truth but don't
be so sure about that what if there's a divergence
what if the truth is actually that reality is mystical
can you see that you're going to miss that if
your project in life is to demystify everything so what
you're missing is that you're not realizing that actually you
and science at large cannot know whether reality is mystical
or not a priori you have to actually go and
explore all of reality and ask the question is reality
mystical and treat that as a legitimate question don't treat
it as though you already know the answer you might
be surprised by what nature reveals to you if you're
truly open with that question here are some empirical questions
that science should be asking but isn't asking is reality
mystical or not is reality paradoxical or not is rationality
fundamental is rationality the best way is rationality the only
way what are the limits of rationality what are the
limits of science is truth with a capital t even
accessible to reason is reason objective and universal what exists
beyond what reason can grasp but you see the typical
rationalist scientist is not interested in these questions doesn't take
these questions seriously and never tests them never treats these
questions as though they were legitimate empirical questions and yet
they are they are they're meta scientific questions if you
want to be technical so what creates paradox several deeply
interconnected notions here are these notions self-reference circular definitions recursion
infinite regress denial of contradiction duality and identity that's a
profound list i just gave you the ultimate answer that
explains all of paradox if a paradox exists in any
system whether it's logical or within one's worldview or elsewhere
it's going to be because of one of these seven
or so reasons that i just gave you and if
you study each of these i don't have time to
go into all of them for you you can go
and study them on your own and contemplate the nature
of what they are i've talked about some of these
in other episodes check that out i have episodes about
duality i have episodes about infinity uh i might do
an episode in the future about recursion i have i've
talked about self-reference in the past i have episodes about
identity so you know um and and we'll talk a
little bit more about some of those here as we
keep going but you got to really study and contemplate
those for yourself and you got to ask yourself the
question how did all those things interconnect and construct paradox
but the most important perhaps of all of these is
self-reference so let's go into the problem of self-reference here
to to really drive this point home so what is
self-reference i actually call this the self-reference problem the self-reference
problem the self-reference problem is whenever any kind of formal
system it could be a logical system it could be
a worldview it could be signs as a whole these
are all systems it could be mathematics could be arithmetic
it could be a religion these are all systems whenever
one of these systems tries to grasp itself this creates
a self-reference problem because usually the function of all these
systems is to grasp other things these systems are like
hands like this hand that i have i can grasp
the camera i can grasp the light i can grasp
the chair i can grasp another person with this hand
i can grasp a lot of stuff but notice there's
a self-reference problem is that i can't grasp my own
hand by using my hand and why is that really
contemplate why this seems kind of obvious and stupid but
it's not it's extremely [ __ ] profound so really
contemplate this for a year every day for a year
contemplate why can't my hand grab my own hand why
try it why can't it work what is what is
the profound metaphysical reason for why my hand can't grab
my own hand if you understand this one point you
will understand the entire problem of grasping what consciousness is
how can you use consciousness to grasp consciousness how can
you use mind to grasp mind and remember science is
mind scientists forget this and rationalists forget this rationalists and
scientists like to pretend and skeptics too like to pretend
as though skepticism rationality and science are not mined but
that they are somehow outside or prior to mind they're
not their mind you can't have science skepticism or rationality
without mind do you get it so what's going on
here is that mind is trying to grasp reality that's
what science is doing that's what logic is for that's
what all human knowledge is about even if you're doing
philosophy philosophical systems also have a self-reference problem because see
for for a philosopher like as a philosopher what do
we want we want to create some sort of philosophy
that explains all of reality right but then of course
if your philosophy is going to explain all of reality
isn't your philosophy part of the reality you're trying to
explain therefore your philosophy by definition if it's going to
explain all reality has to also be able to explain
itself do you see that and so most philosophers are
not conscious of this self-reference problem that exists within all
philosophical systems and therefore they're not able to properly explain
or account for reality because you actually can't explain all
of reality through a linguistic scheme or through a thought-based
scheme of any kind and there's a very deep reason
for that which we'll get to in a minute so
anyways mind tries to grasp reality assuming notice notice there's
a there's such a deep implicit assumption just in this
attempt to grasp reality when you're asking the question like
what is reality see you're trying to grasp reality with
your mind notice that but also notice that when you're
doing that don't just assume that it's going to be
possible ask yourself what are the assumptions just in that
process in that method of grasping reality when science is
the least is reaching out to grasp some some corner
of reality it's assuming that the mind or the method
of science is separate from the reality that it's trying
to grasp it assumes a duality between these two things
mind and reality science and reality that's a distinction so
the mind goes looking for some part of reality that
it can use to define itself with for example if
you ask a scientist what is mind the scientists will
say well of course mind is just neurons in the
brain but you see neurons in the brain what is
that that itself is mind so how you're defining mind
is in a circular manner without noticing that that's what
you're doing you're in denial about the fact that you're
doing this which means you don't actually have a true
understanding of what you're doing and what mind is in
order for for mind to explain itself mind has to
try to look for something outside of itself to define
itself with so it might say neurons neuron leo neurons
are not part of the mind neurons are part of
the brain therefore this is acceptable we can define the
mind using something outside the mind which is called the
neuron which is in the brain and then you can
say well what defines a brain then you say well
the brain is defined by atoms which are not in
the brain but something beyond the brain like that see
it's an endless game like this that the scientific mind
plays without realizing that's what it's doing so notice what's
happening here at a metaphysical level is that mind in
order to explain and to define itself to understand itself
tries to look for something other to itself but notice
what that means notice what that assumes that assumes that
there is something other to mind but consider the possibility
that mind is everything that's a problem see you can
either assume that there's mind and then other to mind
or you can assume that there's only mind science assumes
there's mind and there's something other to mind therefore that's
a dualistic paradigm and a naturalistic paradigm you can play
as sort of a little bit of a game there
try to define mine relative to something other outside the
mind but the problem of course is that if if
the mind keeps looking deeper and deeper and further out
to the to its extents what it realizes that it
can look infinitely far in every direction and it'll find
nothing but itself more mind because the absolute truth is
that mind is all that there is there is no
other to mind mind is an absolute and so now
the problem becomes that of the hand grasping itself if
all there exists is the hand and nothing else to
be grasped but the hand and you're trying to use
the hand to grasp the only thing that there is
is the hand imagine the hand is everything how can
you use everything to grasp everything you see the mind
is trying to grasp itself but it can't define itself
against anything other than itself because itself is only is
the only thing that there exists by definition so then
how can mind grasp mind well it can't but this
is very counter-intuitive and tricky because it might sound like
leo so what you're saying is that all of philosophy
and science and all this knowledge seeking is all [
__ ] it's impossible and the answers can't really be
arrived at or all the questions the deep questions can't
really be answered no that's not what i'm saying leo
you're saying all this is just a [ __ ]
mind game and it's just all just armchair philosophy and
speculative metaphysics it's all pointless and we should stop doing
it no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying precisely
the opposite of that the mind cannot grasp itself but
the mind can grasp the fact that it cannot grasp
itself and furthermore that the mind exists as mind and
that mind is everything this is a very subtle nuanced
distinction so although mind cannot fully know itself mind can
realize that it is being itself and so the answers
that we seek the deepest answers that we seek can
be reached but those answers don't exist at the level
of logical symbolic mind those answers are so [ __
] profound they exist at the level of being you
don't know the answer you become the answer you don't
know that the mind is infinite you become infinity you
become infinite mind is that making sense so in a
sense what i'm saying is that self-knowledge is impossible so
you might say well that's that's a that's a very
negative point leo it sounds like you're a nihilist self-knowledge
is impossible sure that's easy to say then you have
to do any work but i'm saying something much deeper
than that even though self-knowledge is impossible self with a
capital s is possible so it turns out that the
answers you seek don't exist at the level of self-knowledge
because knowledge itself is a second order feature of consciousness
and mind they exist at a at a more primordial
level which is at the at the level of consciousness
or direct experience or self or being which is prior
to knowledge and the problem with science and logic and
rationality and skepticism around and materialism and all this sorts
of stuff is it's it's all at the level of
knowledge religion too religion is all at the level of
knowledge all philosophies too are at the level of knowledge
whether you're an idealist or a realist or a an
existentialist or a kantian or or a cartesian or whatever
you are that's all knowledge and this explains why philosophy
throughout the ages especially in the west has not been
very successful in answering the deepest questions about reality it's
not because they can't be answered it's because they can't
be answered at the level of knowledge but they can
be answered at the more primordial level of being and
actually paradoxically at the level of not knowing so you
see now we're getting very zen here even though you
can't reach the answers through knowing you can paradoxically and
counterintuitively reach the answers through not knowing this takes us
into the issue of not knowing which i'll shoot a
separate episode about a very profound notion not knowing the
self or mind with a capital m cannot know itself
because it is infinite and knowing or knowledge is not
infinity it is less than if it's a subset of
infinity knowing is a conceptual activity concepts are a subset
of infinity therefore they can't encompass the whole of infinity
but what can encompass the whole of infinity is being
being is actually infinite being is more fundamental than concept
or the knowing and at the level of being what
you have is not knowing i'm sorry if this is
confusing you and it sounds like word salad but this
is just the nature of the paradoxes we run into
when we're talking about infinity because you see the self
what you are your mind is infinity it's everything it's
rocks it's trees it's cars it's people it's good it's
bad it's evil it's criminality it's torture it's murder it's
theft it's love it's cute babies and animals it's planets
it's stars it's galaxies it's science it's pseudoscience it's rationality
it's irrationality it's sanity it's madness it's schizophrenia it's high
iq it's low iq and everything literally everything else that
you could imagine so see the problem here is that
your methodology is too limited your methodology needs to be
deeper than the knowing methodology your methodology needs to include
not knowing in it too that's what you're missing so
here's the paradox of knowing this is one of the
first paradoxes we'll cover i'll give you a list here
in a moment of many other paradoxes that are very
interesting but here's the first one is the highest knowing
is not knowing that's the paradox of knowing so what
you need to understand about the self-reference problem is that
self-reference is equivalent to in a sense self-destruction if you
have constructed a finite limited self and here by self
we can really be generic here we can we can
not just refer to human selves we can refer to
even science as a self like the whole system of
science or language or logic or mathematics any of these
can be a finite self we could say if one
of these finite selves finite portions of consciousness is allowed
to self-reflect and self-reference deeply enough it will become so
self-aware that it will realize that its own self cannot
be contained within any finite definition of itself and therefore
it will actually annihilate itself and when it annihilates itself
what it's annihilating is not the infant itself it's annihilating
the finite self-definition so that finite self-definition of mathematics logic
science religion christianity buddhism islam rationality atheism whatever it is
that finite self-definition of your human biological self that will
collapse that will annihilate and then you will become the
infant itself that's what i mean when i say self-reference
equals self-destruction the finite self self-destructs or eats its own
tail as the oroboros when the finite self merges with
its polar opposite because you see to define a finite
self it's like you're drawing a circle when you draw
a circle you're simultaneously creating the inside and the outside
of the circle you can't have a circle with just
inside and no outside and you can't have a circle
with just outside and no inside you're co-defining the outside
and the inside this is what it means to create
a distinction or a duality so the reason that all
these symbolic systems must collapse and cannot grasp themselves nor
larger ultimate reality is because all of them are constructed
out of distinctions that's so that remember i talked about
construction bias so for example when you're doing quantum mechanics
you're making distinctions between electrons and protons and quarks up
quarks and down quarks and spin and color quarks and
this and that and other subatomic particles muons and gluons
and firm ions and whatever and then you're making further
distinctions about fields energies momentum velocities time gravity and space
time and this you're making distinctions even when you're using
mathematical formulas you're making distinctions between the number one two
three the equal sign the plus sign the minus sign
the division sign the the integral sign the derivative sign
these are all distinctions you're you have to construct these
to do your quantum mechanics or if you're doing astrophysics
with general relativity also you're using distinctions you see and
even for example general relativity versus quantum mechanics which has
not been reconciled yet has not been unified yet scientists
are trying to unify it but they don't know how
to unify it well how can you unify it when
you're creating distinctions between the two literally the difference between
quantum mechanics and general relativity is a distinction in the
mind of a scientist that they're trying to unify without
realizing that they've made this distinction so of course you
can't unify it because you're not conscious what you're doing
and so you see this issue of self-reference and self-reflection
is is the the linchpin to everything because if you're
not conscious of how you're using your own mind when
you're doing science or logic or quantum mechanic or general
relativity you're not going to understand reality the only way
to understand reality is through infinite self-reference and self-reflection infinite
consciousness that's the only force in the universe that's capable
of understanding its own self because it is itself but
scientists and rationalists think that they can get away with
doing their work while not doing self-reflection and it can't
see they're they're actively running away from self-reflection when if
you truly wanted to do good science and logic and
rationality you would have to embrace and run towards self
uh reference and self reflection so bertrand russell made a
huge mistake when he was trying to excise self-reference from
set theory he should have been doing what hofstadter was
doing which is embracing the beauty of self-reference and strange
loops although douglas hofstadter didn't do it to the ultimate
degree either which i explained in my episode about reality
is a strange loop so you see the fundamental problem
here is that the mind whether it's a scientific mind
or any mind takes identity for granted identity meaning what
is a thing when a thing is a thing how
do you know it's that thing and not some other
thing that's the that's the problem of identity so within
science there's identity problems like how do you define what
science is how do you know what science is that's
an identity problem for science now most scientists ignore that
identity problem and they say well we've always known what
science was there's no real fundamental identity problem in science
oh yes there is because the distinction between science and
non-science or science and pseudoscience that itself is the identity
of science and where you draw that line how you
construct that distinction you better be very conscious of it
or you're going to make mistakes and that's exactly the
problem with science it's not conscious that it doesn't even
acknowledge that it's drawing that line it's taking that line
to be some sort of absolute god-given thing it's not
you're constructing it using your mind and that that line
by the way has always shifted throughout all of human
history the line between science and pseudoscience science and non-science
science and religion science and spirituality has always been shifting
and it's shifting to this day but most people are
in denial about it because they don't take this identity
problem seriously but this identity problem doesn't just apply to
science it applies to literally every single object in the
universe who says that a chair is a chair that's
the identity problem in a nutshell all right so we've
covered a lot of deep stuff here um now let's
move on to a list of examples of paradox because
when i say paradox you might still be scratching your
head like leo what are you even talking about with
paradox well here are some examples this sentence is false
that's the classic liar paradox there's also visual paradoxes like
the penrose triangle you've probably seen many of these types
of visual paradoxes they're quite cool i show a lot
of them in my episode called reality is a strange
loop another paradox is less is more has anyone ever
given you that advice if you're an artist if you're
a designer really good advice for you a really good
principle is less is more but that seems paradoxical why
would less be more this paradox can even apply to
something like money or material possessions you might think the
greatest life possible is for me to have as many
material possessions as possible right and then the minimalist comes
in and says counterintuitively no less is more you can
actually get more out of life by having less [
__ ] so sell most of your [ __ ]
and watch the quality of your life actually improve paradoxical
huh here's one that i love uh it's a quote
by yogi berra quote nobody goes to that restaurant it's
too crowded end quote when a restaurant becomes so crowded
nobody goes there anymore here's another one the only rule
is ignore all rules so if i'm going to ignore
all rules do i follow the only rule which is
to ignore all rules here's other paradox make money by
spending it what how can you make money by spending
it but you can and in fact the most wealthy
people in the world are those who follow this principle
of make money by spending it rather than hoarding it
here's the paradox is a quote describing the late ronald
reagan this was a quote describing his personality and the
quote says he was an authentic phony i love that
description an authentic phony another paradox if i know one
thing it's that i know nothing that's a sort of
a socrates paradox here's a quote from shakespeare i must
be cruel to be kind said by hamlet i must
be cruel to be kind what how does that work
that ties in with the concept of masculine compassion which
i've talked a long time ago in my episode called
masculine versus feminine compassion here's a paradox i love maybe
you're familiar with this if you're a bit of an
excel nerd have you ever done your text or something
in excel spreadsheet software and then you're trying to like
you have a column of cells with different values and
you're trying to add them all up into like a
final total at the bottom and you can use excel
to draw a little square like a rectangle around that
column and then you can get the sum total at
the bottom so that's fine it works the reason it
works is because you're referencing some other cell from the
bottom cell so the bottom cell is the one that
contains the formula that references all the cells above it
and adds them up into a total that works but
what happens when you draw your rectangle in such a
way that it it includes the whole column but that
column since it's the whole column also includes the the
sum total too so see now you've got a self-reference
problem this is the perfect like visual metaphor uh of
the self-reference problem in action it's when that bottom cell
the total cell which is supposed to contain the answer
is itself referenced in the question or the tally of
the total you see so this creates a sort of
a recursion problem self-reference problem and then what does excel
tell you when you actually do this try try doing
this in your excel program see what happens it'll give
you an error that says something like circular reference error
so this is exactly what i'm talking about this error
doesn't just exist in excel it exists in every single
symbolic system whether it's an excel spreadsheet or some computer
code you know you can actually cause a computer to
crash or to malfunction by finding this sort of self-reference
error in in computer code hackers can use this to
break into systems you can do like mysql injections this
way very interestingly um you can crack passwords and and
break into the most secure computer systems through these sorts
of circular reference errors um but these errors exist in
all kinds of systems these errors exist within religion they
exist within the english language they exist within all worldviews
and and books you can find them and um all
logical schemes within science let's see another example of paradox
is try time travel paradoxes so what happens if you
travel back in time kill kill your own grandfather will
you still have been born will you also kill yourself
at the same moment interesting to think about those and
there are plenty of movies that have explored those kinds
of time travel paradoxes like a one of the movies
that comes to mind is with bruce willis it's called
looper appropriately named looper it's real really good check it
out it's a it's a very strange loopy sort of
movie um within quantum mechanics there are interesting paradoxes between
the particle wave duality sort of retroactive backwards causality information
can flow almost in spooky backwards ways within quantum mechanical
experiments if you've researched or studied those a bit you
can relate to what i'm saying there of course there's
russell's paradox which we've already talked about which can be
stated as it's the list of all lists that do
not contain themselves and that list would itself include itself
it's very twisted even when i say it it doesn't
really make sense in my own mind like i have
to go through it very slowly for it to make
sense you can actually go on google and search for
russell's paradox you can find videos on it on youtube
and where they will give you a very technical explanation
of the paradox i'm not going to go into that
here because it's not relevant to what we're talking about
we're talking about big picture stuff here not the little
details so here's another paradox for you the mind is
in the brain but the brain is also in the
mind how can that be which is it is the
mind in the brain or is the brain in the
mind what materialists call the brain they are too stupid
to understand is actually the mind they think they can
explain mind by appealing to brain without being conscious that
brain is actually mind if you cut open your own
skull and you feel your physical pink squishy brain those
will all be phenomenal experiences and sensations which by definition
are mind the walls of your house are mined the
walls of your house are not made out of brains
they're made of minds a tree is not man of
a brain it's made of a mind and the brain
itself is not mad of a brain it's mad of
a mind brain has always been mind you just didn't
look deeply enough into it there's an additional sort of
corollary paradox here it's like it can this problem can
also be reframed as the universe is in the mind
but the mind is in the universe again which is
it is it that the mind is in the universe
or is the universe in the mind if we're sort
of naive materialists and realists we tend to believe that
the mind is in the universe the mind is this
small thing the universe is this large thing and the
mind is contained in the universe but that's not true
because the universe the big bang outer space is in
your own mind where else did it ever exist but
in your own mind you've never been to outer space
it was always your mind the big bang only exists
in your mind it doesn't exist anywhere else but see
science will try to convince you that no no leo
your brain came out of the big bang before the
big bang there was no brain no you don't get
how radical this is your brain didn't come out of
the big bang or rather you could you could see
if you want you could say the brain okay the
brain came out of the big bang but where the
big bang came out of the big bang came out
of your mind because it only ever existed in your
mind so first there was your mind then there was
the big bang then there was your brain are you
getting this another paradox the classic one from philosophy is
called the ship of theseus there was the greek ship
of theseus the original ship it has special significance from
mythology and then the some philosopher asked the question of
like okay so we have this ship it's mad at
wood and wooden planks there's like thousands of wooden planks
so what happens if i replace one of the planks
in the ship is it still the ship of theseus
most people say yeah sure of course planks are replaced
on ships all the time it doesn't change the fact
that it's a ship okay but what if i replace
two planks three planks four planks what if i keep
doing this until i replace every single plank in the
ship such that no none of the original planks remain
is it still the ship of theseus and you see
this is pointing out what identity is it it's pointing
out the paradox is inherent to identity what is identity
what does it mean to say that this thing here
is the ship of theseus what does it mean to
say that see we take this for granted and by
the way this happens with your body so you might
think well leo this ship of theseus example is so
contrived and silly how does it apply to my life
well look at your body every cell in your body
has been replaced over time by other cells so you
say you're still the same person you were 10 20
30 years ago but are you really the same person
who says so see science assumes that when i'm sitting
here that this here is leo and if a year
passes from now i can still be sitting here and
this will still be leo that's what science just takes
for granted that's objectively true but it's not objectively true
because what i'm going to be sitting here even just
five minutes from now before the end of this episode
what was sitting here was already changed there's no such
thing as leo sitting here there's leo 1 leo 2
leo 3 leo 4 leo infinity so which leo are
you talking about there's a similar related problem called the
heap problem if we take a pile of sand you
know a sizable pile of sand we could say that's
a heap of sand okay most people would agree and
then i can take some tweezers and pull one grain
of sand out of that pile and i can still
ask the question is this still a heap and most
people say yes it is so i can pull two
three four five grains of sand a hundred thousand grain
percent a million at some point will be down to
just two grains of sand left is two grains of
sand a pile of sand and if you still say
yes i'm going to pull the last grain of sand
and it's just going to be a single grain of
sand it's a single grain of sand a pile of
sand and you're going to say no so how many
grains of sand does it take to make a heap
of sand so what this example also shows you is
the relativity of our notions of what a thing is
like a heap you might say again leo that's a
contrived example okay well what about your body let's take
your body so your body is all of this let's
say i cut out a few cells from my face
is this still a body you would say yes okay
well if i cut off my arm is it still
a body you would say yes if i cut off
all my arms legs and and i keep cutting off
more and more and more until there's just two cells
of leo left is that still leo is that still
leo's body and you would say maybe and then if
i take away everything except one cell if there's one
cell of leo left is that leo's body so what
does it mean to say that leo has a body
what does it mean to say leo because as leo
was talking his thoughts are changing his genetics are changing
as he's talking the epigenetics the expression of my genetics
are literally changing as i talk as i think as
i eat as i contemplate i'm gonna be a different
person by the end of this episode watch watch me
and intuitively that makes sense because look even as i'm
talking by the fact that i can hear myself talking
about these ideas this gives me a deeper understanding of
the things i'm talking about i actually learn when i
teach you guys from this episode even though i generally
understand what i'm talking about here i've thought about this
for years so i'm well versed with with this subject
matter but still just in delivering it i'm going to
learn new things about myself and these ideas that i'm
communicating with you so literally by the end of this
episode i'm going to be smarter about this issue of
paradox than i was when i began so i will
have turned into a different person will you recognize that
about me see i can recognize that about me because
i'm very self-aware of how this works but will you
recognize that about me maybe you won't and then maybe
you'll be disappointed after five years of teaching i'll become
a totally different person and then you're gonna say well
where did the old leo go leo i i like
the old leo i don't like the new leo the
old leo is because there never was a leo here's
a cool paradox you have a magic genie lamp you
find in the desert and you rub it and out
pops a genie and the genie grants you three wishes
what do you wish for if you're very clever you
wish to the magic genie that none of your wishes
come true in this way you mind [ __ ]
the the magic genie because if the magic genie grants
you your wishes then he's not granting you your wishes
and that creates a glitch in the matrix and yet
if the magic genie doesn't grant you your wish that
none of your wishes should come true then he is
granting your wish and so the genie is damned if
he doesn't and damned if he does that's a really
good paradox um here's one i recently learned from from
uh from kurt uh i did an interview with kurt
jay mongol on his channel uh theories of everything go
check out my two-part interview with him it's actually a
very long profound conversation we had but anyways in the
in that um in that conversation with him he he
brought up an interesting paradox that i jotted down it
goes like this if you're worried you shouldn't be worried
and if you're not worried you should be worried so
this is sort of a classic problem for neurotic people
it's like leo should i be worried about my money
situation well if you're worried too much that'll be a
problem and if you're not worried at all then you
should start to worry about your money situation because people
who don't worry at all about their money situation have
a very bad money situation so for example right now
where i am in my life i don't worry about
my money situation very much but the only reason i
don't worry is because i've spent my whole life worrying
about it which has motivated me to put a lot
of place things in place get all my ducks in
a row financially such that now i don't have to
worry about it but that's the result of years and
years of worrying about it you see there's the paradox
of impermanence which says that nothing is permanent except impermanence
there is the paradox of tolerance which exists within politics
and governance it works like this if society is absolutely
tolerant then it will tolerate the intolerant who will make
society intolerant you get that so for example if our
society is so tolerant that we tolerate fascists because we're
so democratic that will even allow fascists on social media
and on tv just complete free reign and car blanche
to fascists without checking them in some way well what
happens is that those fascists then can actually use the
tools of democracy and healthy governance they can use those
tools to amass power and then because those fascists themselves
are intolerant what they will do is then they will
cut that off for everybody else and then we will
actually paradoxically end up in a very intolerant society precisely
because we were so lax and so tolerant about intolerance
therefore if you want a tolerant society you have to
actually be intolerant towards the intolerant mind [ __ ]
huh um there's a similar paradox that comes with absolute
freedom i've discussed this in my episode about libertarianism why
libertarianism is nonsense in that episode i talked about how
counterintuitive absolute freedom is it's similar to this paradox of
intolerance it's like you know if we have a society
that only values freedom the way that libertarians tend to
want the end result of that is going to be
slavery the end result of libertarianism if it's enacted is
going to be slavery and totalitarian control why is that
well because if you remove all regulations and you allow
within a society total freedom anybody can do whatever they
want then what happens is that people start amassing more
and more power and wealth they start to create cabals
and syndicates larger collective constructs like corporations those corporations amass
more power more wealth and they start to dominate and
eat up other corporations until they have giant monopolies and
if you keep allowing that more and more without checking
in in some way then eventually what's going to happen
is that one corporation will end up with so much
money and a monopoly over every single industry they will
literally dominate and they will become the new government except
this government is not going to be democratically uh accountable
because a corporation is not democratically accountable so whoever owns
all the stock in that corporation will be the de
facto dictator and tyrant of the world in this system
so libertarians are not conscious enough to understand that this
is going to happen under their scheme which is why
regulation is so so crucial now of course libertarians will
deny all this and they'll say oh leo but our
system doesn't allow for such a thing because it's a
it's a it's a press this this would be too
oppressive it and we have a rule that says that
you know you're not allowed to use force against others
against their will but yeah that you have those rules
but all those rules will be broken in practice right
nobody's gonna abide by your stupid libertarian morals um there's
a deep paradox between the relative and the absolute which
i've talked about before in my episode about relative versus
absolute truth go check that out there's the paradox of
skepticism which goes like this and actually this is a
profound self-reflection problem within skepticism or a self-reference problem look
let's say i'm going to be the world's biggest skeptic
i'm skeptical about everything i believe that if i if
you're not skeptical to the to the nth degree then
you're deluded okay so that i'm skeptical about everything but
then eventually once i've exhausted my skepticism towards everything in
the world notice what happens now i have to turn
it in on myself is it true that skepticism is
a truthful way of understanding reality and when i start
to question that i realize uh oh what if it's
not true that skepticism is true what then and then
in this way skepticism destroys itself this would be a
valid and proper use of skepticism but most skeptics notice
most skeptics do not do this most skeptics only use
skepticism as a weapon to attack other ideologies and belief
systems but not to question their own worldview and so
in this sense they're missing the self-reflection they're missing that
self-reference move and by missing that they're not actually able
to to penetrate to the truth of reality or skepticism
or philosophy there's a similar paradox within nihilism i've talked
about this in my episode called understanding and coping with
nihilism go check that out one of my best episodes
i give a full explanation of nihilism there and i
talk at length about this paradox look the nihilist says
that he believes in nothing and the nihilist says that
everything is absolutely meaningless and because of this reality is
bleak and that we must now destroy government and other
institutions because all of it is meaningless and maybe even
i should kill myself as the ultimate conclusion of that
but hold on have you fully turned nihilism in on
itself have you become nihilistic about your own nihilism you
would have to if you were a true nihilist because
see if you're going to say that everything is meaningless
you can't now be depressed about the fact that reality
is meaningless because depression is a meaning you're adding to
reality so if nihilism makes you depressed you have to
go further in your nihilism to the point where even
your depression annihilates itself because depression is completely meaningless people
who are depressed are not nihilists you can't be depressed
if you're a true nihilist because as a true nihilist
nothing has any meaning and therefore what are you depressed
about you also then have no reason or excuse to
attack social institutions or to destroy things because the only
reason to destroy things rather than to create things is
if you find more meaning and destruction than in creation
you see so in this way nihilists fooled themselves by
not being fully self-aware notice with skepticism with libertarianism with
nihilism what is the problem with all these different systems
they're not fully self-aware they're partially self-aware and this leaves
something always that is missing a similar paradox exists within
post-modernism post-modernism basically says that we shouldn't privilege any one
perspective or world view over any other perspective or worldview
for example western culture is not better than eastern culture
american culture is not better than middle eastern culture men
are not superior to women straight people are not superior
to gay people and so on so we should put
all of them on the same playing field that's what
post-modernism sort of wants to say yet at the same
time when you take one of these post-modernists and you
say i don't believe in your post-modernism post-modernism is [
__ ] they will say ah no post-modernism is not
[ __ ] post-modernism sits above other positions but what
if my position is that post-modernism doesn't sit above other
positions what if in my position post-modernism sits below all
of their positions see a post-modernism would a post-modernist would
deny that but by denying that the postmodernist contradicts themselves
go check out my episode called um jacques derrida deconstruction
and non-duality where i talk about daredev's work and there
there's a paradox sort of within daredev's work although he's
he's self-aware enough to see it which is that see
derrida with his post-modernist deconstructivist work he's trying to point
out that all of language is a lie that's essentially
in a nutshell what he's trying to do if all
of language is a lie and by the way science
is language so he would say you know science is
a lie because it's language but you see the the
self-reference problem here is that if if darada is trying
to tell us that all use of language is a
lie he has to use language to tell us that
which means that he himself is lying so it's the
liar paradox in a different form so how does daredevil
avoid this problem well it's very sneaky i mean tricky
and his writings are notoriously obscure and convoluted precisely because
he's trying to use language to point to the fact
that all of language is a lie yet at the
same time he has to do it in such a
way where he's not directly contradicting himself and so that's
that's a very difficult uh tight rope walk to act
uh tight rope act to walk see that episode for
a fuller explanation there's the paradox of neuroscience which goes
like this if human experience is caused by chemicals which
neuroscience says is true then according to neuroscience all of
neuroscience is also caused by chemicals and is therefore just
a hallucination have you neuroscientists got this yet see neuroscientists
are so [ __ ] stupid and this also connects
to psychedelics when scientists or rationalists or skeptics reason about
psychedelics they're being so stupid because they say oh yeah
leo you talk about experiencing god on a psychedelic but
that's just all hallucination science tells us so neuroscience tells
us so it's just all chemicals okay let's take your
logic let's say that my experience of god is all
hallucination and all chemicals if that's true and i'm using
your logic here then that means all of neuroscience is
also just a hallucination and it's as unreal as my
claims to god why because neuroscience can only occur with
the chemicals in your brain you can't do neuroscience without
a brain according to neuroscience it's not according to me
according to neuroscience according to your own worldview you can't
do neuroscience you can't do science you can't do logic
without chemicals in your brain so you see if you're
going to use that logic against me i can use
it against you the problem though is that when people
use that logic against me and the things that i
say they're not actually honest actors they will use that
logic against me but then they will not allow the
same logic to be used against them it won't compute
in their mind because in their mind they think that
psychedelics are a hallucination and neuroscience is not a hallucination
my point is meta i make a metapoint that everything
is hallucination including neuroscience including logic including history including mathematics
it's all hallucination and it cannot work without chemicals in
your imaginary brain and by the way chemicals themselves of
course are a hallucination so you have a hallucination within
a hallucination which is the very essence and crux of
the self-reference problem but the self-reference problem is denied by
every single neuroscientist and materialist it would be funny if
it wasn't so stupid it's so [ __ ] stupid
like it's just it it it blows my mind how
stupid people can be about these matters and that's because
people can be otherwise rather intelligent and even high iq
but when it comes to the self-reference issue they're particularly
dumb about self-reflection because they don't self-reflect and the reason
they don't self-reflect is because if they self-reflected they would
[ __ ] die their whole worldview would collapse so
of course they don't self-reflect that's not an accident it's
not an accident that everybody sucks at self-reflection that's by
design if you didn't suck at self-reflection you'd realize you're
infinite you'd realize your gut and we wouldn't need to
be having this conversation i just have to look at
you and you'd look at me and we'd be done
i wouldn't need to shoot hour-long videos explaining this stuff
to you there's the paradox of logic it goes like
this if everything in logic must be proven which is
generally how logic works but then what about logic itself
logic itself as a scheme isn't provable because proof is
something logic is doing but if you expect everything to
be provable why are you accepting logic can you see
that you're accepting logic on faith you haven't proved logic
you've accepted it on faith which is the definition of
illogical logic is illogical there's a paradox about proof itself
the notion of proof itself is a paradox because how
can you prove what counts as valid proof see anything
you say is a valid proof i can always ask
as a skeptic i can always say well but prove
to me that that criteria for proof is itself valid
and in order to prove it you'll have to appeal
to some other criteria i can say to that criteria
what about prove to me that that criteria is valid
criteria and then you're going to appeal to more criteria
and this isn't going to be an infinite regress problem
you see because truth is actually a greater notion than
proof i've talked about that many times in the past
there's a paradox within logical positivism logical positivism was a
movement that was popular 100 years ago within science and
academia and to some degree it still is popular today
i mean it's still it's still active even though it's
kind of gone out of fashion it's still active in
in an implicit way logical positivism basically said that the
only kind of statements that are valid within science and
human knowledge are those which can be demonstrated empirically that's
what logical positivism was trying to say it was trying
to say that no statements are true unless they can
be shown empirically to be true but the problem here
via self reflection is that that statement itself is not
an empirically verifiable statement so you can be a logical
positivist but it's not an empirical position because in fact
you can't test every single statement in the universe to
test whether it is empirical or not logical positivism is
not an empirically verifiable position therefore it eats its own
tail and deconstructs itself so in order to be a
logical positivist you have to deny self-reflection and that's exactly
what logical positivists did you can use logical positivism on
everything else but you can't turn it in on itself
otherwise it collapses this is true of every single conceptual
paradigmatic scheme that you can imagine every epistemic scheme will
fall prey to this sort of self-reflection problem if you
reflect deeply enough but that is the key you have
to reflect deep enough which most people are not willing
to do because they suck at self-reflection and that's because
they don't want to self-reflect because if they did everything
they believed would collapse including science mathematics logic and logical
positivism skepticism and so forth then there's the paradox of
selflessness it goes like this if being selfless gives me
the greatest personal joy am i then not being selfish
you see what if i love being selfless more than
anything else in the world would i not then be
selfish if i was selfless that's right because there is
a profound connection between selflessness and selfishness these are not
two distinct things and in fact nothing in the universe
is distinct from anything else which is why these all
these dualities keep collapsing how about this the paradox of
love if you love everything then you must even love
the things you hate including your inability to love see
when you start doing spiritual work and you hear people
like me talking about love you start thinking to yourself
like okay leo so i'm gonna be i'm gonna commit
myself to a course of becoming more loving as a
person i'm gonna try to be more loving of everyone
including myself but then what you find is that as
you're trying to you know love certain things you know
someone's being a dick to you and and then you
find yourself incapable of loving that person and then you
start to feel bad like oh [ __ ] you
know that guy was a dick to me today so
i was a dick back to him and we got
into a fight and you know at the end of
the day you sit there and you reflect about it
and say [ __ ] you know i screwed up
i shouldn't have judged him he should have just been
able to be a dick to me i should have
just been more loving to him accept that and then
the situation would have worked out better i would have
been more loving and then i would have actually stuck
and i've been in alignment with the things leo was
talking about you know love and now you feel guilty
like [ __ ] i feel guilty now because i
wasn't loving enough and now i'm beating myself up for
not being loving enough to that person even though he
was a dick to me i should have been loving
to him and now i feel bad about it but
when i'm doing that i'm not loving myself you see
if i was truly being loving like leo teaches then
i would love myself even if i was a dick
to that guy and for any reason that's absolute love
that's true love that's the true lesson but you see
but it's tricky it's tricky there's a great quote that
i have used in the past some of you have
heard it but i'll say it again it's a it's
an old zen saying i love how beautiful paradoxical it
is it says quote there is no path but only
a fool doesn't walk it and quote there is no
path but only a fool doesn't walk it super important
spiritual principle because if you tell a newbie there is
no path the newbie will say oh okay well then
i shouldn't meditate anymore and i shouldn't do psychedelics and
i shouldn't do yoga i shouldn't do anything i'll just
be lazy and sit on the couch looking at porn
no that's not what it means when we say there
is no path walk the path that isn't there there's
a profound paradox about non-existence does non-existence itself exist contemplate
that one and of course there's a profound paradox related
to infinity and zero or everything and nothing see ordinarily
people think that infinity and zero are two different things
and that everything is the opposite of nothing or something
is the opposite of nothing but then of course when
you become infinitely conscious and you collapse all distinctions and
dualities you realize infinity is zero everything is nothing something
is nothing they're identical so here is the ultimate paradox
of the mind i'm going to quote here from the
ambrose pierce unabridged devil's dictionary it defines mind as quote
mind a noun a mysterious form of matter secreted by
the brain its chief activity consists in the endeavor to
ascertain its own nature the futility of the attempt being
due to the fact that it has nothing but itself
to know itself with end quote i just love that
it's deliciously self-referential deliciously paradoxical deliciously strange loopy which is
exactly correct the mind is a strange loop you see
the mind creates simplistic categories to make sense of reality
these categories include man versus woman matter versus anti-matter good
versus bad real versus fantasy science versus religion rational versus
irrational objective versus subjective and so on but all of
these categories dualities distinctions are finite while reality as a
whole is infinite there is no set of categories that
can be complete and they will always break down or
contradict themselves at the edges so science the reason science
isn't up to the task of understanding ultimate reality nor
is logic nor is skepticism nor is materialism nor is
dualism nor is realism is because all of these ideologies
and worldviews take for granted certain categories that they have
constructed and are not aware that they have constructed and
they assume that those categories are somehow absolute when no
category is absolute and no set of categories can ground
all of reality and this is being missed by all
these different worldviews and so science will always fail to
grasp the ultimate reality because science is nothing more than
a set of categories and ultimate reality is not one
set of categories ultimate reality is all possible sets of
categories including the category of non-science by definition science cannot
grasp all of reality because science itself is merely a
distinction within reality between science and non-science so if you
think all of reality is just science you're missing the
non-science in fact more of reality is non-scientific then it
is scientific and that's what you're missing here's a quote
to drive this point home quote the greeks observed a
paradox about the dyad dayad meaning duality while it appears
separate from unity its opposite poles remember their source and
attract each other in an attempt to merge and return
to the state of unity the dyad simultaneously divides and
unites repels and attracts separates and returns end quote that's
by priya hemingway beautiful beautiful articulation of what we're talking
about here the dyad everything in science is a dyad
everything your mind knows is a dyad big versus small
good versus bad etc etc even the dyad that you
created between you and leo you versus leo student versus
teacher you versus guru you versus god this is a
dyad these are dyads you created and every dayad must
loop back around and the the polar opposites of the
dyad must touch at which point they become one the
dyad becomes the monad and what we're talking about here
is monism monism is the philosophy that everything is one
and because everything is one everything is two and three
and four and five and six and seven and eight
and infinity so what i want you to deeply take
away from this episode is that all mental constructions must
be vulnerable to paradox why because ultimately reality is one
and all constructions use the assumption that reality is two
or more any time that you assume reality is anything
other than one you're setting yourself up for contradiction and
for paradox as long as you're open-minded enough to look
for it now if you want to close your mind
and deny the paradox or the contradiction you can do
that your mind has an infinite capacity for looking the
other way and not seeing your own internal contradictions but
then you should also contemplate the question of wait a
minute why are we taking contradiction for granted after all
non-contradiction versus contradiction is itself a duality so there's a
even deeper layer of self-reference problem here when we start
talking about contradiction why is contradiction such a bad thing
is it true that contradiction is inferior to non-contradiction see
most humans would say yes but is that true from
the absolute point of view see the reason that most
scientists and academic types are marginalizing contradiction and demonizing contradiction
is because contradiction breaks all formal systems if you allow
for a contradiction within any logical system that means anything
goes you can literally prove anything in a logical system
if contradiction is acceptable therefore every logical system has to
deny contradiction otherwise all hell breaks loose but you know
what is another word for anything goes and all hell
breaks loose infinity literally all hell breaks loose means everything
occurs infinity infinity is everything occurring now most scientists and
academics when they see infinity in their in their math
equations or in their uh in their work they get
scared because they can't now control infinity they can't define
infinity they can't work with infinity they can't use infinity
to construct something so they they have to manipulate their
work to hide the bursting forth of infinity or chaos
in their systems and models so scientists in practice they
don't like infinities because you can't crunch infinity you can't
put infinity into a calculator or into a computer it's
going to break it and they assume that that's something
like a bug of the system it's not a bug
of the system it's the feature of reality you got
it precisely backwards why do you assume contradiction is a
bad thing so what if contradiction destroys your whole system
maybe the truth is that your system is [ __
] and it needs to be destroyed how about that
how do you like them apples are you willing to
accept that not if you've staked your entire career on
building that system not if you get your paycheck from
that system not if your children are fed from that
system not if your electric bill is paid by that
system not if your intellectual ego is supported by that
system have you considered the possibility what if reality is
contradictory see you assume reality is not contradictory but how
do you know that can you see that that should
be an empirical question that you have to ask and
go and actually research you can't know this question a
priori but most people assume it a priority they don't
actually test it they just assume it and that turns
out to be a big [ __ ] mistake the
contradiction of your symbolic systems is not in any way
a bug of reality it is the key feature of
reality because it's those contradictions within your symbolic systems that
save you from being lost in your own finite walled
garden see if your finite system didn't contradict itself then
that means god could lock itself into a finite system
and then forever disconnect itself from god from unity from
love this would be a terrible design so god designed
reality in such a way that any time you take
a formal finite system and you try to say this
is it i've got reality in this finite formal system
god says if you look deep enough within that final
finite formal system you will always discover some loophole that
you can break through the system out into the larger
system but only if you're willing to look only if
you're truly interested in finding the loophole because if you're
not you will stay locked in that system forever so
another way to frame it is contradiction is when finity
tries to grasp infinity and it fails this is not
a mistake finity cannot grasp infinity actually it would be
a contradiction if any finite formal system could capture all
of reality without contradiction that would be the ultimate contradiction
which is what god cannot allow paradox is a sign
from god that all division must end in unity contradiction
paradox is inherent to any dualistic linguistic symbolic system any
logic mathematics science and philosophy if you think that your
worldview or your philosophical system is not contradictory what i'm
telling you is that it is and if you say
no leo it's not how can you be so sure
you haven't even heard my system yet my reply to
you is yes i'm 100 sure because whatever your system
is i don't care what the details of your system
are no matter what your system is if it's symbolic
if it's linguistic if it's conceptual it's got to be
dualistic and that means it's finite and the finite will
always contradict itself because it isn't infinite do you understand
the profundity of what i just said i have given
you the master skeleton key that will unlock every single
conceptual lock that exists in the human mind i've given
you the skeleton key to every lock in the [
__ ] world if you're wise enough to underst to
understand what i said and it's not difficult to understand
what i said but you have to you have to
really grok it which means you have to be very
open-minded about what i'm saying and you have to be
very detached from all of the other systems that you're
attached to see you have some sort of pet theory
pet world view whether it's a religious one atheistic one
rational or whatever it is logical one skeptical one scientific
one you're attached to that and so even though i
just gave you the skeleton key will you actually dare
to use the key to jailbreak your mind and free
yourself of the shackles you have put upon your own
mind do you dare to do that and what kind
of crazy things will you discover outside of that walled
garden that you've been constructing your whole life what kind
of monsters and dragons lurk in the sea of chaos
beyond your little walled garden madness lurks there the dragon
of chaos lurks there be careful or he'll bite your
ass here's a quote from lk samuels who says quote
paradoxes often arise because theory routinely refuses to subordinate to
reality end quote that is the crux of the matter
here humans are arrogant creatures and what i'm talking about
it might sound like what i'm talking about is intellectual
arrogance actually it's not i am speaking from a position
of deep epistemic humility the deepest epistemic humility is to
acknowledge to yourself definitively and conclusively and absolutely that all
of your theories about reality are not going to be
sufficient to grasp all of reality and therefore you must
be humble and you must subordinate your theories to reality
itself and so this is the chief sin and evil
of science and rationality is that even though they like
to put on an air of being humble like scientists
will say oh leo we we admit that we don't
know so much whereas you are sitting here talking about
god and other definitive things so you're the arrogant one
and we're the humble scientists no no no i'm the
humble one here you're the [ __ ] arrogant scientists
and rationalists because the humility in my position is that
i have i have realized and surrendered the notion that
i can formalize reality or model reality with any kind
of theoretical scheme whereas you actually believe you can and
that is your arrogance and then your claims to humility
that's just a a game you're playing to deny the
actual arrogance of your position every scientist is deeply deeply
arrogant in their epistemology because if they were truly humble
they would have to abandon all of science now you
might wonder but leo why why must theory always be
insufficient to grasp reality because theory is always a subset
of reality and not the whole of reality somewhere along
the road in your education as a scientist or a
rationalist or a skeptic or an academic what has happened
is that you were so brainwashed with theory that you
have mistaken theory for reality and the only way you
know how to understand or think about reality or even
interface with reality is via theory and of course there's
no reason why that should be the only method you've
just been brainwashed into it in the same way that
a fundamentalist muslim is brainwashed into islam and cannot interface
with reality in any other way they're stuck in that
paradigm it's a hermetically sealed self-justifying self-isolating walled garden which
keeps you from exploring the outer confines of the territory
in this way islam and science are exactly the same
now there are important distinctions between islam and science but
on this point there is no distinction now this question
of mystery becomes very important we've talked about it a
little bit earlier where i talked about demystification that bias
to demystify all of reality but you see what if
reality is a mystery fundamentally what does mystery mean actually
go look up the word mystery in the dictionary it'll
be illuminating for you here's after you do that uh
here's here's a little bit more of the full picture
for you of how profound mystery is this question of
mystery don't take this lightly see when we say that
reality is a mystery usually people think oh well that
just means like we haven't done enough science on it
if we do enough science on it it'll stop being
a mystery no no no that's not what i mean
when i say reality is a mystery that's a metaphysical
claim that's a profound epistemological claim what i'm saying is
that reality is that which cannot be known because it's
literally endless you see infinity is endless mystery that's not
a problem to be solved by doing more science the
way that scientists think you will never science your way
out of the mystery of infinity if you could know
infinity it would have an end to it meaning it
would be finite meaning it wouldn't be infinite meaning you
would be contradicting yourself so infinity has to be unknowable
and so ultimately what has to happen here is that
there needs to be a profound collapse between the duality
of knowledge and being or grounding it's not that there
is a ground to reality and there's knowledge knowledge of
the ground no knowing in ground are the same thing
here metaphysics and epistemology they collapse into each other into
immunity and then you're in non-dual non-symbolic absolute god consciousness
so paradox threatens science because it forces science then to
admit that there are other domains outside of science which
are valid legitimate and worthwhile to study but see science
wants a monopoly on truth a monopoly on reality science
wants to say that hey guys we got all this
everything that's real and true and and factual and objective
it exists within the the confines of our walled garden
that we've been curating carefully over the centuries and then
paradox says no that's not true so science is playing
a game where it's trying to deny validity to other
domains outside of science science cannot acknowledge other ways of
knowing because that makes science insecure about itself that makes
science wonder like huh well maybe maybe i'm not superior
to other schemes maybe i'm not better than religion maybe
i can learn something from religion or from spirituality or
from the new agers or from ufo phenomena or from
paranormal phenomena or from psychedelics but see science is too
arrogant to have this kind of epistemic humility to learn
from sources outside of itself because it wants to be
king it has crown itself king which is by the
very definition of what devilry is what satan is so
by definition science is devilry because it's trying to crown
itself as king within god's kingdom of which it's just
a small portion of the entire kingdom it's not the
whole kingdom and so for science this creates a slippery
slope because as you start to deconstruct science scientists become
more and more scared that the entire foundations of their
science are getting destroyed and their attachment is more to
science than the truth so then they start to play
games to prevent themselves from slipping down the slippery slope
which is why if you go show to some scientists
or academics my three-part series on deconstructing the myth of
science they're not going to sit through and watch the
whole thing and gr grock it and then uh actually
use the wisdom that's contained in that three-part series they're
gonna they're gonna try to dispute me or write snarky
comments or they'll just turn it off they won't finish
watching it why not because it's too threatening i mean
i'm not kidding you will you will realize if you
if you take that series seriously you will realize that
all of science is a myth it's something you're imagining
and furthermore the rational mind fears paradox it's not just
science also the rational mind why because paradox breaks rationality
it exposes the limits of rationality as a paradigm the
rational also has a bias to demystify everything and paradox
reveals that rationality is not all-encompassing there are many a-rational
and irrational aspects to the universe which rationalists are in
denial about because they want everything to be rational because
they just assume that everything is rational but why would
you assume everything is rational see the paradox here it's
so funny the paradox is that it's actually irrational to
be stubbornly rational notice the strange loop of this this
isn't an accident all right this is uh the first
part of this i'm going to take a quick intermission
here for a little break and then i'll be back
in a second to finish this up all right let's
continue i have a series of profound quotes for you
about this whole topic that we've been discussing so here
we go it's a collection of various authors and thinkers
and philosophers so here's the first one quote the commonest
kind of trouble is that the world is nearly reasonable
but not quite life is not an illogicality yet it
is a trap for logicians it looks just a little
more mathematical and regular than it is end quote that's
from gk chesterton furthermore quote if you follow reason far
enough it always leads to conclusions that are contrary to
reason end quote by samuel butler and also quote relying
on words to lead you to the truth is like
relying on an incomplete formal system to lead you to
the truth a formal system will give you some truths
but a formal system no matter how powerful cannot lead
to all truths end quote from douglas hofstadter also quote
reason is limited in that it does not afford the
capacity for the discernment of essence or the critical point
of a complex issue and generally disregards context reason does
not itself provide a guide to truth it produces massive
amounts of information and documentation but lacks the capability to
resolve discrepancies and data and conclusions all philosophic arguments sound
convincing on their own although reason is highly effective in
a technical world where the methodologies of logic dominate reason
itself paradoxically is the major block to reaching the higher
levels of consciousness and transcending this level is relatively uncommon
in our society end quote that's from david hawkins and
also quote in our modern world we have inaugurated the
reign of a dull bourgeois rationalism which finds some inadequate
reason for all things in heaven and earth and makes
a god of its own infallibility end quote by john
buchan and also quote beware of him in whom reason
has become the greatest and most terrible of passions end
quote by freeman dyson and also quote the supreme function
of reason is to show man that some things are
beyond reason end quote by blaise pascal so these are
what some of our greatest thinkers and philosophers who have
gone into the trans-rational domains have to say about reason
and logic this is what people who are stuck in
rationalism and reacting against pre-rational worldviews do not yet comprehend
and so if you're stuck in the rational paradigm and
you're fretting over the pre-rational and you think that what
i'm trying to teach you here is the pre-rational you're
not getting that there's a step beyond the rational which
is the trans-rational which is where i'm speaking to you
from but you need to be wise enough to to
see that distinction otherwise you're going to fall into the
pre-rational trans-rational fallacy so actually logic and reason secretly rely
on intuition and infinite intelligence to actually do the heavy
lifting this is the big takeaway from girdle's work there's
something more fundamental at work when you are doing mathematics
and when you are logicing reality than merely your logic
you have to ask yourself what is the source of
logic what makes logic function at all and that would
be actually intuition or infinite intelligence and actually if you
carefully study western intellectual tradition if you study the greatest
scientists the greatest thinkers the greatest philosophers what you realize
is that the greatest thinkers have always used highly non-linear
forms of reasoning intuition and trans-rational modes of thinking and
what is called vision logic this is what our greatest
scientists and logicians and mathematicians have always relied upon to
make great leaps paradigm shifts within science and logic and
mathematics so there's an interesting paradox at the heart of
science and mathematics and rationality is that all the greatest
scientific discoveries were actually made not by left-brained number crunching
they were made by mystical leaps of intuition and if
you don't believe me carefully study the works of the
greatest thinkers philosophers scientists and logicians study einstein study newton
study leibniz study galileo study carl gauss niels bohr the
fathers of quantum mechanics like heisenberg schroedinger david baume richard
feynman leonardo da vinci charles darwin nicola tesla kurt gerdel
george cantor ramanujan the famous indian mathematician who was a
math prodigy he was able to see mathematical proofs and
insights without actually having to go through any formal process
to arrive at the proof see many so-called scientifically-minded people
actually have a very poor understanding of the history of
science deeply study what actually made science work what made
science work is very rare individuals who had access to
higher levels of consciousness and intuition beyond those of most
scientists and academics of their era and then in retrospect
what we do is we incorporate we integrate into our
culture the developments and discoveries of these intellectual giants and
we tend to rationalize it to ourselves oh they were
just strictly rational logical empirical people and that's how they
arrived at their conclusions and their discoveries but the answer
is no that's not how they did it that's not
how einstein did it that's not how nikola tesla did
it that's not how kurt gerdel did it they used
a mystical intuition to achieve their results and then in
retrospect after hundreds of years have passed now as a
culture we look back at those people and say oh
yeah of course it was obvious their discoveries were just
obvious and it was all logical and rational and scientific
no it wasn't not at the time when george cantor
for example discovered multiple orders of infinity which led to
the creation of seth theory and so forth modern set
theory his work was completely denounced and demonized by his
colleagues for being some sort of superstitious woo nonsense garrett
cantor who today if you go to a math class
or a a logic class they will revere him as
one of the you know intellectual giants but he also
happened to be a deeply religious man and he believed
that his discovery of mathematical infinities was the discovery of
god see but modern materialists and scientists and rationalists and
skeptics and atheists are completely in denial about this go
read the works of isaac newton he was a deeply
religious woo-woo guy he practiced alchemy he talked about infinity
he talked about the mystery of nature the infinite mystery
of nature and yet today when they teach about isaac
newton it's as though he was just this strictly left-brained
guy who was just using pure logic and pure reason
to understand nature no that's not what he was doing
that's not how he developed calculus he used profound levels
of intuition to do that and it was radical and
nobody unders understood his work at the time when he
was doing it i mean leibniz leibniz was was doing
it also he was co-developing calculus but aliveness is also
a great example of of a deeply intuitive uh trans-rational
guy who was not limiting his mind just to the
little you know walled garden that most academics and scientists
and thinkers limit themselves to so here are some quotes
about albert einstein who is a brilliant example of this
i actually spent quite a bit of time just taking
courses and studying the work and life of albert einstein
i actually studied his philosophy i studied his metaphysics i
studied his approach because to me what's more interesting about
einstein is not his theory per se like they will
teach physicists general relativity and special relativity in college physics
classes but what they don't teach is actually how einstein
developed it what it actually took for him to be
able to think in the relativistic ways that he thought
they don't really teach that and they don't teach einstein's
philosophy of science because einstein had some sharp critiques against
the way that science and academia was done so did
by the way kurt gerdel he had some sharp critiques
too of how dense most logicians and academics were which
was why they were not able to achieve his results
but he was likewise with einstein likewise with nikola tesla
likewise with garrett cantor these were all brilliantly intuitive minds
highly non-linear so here's a quote by albert einstein quote
when i examine myself and my methods of thought i
come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination
has meant more to me than any talent for absorbing
absolute knowledge all great achievements of science must start from
intuitive knowledge i believe in intuition and inspiration at times
i feel certain that i am right while not knowing
the reason end quote you see but many of today's
academics and scientists would actually outlaw this method of doing
science they call this woo here's another quote from psychology
today describing einstein's epistemic attitude quote einstein first described his
intuitive thought processes at a physics conference in kyoto in
1922 when he indicated that he used images to solve
his problems and found words later einstein explicated this bold
idea at length to one scholar of creativity in 1959
telling max wertheimer that he never thought in logical symbols
or mathematical equations but in images feelings and even musical
architectures end quote you see so was einstein being scientific
or not if you say he wasn't then perhaps the
most quintessential scientific discovery of all time which is general
relativity is not proper science on the other hand if
you consider it proper science then be honest with yourself
about how it was actually discovered it wasn't discovered how
you think it was discovered it was discovered via leaps
of mystical intuition and you might say oh leo but
you are just you're just projecting mysticism onto einstein no
i'm not actually read about einstein's mysticism read about his
reverence for spinoza who was an idealist who was a
deist who believed in god so which is it is
is einstein the greatest scientist of all time or isn't
he and if he is then how could he have
been so stupid to talk about god see this is
a sort of paradox that that you rationalists and scientifically-minded
people um and materialists simply aren't comprehending deeply enough how
about isaac newton was isaac newton one of the most
brilliant scientists of all time if he was why did
he practice alchemy why did he study the occult why
did he talk about god why did he talk about
infinity see today's scientists and materials think that oh well
yeah leo sure einstein and newton they got some things
right but but other things they got wrong they were
stupid in other areas were they really stupid in other
areas or are you stupid in other areas be careful
about confusing your stupidity for their stupidity and now i
want to quote a little bit about ramanujan who was
this brilliant indian hindu prodigy in mathematics he developed some
of the greatest discoveries in mathematics that were basically considered
impossible by his colleagues and the world's greatest mathematicians what's
even more amazing is how he did it so here's
a quote about that quote a deeply religious hindu ramanujan
credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity and said that
the mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by
his family goddess he had visions of scrolls of complex
mathematical content unfolding before his eyes he once said quote
an equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses
a thought of god end quote that's from wikipedia furthermore
quote suppose that we rate mathematicians on the basis of
pure talent on a scale from zero to a hundred
hardy hardy was ramanujan's colleague and advisor in the uk
hardy gave himself a score of 25. he gave j.e
littlewood a score of 30 david hilbert a score of
80 and ramanujan 100. end quote so what happened was
that hardy discovered ramanujan and his amazing mathematical talents his
intuitive talents and then he brought ramanujan over to the
uk to to work in their universities to help him
to make groundbreaking discoveries within mathematics unfortunately ramanujan fell ill
and died at a very young age like in his
late 20s or early 30s and so if he lived
a full life who knows what kind of amazing mathematical
contributions he could have made with his intuitive talents but
his life was cut very short but even so he
he was still able to make incredible contributions to mathematics
and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all
time and if you want a little bit more about
that go check out the movie called you can find
this on youtube it's a free free movie you can
watch called the man who knew infinity it's a biography
basically a very well done biography of ramanujan i'm going
to post a link down below the video and i'm
going to also post a link on my blog so
check that out i highly recommend you watch this movie
because it'll it'll get you to understand what i'm pointing
to with this entire conversation i'm pointing to something very
profound and i'm afraid that many of you guys will
will not grasp it you'll miss it you'll miss the
profanity of what's being said here so watch that movie
it'll it'll help you to integrate what i'm teaching here
at a deeper more emotional more intuitive level for you
so it's not just purely rational so why is paradox
important paradox is important because a proper understanding of paradox
is what allows you to go from the rational to
the to the trans-rational to vision logic and beyond to
understand reality at profoundly higher levels than is possible with
the ordinary logical mind you cannot do this if you
don't confront paradox directly and some of these issues i've
been talking about here you have to confront this stuff
very directly and you have to let it affect your
entire world view and how you think about science logic
rationality atheism and other things like this paradox is also
important because it shows you the limits of language logic
and mind it sort of is a gateway paradoxes are
a gateway to transcend the finite mind paradox is also
important because it's humbling paradox humbles the arrogant rational mind
which thinks that understands everything or that it will understand
everything through its preconceived methods and paradigm and ultimately paradox
is important because of spirituality paradox is a gateway to
spirit absolute truth god infinite consciousness love which are the
most important things that are missed by modern science mathematics
and logic rationality materialism atheism all of these isms are
missing the most important aspect of reality they're missing the
spirit and soul of the mind they have de-spirited the
mind thereby crippling their own minds and the collective mind
of our species weak minds cannot handle paradox paradox is
a clue that reality is groundless and infinite in its
ultimate nature but you have to be open enough and
fearless enough to accept these clues you have to be
willing to connect the dots between all the different paradoxes
and to see what is the common root that is
sourcing all paradox whether in logic science or elsewhere and
the deepest example of paradox is god itself because one
definition for god which is a very powerful definition is
that god is that which created itself so one of
the things that i know i struggled with as an
atheist the most when it came to the god question
is i had a very difficult time accepting the idea
of god when i was younger when i was a
materialist and an atheist because according to my logic i
was thinking like this i was thinking that god is
like a some sort of supreme being but then if
you posit god to explain where the universe came from
then you need some other thing beyond god that will
explain where god came from because otherwise what does god
really explain so to me it felt like positing god
was a cop-out and it didn't really resolve any deep
existential issues it just pushed the problem back one level
well what i later came to realize of course is
that god is not like other objects in the universe
other objects in the universe do not create themselves objects
in the universe are sourced by some other object have
you noticed this like your body did not create itself
it came out of your mother's body and your car
didn't create itself it came out of a factory and
that factory didn't create itself it came out of some
other factory and the first factory came out of you
know furnaces and forges that were not yet factories and
so on for everything in the universe the earth came
out of the sun or the early gas clouds that
were orbiting the sun and then the sun came out
of some other place like the big bang you might
say you know whatever you're always going to find this
sort of chain this nested chain but then see if
you assume god is just like one more object like
that then you say well then god must have some
other source too right no you don't understand that god
is absolute god is not a part of the universe
god is the entire universe so when we're speaking about
god we're speaking about the totality of everything and so
when we're speaking about the totality of everything what you
have to realize is that thing created itself it has
the power to create itself which is the ultimate paradox
the ultimate strange loop how can something create itself you
might think this is impossible it's a logical impossibility but
what you don't understand yet what you're not conscious of
yet is that for god because it imagines what is
possible and what is impossible nothing is impossible therefore god
is so unlimited it is able to literally create itself
how is that possible see if you tell a scientist
that the universe created itself this is not going to
compute in the normal scientist's mind in the materialist mind
because it's not logical how can something create itself but
then again how can something exist unless it created itself
where else could the universe come from other than from
itself and you can only understand this if you understand
and appreciate paradox and strange loops infinity of course itself
is a very paradoxical notion there are many paradoxes that
stem from infinity and see scientists and materialists and rationalists
make a mistake here because when they start thinking about
infinity they run into these paradoxes their logical mind does
at least and then they take that as evidence of
the fact that infinity must not be real it can't
be actual it can't exist it's like a unicorn we
can think about it but it can't be real but
it is real it's everything you see around you so
what are some of the paradoxes of infinity well for
example if infinity is infinite then it must also be
finite because if infinity wasn't also finite then it actually
wouldn't be infinite because to be truly infinite you must
include the finite in the infinite otherwise you're missing the
finite you see infinite means you're not missing anything it's
all encompassing its total a further paradox of infinity is
that if reality or infinity is absolute unity then it
must also be divided but leo i thought unity was
the opposite of division how could absolute unity also be
infinitely divided but how could it not you see because
if your unity excluded division then it wouldn't be unity
it would be division because you would be dividing unity
from division that's division that's not unity so unity paradoxically
must include all possible divisions so there are interesting paradoxes
here such as how could god have created itself that
seems logically impossible how uh for example the question of
can god destroy itself that's an interesting paradox that applies
to infinity there are interesting paradoxes about stuff that's beyond
absolute infinity you can ask the question like well can
there be something beyond absolute infinity and you can think
about that and play interesting games with yourself and as
soon as you imagine something beyond absolute infinity you have
to reincorporate it within absolute infinity because absolutely is absolute
but then you can keep imagining stuff beyond and then
you have to keep reincorporating it you're playing this infinite
game or the question of are other people real or
imaginary this is a question that many of you guys
struggle with with this solipsism question and this is really
just a the reason that this question is so tricky
and difficult i'll talk about solipsism in the future in
its own episode but it's really so tricky and difficult
because it's paradoxical you're trying to understand and you're trying
to put infinity into some sort of box like idealism
or solipsism or some other ism but it's none of
those it transcends all of that it's more radical than
all of that but your mind your finite mind wants
to lock it down he's like oh leo is talking
about solipsism and it like wants to lock it down
but i'm actually not talking about is i'm talking about
god i'm talking about infinity that's more radical than solipsism
and you're not going to get a clear answer to
this question of are other people real or imaginary because
you're making a distinction there between real and imaginary and
you're assuming that distinction and so you're running into paradoxes
when you're thinking about do other people really exist paradoxes
within paradoxes you're not going to be able to solve
those paradoxes at the level of mind that you're at
you can only resolve them by increasing your consciousness and
then incorporating all of these dualities into a deep unity
and only then will the paradox truly resolve so here's
what i want you to understand the big takeaway from
this episode is that all paradox is what happens when
you try to put infinity into a finite box infinity
is such a thing that it refuses to be put
into a box because infinity cannot be a box infinity
is that which has no boundaries a box has boundaries
and yet at the same time infinity does allow itself
to be boxed in it's just that that's one box
out of an infinite number of different boxes there are
an infinite number of ways that you could box infinity
and yet none of them are the entirety of infinity
you could box infinity as science as mathematics as logic
as islam as the new age as christianity as buddhism
as hinduism as judaism as nazism as postmodernism you see
and this keeps going it keeps going forever so what
you have to understand is that if absolute truth is
ever spoken it will always sound paradoxical but the mistake
people make is that when they hear paradoxical contradictory speech
about absolute truth they hear it and they say ah
that's contradictory therefore it must be false no this is
not a mistake stop thinking this is a mistake absolute
truth must be self-contradictory whenever it's spoken or thought about
or modeled or systematized in any way if you try
to put absolute truth into an equation your equations will
break if you try to hold absolute truth in your
mind your mind will break if you try to capture
absolute truth into language your language will break that's not
because absolute truth isn't real it's because absolute truth is
more real than whatever you're trying to contain it in
so be careful about that mistake here's an analogy to
help you out you've seen maps of the earth the
classical map of the earth is the mercator projection where
you see the continents laid out but if you compare
the mercator projection to an actual globe you'll find that
the size of the continents are significantly distorted in the
mercator projection because the mercator projection is trying to take
a three-dimensional object which is a globe and project it
and map it onto a two-dimensional surface and this is
impossible to do it's an impossible task and yet the
task is still attempted and it's still useful if you
look at a mercator projection if you look at the
size of greenland or antarctica and compare it to africa
or to europe you'll see that greenland looks as though
it's the size of africa or europe and when i
was a kid i actually thought greenland was that big
but then when you look at a globe you see
how small greenland is the mercator projection distorts the size
of continents especially towards the top and bottom poles the
north and south pole so if you want to really
understand the earth you have to look at a globe
you have to work with globes and also if you
take a mercator projection and you try to actually use
like a ruler to measure distances between points on a
mercator projection to like see where your airplane flight is
going to be if you've ever done this you think
like you know flying from los angeles to to russia
for example to moscow you might think that you know
you just take a ruler on a mercator projection you
just draw a straight line from from los angeles to
moscow and it's like a straight line that goes like
this kind of like maybe at a 45 degree angle
but then if you actually look at the flight paths
of airplanes that fly from los angeles to moscow you
see that they fly in a completely different direction when
they're flying they don't fly over those countries you thought
you would fly over if you were going to just
do a straight line on a mercator projection they fly
across the north pole because that's actually the shorter route
on a on an actual globe surface which is what
the earth is and so the actual flight paths of
airplanes when you take them are very different from what
you thought they would be by looking at a mercator
projection so something analogous to this is going on when
you are talking about absolute infinity or god because your
speech and your thoughts about it your models of it
your explanations of it are all like these oversimplified maps
these mercator projections which don't really do justice to the
the true thing and so what's required to access god
is to go beyond all the projections and by the
way everything i speak you might say well leo but
isn't there a self-reference problem here because actualize.org is teaching
about god and yet you're saying that all teachings about
god are in a certain sense distortions and falsehoods they
aren't really truly god therefore what about actual israelite teachings
and of course that's correct actual israelite teachings are fully
self-conscious which means that they understand their own limits i'm
not sitting here deluding myself that my speech about absolute
truth is the same as absolute truth which is actually
why i advocate for psychedelics so strongly because psychedelics will
actually take you to absolute truth whereas my words cannot
my words are a mercator-like projection of the absolute truth
we can further extend this analogy if you've ever looked
at four-dimensional objects projected into three-dimensional spaces it's the same
sort of problem so think of god or infinity as
a four-dimensional object how do you display a four-dimensional cube
when our reality is only three-dimensional well go take a
look go google for tesseracts google four-dimensional cubes and take
a look at how four-dimensional cubes are actually projected into
three-dimensional space and try to understand from looking at three-dimensional
projections of a four-dimensional hypercube tesseract try to actually get
an intuitive grasp of what the actual tesseract is the
four-dimensional thing because what you see depicted in three-dimensional drawings
are not the tesseract i can show you an unlimited
number of different projections of the tesseract in three-dimensional space
and you're never gonna really understand what a tesseract is
from that because they're all distortions just like the mercator
projection so that is something i want you to keep
in mind for the rest of the time that you
continue to listen to me and to learn from other
spiritual teachers and you take notes on all this stuff
and information wisdom that i teach you through actualize.org you
have to understand that actualize.org is a mercator-like projection of
the real stuff that i'm pointing to and talking about
do not confuse the projection do not confuse the teachings
for the actual thing that is being pointed at got
it now you might wonder but leo i want to
know is ultimate reality itself paradoxical because it seems like
you're saying that paradoxes are something that the finite mind
is creating when it's doing these projections but what about
reality itself the answer here is no ultimate reality is
not paradoxical because it is infinite and it's conscious of
its own infinitude and the contradictions only arise when you
try to take infinity and you try to put it
into some kind of symbolic system some finite system like
math language logic reason explanations a religious framework a scientific
framework a materialist framework that's when you get the contradictions
and paradoxes so in other words what i'm saying is
that if you actually stop your mind stop it from
thinking the paradoxes will disappear but if you're addicted to
thinking if the only way you know how to interface
and understand reality is through thinking then do you see
the problem there you're always going to be fighting and
wrestling with these paradoxes and contradictions within your own mind
it's going to be a never-ending struggle you're going to
have to either confront them or you have to somehow
avoid them and play a game of denial about them
however at the same time since infinity contains all finite
domains infinity is at the same time paradoxical so the
paradox of infinity is that infinity is not paradoxical and
infinity is paradoxical you see because paradox is a feature
of the finite mind but the finite mind is a
feature of the infinite mind but leo be straight with
me stop stopping all contradictory is paradox really real no
it's not yes it is there's a great quote by
meister eckhart the christian mystic who says quote only the
hand that erases can write the true thing end quote
contemplate that what does that mean furthermore douglas hofstadter says
quote zen is holism carried to its logical extreme if
holism claims that things can only be understood as wholes
not as sums of parts zen goes further in maintaining
that the world cannot be broken into parts at all
to divide the world into parts is to be deluded
and to miss enlightenment end quote and walt whitman says
quote do i contradict myself very well then i contradict
myself i am large i contain multitudes end quote so
in conclusion what i want you to remember for as
long as you watch my content and you listen to
me is that everything i ever say to you is
only relatively true it is true assuming a certain point
of view a certain paradigm a certain perspective a certain
vantage point a certain context a certain goal that i
have in teaching you something for your own benefit this
is all relative you cannot take any actualized teaching as
absolute truth and yet at the same time i'm not
contradicting myself when i say that i'm talking about absolute
truth do you get it the things i say are
only true assuming a certain point of view and so
when you listen to me you have to understand that
i'm speaking from a certain point of view and for
you to understand you have to recognize what that point
of view is and try to stand within that point
of view otherwise the things i'm saying are not going
to make sense to you this is relativity at its
purest i cannot give you a precise articulation of reality
and the reason that is because reality is infinite if
you think anyone can give you a precise articulation of
reality you're a fool and you haven't understood the communication
in this episode so contemplate contemplate contemplate contemplate until you
finally get it you
