hey what's up this is leo for actualize.org and today
we're covering the topic of living a big life all
right so there's a distinction that i got from brandon
burchard uh his experts academy seminar and the distinction that
i got is one of living a comfortable life versus
living a charged life so what is this distinction well
a comfortable life is the kind of life that you
imagine is the one that's going to make you the
most happiest and that's probably the kind of life that
you're living right now so a comfortable life is you've
got your career down you're you're pretty good with your
finances you've got a good family situation maybe you've got
a good relationship you've got a good marriage a good
family situation and you're just kind of comfortable and now
you're in this place where you can just kind of
relax unwind you have time to do to chill out
to lay back and you're happy you're kind of like
in heaven you know maybe the kind of life that
you would have if you won the lottery and you
didn't have to do anything anymore that's like the comfortable
life the charge life is the life where you're out
there and you're pushing your comfort zone you're doing things
that are scary you're doing things that seem a little
bit out there adventurous and are not things that you
would normally do things where you're pushing yourself you're learning
new things you're taking risks that's the charged life and
that kind of life you're on your edge you're excited
sometimes you're a little bit afraid other times you're thrilled
because you're able to to to persevere through your limits
other times you hit up against those limits and you
fail and you fall down and you have to go
back you have to reevaluate you're always learning new things
that's the charge life the question is what kind of
life are you living are you living a comfortable are
you living a charged life well i want to challenge
you to live the charged life because even though the
comfortable life seems like it's going to be the most
pleasant i think what you find after you either have
gotten there or after you do a lot of personal
development work then you tend to see that that's an
illusion and that you're not really that happy when you're
living a comfortable life you're much more happy when you're
living on the edge with this charged life and so
to help you understand this i will exercise all right
and i want you to do this along with me
so you're going to pause this video do this exercise
and the exercise is very simple what are the top
five things that you're most proud of in your life
from birth up to this point in your life take
a look run run past your personal history and take
a look what are the five things you're most proud
of all right go ahead and just make a bulleted
list of five things and i'm doing this too i
already did this exercise so i'm going to share my
results with you and then we're going to compare and
we're going to get some interesting insights out of this
so pause the video right now go ahead and do
that exercise and i'm going to give you a second
and then you can come back and we'll talk about
it all right i hope you did the exercise you
did it right this is another actually a tangent that
i'm going to go off here on is this idea
that you have to do exercises there's a tendency to
want to just listen to me talk and talk and
talk or if you're reading a book to read the
book read the book read the book and then not
do the exercises or not do the things that they're
telling you to be doing or if you're at a
seminar if they're telling you to do exercises there's a
tendency to not want to do those you have to
do that what i found big one of the biggest
lessons that i've learned from personal development if you want
actual results from listening to all this stuff and not
just be doing a mental jerk-off then you have to
be doing the stuff you have to go out there
and implementing the theory and at the very least what
you should be doing is doing the exercises really you
should be doing more than just the exercises you should
be going out there then and then applying everything you're
learning in your in your life but i hope you
did that exercise it's really really important if you didn't
then you're only getting about five percent of what you
could be getting from what i'm talking about or from
reading a book or from going to a seminar so
do that exercise that's where 95 of the gold is
all right so if you've gone through and you listed
the things that you're most proud of the five things
then you probably got a list similar to mind and
for me i'm going to quickly rattle off the list
and i'm going to go into a little bit of
detail on some of these sub points but not all
of them so for me the top five things were
first my education the education that i got from high
school and from college and the way that it's carried
over for me to today second point is the the
game project that i worked on after college called lost
spires and it became successful and ultimately led to my
getting hired as a game designer uh with otherwise no
experience in one of the best studios in the world
and so that was huge for me the third point
is pick up getting involved in the pickup community learning
about how to get better with women dating women relationships
those sorts of things so getting involved with that has
given me huge payoffs that i can't even begin to
enumerate right now the fourth point was losing 65 pounds
in five months which i did back in college and
there i decided to take my fitness and get into
shape get my nutrition into shape because before that basically
my whole life i grew up overweight 65 pounds overweight
and i was that way through high school and through
college caused a lot of problems for me and then
i got that taken care of and i still have
the the results of that today after about eight years
so that was one of the most proud moments of
my life and then the last one is after i
did get that game design job in boston i spent
about a year working there and then i decided to
leave it to quit and to start my own business
for me that was a really really challenging decision it
was a big inflection point in my life and i'm
really proud of the fact that i made that decision
went through the struggle of starting my own business which
led me to kind of where i am today financially
independent and able to to work for myself and do
these cool things that i do that most people don't
have the opportunity to do like shoot this video and
so those are my five points the question is what
are your five points and the more important question is
and this is the second part of the exercise that
i want you to pause the video and go out
and do is i want you to go through this
list and rate on a scale of one to ten
how challenging each of these five points was for you
so by what i mean here is you're gonna rate
it on a low scale you're gonna rate if something
was very easy for you to accomplish then you're gonna
rate it like a one or a two and if
it was really challenging for you to accomplish and you
rate it a nine or a ten and if it
was something average then you rate it somewhere in between
so from one to ten go ahead pause the video
right now and give a rating a ranking to each
of these uh each of these five points that you've
got and then come on back all right cool so
you gave each of your five points a rating and
now if you did this exercise what might have shocked
you kind of what like what shocked me when i
did it was that my ratings for each of these
were off the scale they were like nines and tens
all these things that i'm really proud of what i've
discovered is that the reason i'm really proud of them
is because they were hard you know i did have
to take some take on some risks to do them
i had to go outside my comfort zone i had
to do things that i didn't know that i was
capable of and i had to grow and learn a
lot in order to accomplish each one of these and
i didn't know that i was going to be able
to accomplish them so this is what i mean by
living a charged kind of life right it's the things
that you're most proud of in your life and the
things that grow you the most the things that give
you the best long-term payoff in your life are the
things that are really difficult and these are not the
things that you can just coast through life and accomplish
and get these are the things you have to work
your ass off for and these are the things you
have to toil for and you have to put out
emotional labor to get and sometimes you don't get them
and sometimes you do and so this exercise keys you
in on that because there is this naive tendency to
think that living the easy life is where it's at
that's where you're gonna be the most happiest you know
just sitting on your couch getting stoned or playing video
games or watching tv if you could just do that
your whole life then wouldn't that be nice wouldn't that
be comfortable but that's not what life is really about
and if you want to accomplish um the greatest things
that you can accomplish with your life if you want
to contribute really to your life if you want to
get those peak experiences that sense of contribution those really
exciting peak experiences that you could be getting the reason
that you're not getting more of those right now is
because you're not challenging yourself enough and each of us
has had moments in our lives where we've challenged ourselves
to accomplish something more where we had a vision of
what we can do where maybe external circumstances just forced
us to go out there and work really hard each
of those cases now we feel really proud of because
we did have to grow we didn't have to learn
new stuff and now we're proud of it and when
you're going to be on your death bed you're going
to be lying there it's these moments that you're going
to be really really proud of and the difference between
going to be having a successful life at that point
and having kind of a mediocre life full of regrets
is going to be how many times did you challenge
yourself how many times did you step up to your
highest potential how many times did you did you choose
that path of growth versus that path of comfort and
if you do that a lot then you're gonna have
an exciting life and if you did that a little
then you're going to have a regretful life and honestly
your life is not going to be as happy as
you think it is it's going to be quite miserable
because when you're sitting there watching that tv or sitting
there getting stoned or whatever it is you're doing you're
in that comfortable little little spot deep down inside you
have that guilt that guilt of knowing that you could
be doing more that guilt of knowing that you're not
really living your full life you're not getting the most
out of life when you're living like that and that
is what i want you to avoid to avoid that
kind of problem to avoid that midlife crisis down the
road you want to stop that right now and the
way that you do that is you realize that in
life not every day but a lot of times you
get these inflection points you get these decision points where
you get to decide am i going to step it
up am i going to take that path of growth
or am i going to stay in my comfort zone
and take the path of comfort and abraham maslow talks
about this and this is one of the ways to
really develop and become self-actualized and to work on your
self-actualization is to learn to spot these inflection points and
you can have they can be little they can be
small or they can be big the ones that i
talked about here for me personally were big right these
like for example starting my own business that was a
very critical inflection point in my life and i remember
just like it like it was yesterday i remember standing
there in my apartment in boston and thinking about whether
i should quit my job because i had a good
job whether i should quit that and i had a
lot of promise there and cut that path off or
whether i should go and start my own business which
i didn't know whether it was going to be successful
i knew i had to work really hard at it
and i also knew that if i was leaving this
job then i would never be coming back to uh
to the game development industry because i already had the
best job that i could have there what more could
i ask for if i if i didn't find that
satisfying there's no other job in the game in this
industry would have worked for me so for me that
was really tough choice but ultimately that there i decided
that uh the path of most growth for me would
be to do the business because that was something new
that was something scary that was something unknown and so
i went off and i did that and i'm really
proud for having done that today got a lot of
a lot of benefit from it from my financial independence
now but also from all the business experience that i've
gotten and now the fact that i have the the
freedom the free time and also the the money to
to start my new business which is shooting these videos
and doing personal development research and doing coaching so that
was huge huge huge for me and the same goes
for really the other all the other uh four points
that i mentioned my point here being is that sometimes
you get those big inflection points sometimes you get little
ones every day you have an opportunity to look at
your life and see okay here i could have pushed
myself a little bit more i could have choose chosen
that growth path a little bit more and instead maybe
you can see that you're choosing the comfortable path all
the time and if you are doing that then i
encourage you to challenge yourself start challenging yourself more you
can't always be perfect at challenging yourself sometimes you're going
to be tired sometimes you're going to feel weak and
you're just going to give in to that temptation to
to veg out but in general by doing this exercise
i hope you can see that those moments where you
did challenge yourself those were big and that's how you
create a really powerful amazing life and the people that
have those kinds of lives they got they didn't get
them by sitting on the couch they didn't get them
by just listening to a video or reading a book
they got them by going out there and actually living
life challenging themselves doing adventurous things doing things that are
outside their comfort zone doing things that are not in
their personality stereotype so really pushing themselves right and i
think that's what we admire about people like that is
when we see people out there killing it when we
see people out there doing crazy stuff that that is
uh out of character for them on some level we're
rooting for them because we know that that's the kind
of life that we want to live and there's a
tendency to want to live your life vicariously through them
but that's a problem right that's really what tv is
kind of like is that you watch tv and you
might watch a show about somebody doing something cool on
tv and you kind of resonate with that but then
you're what are you actually doing you're sitting at home
eating popcorn watching that show when instead you should be
out there doing that kind of stuff in real life
you should be engaged when you're engaged that's how you
create excitement that's how you create motivation so if you're
not motivated if you're not feeling like your life has
a lot of meaning if you're not feeling like your
life is as fulfilling as it could be if you
feel like you're in a dead end job if you're
in debt in relationship uh if stuff is just boring
for you and you're not getting the sense of thrill
that you see other people getting and you're wondering why
this is it you're not challenging yourself enough and the
first challenge that i'm going to put up for you
is do this exercise really think about it think about
points in your life where you chose to go the
growth route versus the the comfortable route and see what
kind of difference your life would would uh would have
what kind of difference in your life there would be
if all those growth choices that you chose if they
were all comfort choices so what if your life was
all comfort really think about that how great would your
life be i'm willing to bet that your life would
be pretty horrible right now you wouldn't do that you
wouldn't make that trade-off because even though those challenging times
were really challenging you had to work your ass off
for them and sometimes you had real moments of anguish
and self-doubt and frustration in the end whether you made
it through or maybe maybe you didn't even make it
through maybe you just quit whatever you still got something
out of that you pushed yourself right you were on
your edge you learned something about yourself and that grew
you for me there's no way that i would go
back and make some of these changes back in high
school and college i chose to really step it up
with my education and to really work hard and study
for me that was huge because that built and cultivated
a love of learning for me that i still have
right now and in fact that's why i'm doing personal
development research and i'm shooting these videos is because i
love to learn i love to analyze i love to
see what kind of things i can understand about the
world and then how those can be used to make
a better life for myself so for me that really
started back in uh in high school and in college
by challenging myself just really step it up and and
become a really good student and then of course uh
other things that i got involved in these other points
that i'm proud of from the game project that i
worked on after college which allowed me to uh to
create my first real successful game put it out there
see the sense of contribution that i got from it
put a lot of smiles on people's faces get over
a hundred thousand downloads of that game and ultimately got
my my dream job from that that was huge for
me i would not trade that for anything and and
then getting involved with pickup was also huge for me
led to my better understanding of of women got me
more self-confidence got me even further involved with personal development
because a lot of people that i met in the
community were self-development junkies so that got me involved with
that um just very very rewarding rewards that i'm still
seeing to this day from all that and of course
my health losing 65 pounds in five months for me
at the point when i decided to do that i
had been overweight my whole life very overweight and it
was a it was a big question as to whether
i was going to succeed i tried dieting in the
past and it hasn't worked for me and then at
that point i just decided to commit and to really
be disciplined about it ended up going to the gym
improving my diet and losing 65 pounds in five months
pretty good result i would say and i was able
to keep that off uh up to this day haven't
really fluctuated much in my weight since that was eight
years ago now and the health benefits that i got
the energy benefits that i've got uh have been huge
the confidence the boost that i got from being more
comfortable with with how i look liking myself more those
things were all huge and that would not trade those
for anything in the world so i'm really happy with
that decision and then of course starting my own business
i already talked about how huge that was for me
because that allows me to be doing what i really
love to do right now and i'm so so grateful
that i that i made that decision and went through
the pains of starting my own business and learning how
the business world works so those are my personal proudest
moments uh i'm curious to hear what yours are and
i want you to sit there and recollect and think
a little bit and wax nostalgic about what you're most
proud of because i think you'll find that when you
get a visceral sense for the importance of pushing yourself
and doing those challenging things then when you're faced with
those choices the comfort versus the challenging versus the comfort
choice when you're faced with those in the future you're
going to lean more towards the challenge and that's going
to lead to the kind of exciting life that you
want to be living all right so i'm gonna sign
off here i encourage you to do this exercise if
you haven't done it by now pause right now still
not too late go ahead and do it really really
important that you do the exercises and then i want
to hear from you i want your comments tell me
