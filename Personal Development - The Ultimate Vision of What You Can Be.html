hey this is Leo for actualised org and you know
what I've been thinking about right now is I've been
thinking about how to really articulate what actualize data really
is about and kind of what it is that we're
doing here and how it's a little bit different than
other personal development sources that are out there from books
to seminars to cds to other websites and blogs on
on this topic of personal development and what i've been
really thinking about is you know how do i really
articulate it what is it that i mean by personal
development and why am i so excited about it and
what is it that I want from you and one
thing that I know that I definitely want from you
is I want the same excitement in your life about
personal development that I have and I'm trying to figure
out how to communicate this and I had this idea
and the idea I had is that I remember a
long time ago when I was when I was a
teenager I really used to be into remote control cars
remote control remote control vehicles and remote control helicopters I
really loved helicopters and I used to own a big
gas helicopter at one point Islands and electric helicopters I
never got really good at them but it was just
such a damn expensive hobby at the time that I
just thought about that and I remember looking and seeing
videos online about really good RC helicopter pilots and the
kind of crazy stuff that they were able to do
like you can actually probably go right now and search
on youtube or on Google for some like RC helicopter
stunt flying and some of the crazy stuff that they're
able to do literally you can see a video of
like a 14 year old kid who takes this little
remote-control helicopter and it's not even one of those big
expensive ones it's like a little electric one and you
see him doing the most ridiculous insane things like you
can't even imagine the kind of things that this guy's
able to do he's able to do backflips he's able
to fly it upside down in Reverse like through the
wind spirals just like all sorts of stuff like really
low to the ground high up in the air it's
just nuts and I thought about that and I wondered
you know that was cool and even though I didn't
ever get even close to that level well the reason
I thought about that we because that's kind of what
I want for you with personal development and I also
was thinking about you know what what are the different
facets of personal development and what specifically do I even
mean by that word because it tends to be pretty
abstract and I think it tends to lose its meaning
when I use it so you know I want to
distinguish it from for example learning how to do nutrition
and I want to distinguish it from learning how to
do fitness like fitness exercises and I was thinking about
all these ideas and what I came up with was
this idea that personal development is really about learning how
to master yourself so it's a process of self mastery
and it's mastering your own psychology and it's understanding how
your brain functions and how to get the best performance
out of your brain and then your body and then
your life right it's how to create an awesome life
but ultimately what I find that boils down to and
what personal development is for me is about understanding your
own psychology because the reason that you're not having that
awesome life the reason that you're not getting the success
in life that you want and then this bubbles out
into all sorts of other areas you can bubble out
into nutrition and fitness and everything else in relationships but
ultimately the reason you're having problems there is because you're
not understanding your own psychology you don't have the facility
and the control of your own psychology that you need
to get those things in place and what I equated
that to and I created this analogy in my mind
is I'm like it's almost like me learning how to
fly a helicopter right when I first started flying a
helicopter for me it was challenging just to get the
thing to hover and lift up off the ground why
because actually if you've ever tried flying or helicopters those
things are pretty difficult to learn to fly and it's
really costly when you make a mistake at least it
was maybe 10 years ago nowadays I see them selling
little a little very flimsy RC helicopters for like 50
bucks and you can practice with those really easy but
when your helicopter cost a hundred dollars and it cost
a a thousand dollars rather and when it cost a
hundred dollars just to replace one blade if you broke
that and that blade broke if it basically touched anything
whether touched the ground or touched a tree or anything
furniture in your house then it basically broke so it's
really hard to learn fly and I remember just spending
hours and hours just like lifting the helicopter just a
few feet off the ground just up and down and
up and down and even there I managed to break
blades and how challenging that was and it was almost
like you know I was learning this machine this complicated
machine and I wanted to be able to do some
of those advanced maneuvers like flying upside down and doing
these cartwheels and all this cool stuff but I was
having difficulty just flying the thing straight and keeping it
steady and not crashing into things and I think that's
really what our condition is in life is that we're
born with this incredible body and we're born with this
incredible brain bye bye estimates from neuroscientists right now the
brain is the most complex organism / machine that we
know in the universe and of course we don't know
we haven't explored too many planets so that's a pretty
advanced statement to make but it is the most complex
thing that we know of on earth and it's really
fascinating because you've got hundreds of billions of neurons and
they're all interconnected all working and then of course you've
got layers and layers of operating system and different instincts
and emotions and logic and all this stuff that evolved
over millions of years and we've got this software in
our brain and now we're here we're trying to live
our everyday lives and we're trying to accomplish certain things
with our lives whether it's to build a business to
have a lot of money to have a time to
travel or to build an awesome family life you know
whatever it might be you're trying to build those things
but ultimately you're doing it through the machinery that you've
got and what do you really have you have this
body you've got this brain and you're trying to figure
out how to use these tools that you just kind
of ended up having being born with them and you
end up kind of just on your own trying to
figure out how it works I forget what book it
was but somewhere in some personal development book somebody talked
about the fact that you're born with this brain and
you're born as a human being an instruction manual and
I thought you know that's that's a really good analogy
it's kind of like trying to learn a helicopter right
and you don't really know how you don't have an
instruction manual and so you have to just kind of
figure it out on your own you're just like going
by touch-and-go and by instinct and you're doing doing a
lot of experimentation and you're using the process of trial
and error to learn how it works and that's what
I found basically I've been doing in my life up
to this point is doing a lot of trial and
error a lot a lot of error figuring out how
to get my finances up in order how to get
my nutrition handled how to get the kind of exciting
life that I want how to get the fulfillment in
life that I just intuitively know I can get but
I haven't been able to tap into yet so for
me that's been kind of the driving force is just
knowing that I think there's something big out there that's
possible that awesome awesome kind of life or I feel
super excited engaged all the time and I'm just now
starting to tap into that with all the stuff that
I've been learning and implementing and so if we make
this analogy between you learning how to use your brain
and your body and somebody learning to use and to
fly a remote-control helicopter I think that is what I
talked about with personal development and I think the biggest
bottleneck for us as humans is learning how to get
the results that we want and how to get the
fulfillment that we want is learning our own psychology because
when we're born we don't get an instruction manual and
even though modern society is really good about teaching us
mathematics and it's good about teaching us language and it's
good about teaching US history and science and all these
cool subjects that we learn in school in the end
I feel like we're really lacking right now in an
education in psychology and not the psychology that you learn
in psychology like freshman college courses in psychology like psychology
101 but I mean practical psychology psychology that you can
apply in the real world like the psychology of what
it takes to manage a good relationship the psychology involved
in managing an intimate relationship the psychology involved with raising
kids and being a parent the psychology involved with running
a business and being a leader the psychology involved with
making yourself happy not stressing yourself out having nice balance
between work and play in your life and then the
psychology of managing your money and the psychology of communicating
with other people and convincing them of your ideas being
able to do that and then of course just a
psychology of managing your own thoughts and expectations and moods
and feelings that's also really big and so I feel
like this psychology is lacking and in fact I think
it's almost like it's not just that people aren't teaching
us these things I think it's even worse than that
it's in fact that people are teaching us the wrong
things because when you grow up with siblings and you
grow up with friends and you grew up with with
your family generally what I find is that your your
surrounding environment the people that you're growing up around they
are not a familiar with the principles of psychological mastery
they haven't mastered that psychology within themselves and they set
a very poor demonstration for you when you're growing up
as to how all this stuff works so what I
find is that as you're growing up you get conditioned
with a lot of bad habits a lot of God
patterns one example is worrying all the time another example
is being very critical and judgmental of other people and
also yourself other example is various limiting beliefs that people
grow up with limiting beliefs a lot of them revolve
around money limiting beliefs about what you're capable of and
what you deserve in life limiting beliefs about how good
you feel you are innately you know how lovable you
feel you are what you feel you need to do
in order to be loved and feel loved so I
think there's a lot there that we get conditioned with
that is negative and that's flat-out false and just not
true as far as your psychology is concerned and so
not only do you not get a manual it's like
you get a manual that teaches you the opposite of
what you should be knowing and should be learning it's
like you were trying to learn how to fly that
helicopter and not only didn't you have a manual I
handed you Emmanuel I said look this is the manual
for flight a helicopter and in that manual I specifically
deliberately put in the wrong things how hard would your
life be then it would be twice as hard and
that's kind of how it is with us humans especially
if you were not very privileged to grow up in
a kind of an enlightened family that was studying the
stuff and that's more aware so it kind of depends
on your circumstances but I feel like most people growing
up just don't have the luxury of having good role
models and so unless you are immersed in personal development
literature and you really go on this journey of figuring
out how this stuff works and what the real truth
is about some of these limiting beliefs and how psychology
really works on a practical level not a theoretical level
then it's really hard to be fulfilled with life because
you get caught up in traps you get caught up
in the trap of seeking external validation you get caught
up in the trap of that hamster wheel of keeping
up with the Joneses trying to get material things thinking
that they're gonna make you happy when they don't so
try and like one-up your neighbors one-up your friends and
then only later in life realizing that that doesn't work
then you can get caught in the trap of success
so being successful with with your business or being successful
in your career and just going after the money because
you think the money will eventually lead you somewhere a
nice and pleasant and you end up realizing that that
often ends up being a big letdown and just all
sorts of themes like this just I can rattle off
lists and lists of them so what ends up happening
is that you fall into these traps because you haven't
been given good examples and you're just kind of going
along and you don't know any better you haven't really
studied this stuff and so I think that's what I
mean by personal development is that we want to give
you psychological self mastery on a practical level not a
theoretical level that means what I want for you is
I want for you to be able to manage your
expectations I want you to be able to manage your
negative emotions I want you to be able to create
beliefs in yourself that are going to make you really
empowered and I'm gonna allow you to go out there
and be really successful and get whatever you want in
your life and I want you to be able to
set goals properly understand how to do that I want
you to understand how relationships really work and how to
get a lot of enjoyment out of your relationships while
taking out all the frustration of relationship which are so
common and I want you to understand the importance of
fitness and nutrition which again often for those two things
- fitness nutrition and and also exercise those we oftentimes
get set with bad examples for those as well from
our parents and siblings and and just the media in
general so all of these things I want you to
understand on a deep psychological level and I want you
to develop mastery of them so that you can do
with your mind what that 14 year old kid on
YouTube can do with helicopter that guy who's practiced that
helpline that helicopter for all of his life and he
can now do barrel rolls and fly it backwards and
upside down and do all sorts of tricks and maneuvers
I want you to be able to do that with
yourself and think of the equivalent if you could do
that with your body who would you be you would
be like an Olympic gymnast right if you could have
with a body you would be an athlete if you
could do those kind of African acrobatic maneuvers but what
if you could do that with your mind what if
you could do backflips with your mind what if you
could do barrel rolls with your mind what does that
mean well I think to me that is the ultimate
vision of why I do personal development is in the
hope that I can reach that point it's after a
while is that I can develop the sort of proficiency
in my own psychology I can master myself so well
I can master my own emotions I can master my
own thoughts I can master basically my body through my
mind that I am able to accomplish amazing things I
can get anything that I want in life I can
make myself feel good by getting the things that I
want I can get those two things to align and
match up which few people are able to do and
I'm able to manage my relationships my health and basically
I'm able to get the most out of this mind-body
combination that I was born with and I'm able to
create the most awesome life that's possible for me and
then I'm able to die with no regrets knowing that
I gave it my all I figured it out I
mastered myself and I accomplished a lot and in the
process doing all of that I'm able to contribute to
society and I'm able to put smiles on people's faces
because when I my mind and I master mind body
and I master my life that puts me suddenly in
a position to be able to go out and help
others do the same with their lives and for me
that's really easy because I'm in personal development so that's
the direct application for you you can also do that
because we're going to be good at your career you're
going to be able to go out there to contribute
and help others and that's what I ultimately want for
all of us to be doing so if you're a
doctor you can be a better doctor if you're a
lawyer you can be a better lawyer if you're an
engineer you can better be a better engineer if you're
a teacher you can be a better teacher if you're
a businessman you can be a better businessman whatever your
passion is in life in order to really live into
that passion I think there are things you need to
master about yourself and that all starts with the psychology
right you want to develop a manual and what I
want for you is I want for you to develop
a manual for yourself I want you to teach yourself
how to master your own psychology and that manual I
think there's two elements to it one is that we
are all very similar because we have the same genetic
makeup and were all human beings were all part of
the same species some of us are very similar in
personality type some of us have the same values so
in that sense we have very similar psychologies and in
that sense whatever works for one person tends to work
across the board right one example of this is for
example we've just been biologically through evolution we have hardwiring
that makes us appreciate nature for example it's very hard
to find a human being I challenge you to find
a human being across the planet who is not gonna
feel some emotional connection when they go out and see
something beautiful in nature like an amazing sunset or the
Grand Canyon or something like that and you know why
that is that's because we grew up in those environments
and we have we have neural wiring for that we
would much rather be out looking at the Grand Canyon
than we would sitting in in in a sterile white
room right because that's more natural that's our natural environment
and that's part of our psychology and understanding that is
important right because maybe right now you are sitting in
a cubicle and you're feeling like your life is not
quite as as as fulfilling as it could be and
maybe the reason that is because you're just not going
outside enough and you're not connecting with nature enough which
is where you grow up you grew up in a
natural environment not in a cubicle so maybe that's one
example right and I think that there's many examples and
that's the reason that personal development can work and that's
the reason that we have these principles of success and
principles of fulfillment because for many people I can give
you a principle that's going to apply almost to everyone
which is going to be important for fulfillment and if
you're breaking that principle and you don't even realize it
then you're gonna be frustrated because you're gonna be wondering
why am I not fulfilled and the reason you're not
fulfilled is because you're breaking these principles and you're not
following certain other principles so there's that I want you
to learn these principles and I want you to master
them and apply them and build habits around them but
then I also of course want you to personalize this
to you because even though you are a human being
and we're all very similar and you could say we're
all the same on some level you can also say
we're very different on another level because we are all
so unique and there's nobody out there that's quite like
you nobody out there that quite has the same experiences
as you quite set has the same programming that you've
had growing up right and even biologically you have differences
you have different you have different races you have different
personality types you have introverts and extroverts and you have
people with different Happiness set points and you have people
with different diseases and conditions and psychological makeups and then
of course on top of that you're adding layers of
conditioning that you get through through childhood and then through
adolescence and then through early adulthood so you've got all
those factors which make you very unique and that means
that certain things not going to work for you quite
the same way as they do for other people and
then of course you have your own intentions that you're
throwing it on top of that you have your own
preferences you have your own goals you have your own
situation you have your own life going on and your
life is different than everybody else is out there so
when you're creating this manual for flying your metaphorical helicopter
and doing backflips what you got to take into account
is that it is a helicopter but then you know
so you're gonna go in there and you're gonna fill
in some of the basics all helicopters work in the
same way but then also you're gonna put in your
own twist on this stuff you're gonna take your own
psychology and you're gonna take your own values and you're
gonna see what works for you what doesn't work for
you and you're basically gonna go in there and write
this manual yourself and my job is to help you
figure out what you need to put into the manual
and figure that out for yourself because I don't want
to let the manual for you that would be wrong
I can't do that because I'm not you the only
one that can write the manual is you I can
just help you look and see you have the right
things in the manual that you need and in fact
I think my biggest role is not even telling you
these things I think my biggest role is just inspiring
you with this grand idea to go out there and
write this manual this is something that's important because if
someone doesn't tell you to do this it takes a
while to figure it out on your own you kind
of have to really stumble upon it and some people
never figure it out they end up wasting all their
years in their life struggling and being frustrated through all
this stuff and then dying full of regrets not even
realizing that they never had a manual or that they
could write their own manual or a lot of people
go through their life using the manual of their friends
or their parents which ends up being wrong for them
or they could grab a manual from some book or
some website or some seminar and just try to copy
it wholesale and just steal that manual and use it
and then find out that that's not giving them the
results they want either and so it just leads to
a lot of frustration what I want to really end
on here is this vision because what I got excited
about when I thought about this helicopter analogy is how
cool would it be to be able to do the
analog of doing those amazing backflips and having that mastery
of control of this machine and I thought well the
only thing cooler than like that is being able to
do it with your mind it's so awesome to see
athletes do that with their bodies when you're watching the
Olympics or you're watching some playoff in the NFL or
the NBA or when you're watching a gymnast do his
thing and be really awesome that's cool to see with
the body but I think that not all of us
care so much about being athletic in that way but
I think all of us want to be more athletic
and nimble inside our minds because we are there you
can't run away from yourself you can't really escape yourself
so this is something that you're going to be stuck
with whether even you want to or not the question
is do you want to be mediocre of a mental
athlete or do you really want to master yourself mash
your mind I think about all the awesomeness that that
could lead to think of the peak experiences that you
could have when you really master your own psychology when
you really understand it and how you could contribute to
the world the kind of feelings you can get from
being both successful but then really figuring out the fulfillment
part because for me the fulfillment is what's important there
are so many people out there that are successful but
then don't have the happiness don't have the feelings with
it that they want or they feel like they're not
excited about life like they're bored with life even though
they've made millions of dollars and they started a bunch
of businesses and they've contributed to a bunch of charities
they still feel empty so for me figuring out how
to connect those two together is the Holy Grail and
for me the Holy Grail is that picture of doing
those acrobatics in the air but you're not doing it
with a remote-control helicopter you're doing it with your life
that to me is why I do personal development and
I hope you're on board with that vision all right
I'm gonna wrap it up there if you like this
leave your comments down below share it like it link
to it I really want to spread this message around
I want to hear from you I want to hear
what you think about this and what you want to
add on to it so go ahead share it and
I look forward to talking to you soon you
