[Music] the ontological status of reality is identical to that
of a dream so think about the dream that you
had last night and ask yourself what was the substance
of that dream where did that dream go what was
it made out of whatever that dream was made out
of is exactly what this thing that you call reality
right now this very moment is made out of it's
made out of the exact same stuff dreams stuff but
people can't appreciate this because they've got the materialist paradigm
running in the back of their mind this conceptual matrix
which tells them that oh well those are just dreams
last night's dreams when I was sleeping those are just
mere dreams activity in the brain neurons firing away weird
stuff going on while my body is resting that's not
how it works at all that's completely backwards there is
no such thing as the brain the brain is a
dream right now it's happening here where have you ever
seen a brain here in this dream the world what
is the world where have you ever encountered a world
but in this dream what is the world other than
the dream of you right now that's what you call
the world the dreams that happen to you when you
are sleeping at night those are not couched within a
physical brain or a physical world the way that you
think they're not occurring in a physical body this is
a deep confusion that people have because they're operating under
the materials paradigm which completely dismisses dreams and it draws
some kind of firm distinction between the sleeping dream world
and the waking dream world there is no such distinction
it's all one dream that's what reality is about that's
what your life is your life is a dream your
life as a whole from the moment you were born
- right now - when you're gonna die it's just
one dream but of course you don't think of it
that way precisely because you've defined it against you've defined
reality against the dreams that you have when you're sleeping
but this is a mistake stop thinking of reality as
a mechanical physical system that's not how it is what
reality is is a dream machine it's just dreams it's
just consciousness that's why it's appropriate to call it a
dream and to call reality a dream is the most
accurate metaphor that I have encountered so far it's actually
one of the simplest also if you want to talk
to people about spirituality or non-duality or about enlightenment you
can give them all sorts of fancy theories and all
this but the simplest way is just to say it's
a dream your whole life is a dream and you
can awaken from this dream in exactly the same way
as you can awaken from last night's dream there's nothing
physical about this thing all this stuff this is not
physical this is a dream it's happening in a dream
machine this dream machine which can otherwise be called God
can dream up whatever it wants it's an infinite dream
right now right this very moment as God is dreaming
your life it's also dreaming that it's being Napoleon it's
dreaming at as being Julius Caesar right now it's dreaming
that it's a monkey and some rainforest right now it's
dreaming that it's all the ants on this planet trillions
of them each one individually a dream onto itself it's
dreaming that it's a tree every single tree on this
planet and every single tree that exists across the entire
universe it's dreaming that it's an alien on some other
planet far far away not only that but is dreaming
that it's being some other kind of being that you
can't even imagine or conceive of in some alternative universe
some alternative dimension which bears no resemblance to our own
doesn't have three dimensions doesn't have time doesn't have space
doesn't have energy or matter or anything like that and
whatever it's got there it's got there whoever lives there
lives there and whoever's conscious there is this very same
thing it's dreams that's what reality is it's not a
net of molecules it's consciousness not only is it dreams
it's every possible dream that could be dreamed happening all
simultaneously that's what infinity means right now what's happening right
this moment is a dream can you see it I'm
talking to you from within your dream hello in there
hello wake up become conscious right now that you're in
the dream this is it this is the dream yes
it feels very real that's because you're so absorbed with
living that you've forgotten that you're inside of a dream
just in the exact same way as happens at night
you're so engrossed in whatever is happening in your nighttime
dreams that you forget until what until you wake up
until the dream comes to an end and what happens
is that you break out of one dream to enter
the next level or the next order of dream likewise
it's very difficult for you to see that you're in
a dream right now the waking dream because you've never
broken out of this dream yet to realize oh this
was just all a dream it was just a figment
of consciousness because you feel that your fears are very
real you feel like within this waking dream there's actually
something real to be lost and something real to be
gained so you're very busy running around doing stuff living
but not seeing that all that activity is couched inside
of the dream and the only reason it has any
kind of meaning is because it's relative to and within
the domain of the dream outside of the dream and
has no meaning it has no existence it has no
reality it has no purpose and it has no importance
whatsoever your life has no importance no more importance than
last night's dream really had it's an interesting experience for
its own sake but beyond that what is there what
was the substance of last night's dream it's it's gone
it's nothing it was just a figment of the mind
now you might wonder but where does this mine take
place doesn't it need to take place in a brain
no it doesn't see the problem is is that your
conventional understanding of dream only makes sense in the materialist
paradigm because you have defined dreaming as something that occurs
within brains that's the key mistake well you need to
do is separate that out such that you acknowledge that
yes you dream at night but then you dream during
the day too and that in fact the brain is
part of this dream right here during the day the
nighttime dreams don't occur within the daytime dreams these are
two separate dreams one is running the other one is
off now this one's running that one is off and
then at some point even this one will come off
all of them will come off all sorts of dreams
are possible materialism itself is occurring within the wakingdream I've
talked about Rene Descartes before and how he was a
pivotal figure for Western philosophy and a lot of modern
philosophy is based upon de cartes work and specifically they
card skepticism and his skepticism was quite powerful although not
powerful enough as I've mentioned before and one of his
doubts was the evil demon doubt I've talked about that
before but here I want to talk about a second
doubt that he had because he was interested in establishing
a firm foundation for all of Western intellectual tradition including
mathematics science and also his Christian morality and his his
Christian worldview so he needed to base that on certain
facts and certain knowledge about the world but the way
he decided to do that first just wipe the slate
clean with a bunch of skepticism just radical skepticism and
one of the things he was skeptical about is how
do we distinguish dreaming from reality how do we know
that we're not dreaming right now and although he put
that skeptical idea out there in his work the meditations
it was never really taken seriously even by himself in
the end because Descartes was a foundationalist and he really
wanted to to ground human knowledge into some absolute standard
that was enumerable he had to do away with the
very skeptical considerations that he brought forth in the very
beginning and the most unsatisfying part of the carts work
is that he he just hand waved away a lot
of these very otherwise serious and important doubts so in
the end in his work basically what he said is
he said well we can just basically into it or
feel the difference between being in a dream and being
in reality dreams are kind of murky and they're kind
of hazy and dark whereas reality is bright and crisp
and very solid so you clearly know that when you're
in reality here in this waking dream that you're not
actually in the sleeping dream but here was the it's
great mistake because in fact you actually cannot Intuit such
a thing how could you your intuition is based upon
your experience within a certain framework within a certain environment
without having had experience in that environment you have no
possible intuitions and when we're talking about intuitions that are
related to only one environment like in one dream you
have no contrasting environment no all serious alternative which you
can use as a foil to feel this difference which
is precisely why is so remarkable that when you're asleep
at night and you're having some crazy-ass dream and all
sorts of outlandish things are happening in this dream and
then you wake up and then you're like whoa how
could I have not known that was a dream I
mean I was like flying around and there were like
space kangaroos and they're like all sorts of weird stuff
was happening and like I was in this room one
moment then the next moment I'm some other place like
all this crazy outlandish stuff I should have been able
to know that was a dream and yet I was
completely bought into it why is that precisely because the
only way the human mind can distinguish these things is
if it experiences first one and then the other if
it's only stuck in one that one literally defines what
reality is do you see you see what the problem
of reality is it's not that there is some one
thing which is the reality it's basically just whatever you
take it to be that's what it becomes due to
lack of alternatives dreams are actually very valuable I'm talking
about nighttime dreams and I think that actually you should
start taking your nighttime dreams much more seriously rather than
just dismissing them as aa mere dreams mere silly nonsense
crazy stuff going on mere fantasies start to take them
more seriously because they will reveal important existential truths about
this waking dream that you're in you're gonna see glitches
in the matrix once you start to pay attention to
your nighttime dreams because then you're also gonna carry them
forward here and you're gonna stir to question this waking
reality more than you used to you're not gonna take
it for granted the way that the materialist paradigm does
see the materialist paradigm has a vested interest in dismissing
the importance of dreams because the materials paradigm wants to
define materialism as this stuff here the physical world here
and it needs to have no alternatives to that so
what it says it says well this here is reality
this is where physics applies this is where we do
science this is where all the serious important work gets
done and then in dreams those are fantasies and silly
things and and those are actually happening within the real
reality you see the trick that's being played here one
dream is being couched within the other for good reason
because that's how grounding is done grounding is always done
through a sort of sleight of hand because in fact
there is no ground where are these dreams occurring you
might ask nowhere they're not happening within any mechanical system
as you might assume now you might say well that's
impossible that seems crazy but then again why would you
assume reality is mechanical how is mechanical possible how is
physical possible it's just as absurd the only reason that
you think that dreams have to be inside of some
mechanical system like inside of a computer simulation or something
or inside of a matrix or inside of a brain-in-a-vat
or the human brain for that matter is because you're
just a custom to thinking of reality is being mechanical
that's just something you assumed from the very beginning you
never really questioned it because it sort of seemed obvious
to you because your culture just told you so and
because you just believed it because in this dream that
we're in right now this waking dream we have mechanical
objects and it seems that we can learn about mechanics
and we can use them mechanically but then again the
same thing happens with in your night time dreams your
nighttime dreams are very mechanical on the inside there's a
lot of rules and and limitations within those dreams you
can't literally do everything you want so it's really just
a matter of convention it's a matter of what are
you comfortable with see a lot of people are comfortable
with thinking of reality as a physical system but they're
very uncomfortable with thinking of reality as a dream machine
without the machine part because they want the machine Lia
where's the machine everything's a machine we're used to thinking
of reality and all our little gadgets and stuff is
machines the clockwork universe has talked about by Newton this
is just a story there's no such thing as a
clockwork universe there's a dream universe and the clockwork universe
is just one of the types of dreams that there
could be here are them some things to notice about
your dreams firstly notice that they feel very very real
when they are happening just like real life it feels
very real but only when it's happening now the trick
here is of course that you have an exited real
life yet and you don't believe that even such a
thing is possible for many people that's completely outside their
paradigm but it is possible to exit what you call
real life and to discover that actually it's also just
a dream so this feeling of it feels real doesn't
cut it you can't use that to distinguish between dreams
because all dreams feel real when you're inside of them
the only time you could say something is unreal is
after you've exited it so be very careful about relying
on your intuitions here to make this distinction the way
that decart did because if you do you're going to
delude yourself secondly notice about your dreams that they have
their own internal self consistent logic and this is a
thing that a lot of scientifically minded rashly minded materialist
type people get confused about very easily because the key
argument they make against what I'm saying is a Leo
there's no way that this right here could be a
dream look how real it is look how consistent and
logical it is look I can do some math equations
and I can figure out that if I throw up
this rock it's gonna take 2.5 seconds to fall back
down in my hand and look we can we can
build this rocket ship and launch it to the moon
and that proves said it's not a dream but of
course this is the most absurd circular logic that you've
ever heard because if you just apply that same standard
to your dreams when you're sleeping you'll see that they
meet all of that criteria as well they're completely self
consistent but using a different rule set so for example
you might be dreaming while you're sleeping and there may
be a bear's attacking you and you're a hunter so
you pick up a rifle and you shoot the bear
between the eyes to defend yourself and your heart is
pounding because the Bears just about to pounce on yours
like ah it's pouncing on you it's gonna tear you
to pieces but you shoot it right between the eyes
and you defend your family okay then you feel a
sense of victory so what happened in this dream how
is it that you were afraid of this bear it's
a dream after all why be afraid of a bear
if it's just a dream bear and yet you're afraid
and how is it possible that a dream gun you
can pick up a dream gun shoot a dream bullet
into between the eyes of a bear who's also a
dream bear and kill the dream bear why not why
isn't it not the case that the bullet just like
because it's a dream bullet why doesn't a bullet just
like fly through the bear and not kill it because
your dream has its own internal self consistent logic to
it and now you might say Oh leo but I've
had dreams that were kind of crazy and wacky where
weird stuff was happening and it was it didn't obey
the laws of physics the way you're suggesting with this
bear and that's correct because see dreams can have different
rule sets they can have different self consistent logics that's
the whole point of a dream is that what defines
the dream is the rule set and there are different
possible rule sets don't assume that for something to be
a dream it has to have some crazy rule sets
like where bears have wings and they fly around and
there are unicorns and they're elves and there are weird
stuff like that going on I mean of course you
could have dreams like that but even in those dreams
notice it's not completely random there's still a logic to
it even in those dreams were like you're able to
fly or maybe you're dreaming that the bear grows wings
and it flies after you and chases your family that
could happen and maybe you get your family into an
airplane you're now you're flying away from this bear and
the bear is chasing you and it's flying out for
you and it's it's it's biting at your airplanes tail
yeah that could happen I might seem like well Leo
that's not reality that's just made-up fantasy yes but there's
still rules you see because when the bear is biting
at the tail of your airplane well the rule are
the rules of that scenario are that still it can
bite through your airplane it can knock down your airplane
if it knocks down your airplane if it ruins your
propeller or something then the airplane is gonna crash to
the ground so in your dream there you've got gravity
or you're assuming that kind of sense of gravity now
maybe the gravity is different than it is on earth
but still you've got something like that going on or
maybe you're dreaming that you're in a in a in
a earth environment that has no gravity well then those
are the rules of the dream you see and still
you still assume that you can kill the bear with
the bears gonna kill you there's a reason you're running
away from the bear in the first place there is
it reason why you're protecting your family after all why
protect a dream family from a dream bear in a
dream airplane on a dream earth because it's all defined
in terms of itself you see it's like a story
a self-consistent story in the same way when you're watching
a movie you might wonder well but why are the
characters taking this scenario so seriously because like don't they
know that they're inside of a movie so why should
they fight so hard with the bad guy when he
knows that it is just a movie but I mean
that's to confuse two totally different levels of reality see
of course the characters in the movie are pretending like
it's real because that's that's the level of reality that
they're at here's another example if you ever had a
dream where you lose your pants maybe you're standing up
in front of class and you're giving a speech or
something like that and then you your pants fall down
and then well you're rather embarrassed why are you embarrassed
after all just a dream so what harm could come
from your pants falling down you could just walk around
with your pants down ah see but you can't because
in a dream you care you care about your self-image
you care about your reputation in the dream just like
you do in this waking dream you might wonder why
do you care about walking around with your dick hanging
out in the middle of the sidewalk or the crosswalk
why is that a problem why would that embarrass you
in real life now you might say well Leo that's
because man you know real life is the cops will
come they'll arrest me they'll give me a ticket for
public exposure and indecency they'll throw me in jail and
that will ruin my reputation and some will take a
video of and post it on youtube that'll embarrass me
and that'll ruin my chances to to get a job
and then I won't make good money I won't be
able to provide for my family in yada yada yada
you got this whole story built up why it embarrasses
you right yeah exactly the same as in one of
your dreams when you're asleep it's a self-consistent story define
to guess itself all the punishments and threats are always
within the dream and ultimately you've the biggest threat to
you in this waking dream is of it ending which
is what you call death which you work very hard
to avoid you see how this works you see how
tricky this is don't underestimate these mechanisms this here is
how reality gets created we're not talking about fantasy here
we're talking about how reality gets created here's another example
of self consistent logic inside of a dream maybe you're
in a haunted house and you're being chased by a
ghost or something and you're you're running away you're running
away and you're trying to get out the front door
but the front door is locked and it's jammed and
you're you're turning the handle and you're you're finagling it
and it's just locked and you can't get out so
what is that I mean you would think that well
if it's a dream couldn't you just like fly through
the door because the door is not solid I mean
what is a door really made out of inside of
a dream it's just an idea so it's not solid
see you would think you could just like vaporize the
door with your mind and walk through but of course
that's not how dreams work they have limitations there's a
rule set at work and so in that particular dream
the rule set might be that you got to find
a key to unlock the door or maybe the rule
set is is that you've got super powerful fists so
you can actually punch through the door but then you
still got to remember to use your fists and that
still takes time so maybe the ghost will catch up
to you while you're punching through that door with your
Hulk like fists or whatever other superpower you have just
because you can imagine having a superpower to dream doesn't
mean really anything that doesn't mean it's unreal that's just
that rule set how about inside of a dream if
you take a knife and you cut open your stomach
what will you see in there is it gonna be
just empty maybe depending on the rules of that dream
or more likely is that you'll actually imagine that you
cut open your stomach and your guts spill out and
it's painful and you're suffering and blood is squirting everywhere
just like in real life and in a dream you
might take a saw and cut open your skull and
you might feel around you might take a mirror and
look inside and you could you could see the brain
in the dream but does that mean if you see
that brain in your skull inside your team does that
mean that that brain is creating the dream no of
course not you see this is to confuse the contents
of the dream for the dream itself and this is
precisely the same thing that materialists do with this waking
dream so when I say something radical like the brain
doesn't exist many people say oh my god leo that's
crazy that's ridiculous what have you been smoking no just
think through the logic of it it's very very simple
this here is your dream you cut open your skull
yes of course there's some pink squishy substance inside you
can feel it you can screw around with it but
does that mean that it is causing this whole thing
no of course not now here's where materials get really
tricky and sayali oh but if I take if I
take some instrument I poke around in there or some
neuroscientist pokes around in there then all sorts of hallucinate
weird stuff my perceptual systems will all change and stuff
will get very weird my memories will fade or new
memories will come into being and that proves that this
brain is causing it all no it doesn't doesn't prove
that at all think about it this way if you
were sleeping and you were dreaming in fact you could
try to do this too tonight make this a little
experiment for you see if you can do it when
you're dreaming cut open your own skull and poke around
inside take an ice pick and poke around inside your
brain and then notice how that will actually change what
you're experiencing but of course does that mean that that
that brain that you're imagining and dreaming in your dream
that it is what's causing the whole dream of course
not see this is where you have to be able
to really think outside the box think outside of your
own paradigm otherwise you get stuck in it and you
keep insisting - no no no Leo it's got to
be inside there has to be a brain because a
dream is only a thing that can occur in a
brain no that's something you've just assumed up to now
I'm asking you now to really think it through think
through the circularity of that put it to empirical investigation
also notice about your dreams that physics logic causality and
time and space all of these are distorted depending on
what kind of dream you're dreaming so a lot of
times scientifically minded people rationally minded people we like to
say all Leo but the most certain things we know
about reality are physics and logic and causality and time
and space all the hard scientific stuff oh yeah but
does that stuff apply to your dreams no Leo doesn't
apply to my dreams but that's just because her fantasies
I'm talking about reality know what you're talking about is
the ruleset of this particular dream so of course in
this particular dream that we call the physical universe there
is a certain kind of physics certain kind of gravity
certain kind of logic and this kind of stuff and
it's pretty consistent pretty stable that's what defines our dream
is how consistent and stable it is you can't just
imagine gravity - to reverse itself and then it cups
start flying up and your cat flies up and your
dog flies up doesn't work like that in your dreaming
sleeping dream you might be able to to do that
but see science is very tricky because science love to
claim that it makes universal discoveries universal laws that apply
everywhere in the universe now they don't they only apply
within the dream which is easily proven to yourself by
going to sleep at night and noticing that the physics
the logic the causality the time and the science inside
those dreams is different of course because a different rule
set all that science does is it just studies the
patterns occurring within one bubble within one dream you switch
dreams now science changes you can do science inside your
sleeping dreams it'll be a different kind of science but
it's still science but of course science is very reluctant
to admit this because this throws the whole paradigm into
question the universality of science gets cool it gets eroded
when this sort of consideration is taken seriously that's why
science cannot take dreams seriously it's got to classify them
as fantasies or hallucinations or illusions but of course that's
just a sleight of hand that it plays also notice
about your dreams that they feel very serious often times
and many times there are life and death just like
this waking dream also notice that you have very strong
emotions within your sleeping dreams just like in the waking
dream also notice that you play different characters within your
sleeping dreams you might be interacting with your mom and
your dad and your brother and your sister and your
co-workers and your spouse and other strangers and bears and
animals and aliens and all sorts of stuff inside your
sleeping dream but what are they all they're all you
just your mind is sort of splitting itself off and
then playing this drama by taking on different roles the
bear attacking you in that dream it's you it's not
other than you but then when you come out of
that dream you wake up you come here to this
waking dream when you're interacting with human beings and animals
here especially when you're threatened are you still aware that
all of these are you no of course not of
course not because the only time you're aware that all
of these things are you is only after you wake
up the only time you're aware that all the people
and you're sleeping dreams are actually you is only after
you've woken up and you have some time to reflect
on it when you're inside the sleeping dream and a
bear is attacking you you're not sitting there and thinking
oh well but but this is a dream so I
don't need to defend myself I don't need to go
for the gun I don't need to worry about anything
and in fact that bear is me that gun is
me that's what this whole world is me I'm dreaming
it all up no that takes consciousness you could only
do that when you're conscious which of course you're not
you're stuck in the dream that's what it means to
be a dreamer if you were conscious you would be
awake and then the dream would disappear that's exactly what's
going on here we're just talking about it a second
or a third level here see you got the dreaming
this sleeping dreams here then waking reality here then you've
got the next level above that that's what we're talking
about also notice that within your sleeping dreams they have
narrative arcs they're always story based it's always a sequence
of events that happened to you just like ordinary life
doesn't that make you suspicious about ordinary life all these
similarities you're noticing all these similarities should start to make
you very suspicious I want you to ask next time
you wake up from a sleeping dream and it was
a nice juicy one that really got you absorbed into
it as soon as you wake up before you even
get out of bed I want you to ask yourself
what's the ontological status of that dream that just happened
what was the dream made out of and where did
stuff go and do not fall into the trick of
thinking at all well it was just all happening in
my brain that's a cop-out that's not what was actually
happening you have no direct experience of a brain you
never have in you ever will think about that stop
thinking of dreams merely as dreams dreams are the only
reality that there is that's just what reality is I
know it's kind of mind-bending and it's a little difficult
to get to to adjust to it but you know
you start to think along these routes long and I've
stuffed a question and contemplate and meditate and all that
and then it becomes like second nature after a while
you reach a point where you're walking down the street
you're seeing a dog you're seeing a cat you're seeing
a car crash you're seeing crazy stuff on politics and
you remind yourself oh yeah I'm inside of a dream
right now this is a dream I'm talking you from
a dream you're watching me on a computer is a

you're dreaming that you're in the 21st century you're dreaming
that you're part of your country in your nation you're
part of this physical universe this Big Bang that happened
14 billion years ago with evolution all this is all
a dream size is all a dream all scientific discoveries
are dream phenomena you're studying the internal mechanics of the
dream that's what science is that's why science is fundamentally
limited because you can be a brilliant scientist and you
can study the internal mechanics of any dream to death
for hundreds of years for thousands of years you could
do all this study but you still will not understand
that all of this is just happening within a dream
you see that requires something different than science that requires
a shift in consciousness in the same way that if
you're sleeping and you're dreaming you can imagine that you're
a some famous scientist inside of your dream doing some
sort of important work and you can take that very
seriously in your dream and then you wake up and
you discover oh [ __ ] why was I doing
science in that dream all of that I mean it
made sense within the context of the dream it made
sense because like I needed to feed my family I
was curious in science I it was important for me
to discover the internal mechanics of that dream I made
some important discoveries there about gravity or about quantum mechanics
or whatever you know that was going on in that
dream but now I've awoken and now none of that
stuff matters anymore and that's precisely how it is here
in the real world the real world as we call
it the only kind of reality there could be is
dreams it's just a question of how convincing is the
dream and what tricks people so much is that this
waking dream is so convincing with all of its emotions
and all of its titillations and desires and fears and
all this is so juicy it's so consistent to that
it completely fools you the mistake people make is they
underestimate reality the underestimate the power of dreams they think
that dreams are just something like oh yeah I could
easily see through a dream but you know in your
direct experience that you can't see through a dream easily
which is why you get tricked over and over and
over again when you find yourself sleeping in your bed
how many times have you dream your bed in your
entire life thousands right almost every night maybe you don't
remember it all the time but still thousands of times
thousands of times you've been tricked you've awoken you said
oh my god why was I so scared why was
I so emotional in that dream you would think that
you would be able to learn your lesson and be
like okay that's it this is the last time I'm
getting tricked my mind is ever gonna trick me again
but then what happens next night you go to sleep
again and it happens again that shows you the power
of dreams but still that's only the tip of the
iceberg of the power of dreams because you can only
really appreciate the power of dreams not when you awaken
from your sleeping dreams but when you awaken from this
dream the waking dream that's when you get a real
taste of the power of the mind and the power
to cos and then you're like holy [ __ ]
all of reality had me so fooled but I have
awoken from it and that's what's possible and that's why
I'm talking about this topic at all in the first
place not because this is some philosophy I'm not some
salep sister some nihilist or some idealist who's trying to
present some sort of clever philosophy that I invented for
you because I think it's cool I am talking about
the real possibility of waking up from this dream that's
possible I've done it other people have done it you
can do it it's quite amazing it's sort of the
whole point of life is to be inside these dreams
and and realize you're inside of them and then to
see goddamn that's amazing it's amazing what this dreamscape machine
is it just manufactures dreams forever to infinity that's what's
so amazing about it and it's possible for you to
wake up but there's a catch the catch is what
I call waking up you call death literally not figuratively
actually because you see actually is only defined within this
dream that's what actually means actually means this dream not
some other dream so you really don't want to exit
this dream you call that death you spend most of
your time avoiding exiting this dream which is why it's
so hard to awaken and why do they call it
awakening which I actually think is a better word than
enlightenment it really feels like awakening more than it does
like enlightenment it feels like you're waking up from life
that's possible put your attention right now on the fact
that you are inside of a dream this right here
all of this this is a dream I'm talking to
you from inside the dream I am you telling you
about the fact that you're stuck in a dream do
you get it do you get it wake up wake
up wake up you can wake up hello in there
wake yeah I'm talking to you wake up you can
wake up you're inside of a dream this is a
dream your whole life is a dream wake up that's
actually possible you can actually wake up can you fathom
the significance of that we're talking about transcending your entire
existence do you realize how significant that is drop your
petty problems drop your problems about women or about men
or about politics or about science or about money problems
or emotional drop all that [ __ ] that's inside
the dream you can transcend that you can exit the
whole dream it's like people hear this but they still
don't get it they still think I'm just like being
metaphorical or I'm just being cute or I'm just being
dramatic or bombastic or or exaggerating or or whatever or
this is just a philosophy this is not a philosophy
you can actually wake up how do you wake up
by questioning the dream to death by questioning death and
by actually turning yourself into what you consider death death
of the self to discover what lies on the other
side and how do you do that well through meditation
through yoga through self inquiry through neti neti method through
just sitting in silence do nothing meditation through psychedelics there's
a lot of different ways or a combination of all
those above you know and many other techniques like that
that's what spirituality is about what is spirituality in a
nutshell it's about waking up from the dream called life
and seeing what lies on the other side the problem
is that most people are so stuck in the materials
paradigm they think that that's impossible there's no way that
could be possible yes you're right if the materials paradigm
is right but the materials paradigm is not right which
he will discover by questioning it to death and the
biggest obstacle that's really preventing you from waking up is
the materialist paradigm you really really believe that there's such
a thing as a external physical universe external physical world
a brain or some matrix simulation or something like that
because that's what your culture is led you to believe
and that's what you need to struct a question alright
I'm done here please click like button for me share
this episode with a friend and come check out actualised
org right there my website i got a blog there's
the forum there's the life purpose course there's the book
list which will help you wrap your mind around some
of these mind-bending concepts and lastly just stay around stick
with me as I share more techniques and ways of
breaking this illusion called reality to me this is the
coolest thing about reality is that you get to explore
what reality is it's amazing the mechanics of it it's
so ingenious the way that it works it's amazing to
make all these little insights about all of this and
this and that and and how do I trick myself
there and why do people get wrapped up in these
illusions and this and that and as it turns out
the more you become conscious of the fact that reality
is a dream the easier your life becomes the more
effortless the more magical the more carefree the more satisfying
the more blissful why because when you are inside of
a dream which you know for sure is a dream
you don't take it seriously anymore it's hard to bother
you when you're lucid when you know the bear attacking
you isn't a real bear and even if it eats
you so what it's not a problem we see you
can't think that way so long as you're buying into
the fact that this is not a dream you
