hey Leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm gonna be talking about how to raise Rockstar kids
[Music] you by Rockstar kids of course I mean raising
psychologically healthy kids who grow up into wise conscious adults
and are able to tap into the higher consciousness facets
of life which very few people are able to tap
into so that's what we're talking about here now for
the record I don't have children so of course it's
perfectly within your right to question why I'm qualified to
talk about this topic at all and in a sense
I feel like I'm not qualified to talk about it
because I think that there are a lot of elements
to parenting which are counterintuitive and tricky and can only
be discovered by having kids and going through that process
yourself so I'm gonna tread carefully here instead what I've
decided to let my limit myself to is to sort
of the theoretical foundations of raising these kinds of children
this is the kind of stuff that you might not
hear about in typical parenting books although some of them
might talk about this and my qualifications here are that
I've spent the last five or ten years studying a
lot of personal development a lot of human psychology and
a lot of spirituality and I've also spent quite a
bit of time doing a sort of post-mortem analysis of
my own childhood and what worked and what didn't work
there and in a sense it's kind of like coming
full circle because one of the reasons that I entered
into personal development in the first place is because I
grew up in a rather dysfunctional family a lot of
elements in my family were dysfunctional and me entering personal
development was a way to address those issues for myself
because I wanted to live a certain kind of life
and I was reacting really against that dysfunction my family
which led me to all this stuff and what was
very interesting is that I as I was studying all
this personal development material for my adult life reading these
books I started having insights about all this would be
really great to know for people raising their kids this
is something counterintuitive that a lot of parents I see
don't understand because my parents didn't understand this or they
did this wrong or other parents I see doing this
wrong and so I actually started having so many of
these insights that I started keeping a list and for
the last couple of years I've been compiling this list
of insights and kind of fleshing it out more and
more and more and now I feel like it's complete
enough to be able to present it to you so
what you're gonna get here is you're gonna get the
very fundamental principles and you're gonna see after the fact
that a lot of this stuff is very obvious it'll
just make sense to you you're not going to be
very skeptical about it once you hear it but then
again as they say common sense isn't so common and
so even though this stuff should be obvious to most
parents that's far from the case which is precisely why
we have so many dysfunctional parents who raise dysfunctional kids
who then go on to become dysfunctional parents to raise
more dysfunctional kids and so therefore the dysfunction and the
low consciousness just perpetuates itself so good parenting is a
is a key component to solving humanity's low consciousness crisis
which is putting us at a really at a species
wide threat now to understand what your job is as
a parent you have to first understand what school is
gonna do for your kids and what it's not gonna
do for your kids so you're gonna send your kids
to school now there can be different options private school
public school home schooling we'll talk about that later in
the end of this episode but no matter where you
send them basically school is gonna do a good job
of teaching them math reading language history and science if
you sign up to a decent school they'll do a
decent job but school will do a bad job and
oftentimes a terrible job or zero job at all in
the following categories which are the ones you really need
to now put your attention on psychology philosophy art music
spirituality consciousness personal development high-level thinking strategic thinking big-picture thinking
holistic thinking creativity and thinking outside the box and what
I mean by creativity is the actual process and all
the tricks and techniques for being creative for being a
highly creative person school does not teach this also existential
thinking school does not teach this almost at all holism
ecology and systems thinking school doesn't teach this business marketing
wealth creation money management and investing these topics are virtually
untouched by school nutrition socialization dating and male-female psychology the
differences between those is not taught very well how to
be good at sex is not taught at all self-discipline
and self-reliance is also not really taught so that gives
you a very very broad overview of some of the
things you need to be worth worrying about now let
me give you a list of the most important things
that you need to teach your children it's all the
stuff that they won't learn at school so at the
top of this list as you might expect it's enlightenment
and self inquiry teaching them about what enlightenment is and
not just giving it to them as an ideology of
course but basically getting them interested in questioning what reality
is existentially and showing them how to do that what
kind of questions are worth asking what kind of questions
are worth thinking about how should you think about these
questions such as what am i what are other people
what is consciousness what is matter and what is energy
and what is God and is there a God and
what is science and what is language and what is
the mind and what is thinking and what is reality
as a whole so all these sorts of questions getting
them to think about that and giving them some tools
like self inquiry a very concrete process that they can
use to actually contemplate these things and of course not
just telling them to do it like a homework assignment
but really getting them curious about answering all these questions
and getting them thinking about these sort of paradigms that
society and culture will just feed to them at school
and feed to them through the television 3 to them
feed to them through the text books that they're reading
getting them to question all the very fundamental assumptions there
that are that are involved with these paradigms the next
thing is meditation and concentration practices if you can instill
in them a habit of meditation or concentration this is
going to be huge just absolutely life transforming for them
and it's so much easier to do this when they're
very young so meditation you should start teaching them at
five years old you can start that young and you
could just teach them some basic techniques you know pick
and choose whichever techniques you like you can also teach
them some concentration techniques when they get a little bit
older probably not when they're that young because a lot
of kids these days in school they have a Dede
problems because they can't focus because they play all these
video games and because our culture is just so distracting
they're on their iPod or on their iPad and their
smartphone when they're toddlers and then that just worsens the
problem a lot more so having some concentration practices for
them would be huge now with meditation of course the
best way to really instill a value of meditation is
not through lecturing to them but through bahding it yourself
imagine that your child sees you meditate for 30 minutes
or 60 minutes every single morning for for the next
20 years of its life so basically since it's a
baby all the way till it graduates high school it
sees you meditate and not miss a single day of
meditation in 20 years just imagine what kind of effect
that will have on the child psychology obviously if you're
able to do that and that's no small feat especially
when you have small children is to find that time
but if you're able to do that think about what
that communicates to the child you don't even need to
lecture to them to say oh hey go go in
your room and meditate you don't need to do that
just doing it yourself and them seeing you doing that
and seeing how important it is to you to find
the time to do that they will naturally get curious
about it they will naturally ask you questions about why
you do it and then that will open up those
conversations and then you can share the techniques with them
and you could teach them to do it as well
and you can frame it as meditation is a tool
that you can use to calm your mind to control
your emotions to contemplate any questions you have about life
any problems you have you can kind of meditate them
away or become very mindful of them so that they
lose their grip over you that would be a huge
gift that you give to your child that virtually no
parent does think about how many parents do this less
than 1% for sure and yet this is probably the
single most powerful thing you can do for your kid
is to teach them to meditate and if you do
it very young it's gonna be easy and man by
the tide that they turn 10 years old 15 years
old 20 years old these guys can be expert meditators
they can already have enlightenment experience as they hit before
they even graduate high school imagine how much of a
of a leg up that gives them also the next
thing you got to teach them is how emotions work
this is another thing that school is gonna be terrible
at school is not going to teach them what emotions
really are or how they work or the importance even
of understanding emotions and this thing called emotional mastery so
of course you're gonna have to learn what emotions are
and how they work and a little bit of what
emotional mastery means before you could teach it to them
but talking about what all these emotions are anger sadness
frustration depression hurt jealousy etc etc especially all the negative
ones and talking about why these emotions arise what they're
supposed to be doing what their function is how to
think about them properly and also very importantly giving your
child some tools for handling strong negative emotions there are
a lot of tools out there you can read self-help
books on this stuff there's the emotional freedom technique there's
the Sedona Method which I actually highly recommend the Sedona
Method it's very simple for letting go and releasing emotions
you can also teach the mindfulness with labeling which is
just a very formal but simple technique also for how
to label emotions that come up become mindful of them
so that they don't overwhelm you this will be huge
for them when they become teenagers if you can get
them to to learn some of these techniques and practice
them by the time they're 10 years old or 12
years old then when they after high school and all
the emotional stuff comes up or they go to college
then they will have these tools already well under their
belt and they'll be able to use them to handle
a lot of stuff that would otherwise lead them down
to some bad alleys in life teaching them existential questioning
is ridiculously important and this is something that nobody no
school is going to do this for you you have
to get them really curious and interested about thinking about
life and trying to understand what life is every element
of life get them to question it teach them the
the value of radical open-mindedness show them that just because
some adult thinks that something works this way or says
that something works this way doesn't mean it actually does
teach them that science can be wrong teach them that
adults can be wrong teach them that social institution institutions
can be wrong and that they have been all throughout
history so that they're clear that they are clear that
they need to learn how to think for themselves and
that they can't take anything for granted that they pick
up from culture from society if you do this when
they're young this will program their mind for open mindedness
which is the exact opposite of what our culture generally
does is it programs us for closed mindedness and it
doesn't admit that it makes certain fundamental assumptions about how
reality is all these assumptions you can easily start to
question with your child when they are just like six
years old you can get them to start questioning all
this stuff so when they start asking you why is
the sky blue and why is the grass green go
with that make them question those things and go help
them to find resources for how they can keep their
mind open and questioning that rather than just giving them
some fake little dismissive excuses you could actually tell them
that what we don't know why the sky is blue
or I don't know why it's blue you go find
out and you come and tell me and then we'll
see and then we'll think through it together and we'll
actually see does the answer make sense let's see what
the science textbooks say about why the sky is blue
and then we'll actually think through it together and we'll
see what the assumptions are that the scientists are making
what kind of paradigm are they using to make those
conclusions and what does it even mean to say that
you have an explanation for why the sky is blue
you see get them thinking along those sorts of lines
very importantly of course you have to teach them and
also demonstrate of course good nutrition this is something I
learned the hard way growing up I had terrible role
model both my parents were terrible role models my entire
family was for for nutrition there was just no value
of healthy eating whatsoever in fact the value in my
family was the exact opposites like the more unhealthy it
is the better that was the value and so I
grew up fat and I struggled with that quite a
lot and it led to all sorts of self-esteem issues
confidence issues sexual sexuality issues so all sorts of problems
come up from that of course not to mention health
issues so this is a tricky one because nutrition is
really a cultural thing and it's going to be very
hard to just force your kids to eat vegetables and
carrots when all their friends are eating pizza and soda
and all sorts of junk like that and also at
school were they gonna be selling or gonna be selling
soda fries Pizza all that stuff so that's gonna be
tricky in reality you're not gonna be able to stop
them from eating that kind of chunk they'll still be
able to buy at school they'll be able to buy
it at the store they'll get it from their friend's
house they'll order a pizza whatever but what you can
do is you can teach them the fundamentals of nutrition
which I was never taught I had to learn this
stuff when I was like 25 years old even after
I lost all my weight I still didn't didn't have
the fundamentals of of proper nutrition down I just lost
that weight by cutting calories so with proper nutrition get
them some nutrition books read to them about what are
the pros and cons of various kinds of food make
them smart shoppers so that when they're going out and
buying food they're looking at the back of the box
or looking at the ingredient list they're looking at the
labels to see if there any trans fats in there
and all that kind of stuff and of course that
means you have to learn up on nutrition so that
if you know your nutrition then you can teach it
to your kids and also a lot of it is
gonna come down to how you're modeling it so if
you're actually eating healthy and they see you eating healthy
for 20 years of your life and they see you
not touching pizzas and donuts and bacon and all this
stuff when it's presented to you that will put a
strong idea in their mind that hey there must be
a reason why he or she hasn't been eating pizza
for twenty years probably because there's some logic to that
and then you can talk about that and also very
importantly get them to see that the food that they're
putting into their body actually affects not just how fat
they are it affects how they feel it affects their
energy levels and of course with kids is a little
hard to to convince them of that because they have
great health usually when they start off they don't have
energy problems and so forth but still you can start
to show them that their consciousness is affected their ability
to focus is affected how they feel is affected based
on what kind of food they're putting into their body
and give them the idea that hey wouldn't you rather
feel good have a lot of energy rather than eating
this junk food and then getting bogged down and then
you can't go play you can't go have fun you
can't do other activities that you love to do as
much it's very important that you teach them life purpose
and mastery so everything in my life purpose course the
earlier you can teach that to your kid the better
you need to get your kids so start thinking about
what do they want their life to be about get
them to start planning from seven years old they should
be already planning about what kind of career do they
want what kind of things that they want to create
with their life what kind of technical skills should they
be learning in order to have that kind of impact
in the world what are they passionate about doing the
most is it art is it science is it language
is it comedy you know whatever it is doesn't really
matter and then help them to start working towards that
and building towards it of course they're mine is gonna
be scatterbrain they're gonna be all over the place they
might not know what they want to do but the
whole point of their childhood is that they should be
figuring that out by dabbling in all sorts of stuff
and you need to be helping them to dabble in
that and teach them the theory behind the mastery process
so that they have a clear idea in their mind
what it takes to master a thing I know that
for me personally this was something I really could have
used in my childhood because there's a lot of stuff
that I wanted to master like I wanted to become
good at drawing or I wanted to become good at
at programming or at designing or whatever and I just
didn't have the the theory and nobody told me about
the theory of mastery of like hey there's actually a
process for how you master something and it's rather tricky
it's counterintuitive and it's deceptive because your mind will get
you to quit and you require patience and you require
steadiness and you require going through these plateaus like I
talked about in my mastery episode a long time ago
so all these things you guys teach them early on
if you want them to start building these skills and
then of course you demonstrate it in your own life
through showing them how you are mastering certain things in
your life you're a career tell them about how you
did it and all the struggle you went through it's
really important they understand how much struggle and how much
failure goes into mastering anything because as a kid it's
really easy to just get an idea try to go
do it but then you get one or two failures
and then you quit thinking that oh well I'm not
good at that like I'm not a good painter I'm
not a good artist see as a kid I tried
doing drawing and I wasn't very good at it but
nobody told me that hey you're not born a good
drawer you teach yourself you need to go through this
mastery process and I didn't know that until it was
too late also you got to teach them about the
mind-body connection this is something that Western culture teaches very
poorly not at all and in fact actively denies this
we treat the mind and the body as two separate
things and you got to show them the interconnection between
this this is more the Eastern approach so a good
way to do that is to teach them yoga but
you got to teach them that their thoughts affect their
emotions their emotions are physically located in their body they
can become conscious of this and then of course how
they feel in their body affects how they think so
this whole thing is this interconnected feedback system and it's
all interconnected in a holistic way and that if they're
feeling bad their body that's gonna affect how they think
and if they think poorly then that's gonna affect how
they feel in their body I wish I knew that
when I was much younger I remember I had these
terrible stomach aches as as a teenager for years I
would suffer through these stomachaches because nobody told me that
it was how I was thinking that was creating stress
that was leading to like irritable bowel syndrome and all
the sort of stuff that I thought was just a
physical ailment that I had until just through trial-and-error at
some point early in college I realized that hey actually
my thoughts affect what my stomach is feeling that was
a huge discovery for me and I was I was
I thought I was crazy that I made this discovery
because like nobody around me was thinking about this sort
of mind-body connection nobody was talking about it they didn't
teach it to me in school and certainly wasn't written
about in the textbooks all the textbooks treat the mind
and body as separate things you also need to teach
them about the deceptive nature of the mind and how
beliefs work and the difference between direct experience direct consciousness
and beliefs teach this to them very early on teach
them the dangers of ideology the dangers of just blindly
believing things the dangers of dogma the dangers of tribalism
teach them the fundamentals of epistemology and teach this stuff
as early as humanly possible this is super important and
this will inoculate them against all sorts of bad belief
systems and of course this is not licensed for you
to imprint them with your own ideology you have to
be very careful about taking sort of Socratic method where
you are not filling their mind with concrete beliefs and
ideas because that just contributes more to the problem but
that you get them to discover how beliefs and ideas
work make them very conscious of this so that they
see what their own mind is doing and how its
tricking them so that then can really avoid all those
traps especially later in the teenage years when they're gonna
be prone to all sorts of ideologies teach snow about
the limits of rationality and the limits of thinking man
I wish I wish some of this stuff was taught
to me when I was younger it would have made
life so much easier and life would have made so
much more sense but see I went through school thinking
that thinking is all there is rationality is all there
is and most people do and most people even go
through college thinking that and they end up being adults
like that living their whole life as though rationality is
the end-all be-all teach them that there is something called
awareness something called consciousness which has nothing to do with
rationality has nothing to do with thinking teach them to
become aware of what goes on in between their thoughts
when they're not thinking what's their what's in the gap
between one thought and another thought see as kids they
have enormous potential for consciousness for them it's going to
be super easy as adults for you maybe right now
consciousness work enlightenment work this existential questioning of your paradigms
it's all very challenging why is that because your mind
has been calcified with all this ideology all these ideas
that you haven't questioned for a solid thirty years you
took it for granted and now you're starting to question
it and it's really hard but for their minds their
minds gonna be totally fresh and they're gonna have a
direct line to to consciousness just pure raw consciousness they're
still gonna have that connection for the first 10 15
years of their life and if you just feed them
a little bit of these nuggets and just kind of
guide them in the right direction they have enormous potential
for having all sorts of interesting insights for themselves about
the nature of the mind and all this stuff even
deeper insights that maybe you'll ever have teach them techniques
like visualization and formations and show them that these are
very simple techniques that they can do every single day
to work towards whatever goals they might have teach them
systems-thinking holism and seeing the world from perspectives this paradigm
of seeing the world from different perspectives is huge so
that they don't get caught up in any one perspective
show them that a perspective just a partial way and
it's just one way out of perhaps many ways there
are not just two sides of the coin there are
just two ways to look at every issue there are
hundreds of ways to look at different issues and there
are different pros and cons teach them subtle thinking rather
than just black and white thinking and of course the
best way to teach all this stuff is to demonstrate
it for yourself in your own life and then as
you demonstrate it they will pick it up off of
you and then of course you can supplement by explicate
the actual theory behind teach them strategic thinking teach them
to think long term about their choices to think about
the consequences of their choices and teach them that their
choices might have counterintuitive consequences where they think they're gonna
do this and that's gonna lead to some result but
actually oftentimes because the mine is so self deceptive that
actually it'll lead to exact opposite of result like they
think they're gonna go and do that and be happy
but actually it's gonna make them depressed and get them
to start to think about that and get them to
start to think about strategizing hope for their career strategizing
with their relationships strategizing with their money and their finances
all this sort of stuff this can be taught very
very early on and what's what's cool about all these
topics is that they're inherently fascinating and interesting so this
isn't some boring lecture that you need to give to
them is just like you got to teach them from
the very outset that life is a very interesting system
that they are studying after growing up this is what
the whole process of life is all about is just
about studying and understanding more and more and more about
this magical thing that you're part of very importantly teach
them how true happiness works teach them that success is
not happiness teach them that oftentimes even when they get
what they want they end up not being satisfied like
they want a certain toy they want to go to
a party they want to watch a movie whatever and
you do that with them and they think oh now
I'm gonna be happy but then show them a hey
look are you still happy now after you played with
that toy for five minutes and then they can see
oh no I'm not happy actually I'm kind of disappointed
because I played with this toy I thought it was
gonna be great and now I'm not happy with this
this game that I played or whatever right see and
then show them how that's how life works it's very
counterintuitive and then get them to start to understand well
win um in my life am I actually truly happy
when I'm just being when I'm not moving towards something
when I'm not chasing something but I'm just being see
so that they start to learn that being is where
true happiness resides and they don't confuse it with success
or money or sex or having lots of friends or
being well-liked or having good reputation at school or getting
good grades that none of that stuff is true happiness
that will be a huge lesson that you can teach
them teach them about backfiring mechanisms teach them that a
lot of things that they do will backfire in their
life that's precisely why they have to be much more
strategic and they have to learn to outwit their own
mind teach them about good versus evil and what those
concepts really are teach them about what judgments really are
teach them about what the devil is Tissot about what
the ego is and what selfishness is teach them how
business really works and how marketing works and of course
for that you need to yourself learn how business really
works and how marketing works there's a lot to learn
there and a lot to teach but it's also very
fascinating teach them how to build habits this is also
one of those things that I didn't get when I
was young I didn't know anything about habits or how
to build them or why they're important and how challenging
they are to build but also how beneficial they can
be teach them about male and female psychology I have
a whole episode about that which goes into the differences
that are very important to understand both for males and
females about the opposite sex because again this is something
that's not taught in school and I know that when
I was growing up for a long time one of
the biggest problems I have with the opposite sex and
I just didn't understand it and I thought that it
was the same I didn't really understand that there was
a difference in psychology I mean of course physically I
knew we look different but I didn't really understand that
that men and women think differently it took me quite
late to figure that out teach them money management investing
and wealth creation and wealth is not the same thing
as money creating wealth and having money are two different
things rather than having them chasing money have them understanding
how wealth is actually built and for that you might
need to teach yourself the difference between money and wealth
and there are good seminars and courses and books that
you can read about that this is huge because money
problems for many people end up plaguing them as adults
till the end of their life if a kid is
not taught proper money management they will either waste their
money way too quickly and they will overspend and they
will buy a bunch of stuff on credit and screw
themselves over really badly that way or the opposite they'll
become very stingy and they won't know how to use
their money to grow their money and how to use
their money to invest in themselves to build the kind
of life that they could build and they won't know
how money and wealth is actually generated it's not just
generated by having a job there's a lot more that
goes into wealth creation and they need to understand that
difference teach them the dangers of scammers con artists and
all the traps that are there within mainstream culture there
are a lot of traps in mainstream culture like gambling
the lottery entering contest expecting stuff for free and it
just kind of goes on and on all sorts of
Ponzi schemes credit cards various kinds of loans payday loans
and other sorts of loans it's like all these traps
which can ruin your life if you think about it
if you get caught in one of these bad enough
you can ruin your life here just make them very
aware of these not paranoid about it but just aware
of them a lot of parents I think don't do
this and then that's why their kids get caught up
in these things that's why these traps exist because new
people are born every single day and these new people
have no idea that these scams are scams and so
they get caught up with them because their parents don't
teach them teach them about the corruption in our social
systems teach them that our education system is not perfect
that that has limits teach them that there's deep corruptions
within our religious system within our political system within our
government within university systems and just culture as a whole
start to teach them that it's not just to be
taken for granted it's not always their friend it's not
always true and it's not always to their benefit in
fact a lot of culture is very dumbed down and
actually unhealthy and dysfunctional and that they need to be
very careful because they're gonna be partaking in a lot
of popular culture as kids of course will do you
can't prevent them from doing that because all their friends
are gonna be going to movies and playing video games
and doing all this or low consciousness cultural stuff and
so you can't you can't shield them to that from
that too much but you can make them aware of
some of the dangers there and teach them technical skills
make sure they learn skills like programming Photoshop Web Design
maybe music composition drawing tinkering with electronics building their own
computers like teach them all that kind of practical technical
stuff because first of all those skills are actually well-paid
skills and they can get a pretty decent job with
those skills rather than working in McDonald's if they know
some Photoshop or some web design or some programming or
some some tinkering that will that will make their career
beginnings a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable and
also because these skills I found that these skills are
critical to be able to kind of just like bootstrap
yourself in life I feel like a lot of kids
don't develop these skills and then the only option they
have is when they're in high school or college is
that they like do babysitting or working at McDonald's just
these kind of like very simple jobs which have no
real growth potential they're not very well paid and they
just like they don't contribute to anything whereas if your
kids start to get passionate about programming or Photoshop or
web design I can actually take them to a whole
career or at the very least they'll have some skills
that will serve as a foundation so they make they
can never like go broke in the worst case scenario
they'll just go and use those skills to earn a
decent living and then anything else beyond that it's just
extra and also I found that a lot of these
technical skills are critical for them to build let's say
any kind of business they might want to start programming
web design graphic design tinkering whatever that will all help
them towards that end so give them some some courses
take them to some workshops to learn all this stuff
here are the most important values that you should your
children firstly is truth that's the most important value and
by truth I don't mean honesty that's something else I
mean teach them to love and to value truth for
truth sake which is not them being truthful to you
it's them being truthful to themselves and them caring to
know what the truth is for its own sake because
they just want to know what's real this is where
the existential questioning comes from when you care about the
truth a lot that means you will invest a lot
of time questioning reality simply because you care to know
what's real for its own sake and the best way
I think to teach this value is to have deep
philosophical discussions with them about the nature of reality show
them how fascinating it is show them how interesting truth
is show them the possibilities of where truth can take
them and show them the dangers of what happens to
people when they don't hold truth as the highest value
show them the dangers of valuing truth only for utilitarian
purposes to get to some other ends show them what
that leads to the next value is consciousness teach them
what low consciousness is versus high consciousness how to distinguish
those two teach them as some techniques for raising their
own consciousness and for also scanning their environment for low
consciousness behavior and high consciousness behavior and of course how
to scan it within yourself as well teach them the
importance of learning and understanding as the next value probably
the most important thing you can do for your kid
is to instill in them a deep curiosity about life
and get them to buy into the idea of lifelong
learning so that learning is not just something that happens
within school it's not just about homework it's not something
that's gonna end after the exit college it's something that
life is about it's like you're born and you're here
and now your job is to learn forever until you're
dead and so your whole life is about learning and
learning is not something that you just do in school
because your teacher forces you to learning is is a
privilege and it's one of the most interesting facets of
life and it produces all the most important results based
on learning and understanding everything else is built a good
career good relationships good family happiness emotional mastery anything anything
is built on learning it all starts there that's why
this is one of the most important gifts you can
give them teach them the value of wisdom the wisdom
versus just knowledge or information or just trivia or just
beliefs teach them what wisdom is teach them the value
of passion and how powerful passion can be so they
are passionate about life they're passionate about what they're doing
they're passionate about their career they're passionate about their schoolwork
don't have them just do stuff just to do stuff
have them doing stuff which they intrinsically want to do
teach them the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation so
that they become self driven teach them the value of
creativity and how one of the most amazing things about
life is the potential that they have to be creative
in whatever field they want to go into and that
creativity is is a skill in and of itself and
that this is a skill it can be cultivated it's
not something you're just born with you can learn tools
and techniques and theory behind creativity and you can become
extremely creative in whatever field you want to become creative
teach them the importance of compassion for other living beings
and the easiest way to do that is to show
them what it's like to live life from somebody else's
perspective get them to do thought experiments about how hey
what would it be like if you were that bum
on the street corner begging for money try to think
and imagine what would it be like to to live
a day in his shoes see and teach them to
step into the shoes of their enemies and people they
disagree with with their teachers with their friends with girls
with boys with people that they make fun of see
so that they become really good at shifting perspectives and
they become so fluent in that that you break down
all these artificial barriers between us and them and me
and other and lastly teach them the value of hard
work and excellence in what they do get them to
value a hard work ethic and show them that through
a hard work ethic they can create the kind of
life that they want and that actually being lazy is
in many ways a harder way to live life than
to just do hard work because by becoming lazy they
will have all these problems with procrastination and they won't
have money and then they'll be feeling guilty and so
like all of all this stuff comes up in it's
just so much more complicated to be lazy in life
than to be passionate and hard-working all of this that
I'm talking about is going to inoculate your kids against
chimp behavior which will tend to crop up as soon
as they get into their teenage years so this is
all the stuff that parents dread and that parents fight
with their teenagers over so it's like sex drugs partying
not doing your homework not cleaning your room and and
being lazy and she's like all this sort of stuff
right this is a problem that really needs to be
solved much much earlier in your kids development than in
the teenage years if you're dealing with those problems in
the teenage years then you fail to do a lot
of the stuff what I'm talking about here because this
stuff you do this stuff from the age of let's
say 7 to 12 then this will inoculate them against
the most unconscious behavior that leads to all the problems
that of course as a parent you don't want to
be dealing with that's all the chip behavior so if
you make them conscious early on before they're even 10
years old then they will naturally of course not there's
no guarantees here but they will naturally tend to see
see you don't need to tell them not to do
it they will naturally see that hey I don't want
to behave like a chimp because there's like bigger things
that I'm after in life whereas most kids they don't
have they don't have the higher vision for their life
so they just go behaving like chimps and then that
leads to all the parenting problems and and all this
back and forth that doesn't need to happen now of
course your kids are your kids and they're are their
own people and they have their own karma so there's
no guarantees about what they end up doing they have
to make their own choices and there's only so much
you can do it's very important here that you don't
go manipulating your children too much and micromanaging them telling
them all you got to do this and you got
to do that to avoid all this and so you're
it sounds like if you miss apply my advice here
that you're gonna be really anal about what your kids
are doing that's not what I'm advocating at all what
I'm advocating them is is instead get them intrinsically interested
in this stuff not like force-feeding it down their throat
but through demonstrating it yourself through living your own life
this way and through having interesting discussions with them about
all these sorts of topics pointing out different facets of
life that they should become cognizant of they will naturally
start to see this and then they will generally tend
to behave accordingly another really good tip I have for
you is stock your house with fun learning tools rather
than buying them childish toys which a lot of parents
do you know like stuffed toys and Sesame Street all
that kind of crap try to buy them tools instead
of toys and show them how much cooler the tools
are rather than the toys it's like would you rather
have a Barbie or would you rather have an electric
piano that you can practice on or some cool art
books or some puzzles or here's a microscope here's a
telescope here's some painting supplies here's some cool computer program
that you can use like computer software such as Photoshop
3d modeling software programming software I mean there's so much
software available these days which is quite intuitive and easy
to use and also there's a lot of tools and
tutorials available or how-to for how to use that now
of course you're gonna have to buy them some toys
that's fine you can buy them toys but what I'm
telling you here is create your house as an environment
full of this stuff not so that you have to
go out and buy it for them but that it's
already there like you already have the microscope you already
have the telescope it's all it's all there living in
the living room see you have tons of books you
have magazines interesting magazines about nature about dinosaurs about history
about science about whatever and just set up this sort
of playground so that they gravitates towards this rather than
a lot of the sort of like time wasting cheap
entertainment that society offers them instead and really importantly as
part of this is assemble a giant library of course
of physical books that's very important but also courses tutorials
audio and video seminars and audio books so that this
library is available and it has literally you can have
hundreds of courses on there and tutorials that teach them
everything from programming to Photoshop to drawing to singing to
music composition you name it and so they could just
click on that and access it immediately think about how
how big of a difference that can man I wish
I had that when I was a kid um the
internet was just barely coming online it's so much easier
to get that stuff nowadays it's cheap a lot of
it is free you can just download it find it
or buy it personally I have a huge collection of
this already for myself and if I ever had a
kid I would first thing I would do is I
would share this massive library of all this cool learning
material it would be just like years and years and
years I could just give my my hard drives to
a kid and that would that alone would be better
than everything that they would ever learn in school that's
how powerful the information is on these hard drives that
I have and you could easily create these hard drives
for yourself you know interestingly they did research on kids
who thrive the most and do well in school the
most and you know what they found they found that
when they compared all the factors what correlates the best
with kids who do good in school what they found
is very surprising it's that the quality of the school
that they went to was not as important as how
many books were on the bookshelves of their parents houses
so if you took a kid who went to the
best private school and you compared him to a kid
who had a parent who had a lot of books
on his bookshelf the but who went just to a
basic public school that kid would do better than the
private school kid if the private school kid also didn't
have a huge library of books at home see and
what that shows you is the importance of the parent
in their children's success because it's not so much just
about having a bunch of books on your bookshelf it's
the fact that a parent who would be the kind
of parent who does have a bunch of books on
their bookshelf that's a parent who is naturally curious and
interested in learning and of course a parent who is
naturally interested in learning will infect their child with that
interest and it's that which actually fuels them to go
out and to learn not whether they're in a private
or public school that's not nearly as important as the
intrinsic motivation that you put into your kid which is
why setting up this sort of environment that I'm talking
about is is such a good idea I would be
very careful with letting them have smartphones iPads video games
and television and in a way it's hypocritical for me
to say that because when I was a kid I
spent enormous amount of time playing video games and television
there were no smart phones or iPads back then but
it saddens me these days when I go to restaurants
or I'm at the airport these little kids almost toddlers
sitting in kids chairs at restaurants with these iPads or
these Kindles and they're just playing games like non [
__ ] stop and they're like four years old maybe
even younger it's just a terrible terrible disservice to your
child to do that like you're just setting them up
for a BD and for being addicted for the rest
of their life to the Internet media and all this
sort of stuff and I know that's really hard because
for parents of course you know your kids drive you
crazy so it's so much easier to buy them an
iPad and just have them play games quietly while you
enjoy your dinner rather than having them sit there and
actually talk to you or ask you stupid questions or
whatever or make jokes but man that's gonna make a
huge difference I think that the next generation that grows
up on these smart phones and iPads is gonna be
mentally crippled they're gonna have an even harder time to
do consciousness work than the past generation and that's a
scary idea and with virtual reality coming online in the
next 10 20 years it's only gonna get worse so
watch out and this is very hard because all their
friends are gonna have course iPads and phones so how
do you prevent them from from from all this well
it's it's hard I mean you're not gonna prevent it
totally that's unrealistic and in a sense the more that
you prohibit them from using it the more they'll want
to use it and so that becomes a bit tricky
but I think that by getting them more interested in
consciousness work and having this sort of environment at home
where you don't have a television but you have all
these microscopes and telescopes and magazines and books and stuff
like that that you'll nudge them in the right direction
of course it won't be perfect they'll still come out
of high school addicted to media the only question will
be how much and then to this end also I
think a really good tool for kids is taking them
outdoors into national parks especially if you live in the
US we have all these amazing national parks especially here
in the West in California and Nevada and Utah and
so on but it'd be all around the country they
exist get them interested in nature get them interested in
animals get them interested in dinosaur like oh there's all
this sort of stuff that kids will naturally love so
that they experience the joy of learning once you get
them hooked on the joy of learning the way that
I got hooked when I was in my early teens
man that's gonna make all the difference in the world
it's gonna make their schooling so much easier not gonna
have to fight them to do their homework you're not
gonna fight them to get good grades they will naturally
just do all that stuff because they'll want to learn
and then they'll go above and beyond all that when
you give them all these cool tutorials and books and
tools to do it of course you need to learn
personal development and teach it to your children gradually if
you have to like sprinkle that in over 20 years
of their development and then when they get older of
course you can actually give them some of the best
person development books infect your children with a passion for
life I see this as one of the biggest problems
that teenagers have is it just they have no sense
of direction their life is so easy their parents just
provide them with everything but no reason to be passionate
no reason to be hard-working no sense of purpose you
need to help them to find their purpose in life
this is a key thing you got to help them
to dabble in different career paths to discover what they
really want to do what they love who they want
to be whether it's music writing art science philosophy help
them just to go through that and eliminate all the
things that they definitely don't want to do it's like
well I've tried being a programmer I definitely don't like
that I've tried doing art I definitely don't like that
but maybe I want to do some writing so then
they're kind of leaning in that direction and then help
them to explore that and then give them an idea
of what it would be like to have a career
as a writer and is that something that they really
want this is something that I see that most parents
never do and then what their kids end up doing
is just getting the most lame job they can and
as soon as that happens that's that's sort of the
end of the beginning of the end because by that
point they have nothing in life to look forward to
nothing to be really be passionate about other than just
like entertainment video games and and maybe sex those sorts
of low consciousness things expose your children early on as
early as possible to multiple cultures this is really helpful
for creating radical open-mindedness one of the things I'm most
thankful for in my own development is that I wasn't
an American I moved to America when I was 6
7 years old and that had a huge impact on
my my open-mindedness because I never felt like I totally
fit into the culture and I was sort of able
to see through the assumptions of American culture without completely
getting sucked into that paradigm that was huge I think
that having your kids live abroad is very important and
in fact if you want to move to a different
country for a few years just to give them that
experience that alone would be worth it that would be
worth all the hassle just so they start to see
that oh there's like one way to live in America
that's one bubble and there's another way to live in
France or in Canada or in Mexico that's a totally
different bubble it's like a totally different world that shows
them that oh this American bubble is just a bubble
culture is just culture like there's so many different cultures
out there and you can't take anyone too seriously and
you start to see that oh that's just one paradigm
here's another paradigm here's another perspective here's another perspective and
they all have their own pros and cons and none
of them is perfect set a good example for your
kids by eating healthy and exercising by meditating by reading
by journaling and taking notes by not criticizing people by
not hating on people really watch out with your judgments
criticism and hatred of other people or other groups because
when your kids see you hating on religion or on
science or on a certain philosophy or on a certain
politician or in a certain group of people certain culture
they will absorb that hatred and then that stick with
them for a long long time teach them how to
socialize this is something that school doesn't teach very well
even though by going to school they will be socializing
and that's really good that's a really important aspect of
school but also teach them some of the theory behind
socializing because school doesn't teach the theory of it like
what is confidence how do you think about other people
when they make jokes about you when they humiliate you
when they embarrass you when they give you an attitude
when they want to pick a fight with you when
you don't feel very confident how do you build up
your confidence socially how do you small talk how do
you avoid gossip or any of that kind of stuff
there's all this kind of theory that you can teach
them about this which how would I love to have
when I was a kid I had no idea about
any of this theory until many many years later when
it was way too late make it easy for your
kids to eat healthy so eliminate junk food from your
house try to have and this is hard to try
to have good healthy snacks for them this is hard
because you need to prepare them it's harder to prepare
healthy food than it is junk food you got to
go shop for it more shop for more vegetables and
fruits and of course your kids don't want to eat
that nearly as much as they want to eat junk
food so that'll be tricky but you've got to find
the recipes that they're willing to to eat and you
got to find some stuff that's convenient and quick enough
for you to make so that you're not tempted to
just take them to junk food or order pizza it's
very important that you respect your kids unique passions and
tastes and that you just don't impose your own ideas
for who they should be so that's why I said
you got to help them to discover who they are
help them to discover what kind of life purpose they
might want not what you want them to be but
what their own natural strengths and talents and inclinations are
inclining them towards and that's tricky because your kids might
be into some weird [ __ ] that you might
think oh man that's that's got no chance of going
anywhere that's not gonna work as a career that's silly
that's ridiculous that's not that's not gonna fly but then
your kid is still passionate about it and then you're
critical about it that's not gonna work you got to
be very careful about taking yourself out of the picture
for me this was tricky because when I was a
kid I was really interested in videogames I wanted to
become a videogame designer when I was very very young
and the problem though was is that even though I
was very passionate about it that was in the early
90s when video games were still a very niche thing
they weren't considered a respectable career they weren't even considered
a respectable form of media like film or like music
and so when I talked with my dad about it
like he always kind of dismissed me and he always
poopoo the idea like all video games you can't be
a video game designer that's silly that's ridiculous those are
just toys you don't want to make toys for a
living and that was really challenging I had to work
against that to become a video game designer ultimately I
did become one and actually in retrospect he was kind
of right cuz he told me that you know you're
gonna grow out of your passion for video games and
I didn't believe him I said no I'll be passionate
about them forever and in the sense I'm still passionate
about the art of creating video games but I've just
found something much deeper which is what I'm currently doing
instead but nevertheless it would have been nice to get
some support in that career because it was really challenging
to to find my own way through that and then
if not but for some fluke luck I would have
probably never been able to realize that career I had
to have enormous passion to push through some of the
resistance there so be careful about doing that with your
kids kind of be open because sometimes your kids actually
their minds are fresh they can see new ideas and
new trends within society that you as an adult especially
now your you're in your 40s or 50s as you're
raising these kids you're not able to be as visionary
as them like I saw how big video games we're
gonna get when I was just a kid and I
knew that I want to be a part of that
trend but see there's no way that my dad or
my parents could really appreciate that and so as a
parent you have to see your own limitations you have
a lot of wisdom especially if you're teaching them all
this stuff you've got a ton of wisdom but also
you have limitations there are certain things that your kids
will know especially about what they really want and what
they can get excited about that you can never know
so you have to be very receptive to that and
not just drown them out with your own ideas I
would recommend de-emphasizing grades and Ivy League education I wish
that this happened in my own life I got addicted
to this whole game of getting good grades getting accolades
from my teachers and for my parents and working to
go to a fancy Ivy League university doing all that
SAT prep and going through all the hard classes all
that [ __ ] it was just so pointless in
a certain sense it was good that I learned up
study skills and I developed a certain love for self
education in that process but what was bad about it
was the whole chasing of grades and this whole idea
that you got to go to a good university to
to become successful in life or to be smart or
to be wise nothing could be further from the truth
and these days getting into these universities is getting more
and more competitive more and more expensive and it's just
to the point where it's ridiculous rather than having them
play that game instead emphasize self education emphasize learning technical
skills learning practical skills learning wisdom developing meditation practices learning
psychology practically the stuff that they can embody in their
own lives doing self inquiry this stuff is way more
important it's going to stick with them for the rest
of lives where as distil ivy-league [ __ ] is
is just gonna actually move them further away from consciousness
cuz once they go to a fancy Ivy League Harvard
University something like that then they're gonna be caught up
in that whole game of chasing status and all these
reputations and prestige and going to the to the best
jobs and the best law firms all I call this
kind of this whole game and there is no fulfillment
to be found there none at all and yet if
you go it on your own and you develop all
these practical skills and you actually become a very creative
human being who has a life purpose and who understands
mastery and you have emotional self control and wisdom and
consciousness Wow you can start your own business you can
be a valuable asset in any company you can build
a great portfolio so there's gonna be no problem with
the job opportunities there it's very important that you accept
your children for who they are and the trick here
is to balance everything that I'm saying with this component
of acceptance and unconditional love because if you just lecture
to your children and criticize them constantly about all the
stuff that they're not doing not checking off every box
on this list that I'm giving then you're gonna screw
them up even more than if you never mentioned any
of the stuff on this list so you got to
be careful about how you choose to apply it it
has to be done in a sort of collaborative manner
where they are in on it with you and not
that you're forcing them to do all this stuff in
the way that you would force them to do homework
or chores see and if they're not able to do
some of this stuff then that's your burden to swallow
that pill and to be cool with that to accept
it anyways see because one of the worst things you
can do is is to not accept your kids for
who they are and then what that would lead to
is all sorts of neurotic problems and this is some
of the worst just stuff that bad parenting can lead
to is neuroses there's many factors that lead to neuroses
but I'll cover some of the biggest ones here by
neurosis I also mean low self-esteem this is the stuff
that goes to your kids beliefs about him or herself
and what they can accomplish in the world and once
these beliefs are eroded or they're not built up properly
then this is the stuff that leads to dysfunctional adults
dysfunctional relationships dysfunctional career patterns dysfunctional behavior substance abuse physical
abuse violence getting caught up in gangs and the wrong
type of people the wrong types of friends becoming a
victim becoming a doormat for people to abuse you confidence
issues sexuality issues just all this stuff comes up right
depression and anxiety and so on and so forth and
this can be very easily prevented by avoiding a couple
of key things so be very careful first with your
criticism of your kids try not to criticize them and
if you do do it in a very kind of
light and constructive manner make sure that you give them
room to make mistakes and in fact they need to
learn that failure is not a bad thing but a
good thing and that in fact their strategy in life
should be to fail as often as possible and that
that's how they will ultimately succeed and you need to
recognize that that if they're failing that's okay that means
they're learning so be careful with your criticism obviously don't
physically harm them in any way don't slap them don't
hit them even small slapping and hitting will lead to
long term neuroses and shadow problems that they will need
to spend years in therapy as adults to fix and
some of this stuff they will not even be able
to fix after 10 or 20 years of therapy and
thousands and thousands of dollars so be very careful if
you're to create if you hit them too much if
you humiliate them or you ridicule them if you let
them get bullied if you manipulate them all the time
if you withdraw your love for them as a form
of threat for non-compliance all this stuff will create low
self-esteem and neuroses which well you'll be dealing with that
stuff for years to come and so will they so
be careful make sure you protect them from older siblings
if they have older siblings like a brother or sister
they will get bullied so you got to watch out
for the younger ones with the older ones of course
they can get bullied at school but that's harder for
you to to keep your eye on but of course
you should keep your eye on that if you see
it happening your job with your kids is to walk
this fine line between sheltering them too much from making
mistakes and just letting them roam free and then that
might lead to the possibility of catastrophic mistakes so your
job as a parent should be to prevent catastrophic mistakes
don't let them kill themselves don't let them poke their
eye out don't like don't let them lose a leg
or an arm in a wood chipper right obviously that's
very important but then aside from that basically let your
kids roam free and create a little bit of havoc
and learn from their own mistakes and suffer from the
consequences of what they're doing this is very important because
you need to let your kid build autonomy autonomy is
sort of self Drive self motivation and also self reflection
and self-governance so that your child is ever able to
think about their own life independently and that they know
that if they don't strategize right they will have to
suffer the consequences of the fallout from that it's super
super important that you don't use the withdrawing of love
as a threat to manipulate your child into behaving in
the way that you want him to behave a lot
of parents do this it's like well if you don't
take out the trash then I'm not gonna love you
as much or if you don't do this thing here
then see it's a sort of quid pro quo type
of relationship and it's convenient at first because your kids
can be Rascals and you want to keep them in
line but you should never threaten them with comment cutting
off love because if you do that then they will
suffer from crippling self-esteem issues and that stuff once it
gets imprinted into a young mind it's really hard to
undo really really hard that'll take years of spiritual work
to undo that stuff and it will be painful and
it will be costly for your kids and also it'll
lead to a lot of problems in their teenage years
because if they got low self-esteem in their teenage years
that's what leads them to joining all these sorts of
bad groups of people and getting caught up in stupid
ideologies and all all that kind of low consciousness stuff
that that kids do drugs abuse and violence etc don't
guilt them about sex don't do [ __ ] shaming
don't demonize masturbation or pornography make sure that they understand
that sex is a natural thing and that you are
not like the cop teach them responsible and mature attitude
toward sex don't solve their problems for them give them
instead tools to solve their own problems rather than micromanaging
them plant seed seeds for self-governance don't berate them for
their mistakes show them that their actions have consequences and
get them to feel a little bit of suffering and
show them what suffering is all about and why suffering
exists it's a tool suffering is a tool that your
mind provides in order to show you that you're [
__ ] up this is a really good teacher it's
really important that as a parent you understand that your
kids are your own people their own people and that
they have to make their own mistakes and that they
can't just absorb your own life lessons a lot of
people make this mistake a lot of parents is they
think that well in my childhood you know I had
this problem or I had that problem and now I'm
gonna teach my children to avoid that problem but this
ends up backfiring because the reason you learned to avoid
that problem is because you actually went through the suffering
and all the drama that came with it you see
and that instilled the lesson in you and now when
you're trying to communicate that listen theoretically to your kid
the kid can understand it theoretically but that's never nearly
as deep as how you understand it because you've gone
through that process so you have to expect them to
also go through this process of trial and error so
reflect on your own childhood and how much trial and
error and how many mistakes you've made to learn the
lessons you've learned and now understand that your kid will
have to go through that process you can't short-circuit that
you can't cut their learning curve what you can do
is you can kind of guide them a little bit
in the right direction and provide them the right tools
and the right theoretical foundations that you didn't have that
you wish you had all this stuff that I'm talking
about don't stress too much over providing them with material
luxuries and private schooling I mean those things are nice
but in many ways they can be a distraction really
what you want to focus on is the fundamentals of
building a high consciousness psychology within them and building character
don't shield them too much from adult content when parents
do this to me it feels like they don't respect
the intelligence or maturity of the child it's like you're
telling the child well you're just a child so you
shouldn't know about some of these kind of adult topics
well if you treat your child that way then don't
be surprised that then they are an immature child don't
give them fake explanations for things like God and birth
and sex and murder and rape and violence and war
and death these topics they can start thinking about when
they're young from seven years old you can start thinking
about all these topics what is death yeah you're gonna
die and I'm gonna die we're all gonna die so
what does that mean for your life does that depress
you why does it depress you you see I feel
like a lot of adults inoculate or I mean numb
insulate their kids from these adult issues and then when
the adults grow up they don't really have a very
deep understanding of these things and then their life reflects
that they live a very shallow sort of existence because
they haven't spent a lot of time as teenagers thinking
about death and war and violence and rape and murder
and all this sort of stuff when really you should
be because these are very foundational cornerstone issues of life
when you think about them when you contemplate them it
changes who you are and who you want to become
and what you think is worthwhile to do in life
and what's not worthwhile have philosophical conversations with them and
a great way to do this is through taking road
trips like if you take a long road trip to
some national park you're gonna have hours in that car
doing nothing rather than having them play on their gameboy
and their iPad have a philosophical conversation about the nature
of life and death that's a life transforming conversation one
of the things I'm really grateful for in the way
that I was raised I was generally raised in a
very liberal sort of laissez-faire environment where my parents didn't
tell me to do anything it's like I had nothing
to do I had no rules I could do anything
I wanted to and in a sense this was very
powerful because I could make huge mistakes but also I
understood that if I didn't guide my own life my
life would go to hell and that would it would
be [ __ ] because nobody was forcing me to
do anything so this made me very very intrinsically motivated
from the get-go and one of the things I'm really
grateful for is that me and my dad had some
interesting philosophical conversations on road trips I'll go with road
trips too with him on road trips and we would
have these interesting philosophical conversations about the nature of reality
and that's what opened the doors for me to philosophy
and to skepticism and to existential thinking and it was
just very light because my dad didn't know anything about
consciousness or about enlightenment or about anything like that but
just the fact that he was interested in some questions
about reality and then he kind of introduced me to
that then I took it to a whole new level
and then I sort of turned my whole life uh-huh
in that direction and that was huge that was huge
and that got me very curious about all of life
basically and then from that everything that I've accomplished and
everything that I've experienced sort of stemmed for them and
I think that a lot of kids miss out on
this component because you know in our culture kids are
infantilized a lot you can play video games till you're
30 years old and that's considered actually quite normal most
video game players or adults these days are not even
kids but the problem with that is that it's it's
like we treat our children like they're children even when
they're 20 years old or thirty years old see and
then the children themselves think of themselves as children till
they're twenty or thirty years old when in fact in
ancient cultures it wasn't like that when you're 12 years
old in an ancient culture in some kind of like
tribe in the Amazon you're already a man you're already
a woman really your children become men and women as
soon as they reach sexual maturity which is at around
age 12 12 to 14 by 14 they are definitely
men and women and you got to treat them that
way and you got to make sure that they start
to think of themselves that way this is really important
and to this end one of the most important things
you can do for your kid is to create a
rite of passage this is something that ancient cultures used
to do but modern cultures don't do very well especially
in the West a rite of passage is a certain
kind of like ceremony that you create which creates a
clear line in their life which says that okay after
today from now on you have become a man or
a woman and you're no longer a child and I'm
gonna treat you differently now and for example in Native
American cultures they will have these rites of passages where
they will send the boy on a Vision Quest or
they will send the girl and they'll put her in
some tepee and she'll have to sit there for for
a week or whatever and the the boil have to
go out on a Vision Quest and they'll give them
some psychedelic some peyote or whatever he has to go
out there and hunt for for some kind of animal
a coyote and kill it and then he has to
come back and drag it back to the village and
then you know this whole thing happens then after this
everybody in the tribe treats the man and the woman
as a man and a woman not a boar a
girl and they think of themselves now as having grown
up and now totally different expectations apply to them now
they're expected to be responsible and mature and all this
and this is something that we don't do here in
America for example and it's really bad because I know
that when I was like 24 years old I still
felt like a child in many ways because there was
never like a clear line of when I became an
adult sure yeah you turn 18 or you turn 21
you think okay now I'm legally of age but you
don't really feel it especially because you spent your whole
childhood watching TV and playing video games doing all this
infantile stuff that you don't really feel like the responsibility
of being an adult and I think a lot of
modern teenagers get stuck in this because they never have
that clear sense of Lin of when it happened and
at the same time these teenagers of course they do
think of themselves as adults because they start to rebel
he start to have their own ideas and all this
sort of stuff and then the parent see it's important
to have a rite of passage for the parent as
well because if you and your mind as the parent
keep thinking of your kid as a kid until they're
30 years old or even beyond that you're really doing
them a disservice because how you think of them is
also how then they will think of their relationship with
you and then they will rebel against that or as
when you treat them in a mature way then they
will tend to act towards that expectation see and then
you give them more autonomy and as you give them
more autonomy they don't have to rebel as much because
they see it oh yeah my life is in my
own hands and I really could [ __ ] this
up and if I [ __ ] this up my
parents aren't just gonna come in and swoop in and
save me because now I'm an adult so like if
I go steal something and they lock me up in
jail my daddy and my mommy aren't just gonna come
and bail me out I'm gonna be stuck in that
jail see there has to be that sense of of
consequences to your actions that they understand and of course
that's difficult for you to do as a parent because
as a parent you want to help them out when
you can if they get into a mess you want
to help them out but you got to resist that
only help them out when they really are in a
catastrophic situation where like their life is in danger but
if they're just suffering from their own stupidity let them
suffer that and that's hard to do because you have
empathy of course for the time you don't want them
to suffer but also you got to do it because
if they don't suffer how are they gonna learn if
you always bail them out it's also really important if
you want to raise good kids to choose a high
quality partner who you're gonna do it with so your
wife or your husband you need to choose a loving
mom and a dependable dad woe unto you if you
choose a neurotic partner to raise your child with woe
unto you if you guys are not compatible if you're
not on the same page about how you want to
raise your child this is one of the biggest mistakes
that people make is they have children with the wrong
people and then all hell breaks loose and then it's
really hard to follow all the guidelines that I'm giving
you here of course it is because if your partner
is neurotic and they have a lot of their own
emotional issues and baggage and they are fundamentally a chimp
who is unconscious and you're the conscious one in the
relationship that's not gonna work that's gonna create way too
much friction both of you need to be into consciousness
work both of you need to be into personal development
into growth into learning into some of these values that
I'm telling you to teach your kids you can't do
that with a neurotic partner and it's very important in
that respect to also have love between you and your
spouse real love a lot of parents face this dilemma
of getting divorced while they have kids and they think
that well the divorce is so bad for the children
that we need to just stay together no matter what
but what they don't realize is that if you have
no true love between you and you still stay married
for the sake of the kids in many ways that
will be worse than if you had a a clean
cut amicable divorce if you just have a simple divorce
without letting it get nasty and toxic that will be
a lot better than what a lot of married couples
do is they stay together even though they don't love
each other anymore just because they think they have to
but actually it backfires because you think the kids won't
know but of course the kids are really sharp the
kids know there's no love between you and you're not
gonna be able to hide it for 20 years so
it's gonna come out anyways it's gonna come out and
how you look at your partner it's gonna come out
and tell how you talk in your tone in the
things you do or don't do together how you communicate
all that stuff is going to come out so if
your relationship is on the rocks and you already have
kids consider a clean cut divorce and if you're gonna
have a relationship with toxic love you got to understand
that your kids will pick that up they'll absorb it
and what you'll teach them is you'll teach them neurotic
love and then they will be forever screwed up in
their intimate relationships because of course they're gonna have your
relationship as a primary example and all the lying and
cheating and backstabbing and manipulation and dishonesty all that they
will think that okay that's how relationships are supposed to
work see well you need to make sure is that
if you're having kids with your spouse that you develop
very strong lines of communication between you two you need
to have failsafe systems where you - because you're gonna
disagree it's not a matter of if it's a matter
of when and how many times so there's gonna be
a lot of strong disagreements but you need to have
ways where you can um or you could communicate that
and work through that where you can purge this stuff
so that it's not festering under the rug if you
let it fester if you don't have these lines of
communication open where you can work through these disagreements wow
that's gonna explode and that's gonna do your kids are
really big disservice and also suggest that you give your
kids personality tests as soon as they're old enough the
myers-briggs the big five traits psychological traits and there are
many other personality assessments out there give them these assessments
not to pigeonhole them but so that you help them
to learn about who they are their natural strengths and
inclinations are so that they can then try to develop
a career around this in the future now as far
as the topic of public schools versus private schools versus
homeschooling just quickly what I'll say about this is that
it doesn't really matter as long as you do all
the other stuff that I said I mean a nice
private school of course would be great but a lot
of people can't afford that if you can't it's okay
just send them to a decent public school move to
a place where has a decent public school system and
as far as homeschooling that's tricky I used to think
homeschooling was silly and stupid but actually now after I've
done all this conscious work I see the benefits of
it and I think that homeschooling might be the most
powerful of all these the problem with homeschooling of course
is that it would take so much of your own
time and energy that most parents don't have this time
and energy to put into it so if you can
do it but also the danger with homeschooling is the
social element if you homeschool your kid he's gonna be
really dysfunctional socially because he needs to actually be interacting
with lots of kids in school and dealing with that
social peer pressure and all that he's gonna be facing
that later in his life and also dating and sexual
issues and male/female issues all that stuff bullying he needs
to he needs to get some experience with that he
needs to suffer through some of that and you're just
not going to be able to replicate that in a
homeschooling situation so just for that reason alone it might
be worthwhile to send him to a public school of
course the problem in the public school is that of
course they have terrible food and all sorts of terrible
low consciousness influences and and so on so you're not
going to be able to raise a perfectly high consciousness
kid in our society in this century it's just not
gonna happen what you can do is you can do
the best you can sort of at home as far
as all this other stuff that I was talking about
which will minimize the damage that they experience out in
our monkey minded culture now you're gonna be tempted to
cut corners with everything that I said there's gonna be
a lot of pressure on you as a parent to
buy your kid an iPad with a bunch of games
so they don't annoy you to feed your kids junk
food because it's cheaper and much more convenient to try
to outsource teaching them all this stuff to your school
thinking that oh well school will just teach them all
this stuff Noah won't all the stuff that I'm talking
about school barely even scratches the surface of some of
these things they don't mention at all like existential thinking
or enlightenment or meditation none of these things will ever
be mentioned in school or the other temptation with shortcuts
is to manipulate your kids for short-term results solving problems
for them rather than teaching them to solve their own
problems see it's very easy to manipulate your kids to
kind of do what you need them to do in
order to make your own life easier but what that
does is it yeah I get you your short-term result
your life is easier but in the long run your
kids don't build the right foundation and actually it'll make
your life harder because later on your kids will get
into all sorts of messes and trouble that could be
avoided if you nip them in the in the bud
here of course if it was easy to do all
the stuff that I'm talking about then all kids would
be rock stars so I'm under no illusions that it's
easy to do any of this I think that parenting
is very challenging I think it's a very serious commitment
which is precisely why you need to spend a lot
of time thinking about what would actually go into being
a good parent and I feel like a lot of
parents just wing it they don't think about this stuff
very much at all because hey they themselves don't know
almost any of this which is a lot of times
why they have kids in the first place just by
accident really because they don't know what the hell they're
doing remember that you can't guarantee how your kids will
turn out even the best parents have terrible kids you
might do everything I say here and your kid might
still become a heroin addict or a crack [ __
] and in fact maybe you'll in a sense increase
the chance of that because you know what tends to
happen is that your kids tend to either align with
their parents or to rebel against their parents and so
you got to be careful that if you're pushing this
whole consciousness agenda on them too much they might go
in a totally opposite direction which is why sometimes I
joke in my own mind I say that if I
have a kid he or she is gonna either be
the next Buddha or the next heroin addict or a
crack [ __ ] because they're either gonna kind of
agree with my whole agenda or they're gonna react violently
against it and then I'm gonna regret that so that
would be a bad situation which is why I'm a
little uh a little hesitant about having kids obviously you're
gonna have to align everything that I'm telling you here
all this material that you need to teach them with
their age so certain things you can teach them when
they're five years old like meditation you can teach it
very young and other things you want to hold off
a little bit longer also don't take yourself too seriously
here as a parent that's very important cuz your kid
needs to see that you're being real and that you're
not just setting up all these rules and all these
ideals that you yourself can't follow and the fact is
that over the next 20 years as you're raising your
kid you're gonna break a lot of these rules yourself
and you need to to frame this whole thing in
the kids mind it's like it's not about following rules
it's about kind of working with your own weaknesses and
with your own substance EFT of mind to kind of
do the best that you can understanding you're gonna make
a lot of flaws along the way and of course
that's just something you should keep in mind for personal
development and I'd make your own flaws admit when you're
lying admit when you're lazy admit when you failed to
meditate for a day rather than try to hide that
stuff because your kid your kid will will know how
phony you are about all this or whether you're really
embodying it and when they see you being authentic about
it admitting a flaw here and there then that's gonna
that's gonna go a long way because otherwise they'll just
see it as preaching if they see you as just
preaching and moralizing to them this whole thing is gonna
backfire so you got to be very careful rather than
preaching and lecturing to them try to have discussions use
the Socratic method question them a lot rather than giving
them answers ask them to come up with the answers
tend to assume the way that we do with life
coaching is that the client has the answers and that
the coach doesn't need to give the client the answers
the coach is not being paid to supply answers but
really to ask high-quality questions that make the clients think
and that's what you should do with your kids and
the most important thing you can do to teach this
stuff to your kids is to actually embody it yourself
otherwise you're just gonna come off looking like a pretty
hypocrite and then they will they will not listen to
anything you say so in conclusion learning how to raise
kids is hard work and actually raising them is hard
work a lot of the stuff that I talked about
you probably aren't an expert at yourself so how are
you gonna teach it to your kids well you have
your work cut out for you you really need to
start learning all this stuff 10 years before you even
decide to have a kid because it's gonna take you
10 years just to get your hand your hands around
some of this stuff and to learn the basics enough
to the point where you can speak about it and
not be too much of a hypocrite but even then
you're gonna have to face all these issues with balancing
it's a fine delicate balancing act where you need to
balance between letting them have fun and be a kid
but also learning and hard work and work ethic see
and balancing between micromanaging them and guiding them too much
and controlling them versus just letting them roam free and
do whatever the hell they want and finding the balance
between letting them make some mistakes and not criticizing them
for it but then also preventing them from making the
most catastrophic mistakes that will [ __ ] their lives
and then of course you have to balance your own
energy levels you are probably gonna be working you have
a business you're gonna be your own career you're gonna
come home tired after work and yet you have to
deal with your kids and you have to teach them
all this stuff and read to them and provide them
all this material so it's a lot of work and
that's one of the reasons that I don't know if
I'm gonna have kids I don't know if frankly that's
right for me maybe I will I'm still not certain
on it but when you really take a look at
what it takes to create a rockstar kid and not
have him come out neurotic it makes you think twice
about having kids and besides which I already feel like
I have six hundred thousand plus kids that I'm working
on every single week so for me that's been a
very fulfilling part of my life is being able to
share all this wisdom information and I think it would
be very fulfilling to have a kid to share it
with in a sense I'm very excited about that but
also in a sense I feel like my purpose is
to be sharing it with with you my six hundred
thousand kids and then you can share it with your
own kids and then we can raise the consciousness of
the world together all right that's it I know this
was very long but there was a lot of stuff
that needed to be said and I actually sped through
it quite fast all right I'm done please remember to
click the like button and come check out actualized org
look at the blog look at the forum the life
purpose course buy that for your kids learn it for
yourself and then teach it to your kids and the
book list and I'll see you more in the future
